<text>The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders of the Catholic Church. Founded in 1209 by the Italian saint Francis of Assisi, these orders include three independent orders for men (the Order of Friars Minor being the largest contemporary male order), an order for nuns known as the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis open to male and female members. They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary. Several smaller Protestant Franciscan orders have been established since the late 19th century as well, particularly in the Lutheran and Anglican traditions. Certain Franciscan communities are ecumenical in nature, having members who belong to several Christian denominations.

Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a religious order. The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the pope did not allow ownership of property, requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching. The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets, while staying in church properties. Clare, under Francis&#x27;s guidance, founded the Poor Clares (Order of Saint Clare) of the Franciscans.

The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the rule in 1223. The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order, resulting in numerous secessions. The Order of Friars Minor, previously known as the &quot;Observant&quot; branch, is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church, the others being the &quot;Conventuals&quot; (formed 1517) and &quot;Capuchins&quot; (1520). The Order of Friars Minor in its current form is the result of an amalgamation of several smaller orders completed in 1897 by Pope Leo XIII. The Capuchins and Conventuals remain distinct religious institutes within the Catholic Church, observing the Rule of Saint Francis with different emphases. Conventual Franciscans are sometimes referred to as minorites or greyfriars because of their habit. In Poland and Lithuania they are known as [[Bernardines (Franciscans)|Bernardines]], after Bernardino of Siena, although the term elsewhere refers to Cistercians instead. 

==Name and demographics==

The name of the original order, (Friars Minor, literally &#x27;Order of Lesser Brothers&#x27;) stems from Francis of Assisi&#x27;s rejection of luxury and wealth. Francis was the son of a rich cloth merchant but gave up his wealth to pursue his faith more fully. He had cut all ties that remained with his family and pursued a life living in solidarity with his fellow brothers in Christ. In other words, he abandoned his life among the wealthy and aristocratic classes (or &quot;majori&quot;) to live like the poor and peasants (&quot;minori&quot;). Francis adopted the simple tunic worn by peasants as the religious habit for his order and had others who wished to join him do the same. Those who joined him became the original Order of Friars Minor.

===First Order===
The First Order or the Order of Friars Minor, or Seraphic Order are commonly called simply the Franciscans. This order is a mendicant religious order of men, some of whom trace their origin to Francis of Assisi. Their official Latin name is the . Francis thus referred to his followers as &quot;Fraticelli&quot;, meaning &quot;Little Brothers&quot;. Franciscan brothers are informally called friars or the Minorites.

The modern organization of the Friars Minor comprises three separate families or groups, each considered a religious order in its own right under its own minister general and particular type of governance. They all live according to a body of regulations known as the Rule of Saint Francis.
* The Order of Friars Minor, also known as the Observants, are most commonly simply called Franciscan friars, official name: Friars Minor (OFM).
* The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin or simply Capuchins, official name: Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.).
* The Order of Friars Minor Conventual or simply Minorites, official name: Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.).

===Second Order===
The Second Order, most commonly called Poor Clares in English-speaking countries, consists of one branch of religious sisters. The order is called the Order of St. Clare (OSC), but prior to 1263 they were called &quot;The Poor Ladies&quot;, &quot;The Poor Enclosed Nuns&quot;, and &quot;The Order of San Damiano&quot;.

===Third Order===
The Franciscan third order, known as the Third Order of Saint Francis, has many men and women members, separated into two main branches:
* The Secular Franciscan Order, OFS, originally known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance or Third Order of Penance, try to live the ideals of the movement in their daily lives outside of religious institutes.
* Members of the Third Order Regular (TOR) live in religious communities under the traditional religious vows. They grew out of the Secular Franciscan Order.

=== Membership ===
The 2013 gave the following figures for the membership of the principal male Franciscan orders:.
* OFM: 1,915 communities; 12,476 members (including 8,512 priests)
* OFM Conv.: 572 communities; 3,981 members (including 2,777 priests)
* OFM Cap.: 1,542 communities; 10,355 members (including 6,796 priests)
* TOR: 147 communities; 813 members (including 581 priests)

The coat of arms that is a universal symbol of Franciscan &quot;contains the Tau cross, with two crossed arms: Christ&#x27;s right hand with the nail wound and Francis&#x27; left hand with the stigmata wound.&quot;

==History==
===Beginnings===

A sermon Francis heard in 1209 on Matthew 10:9 made such an impression on him that he decided to devote himself wholly to a life of apostolic poverty. Clad in a rough garment, barefoot, and, after the evangelical precept, without staff or scrip, he began to preach repentance.

He was soon joined by a prominent fellow townsman, Bernard of Quintavalle, who contributed all that he had to the work, and by other companions who are said to number 11 within a year. The brothers lived in the deserted leper colony of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time traveling through the mountainous districts of Umbria, always cheerful and full of songs, yet making a deep impression on their hearers by their earnest exhortations. Their life was extremely ascetic, though such practices were apparently not prescribed by the first rule which Francis gave them (probably as early as 1209) which seems to have been nothing more than a collection of Scriptural passages emphasizing the duty of poverty.

In spite of some similarities between this principle and some of the fundamental ideas of the followers of Peter Waldo, the brotherhood of Assisi succeeded in gaining the approval of Pope Innocent III. What seems to have impressed first the Bishop of Assisi, then Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo and finally Innocent, was their utter loyalty to the Catholic Church and the clergy. Innocent responsible for helping to construct the church Francis was being called to rebuild. Innocent and the Fourth Lateran Council helped maintain the church in Europe. Innocent probably saw in them a possible answer to his desire for an orthodox preaching force to counter heresy. Many legends have clustered around the decisive audience of Francis with the pope. The realistic account in Matthew Paris—according to which the pope originally sent the shabby saint off to keep swine and only recognized his real worth by his ready obedience—has, in spite of its improbability, a certain historical interest since it shows the natural antipathy of the older Benedictine monasticism to the plebeian mendicant orders. The group was tonsured, and Francis was ordained as a deacon, allowing him to proclaim Gospel passages and preach in churches during Mass.

===Francis&#x27;s last years===
After an intense apostolic activity in Italy, in 1219 Francis went to Egypt with the Fifth Crusade to announce the Gospel to the Saracens. He met with the Sultan Malik al-Kamil, initiating a spirit of dialogue and understanding between Christianity and Islam. The Franciscan presence in the Holy Land started in 1217, when the province of Syria was established, with Brother Elias as minister. By 1229 the friars had a small house near the fifth station of the Via Dolorosa. In 1272 Sultan Baibars allowed the Franciscans to settle in the Cenacle on Mount Zion. Later on, in 1309, they also settled in the Holy Sepulchre and in Bethlehem. In 1335 the king of Naples Robert of Anjou () and his wife Sancha of Majorca () bought the Cenacle and gave it to the Franciscans. Pope Clement VI by the Bulls &quot;Gratias agimus&quot; and &quot;Nuper charissimae&quot; (1342) declared the Franciscans as the official custodians of the Holy Places in the name of the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land is still in force today.

The controversy about how to follow the Gospel life of poverty, which extends through the first three centuries of Franciscan history, began in the lifetime of the founder. The ascetic brothers Matthew of Narni and Gregory of Naples, a nephew of Cardinal Ugolino, were the two vicars-general to whom Francis had entrusted the direction of the order during his time in Egypt. They carried through at a chapter which they held certain stricter regulations in regard to fasting and the reception of alms, which departed from the spirit of the original rule. It did not take Francis long, on his return, to suppress this insubordinate tendency, but he was less successful in regard to another of an opposite nature which soon came up. Elias of Cortona originated a movement for the increase of the worldly consideration of the order and the adaptation of its system to the plans of the hierarchy which conflicted with the original notions of the founder and helped to bring about the successive changes in the rule already described. Francis was not alone in opposition to this lax and secularizing tendency. On the contrary, the party which clung to his original views and after his death took his &quot;testament&quot; for their guide, known as Observantists or , was at least equal in numbers and activity to the followers of Elias.

Exasperated by the demands of running a growing and fractious order, Francis asked Pope Honorius III for help in 1219. He was assigned Cardinal Ugolino as protector of the order by the pope. Francis resigned the day-to-day running of the order into the hands of others but retained the power to shape legislation, writing a rule in 1221 which he revised and had approved in 1223. After about 1221, the day-to-day running of the order was in the hands of Brother Elias of Cortona, who was elected as leader of the friars a few years after Francis&#x27;s death in 1232 but who aroused much opposition because of his autocratic leadership style. He planned and built the Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi in which Francis is buried, a building which includes the friary Sacro Convento, still today the spiritual centre of the order. 

In the external successes of the brothers, as they were reported at the yearly general chapters, there was much to encourage Francis. Caesar of Speyer, the first German provincial, a zealous advocate of the founder&#x27;s strict principle of poverty, began in 1221 from Augsburg with 25 companions, to win for the order the land watered by the Rhine and the Danube. In 1224 Agnellus of Pisa led a small group of friars to England. The branch arriving in England became known as the &quot;greyfriars&quot;. Beginning at Greyfriars at Canterbury, the ecclesiastical capital, they moved on to London, the political capital, and Oxford, the intellectual capital. From these three bases the Franciscans swiftly expanded to embrace the principal towns of England.

===Development after Francis&#x27;s death===
====1232–1239====
Elias was a lay friar, and encouraged other laymen to enter the order. This brought opposition from many ordained friars and ministers provincial, who also opposed increased centralization of the Order. Gregory IX declared his intention to build a splendid church to house the body of Francis and the task fell to Elias, who at once began to lay plans for the erection of a great basilica at Assisi, to enshrine the remains of the &quot;Poverello&quot;. In order to build the basilica, Elias proceeded to collect money in various ways to meet the expenses of the building. Elias thus also alienated the zealots in the order, who felt this was not in keeping with the founder&#x27;s views upon the question of poverty.

The earliest leader of the strict party was Brother Leo, a close companion of Francis during his last years and the author of the , a strong polemic against the laxer party. Having protested against the collection of money for the erection of the basilica of San Francesco, it was Leo who broke in pieces the marble box which Elias had set up for offertories for the completion of the basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this outrage on St Francis&#x27;s dearest disciple consolidated the opposition to Elias. Leo was the leader in the early stages of the struggle in the order for the maintenance of St Francis&#x27;s ideas on strict poverty. At the chapter held in May 1227, Elias was rejected in spite of his prominence, and Giovanni Parenti, Minister Provincial of Spain, was elected Minister General of the order.

In 1232 Elias succeeded him, and under him the Order significantly developed its ministries and presence in the towns. Many new houses were founded, especially in Italy, and in many of them special attention was paid to education. The somewhat earlier settlements of Franciscan teachers at the universities (in Paris, for example, where Alexander of Hales was teaching) continued to develop. Contributions toward the promotion of the Order&#x27;s work, and especially the building of the Basilica in Assisi, came in abundantly. Funds could only be accepted on behalf of the friars for determined, imminent, real necessities that could not be provided for from begging. When in 1230, the General Chapter could not agree on a common interpretation of the 1223 Rule it sent a delegation including Anthony of Padua to Pope Gregory IX for an authentic interpretation of this piece of papal legislation. The bull of Gregory IX declared that the Testament of St. Francis was not legally binding and offered an interpretation of poverty that would allow the Order to continue to develop. Gregory IX authorized agents of the Order to have custody of such funds where they could not be spent immediately. Elias pursued with great severity the principal leaders of the opposition, and even Bernardo di Quintavalle, the founder&#x27;s first disciple, was obliged to conceal himself for years in the forest of Monte Sefro.

The conflict between the two parties lasted many years and the won several notable victories in spite of the favor shown to their opponents by the papal administration, until finally the reconciliation of the two points of view was seen to be impossible and the order was actually split into halves.

====1239–1274====

Elias governed the Order from the center, imposing his authority on the provinces (as had Francis). A reaction to this centralized government was led from the provinces of England and Germany. At the general chapter of 1239, held in Rome under the personal presidency of Gregory IX, Elias was deposed in favor of Albert of Pisa, the former provincial of England, a moderate Observantist. This chapter introduced General Statutes to govern the Order and devolved power from the Minister General to the Ministers Provincial sitting in chapter. The next two Ministers General, Haymo of Faversham (1240–44) and Crescentius of Jesi (1244–47), consolidated this greater democracy in the Order but also led the Order towards a greater clericalization. The new Pope Innocent IV supported them in this. In a bull of November 14, 1245, this pope even sanctioned an extension of the system of financial agents, and allowed the funds to be used not simply for those things that were necessary for the friars but also for those that were useful.

The Observantist party took a strong stand in opposition to this ruling and agitated so successfully against the lax General that in 1247, at a chapter held in Lyon, France—where Innocent IV was then residing—he was replaced by the strict Observantist John of Parma (1247–57) and the Order refused to implement any provisions of Innocent IV that were laxer than those of Gregory IX.
Elias, who had been excommunicated and taken under the protection of Frederick II, was now forced to give up all hope of recovering his power in the Order. He died in 1253, after succeeding by recantation in obtaining the removal of his censures. Under John of Parma, who enjoyed the favor of Innocent IV and Pope Alexander IV, the influence of the Order was notably increased, especially by the provisions of the latter pope in regard to the academic activity of the brothers. He not only sanctioned the theological institutes in Franciscan houses, but did all he could to support the friars in the Mendicant Controversy, when the secular Masters of the University of Paris and the Bishops of France combined to attack the mendicant orders. It was due to the action of Alexander IV&#x27;s envoys, who were obliged to threaten the university authorities with excommunication, that the degree of doctor of theology was finally conceded to the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure (1257), who had previously been able to lecture only as licentiates.

The Franciscan Gerard of Borgo San Donnino at this time issued a Joachimite tract and John of Parma was seen as favoring the condemned theology of Joachim of Fiore. To protect the Order from its enemies, John was forced to step down and recommended Bonaventure as his successor. Bonaventure saw the need to unify the Order around a common ideology and both wrote a new life of the founder and collected the Order&#x27;s legislation into the Constitutions of Narbonne, so called because they were ratified by the Order at its chapter held at Narbonne, France, in 1260. In the chapter of Pisa three years later Bonaventure&#x27;s was approved as the only biography of Francis and all previous biographies were ordered to be destroyed. Bonaventure ruled (1257–74) in a moderate spirit, which is represented also by various works produced by the order in his timeespecially by the written by David of Augsburg soon after 1260.

===14th century===
====1274–1300====
The successor to Bonaventure, Jerome of Ascoli or Girolamo Masci (1274–79), (the future Pope Nicholas IV), and his successor, Bonagratia of Bologna (1279–85), also followed a middle course. Severe measures were taken against certain extreme Spirituals who, on the strength of the rumor that Pope Gregory X was intending at the Council of Lyon (1274–75) to force the mendicant orders to tolerate the possession of property, threatened both pope and council with the renunciation of allegiance. Attempts were made, however, to satisfy the reasonable demands of the Spiritual party, as in the bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; of Pope Nicholas III (1279), which pronounced the principle of complete poverty to be meritorious and holy, but interpreted it in the way of a somewhat sophistical distinction between possession and usufruct. The bull was received respectfully by Bonagratia and the next two generals, Arlotto of Prato (1285–87) and Matthew of Aqua Sparta (1287–89); but the Spiritual party under the leadership of the Bonaventuran pupil and apocalyptic Pierre Jean Olivi regarded its provisions for the dependence of the friars upon the pope and the division between brothers occupied in manual labor and those employed on spiritual missions as a corruption of the fundamental principles of the Order. They were not won over by the conciliatory attitude of the next general, Raymond Gaufredi (1289–96), and of the Franciscan Pope Nicholas IV (1288–92). The attempt made by the next pope, Celestine V, an old friend of the order, to end the strife by uniting the Observantist party with his own order of hermits (see Celestines) was scarcely more successful. Only a part of the Spirituals joined the new order, and the secession scarcely lasted beyond the reign of the hermit-pope. Pope Boniface VIII annulled Celestine&#x27;s bull of foundation with his other acts, deposed the general Raymond Gaufredi, and appointed a man of laxer tendency, John de Murro, in his place. The Benedictine section of the Celestines was separated from the Franciscan section, and the latter was formally suppressed by Pope Boniface VIII in 1302. The leader of the Observantists, Olivi, who spent his last years in the Franciscan house at Tarnius and died there in 1298, had pronounced against the extremer &quot;Spiritual&quot; attitude, and given an exposition of the theory of poverty which was approved by the more moderate Observantists, and for a long time constituted their principle.

====Persecution====
Under Pope Clement V (1305–14) this party succeeded in exercising some influence on papal decisions. In 1309 Clement had a commission sit at Avignon for the purpose of reconciling the conflicting parties. Ubertino of Casale, the leader, after Olivi&#x27;s death, of the stricter party, who was a member of the commission, induced the Council of Vienne to arrive at a decision in the main favoring his views, and the papal constitution (1313) was on the whole conceived in the same sense. Clement&#x27;s successor, Pope John XXII (1316–34), favored the laxer or conventual party. By the bull he modified several provisions of the constitution , and required the formal submission of the Spirituals. Some of them, encouraged by the strongly Observantist general Michael of Cesena, ventured to dispute the pope&#x27;s right so to deal with the provisions of his predecessor. Sixty-four of them were summoned to Avignon and the most obstinate delivered over to the Inquisition, four of them being burned (1318). Shortly before this all the separate houses of the Observantists had been suppressed.

====Renewed controversy on the question of poverty====

A few years later a new controversy, this time theoretical, broke out on the question of poverty. In his 14 August 1279 bull , Pope Nicholas III had confirmed the arrangement already established by Pope Innocent IV, by which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. The bull declared that renunciation of ownership of all things &quot;both individually but also in common, for God&#x27;s sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly.&quot;

Although &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; banned disputing about its contents, the decades that followed saw increasingly bitter disputes about the form of poverty to be observed by Franciscans, with the Spirituals (so called because associated with the Age of the Spirit that Joachim of Fiore had said would begin in 1260) pitched against the Conventual Franciscans. Pope Clement V&#x27;s bull of 20 November 1312 failed to effect a compromise between the two factions. Clement V&#x27;s successor, Pope John XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either separately or jointly, and who were citing in support of their view. In 1317, John XXII formally condemned the group of them known as the Fraticelli. On 26 March 1322, with , he removed the ban on discussion of Nicholas III&#x27;s bull and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would condemn the church&#x27;s right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in May 1322 declared on the contrary: &quot;To say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles, in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right of ownership and or by personal right, we corporately and unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic.&quot; By the bull of 8 December 1322, John XXII, declaring it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in the future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership. And, on 12 November 1323, he issued the short bull which declared &quot;erroneous and heretical&quot; the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever. John XXII&#x27;s actions thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars.

Influential members of the order protested, such as the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In 1324, Louis the Bavarian sided with the Spirituals and accused the pope of heresy. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III&#x27;s bull was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull on 10 November 1324 in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: &quot;Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living &#x27;without property&#x27; does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.&quot; In 1328, Michael of Cesena was summoned to Avignon to explain the Order&#x27;s intransigence in refusing the pope&#x27;s orders and its complicity with Louis of Bavaria. Michael was imprisoned in Avignon, together with Francesco d&#x27;Ascoli, Bonagratia, and William of Ockham. In January of that year Louis of Bavaria entered Rome and had himself crowned emperor. Three months later he declared John XXII deposed and installed the Spiritual Franciscan Pietro Rainalducci as antipope. The Franciscan chapter that opened in Bologna on 28 May reelected Michael of Cesena, who two days before had escaped with his companions from Avignon. But in August Louis the Bavarian and his pope had to flee Rome before an attack by Robert, King of Naples. Only a small part of the Franciscan Order joined the opponents of John XXII, and at a general chapter held in Paris in 1329 the majority of all the houses declared their submission to the Pope. With the bull of 16 November 1329, John XXII replied to Michael of Cesena&#x27;s attacks on , , and . In 1330, Antipope Nicholas V submitted, followed later by the ex-general Michael, and finally, just before his death, by Ockham.

===Separate congregations===
Out of all these dissensions in the 14th century sprang a number of separate congregations, or almost sects, to say nothing of the heretical parties of the Beghards and Fraticelli, some of which developed within the Order on both hermit and cenobitic principles and may here be mentioned:

====Clareni====
The Clareni or Clarenini was an association of hermits established on the river Clareno in the march of Ancona by Angelo da Clareno (1337). Like several other smaller congregations, it was obliged in 1568 under Pope Pius V to unite with the general body of Observantists.

====Minorites of Narbonne====
As a separate congregation, this originated through the union of a number of houses which followed Olivi after 1308. It was limited to southwestern France and, its members being accused of the heresy of the Beghards, was suppressed by the Inquisition during the controversies under John XXII.

====Reform of Johannes de Vallibus====
This was founded in the hermitage of St. Bartholomew at Brugliano near Foligno in 1334. The congregation was suppressed by the Franciscan general chapter in 1354; reestablished in 1368 by Paolo de&#x27; Trinci of Foligno; confirmed by Gregory XI in 1373, and spread rapidly from Central Italy to France, Spain, Hungary, and elsewhere. Most of the Observantist houses joined this congregation by degrees, so that it became known simply as the &quot;brothers of the regular Observance.&quot; It acquired the favor of the popes by its energetic opposition to the heretical Fraticelli, and was expressly recognized by the Council of Constance (1415). It was allowed to have a special vicar-general of its own and legislate for its members without reference to the conventual part of the Order. Through the work of such men as Bernardino of Siena, Giovanni da Capistrano, and Dietrich Coelde (b. 1435? at Munster; was a member of the Brethren of the Common Life, died December 11, 1515), it gained great prominence during the 15th century. By the end of the Middle Ages, the Observantists, with 1,400 houses, comprised nearly half of the entire Order. Their influence brought about attempts at reform even among the Conventuals, including the quasi-Observantist brothers living under the rule of the Conventual ministers (Martinianists or &quot;Observantes sub ministris&quot;), such as the male Colletans, later led by Boniface de Ceva in his reform attempts principally in France and Germany; the reformed congregation founded in 1426 by the Spaniard Philip de Berbegal and distinguished by the special importance they attached to the little hood (); the Neutri, a group of reformers originating about 1463 in Italy, who tried to take a middle ground between the Conventuals and Observantists, but refused to obey the heads of either, until they were compelled by the pope to affiliate with the regular Observantists, or with those of the Common Life; the Caperolani, a congregation founded about 1470 in North Italy by Peter Caperolo, but dissolved again on the death of its founder in 1481; the Amadeists, founded by the noble Portuguese Amadeo, who entered the Franciscan order at Assisi in 1452, gathered around him a number of adherents to his fairly strict principles (numbering finally twenty-six houses), and died in the odor of sanctity in 1482.

====Unification====
Projects for a union between the two main branches of the Order were put forth not only by the Council of Constance but by several popes, without any positive result. By direction of Pope Martin V, John of Capistrano drew up statutes which were to serve as a basis for reunion, and they were actually accepted by a general chapter at Assisi in 1430; but the majority of the Conventual houses refused to agree to them, and they remained without effect. At John of Capistrano&#x27;s request Eugene IV issued a bull (, 1446) aimed at the same result, but again nothing was accomplished. Equally unsuccessful were the attempts of the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, who bestowed a vast number of privileges on both of the original mendicant orders, but by this very fact lost the favor of the Observants and failed in his plans for reunion. Julius II succeeded in reducing some of the smaller branches, but left the division of the two great parties untouched. This division was finally legalized by Leo X, after a general chapter held in Rome in 1517, in connection with the reform-movement of the Fifth Lateran Council, had once more declared the impossibility of reunion. The less strict principles of the Conventuals, permitting the possession of real estate and the enjoyment of fixed revenues, were recognized as tolerable, while the Observants, in contrast to this , were held strictly to their own or &quot;pauper&quot;.

All of the groups that followed the Franciscan Rule literally were united to the Observants, and the right to elect the Minister General of the Order, together with the seal of the Order, was given to this united grouping. This grouping, since it adhered more closely to the rule of the founder, was allowed to claim a certain superiority over the Conventuals. The Observant general (elected now for six years, not for life) inherited the title of &quot;Minister-General of the Whole Order of St. Francis&quot; and was granted the right to confirm the choice of a head for the Conventuals, who was known as &quot;Master-General of the Friars Minor Conventual&quot;—although this privilege never became practically operative.

===Franciscans and the Inquisition===
In about 1236 during the time of Elias of Cortona, Pope Gregory IX appointed the Franciscans, along with the Dominicans, as Inquisitors. The Franciscans had been involved in anti-heretical activities from the beginning simply by preaching and acting as living examples of the Gospel life. As official Inquisitors, they were authorized to use torture to extract confessions, as approved by Pope Innocent IV in 1252 while John of Parma was General Minister. The Franciscans were involved in the torture and trials of Jews, Muslims, and other heretics throughout the Middle Ages and wrote their own manuals to guide Inquisitors, such as the 14th century &quot;Codex Casanatensis&quot; for use by Inquisitors in Tuscany. 

As well as acting as prosecutors, many friars, particularly those associated with the Spiritual Franciscans and even some Observants, were also subject to interrogation and prosecution by the Inquisition at various stages in the 13th and 14th centuries. Notable cases from the Spirituals include Angelo da Clareno and Bernard Délicieux. Notable examples of Observants include the four burned during the suppression of the Observant houses in 1318 mentioned above. 

 The Inquisition spread to the new world during the Age of Discovery to root out heretics, leading further persecution and execution (e.g., Mexican Inquisition). 

===New World missions===
The work of the Franciscans in New Spain began in 1523, when three Flemish friars—Juan de Ayora, Pedro de Tecto, and Pedro de Gante—reached the central highlands. Their impact as missionaries was limited at first, since two of them died on Cortés&#x27;s expedition to Central America in 1524, but Fray Pedro de Gante initiated the evangelization process and studied the Nahuatl language through his contacts with children of the Indian elite from the city of Tetzcoco. Later, in May 1524, with the arrival of the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, led by Martín de Valencia. There they built the Convento Grande de San Francisco, which became Franciscan headquarters for New Spain for the next three hundred years.

==Contemporary organizations==
===First Order===
====Order of Friars Minor====

The Order of Friars Minor (OFM) has 1,500 houses in about 100 provinces and , with about 16,000 members. In 1897, Pope Leo XIII combined the Observants, Discalced (Alcantarines), Recollects, and Riformati into one order under general constitutions. While the Capuchins and Conventuals wanted the reunited Observants to be referred to as The Order of Friars Minor of the Leonine Union, they were instead called simply the Order of Friars Minor. Despite the tensions caused by this forced union the Order grew from 1897 to reach a peak of 26,000 members in the 1960s before declining after the 1970s. The Order is headed by a Minister General, who since July 2021 is Father Massimo Fusarelli. 

====Order of Friars Minor Conventual====
The Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) consists of 290 houses worldwide with a total of almost 5000 friars. They have experienced growth in this century throughout the world. They are located in Italy, the United States, Canada, Australia, and throughout Latin America, and Africa. They are the largest in number in Poland because of the work and inspiration of Maximilian Kolbe.

====Order of Friars Minor Capuchin====

The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.) are the youngest branch of Franciscans, founded in 1525 by Matteo Serafini (Matteo Bassi, Matteo da Bascio), an Observant friar, who felt himself called to an even stricter observance of Franciscan austerity. With the support of the Papal Court, the new branch received early recognition and grew fast, first in Italy and after 1574 all over Europe and throughout the world. The Capuchins eventually became a separate order in 1619. The name Capuchins refers to the particular shape of the long hood or ; originally a popular nickname, it has become a part of the official name of the order. The order now exists in 106 countries all over the world, with around 10,500 brothers living in more than 1700 communities known as fraternities or friaries.

===Second Order===
====Poor Clares====

The Poor Clares, officially the Order of Saint Clare, are members of a contemplative order of nuns in the Catholic Church. The Poor Clares were the second Franciscan order to be established. Founded by Clare of Assisi and Francis of Assisi on Palm Sunday in the year 1212, they were organized after the Order of Friars Minor (the first order), and before the Third Order of Saint Francis. As of 2011 there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.

The Poor Clares follow the &quot;Rule of St. Clare&quot; which was approved by Pope Innocent IV the day before Clare&#x27;s death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (OSC) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique constitutions, are the Colettine Poor Clares (PCC – founded 1410), the Capuchin Poor Clares (OSC Cap. – founded 1538), and the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration (PCPA – founded 1854).

===Third Order===
The Third Order of Saint Francis comprises people who desired to grow in holiness in their daily lives without entering monastic life. After founding the Friars Minor and seeing a need, Francis created a way of life to which married men and women, as well as the single and the secular clergy, could belong and live according to the Gospel. 

====Secular Franciscan Order====
The Secular Franciscan Order, prior to 1978 also known as the Third Order Secular of Saint Francis, is an order founded by Francis in 1212 for brothers and sisters who do not live in a religious community. Members of the order continue to live secular lives, however they do gather regularly for fraternal activities. In the United States alone there are 17,000 professed members of the order. Members of the Order live according to a Rule composed by St Francis in 1221. The Rule was slightly modified through the centuries and was replaced at the turn of the 20th century by Pope Leo XIII, himself a member of the Order. A new and current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI in 1978, and the Third Order was renamed the Secular Franciscan Order. It is an international organization with its own Minister General based in Rome.

====Third Order Regular====
Within a century of the death of Francis, members of the Third Order began to live in common, in an attempt to follow a more ascetical way of life. Angela of Foligno (+1309) was foremost among those who achieved great depths in their lives of prayer and service of the poor, while living in community with other women of the Order.

Among the men, the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance was formed in 1447 by a papal decree that united several communities of hermits following the Third Order Rule into a single Order with its own Minister General. Today it is an international community of friars who desire to emphasize the works of mercy and on-going conversion. The community is also known as the Franciscan Friars, TOR, and they strive to &quot;rebuild the Church&quot; in areas of high school and college education, parish ministry, church renewal, social justice, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, foreign missions, and other ministries in places where the church is needed. The association of Franciscans (Grey Friars) with education becomes a stock fictional reference in (for example) the works of Thackeray (&quot;Grey Friars School&quot; in &quot;Pendennis&quot; and &quot;The Newcomes&quot;) or of &quot;Frank Richards&quot; (Greyfriars School of Billy Bunter fame).

After the formal recognition of the members of religious tertiary communities, the following centuries saw a steady growth of such communities across Europe. Initially, the women&#x27;s communities took a monastic form of life, either voluntarily or under pressure from ecclesiastical superiors. The great figure of this development was Hyacintha Mariscotti. As Europe entered the upheavals of the modern age, new communities arose which were able to focus more exclusively on social service, especially during the immediate post-Napoleonic period which devastated much of Western Europe. An example of this is Mary Frances Schervier (1819–1876).

=====Third Order Regular in North America=====
This movement continued in North America as various congregations arose from one coast to another, in answer to the needs of the large emigrant communities that were flooding the cities of the United States and Canada.

The Third Order Regular of the Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis of Assisi, CFP, are an active community, based in the United States, with houses in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and Brazil. These Franciscans strive to live an integrated life through prayer, community, and ministry to the poor, neglected and disadvantaged youth, the powerless, people in need, and the elderly. The Brothers of the Poor live by their vows of poverty (living a simple lifestyle), consecrated chastity (loving all, possessing no one, striving sincerely, for singleness of heart, a celibate way of loving and being loved), and obedience (to God, to the community, to the church, and to self). The Brothers of the Poor also serve persons with AIDS and people who ask for help, regardless of their religion or their social/economic background. They are teachers, childcare workers, social workers, counselors, pastoral ministers, retreat ministers, religious educators, and school administrators, along with other tasks.

The Regular Tertiaries, officially the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance, who operate the Franciscan University of Steubenville, follow a rule approved by Pope Leo X. Today this group is present in 17 countries: Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, US, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.

==== Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis ====

The Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis, is a private confraternity of the Catholic Church whose members strive to model their lives according to the Rule and Statutes of the Primitive Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis, which was written for lay people in 1221 by Francis of Assisi. Right now there are several hundred members within the United States and a few hundred more throughout the world. The order was originally started in 1996 by members of the Archdiocese of St. Paul in Minnesota.

====Other tertiaries====
* In 1435, Francis of Paola founded the &quot;Poor Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot;, later known as the &quot;Hermits of the Order of Minims&quot;, and then renamed the &quot;Order of Minims&quot; in 1506 by Pope Julius II. There are mendicant friars, contemplative nuns, and lay tertiaries.
* The Society of the Atonement, also known as Graymoor Friars and Graymoor Sisters, started in 1898 as a religious community in the Episcopal Church, and came into union with the Holy See in 1909.
* The Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate started in 1970, and became an institute with Pontifical Right in 1998. In that same year, the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate also became an institute with Pontifical Right. There are also Third Order Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, an offshoot of the Franciscan Tertiaries of the Immaculate.

===Other Franciscan organizations===

* The Community of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal started in 1987, and the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal in 1988.
* The Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word started in 1987, and are now a Public Clerical Association of the Faithful.
* Franciscans International is a Non-governmental organization (NGO) with General Consultative status at the United Nations, uniting the voices of Franciscan brothers and sisters from around the world. It operates under the sponsorship of the Conference of the Franciscan Family (CFF) and serves all Franciscans and the global community by bringing grassroots Franciscans to the United Nations forums in New York City and Geneva. It brings the spiritual and ethical values of the Franciscans to the United Nations and international organisations.

===Other Christian traditions===

There are Franciscan orders in Lutheran Churches, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, and the Evangelische Kanaan Franziskus-Bruderschaft (Kanaan Franciscan Brothers). Established in 2006, the Order of St. Francis-Lutheran (OSF-L) operates under the auspices of the Lutheran Church-International; the OSF-L is based in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. In the United States, the Evangelical Society of the Cross Franciscan (the Lutheran Third Order of St. Francis) was founded in 1988 in Orlando, Florida. It was blessed by Bishop Lavern Franzen of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

One of the results of the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Communion during the 19th century was the re-establishment of religious orders in the Church of England, including some of Franciscan inspiration. The principal Anglican communities in the Franciscan tradition are the Community of St. Francis (women, founded 1905) (CSF), the Poor Clares of Reparation (PCR), the Society of Saint Francis (men, founded 1934)(SSF), the Community of St. Clare (women, enclosed) (OSC), and the Order of St. Francis (men, founded in 2003). There is also a Third Order known as the Third Order Society of St Francis (TSSF), and the Lesser Franciscans. There is also an order of Sisters of St. Clare in the Puget Sound area of Washington state (Diocese of Olympia), the Little Sisters of St. Clare.

There are further some small Franciscan communities within Continental Reformed Churches and the Old Catholic Church. 

In addition, there are associations of Franciscan inspiration that describe themselves as ecumenical—accepting Christians of all denominations, the Order of Ecumenical Franciscans being an example. The Companions of Francis Apostolic Religious Institute (CFARI), with its roots in independent Catholicism, is a dispersed, egalitarian and ecumenical order of Franciscans based in Pasadena, California, with vowed members in California, Arizona and New Mexico. CFARI members live among the populations they serve and are self supporting in their ministry.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
===Spirituality===
Franciscan theology conforms to broader doctrine with the Catholic Church, but involves several unique emphases. Franciscan theologians view creation, the natural world, as good and joyous, and avoid dwelling on the &quot;stain of original sin.&quot; Francis expressed great affection towards animals and inanimate natural objects as fellow inhabitants of God&#x27;s creation, in his work &quot;Canticle of the Creatures&quot; (, also known as the &quot;Canticle of the Sun&quot;). Special emphasis is put on the Incarnation of Christ viewed as a special act of humility, as Francis was struck by God&#x27;s great charity in sacrificing his son for our salvation; they also exhibit great devotion to the Eucharist. The Rule of Saint Francis calls for members to practice simple living and detachment from material possessions in emulation of Jesus&#x27; life and earthly ministry. The simple lifestyle helps members of the order, in whichever branch, to experience solidarity with the poor and to work for social justice. Franciscan spirituality also strongly emphasizes working to preserve the church, and remain loyal to it.

===Visions and stigmata===
Among Catholic religious, Franciscans have proportionally reported higher ratios of stigmata and have claimed proportionally higher ratios of visions of Jesus and Mary. Francis of Assisi himself was one of the first reported cases of stigmata, and perhaps the most famous stigmatic of modern times is Padre Pio, a Capuchin, who also reported visions of Jesus and Mary. Pio&#x27;s stigmata persisted for over fifty years and he was examined by numerous physicians in the 20th century, who confirmed the existence of the wounds, but none of whom could produce a medical explanation for the fact that his bleeding wounds would never get infected. According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, his wounds healed once, but reappeared. According to the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; some medical authorities who examined Padre Pio&#x27;s wounds were inclined to believe that the stigmata were connected with nervous or cataleptic hysteria. According to Answers.com the wounds were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year; Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner who examined them in 1920 and 1925; Giuseppe Bastianelli, a physician to Pope Benedict XV, who agreed that the wounds existed but made no other comment; and pathologist Amico Bignami who also observed the wounds but made no diagnosis.

===Contributions to biblical scholarship===
The Franciscans established the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum as an academic society based in Jerusalem and Hong Kong for the study of scripture. The Hong Kong branch founded by Gabriele Allegra produced the first complete translation of the Catholic Bible in Chinese in 1968 after a 40-year effort. The Studium Biblicum Translation is often considered the authoritative Chinese Bible among Catholics.

The early efforts of another Franciscan, namely Giovanni di Monte Corvino who had attempted a first translation of the Bible in Beijing in the 14th century, provided the initial spark for Gabriele Allegra&#x27;s 40 year undertaking, when at the age of 21 he happened to attend the 6th centenary celebration for Monte Corvino.

===Notable members===
The Franciscan order boasts a number of distinguished members. From its first century can be cited the three great scholastics Alexander of Hales, Bonaventure, and John Duns Scotus, the &quot;Doctor of Wonders&quot; Roger Bacon, and the well-known mystic authors and popular preachers David of Augsburg and Berthold of Regensburg.

During the Middle Ages noteworthy members included Nicholas of Lyra, Biblical commentator Bernardino of Siena, philosopher William of Ockham, preachers John of Capistrano, Oliver Maillard, and Michel Menot, and historians Luke Wadding and Antoine Pagi.

In the field of Christian art during the later Middle Ages, the Franciscan movement exercised considerable influence, especially in Italy. The influence of Franciscan ideals shows in several great painters of the 13th and 14th centuries, especially Cimabue and Giotto, who, though they were not friars, were spiritual sons of Francis in the wider sense; it is also seen in the plastic masterpieces of the latter, as well as the architectural conceptions of both himself and his school. The Italian Gothic style, whose earliest important monument is the great convent church at Assisi (built 1228–53), was cultivated as a rule principally by members of the order or men under their influence.

The early spiritual poetry of Italy was partially inspired by Francis himself, who was followed by Thomas of Celano, Bonaventure, and Jacopone da Todi. Through a tradition which held him to have been a member of the Franciscan Third Order, even Dante may be included within this artistic tradition (cf. especially &quot;Paradiso&quot;, xi. 50).

Other famous members of the Franciscan family include Anthony of Padua, François Rabelais, Alexander of Hales, Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, Pio of Pietrelcina, Maximilian Kolbe, Pasquale Sarullo, Mamerto Esquiú, Gabriele Allegra, Junipero Serra, Simpliciano of the Nativity, Mychal F. Judge, Angelico Chavez, Anton Docher, Joseph of Cupertino, Benedict Groeschel and Leonard of Port Maurice.

During the &quot;spiritual conquest&quot; of New Spain, 1523–1572, the arrival of the first group of Franciscans, the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, included Martín de Valencia, but more prominently for his corpus of writings on the earliest years was Toribio de Benavente Motolinia. Other important Franciscans are Alonso de Molina, Andrés de Olmos, and Bernardino de Sahagún, who all created texts in indigenous language of Nahuatl to aid friars in the evangelization of Mexico. Geronimo de Mendieta, Augustin de Vetancourt, and Juan de Torquemada are important contributors to the history of the Franciscans in central Mexico.

A modern notable member is Casey Cole, an American Franciscan friar, Catholic priest, writer, and blogger. Cole runs his own online blog and YouTube channel called &quot;Breaking in the Habit&quot; and is the author of the books &quot;Let Go: Seven Stumbling Blocks to Christian Discipleship&quot; and &quot;Called: What Happens After Saying Yes to God&quot;.

<text>Norwegian Computing Center (NR, in Norwegian: &quot;Norsk Regnesentral&quot;) is a private, independent, non-profit research foundation. NR carries out contract research and development in the areas of computing and quantitative methods for a broad range of industrial, commercial and public service organizations in Norway and internationally. NR is one of Europe&#x27;s largest research environments in applied statistics and its projects cover a large variety of applied and academic problems. NR&#x27;s offices are located near the university campus Blindern in Oslo, and adjacent to Oslo Science Park (Forskningsparken). 

==History ==
NR was established in 1952. Until 1970 an important part of the activity was to perform mathematical computations for other organizations. NR has worked with data communication since 1963. The Simula programming language was designed and built by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard and their research group at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo between 1962 and 1967.

After 1970 NR has been a methodological research institute. In 1985, NR became an independent institute and moved to its present location in 1988. It has worked with the Internet since 1973, ICT security since 1988, multimedia since 1994, e-Inclusion since 2005. It started working with remote sensing in 1982, geostatistics and petroleum in 1983, marine resources in 1988 and electricity prices and finance in 1994.

NR employees Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard received the Turing Award in 2001 and the 2002 IEEE John von Neumann Medal for the introduction of the concepts underlying object-oriented programming through the design and implementation of Simula 67.

A book about the history of NR, &quot;Norsk Regnesentrals historie 1952 - 2002&quot; was published in 2002. 

== Scientific departments ==

The Department of Applied Research in Information Technology (DART) works with project-oriented applied research within multimedia, information security, information privacy and risks, universal design, and e-inclusion. In addition to research, DART&#x27;s work covers concept studies, analysis, consultancy, prototyping, training, development, and evaluation.

The Department of Statistical Analysis, Image Analysis, and Pattern Recognition (SAMBA) works with project-oriented applied research in all areas of mathematical statistics. The main application areas are Statistics for Climate, Environment, Marine Resources and Health, Statistics for Finance, Insurance and Commodity Markets, Statistics for Technology, Industry and Administration, Earth Observation, and Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition.

The Department of Statistical Analysis of Natural Resource Data (SAND) works with project-oriented applied research statistics related
to the petroleum industry. The group is a significant international contributor to research and services within reservoir description, stochastic modeling and geostatistics for the petroleum industry. The primary goal is to use statistical methods to reduce and quantify risk and uncertainty. The main area is stochastic modeling of the geology in petroleum reservoirs including upscaling and history matching. There is also a significant activity on all kinds of risk quantification, primarily within the energy sector.

== Centres for Research-based Innovation ==
NR was host to Statistics for Innovation in 2007-2014, and is host to BigInsight for the period 2015-2024. 

Statistics for Innovation and BigInsight are both Centres for Research-based Innovation and funded by the Research Council of Norway. 

== NR&#x27;s Master&#x27;s Prize ==
NR&#x27;s Master’s Prize is awarded annually to master&#x27;s theses submitted at the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo and at the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The award was first issued in 2009.

<text>William John Neeson (born 7 June 1952) is an actor from Northern Ireland. He has received several accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Tony Awards. In 2020, he was placed seventh on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s 50 Greatest Film Actors. Neeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000.

Neeson made his film debut in 1978 with &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; followed by early roles in &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984), &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; (1988), and &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992). He rose to prominence portraying Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Holocaust drama &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) for which he earned an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. He played leading man roles in drama films such as &quot;Nell&quot; (1994), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996), and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1998). He took blockbuster roles portraying Qui-Gon Jinn in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), and Aslan in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; trilogy (2005–2010).

Neeson acted in films such as the historical drama &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), the romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), the biographical drama &quot;Kinsey&quot; (2004), the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot; (2009), the religious drama &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), the fantasy film &quot;A Monster Calls&quot; (2016), the crime thriller &quot;Widows&quot; (2018), the anthology film &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot; (2018), and the romantic drama &quot;Ordinary Love&quot; (2019). Beginning in 2009, Neeson cemented himself as an action star with the action thriller series &quot;Taken&quot; (2008–2014), &quot;The A-Team&quot; (2010), &quot;The Grey&quot; (2011), &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; (2012), &quot;A Walk Among the Tombstones&quot; (2014), and &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot; (2019). He is known for his collaborations in the genre with the director Jaume Collet-Serra and starred in four of his films: &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011), &quot;Non-Stop&quot; (2014), &quot;Run All Night&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Commuter&quot; (2018). 

On stage, Neeson joined the Lyric Players&#x27; Theatre in Belfast in 1976 for two years. On Broadway he earned two Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nominations for his performances as Matt Burke in the revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1992) and John Proctor in the Arthur Miller revival of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (2002). He portrayed Oscar Wilde in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
Neeson was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, the son of primary school caretaker Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; Neeson and cook Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Neeson (née Brown). His mother was born and raised in Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. Brought up Catholic, he was named Liam after a local priest. He has three sisters, Elizabeth, Bernadette, and Rosaleen. He attended St Patrick&#x27;s College, Ballymena, from 1963 to 1967, and later recalled that his love of drama began there.

He said that growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a &quot;second-class citizen&quot; there, but has also said he was never made to feel &quot;inferior or even different&quot; at the town&#x27;s predominantly Protestant technical college. &quot;It would be colourful to imagine I had a rebellious, uproarious Irish background,&quot; he has said, &quot;but the facts were much greyer. Irish, yes. But all that nationalistic stuff, crying into your Guinness and singing rebel songs—that was never my scene.&quot; He has described himself as &quot;out of touch&quot; with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday, a massacre in Derry in 1972 during the Troubles, which encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, he said, &quot;I never stop thinking about [the Troubles]. I&#x27;ve known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It&#x27;s part of my DNA.&quot;

At age nine, Neeson began boxing lessons at the All Saints Youth Club, and went on to win a number of regional titles before quitting at 17. He acted in school productions during his teens. His interest in acting and decision to become an actor were also influenced by Ian Paisley, founder of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), into whose Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster he sneaked. He said, &quot;[Paisley] had a magnificent presence and it was incredible to watch him just Bible-thumping away... it was acting, but it was also great acting and stirring too.&quot; In 1971, he joined a physics and computer science course at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast before leaving to work for the Guinness Brewery. At Queen&#x27;s, he discovered a talent for football and was spotted by Seán Thomas at Bohemian FC. There was a club trial in Dublin and Neeson played one game as a substitute against Shamrock Rovers FC, but was not offered a contract.

==Career==
===1976–1993: Rise to prominence ===
After leaving university, Neeson returned to Ballymena, where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, such as a forklift operator at Guinness and a lorry driver. He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, he joined the Lyric Players Theatre in Belfast, where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and The Evangelist in the religious film &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1978). He moved to Dublin in 1978 when he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Says I, Says He&quot;, a drama about The Troubles, at the Project Arts Centre. He acted in several other Project productions and joined the Abbey Theatre (the National Theatre of Ireland). In 1980, he performed with Stephen Rea, Ray McAnally and Mick Lally, playing Doalty in Brian Friel&#x27;s play &quot;Translations&quot;, the first production of Friel&#x27;s and Rea&#x27;s Field Day Theatre Company, first presented in the Guildhall in Derry on 23 September 1980.

In 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film &quot;Excalibur&quot;. After the role, Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage, and in small-budget films and television. He lived with actress Helen Mirren, whom he met working on &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Between 1982 and 1987, he starred in five films, most notably with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Bounty&quot; and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Mission&quot;. Neeson guest-starred in the third season of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in 1986, and moved to Hollywood the next year to take higher-profile roles. He starred with Cher and Dennis Quaid in &quot;Suspect&quot;, which brought him critical acclaim. In 1988, he starred with Clint Eastwood in the fifth Dirty Harry film, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, as Peter Swan, a horror film director. In 1990, he had a starring role in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Darkman&quot;. Although the film was successful, Neeson&#x27;s subsequent years did not bring him the same recognition. He also starred in the eponymous role for the film &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; (1993).

===1993–2000: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
Steven Spielberg offered Neeson the role of Oskar Schindler in his holocaust film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; after seeing him in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; on Broadway. Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty all expressed interest in the part (Beatty even auditioned), but Neeson was cast in December 1992 after auditioning for the role. He read the Keneally book and concluded that his character &quot;enjoyed fookin&#x27; with the Nazis. In Keneally&#x27;s book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them... if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don&#x27;t quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.&quot; His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar, and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for the performance. He soon became an in-demand leading actor. 

In 1993, Neeson made his Broadway debut playing Mat Burke in the revival of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play &quot;Anna Christie&quot; starring opposite his &quot;Ellis Island&quot; co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson. For his performance he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. The following year they also worked together in &quot;Nell&quot; (1994) starring Jodie Foster. He then took leading roles in the period piece drama films including playing the lead role of Rob Roy MacGregor in the historical drama &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995) opposite Jessica Lange, Brian Cox, and Tim Roth. Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised his ability to be a leading man writing, &quot;Neeson, tall and grand, makes an effortless hero as &quot;Rob Roy&quot;&quot;. 

The following year he acted in Neil Jordan&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996) alongside Julia Roberts, and Alan Rickman. Neeson portrayed the title role as the Irish revolutionary leading the fight for Irish independence. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion with Neeson earning the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He later earning nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;Neeson is a compulsive dynamo as Collins, with the actor seizing his part with a passion and boldness utterly in keeping with the character’s approach to life and his cause&quot;.

Neeson portrayed Jean Valjean in the 1998 adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; directed by Bille August. He starred alongside Uma Thurman, Geoffrey Rush, and Claire Danes. Writing of Neeson&#x27;s performance, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[He] plays the role with the sure physical authority and profound decency that are fundamental to Valjean&#x27;s character&quot; adding, &quot;With a first-rate cast and a venerable storytelling style, it fluently condenses Victor Hugo&#x27;s epic novel and retrieves some of its suspenseful momentum.&quot; That same year he returned to the stage in the David Hare play &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot; (1998) portraying Oscar Wilde which ran at both the Almeida Theatre in the West End and the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway. He acted alongside Tom Hollander and Peter Capaldi. In 1999 he acted in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1999) opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones.

===1999–2007: Blockbuster roles ===

In 1999, Neeson starred as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Director George Lucas cast Neeson because he considered him a &quot;master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.&quot; As the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film to be released in 16 years, it was surrounded by media anticipation. Neeson&#x27;s connection to &quot;Star Wars&quot; started in the Crown Bar, Belfast. He told Ricki Lake, &quot;I probably wouldn&#x27;t have taken the role if it wasn&#x27;t for the advice of Peter King in the Crown during a Lyric reunion.&quot; Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was an enormous box-office success and remained the most financially successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; film (unadjusted for inflation) until &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

Neeson&#x27;s performance as Qui-Gon received positive reviews and a Saturn Award nomination. A stock recording of his voice from &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; can be heard during a scene in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002). Neeson was later reported to be appearing in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), but ultimately did not. In the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (2008–20), he voiced Qui-Gon in two episodes of the third season and one episode of the sixth season, and he also made a voice cameo as Qui-Gon in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Neeson appeared as Qui-Gon in the final episode of &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; (2022), appearing as a force ghost to Obi-Wan, in an uncredited cameo, marking his first live-action portrayal of Qui-Gon since &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot; He later voiced Qui-Gon again for an episode of the animated &quot;Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi&quot; (2022).

Neeson narrated the 2001 documentaries &quot;Journey into Amazing Caves&quot;, a short film about two scientists who travel around the world to search for material for potential cures; and &quot;The Endurance: Shackleton&#x27;s Legendary Antarctic Adventure&quot;. The latter won awards at a number of film festivals including Best Documentary from both the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. Neeson returned to Broadway in the revival of the Arthur Miller play &quot;The Crucible&quot; acting opposite Laura Linney. For his performance as John Proctor he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; praised Neeson writing, &quot;In his thoughtful performance as Proctor, the effortlessly charismatic Neeson subtly delineates a man’s moral evolution as Proctor moves from casual scorn for the proceedings to outrage to soul-stricken despair&quot; adding, &quot;Perhaps the finest aspect of Neeson’s performance is its admirable restraint&quot;. That same year Neeson acted with Harrison Ford in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s 2002 submarine thriller &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; as Captain Mikhail Polenin. He was also on the cast of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; with Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz.

In 2003, he played a recently widowed writer in Richard Curtis&#x27;s romantic comedy ensemble &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) acting alongside Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Laura Linney. The film was a commercial success and has since become a cult classic and holiday favorite. The following year he portrayed Alfred Kinsey in the biographical drama &quot;Kinsey&quot; reuniting with Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard and John Lithgow. Neeson received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama losing to Leonardo DiCaprio for &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). That year Neeson hosted an episode of the NBC sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He starred as a redneck trucker, Marlon Weaver, in an &quot;Appalachian Emergency Room&quot; sketch and as a hippie in a one-off sketch about two (the other played by Amy Poehler) who attempt to borrow a police dog to find their lost stash of marijuana. Despite vowing not to play any Irish , Neeson did play an Irish man named Lorcan McArdle in the home makeover show parody &quot;You Call This A House, Do Ya?&quot;
In 2005, Neeson took multiple roles in mainstream blockbuster films. He portrayed Godfrey of Ibelin in Ridley Scott&#x27;s epic adventure &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, one of the main villains in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s action film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;; and Father Bernard in Neil Jordan&#x27;s adaptation of Patrick McCabe&#x27;s novel &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot;. That same year he replaced Brian Cox playing Aslan the Lion in the fantasy adventure film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (2005), an adaptation of the C. S. Lewis book of the same name. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star&quot; (2005), he voiced the kindly priest who (briefly) converts Bart and Homer to Catholicism.

In 2007, he starred in the American Civil War epic &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;. Neeson voiced the main character&#x27;s father, James, in the video game &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. Executive producer Todd Howard said, &quot;This role was written with Liam in mind, and provides the dramatic tone for the entire game&quot;. &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, the third game in the Fallout series, was extremely well received by critics and shipped 4.7 million copies by the end of 2008, the year it was released. In the director&#x27;s commentary of the 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; DVD, Michael Bay said he had told the animators to seek inspiration from Neeson in creating Optimus Prime&#x27;s body language. Neeson appeared as Alistair Little in the BBC Northern Ireland/Big Fish Films television drama &quot;Five Minutes of Heaven&quot;, which tells the true story of a young Protestant man convicted of murdering a Catholic boy during The Troubles.

===2008–present: Action stardom ===

In 2008, Neeson starred in the action film &quot;Taken&quot;, a French-produced film also starring Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace, based on a script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Pierre Morel. Neeson plays a retired CIA operative from the elite Special Activities Division who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped. &quot;Taken&quot; was a worldwide box-office hit, grossing $223.9 million worldwide, making almost $200 million more than its production budget. Neeson has said in interviews that he believed that &quot;Taken&quot; had put some people off the idea of actually travelling to Europe. &quot;Taken&quot; brought Neeson back into the centre of the public eye and resulted in his being cast in many more big-budget Hollywood movies. That year he also narrated the documentary &quot;Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity&quot; and again lent his voice to Aslan in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot; (2008). He also provided a voice for Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s anime film &quot;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea&quot;, which received an August 2009 release.

In 2010, Neeson played Zeus in the remake of the 1981 film, &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;. The film was a huge box-office hit, grossing $475 million worldwide. Neeson also starred in Atom Egoyan&#x27;s erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot;, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on 26 March 2010. &quot;Chloe&quot; had enjoyed commercial success and became the Canadian director&#x27;s biggest money maker ever. Later the same year, he played John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith in the spin-off movie from the television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Neeson voiced Aslan once more in the 2010 sequel &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. That same year he made a guest-star appearance on the Showtime series &quot;The Big C&quot; with Laura Linney. In 2011, Neeson starred in the action-thriller &quot;Unknown&quot;, a German-British-American co-production of a French book filmed in Berlin in early 2010, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. This film led to a collaboration between Neeson and Collet-Serra (as director and/or producer) on a series of similar action films including &quot;Non-Stop&quot; (2014), &quot;Run All Night&quot; (2015), &quot;The Commuter&quot; (2018) and &quot;Retribution&quot; (2023). Neeson reunited with Steven Spielberg with plans to star as Abraham Lincoln in the 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, based on the book &quot;Team of Rivals&quot; by Doris Kearns Goodwin. In preparation for the role, Neeson visited the District of Columbia and Springfield, Illinois, where Lincoln lived before being elected, and read Lincoln&#x27;s personal letters. Neeson eventually declined the role, claiming he was &quot;past his sell date&quot; and had grown too old for the role and was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis (who won his third Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Lincoln).
In 2011, he played himself in BBC2&#x27;s series &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; starring Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and Warwick Davis. In late 2011, Neeson was cast to play the lead character, a journalist, in a new album recording and arena production of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s War of the Worlds&quot;. He replaced Richard Burton, who had posthumously appeared in the arena production through CGI animation. Neeson did not physically appear on the stage, instead playing the role through the use of 3D holography. In 2012, Neeson starred in Joe Carnahan&#x27;s &quot;The Grey&quot;. The film received mostly positive reviews and Neeson&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. He also starred in &quot;Taken 2&quot; (2012), a successful sequel to his 2008 blockbuster. That year, he once again appeared as Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in a cameo appearance in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), the third and final film in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;. Dialogue from his role as Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was featured in the first trailer for the film.

Neeson had a supporting role as the henchman Bad Cop/Good Cop in the animated film &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. Neeson later played Bill Marks in the 2014 action film &quot;Non-Stop&quot;. The film was released on 28 February 2014. He also appeared, uncredited, as God in the BBC2 series &quot;Rev.&quot;. Neeson stars in the 2014 film &quot;A Walk Among the Tombstones&quot;, an adaption of the best-selling novel of the same name, in which he plays former cop Matthew Scudder, a detective hired to hunt the killers of a drug dealer&#x27;s wife. During Super Bowl XLIX, Supercell did a &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; commercial with Neeson playing the game as &quot;AngryNeeson52&quot; and vowing revenge on his opponent &quot;BigBuffetBoy85&quot; while waiting for his scone at a bakery. The appearance was a parody of his role in &quot;Taken&quot;. In 2016, Neeson narrated the RTÉ One three-part documentary on the Easter Rising, &quot;1916&quot;. Following the success of the &quot;Taken&quot; films, Neeson has become increasingly known as a star of action thriller films. Besides &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot;, &quot;The Grey&quot;, &quot;Non-Stop&quot;, &quot;A Walk Among the Tombstones&quot;, &quot;Run All Night&quot;, &quot;The Commuter&quot; and Retribution, other recent action films starring Neeson have included &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot; (2019), &quot;Honest Thief&quot; (2020), &quot;The Marksman&quot; (2021), &quot;The Ice Road&quot; (2021), &quot;Blacklight&quot; (2022), &quot;Memory&quot; (2022), &quot;In the Land of Saints and Sinners&quot; (2024) and &quot;Absolution&quot; (2024). Neeson has indicated a desire to retire from the action genre though the films have taken his acting career in a new direction.

In 2016, Neeson reunited with director Martin Scorsese with the drama an adaptation of the novel &quot;Silence&quot; starring alongside Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. That same year, he did the voice and motion capture for the Monster in the Spanish film &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;. In 2018 he acted in the Coen brothers&#x27; western anthology film &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot; and the Steve McQueen crime thriller &quot;Widows&quot; acting opposite Viola Davis. He portrayed Mark Felt in &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot; (2017) directed by Peter Landesman and Philip Marlowe in &quot;Marlowe&quot; (2022) directed by Neil Jordan. He acted in the romantic drama &quot;Ordinary Love&quot; (2019) with Lesley Manville and the biographical drama &quot;Wildcat&quot; starring Maya Hawke. On television he played Chief Constable Byers in &quot;Derry Girls&quot; (2022), and portrayed a fictional version of himself in &quot;Atlanta&quot; (2022).

==Activism==
Neeson opposes what he sees as the unrestricted right to own firearms in the U.S. and has made calls for gun control. In January 2015, he repeated his views, calling U.S. gun laws a &quot;disgrace&quot; in an interview with Emirati newspaper &quot;Gulf News&quot; when replying to a question about the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shootings earlier that month. In response, U.S. gun manufacturer Para USA, which provided the prop weapons used by Neeson in the &quot;Taken&quot; film series, stated: &quot;We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects.&quot;

In 2014, Neeson protested against the anti-carriage horse campaign of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he would outlaw horse-drawn carriages in Central Park once he took office. He wrote an opinion page published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; citing the carriage trade as a safe one for employees, horses, and tourists, and noted it was a livelihood for many immigrants.

Neeson narrated a video for Amnesty International in favour of the legalisation of abortion in Ireland, which some conservative and pro-life commentators claimed was &quot;anti-Catholic&quot;.

Neeson was opposed to Brexit, stating in 2016 that it would be truly &quot;a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the peace process regarding border controls&quot;.

In September 2017, Neeson compared the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump to the Watergate scandal of Richard Nixon: &quot;Democracy works and no man—and certainly not the president—is above the law. He has to be accountable.&quot;

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Neeson lived with actress Helen Mirren during the early 1980s. They met while working on &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981). Interviewed by James Lipton for &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Neeson said Mirren was instrumental in him getting an agent. 
He dated Barbra Streisand for about nine months between 1991 and 1992.

Neeson then met actress Natasha Richardson while performing in a revival of the play &quot;Anna Christie&quot; on Broadway in 1993. They were married on 3 July 1994 and had two sons together, Micheál (b. 1995) and Daniel (b. 1996). In October 1998, they won £50,000 ($85,370) in libel damages after the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; wrongly claimed that their marriage was suffering. They donated the money to victims of the August 1998 Omagh bombing. In August 2004, they purchased an estate in Millbrook, New York. On 18 March 2009, Richardson died when she suffered a severe head injury in a skiing accident at the Mont Tremblant Resort, northwest of Montreal. Neeson donated her organs following her death.

=== Citizenship ===
Neeson holds Irish and American citizenship, having been naturalised as an American citizen in 2009. He primarily identifies as Irish. After taking up American citizenship, he was adamant he was not turning his back on his Irish roots. In 2009, nearly four decades after he was an undergraduate in physics and computer science at Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast, the university awarded him an honorary doctorate which was presented to him in New York by Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Gregson. In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. He is a patron of Belfast-based charity and film festival CineMagic, which helps young people get involved in the movie industry.

A heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003 while working on &quot;Love Actually&quot;. When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of &quot;The A-Team&quot;, he had reservations about smoking cigars (a signature trait of the character), but agreed to do it for the film.

In June 2012, Neeson&#x27;s publicist denied reports that Neeson was converting to Islam. Neeson has expressed an affection for the &quot;adhan&quot;, the Islamic call to prayer, that he grew accustomed to while filming &quot;Taken 2&quot; in Istanbul: &quot;By the third week, it was like I couldn&#x27;t live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful.&quot; He also expressed admiration for the &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.

Neeson&#x27;s mother, Kitty, died in June 2020. He was unable to return to his hometown for her funeral due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Social views===
Neeson is a long-term supporter of the need for more integrated education in Northern Ireland; that is, educating Catholics and Protestants together. In 2017 he said, &quot;As Northern Ireland moves forward from division, who do we look to for a future we can share? Our children - so why do we continue to educate them apart? Different religions, different backgrounds, different schools. There is another way. Protestants and Catholics, other beliefs and none, learning and working together every day.&quot; He has praised schools where parents have voted to transform segregated schools into integrated schools, and fronted television adverts to encourage more parents to integrate their children&#x27;s schools.

Neeson was criticised for his comments on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Late Late Show&quot; in January 2018, during which he described the Me Too movement as a &quot;witch hunt&quot; and cited Garrison Keillor&#x27;s dismissal from Minnesota Public Radio as an example.

In February 2019, Neeson gained public and media controversy after a press junket interview he conducted with &quot;The Independent&quot; while promoting &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot;, a film about a father seeking revenge for his son&#x27;s murder. He said that he generated his character&#x27;s &quot;primal&quot; anger by recounting an experience he had 40 years ago, in which a female friend of his had been raped by a stranger. After learning the attacker was a black man, Neeson said that he spent a week going &quot;up and down areas with a cosh, hoping some &#x27;black bastard&#x27; would come out of a pub and have a go&quot; so that he &quot;could kill him&quot;. In the interview, he also said he was ashamed of the experience and that the things he did and said were &quot;horrible&quot;. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s awful [...] but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, &#x27;What the fuck are you doing?&#x27;&quot;

In an appearance on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Neeson elaborated on his comments while denying being a racist, stating that he asked for physical attributes of the rapist other than his race and that he would have done the same if the rapist was &quot;a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian&quot;. He also said that he had purposely gone into &quot;black areas of the city&quot; but that he &quot;did seek help&quot; and counselling from his friends and a priest after coming to his senses. He said that the lesson of his experience was &quot;to open up [and] to talk about these things&quot;, including toxic masculinity and the underlying &quot;racism and bigotry&quot; in both the U.S. and Northern Ireland. The controversy following his comments led to cancellation of the red carpet event for the premiere of &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot;. Neeson was publicly defended by Michelle Rodriguez, Whoopi Goldberg, John Barnes, Trevor Noah, and Ralph Fiennes. Donald Glover later convinced him to appear in his FX series &quot;Atlanta&quot; episode &quot;New Jazz&quot; as a fictionalised version of himself, to examine the controversy.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

In 2000, Neeson was offered the &quot;Freedom of the Town of Ballymena&quot; by the Ballymena Borough Council, but because of objections made by members of the Democratic Unionist Party regarding his comments that he had felt like a &quot;second-class citizen&quot; growing up as a Catholic in the town, he declined the award, citing tensions. Following the controversy, Neeson wrote a letter to the council, stating; &quot;I will always remain very proud of my upbringing in, and association with, the town and my country of birth, which I will continue to promote at every opportunity. Indeed, I regard the enduring support over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor.&quot; Subsequently, on 28 January 2013, Neeson received the Freedom of the Borough from Ballymena Borough Council at a ceremony in the town.

Neeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in her 2000 New Year Honours. The American Ireland Fund honoured Neeson with their Performing Arts Award for the great distinction he has brought to Ireland at their 2008 Dinner Gala in New York City. In 2009, at a ceremony in New York, Neeson was awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast. On 9 April 2016, he was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award by the Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) at the Mansion House, Dublin, with Irish President Michael D. Higgins presenting the award. In 2017, Neeson was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 74 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide. In January 2018, he was awarded the Distinguished Service for the Irish Abroad Award by Irish President Michael D. Higgins, who described it as an award &quot;for Irish people abroad who are making a contribution to humanity&quot;.

<doc id="64184" wikidata="Q238179" url="?curid=64184" title="List of Aragonese monarchs">
<text>This is a list of the kings and queens of Aragon. The Kingdom of Aragon was created sometime between 950 and 1035 when the County of Aragon, which had been acquired by the Kingdom of Navarre in the tenth century, was separated from Navarre in accordance with the will of King Sancho III (1004–35). In 1164, the marriage of the Aragonese princess Petronila (Kingdom of Aragon) and the Catalan count Ramon Berenguer IV (County of Barcelona) created a dynastic union from which what modern historians call &quot;the Crown of Aragon&quot; was born. In the thirteenth century the kingdoms of Valencia, Majorca and Sicily were added to the Crown, and in the fourteenth the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica. The Crown of Aragon continued to exist until 1713 when its separate constitutional systems (Catalan Constitutions, Aragon &quot;Fueros&quot;, and Furs of Valencia) were swept away in the &quot;Nueva Planta&quot; decrees at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession.
==Jiménez dynasty, 1035–1164==
With the death of Sancho III of Pamplona, Aragon was inherited by his son Ramiro as an autonomous state.

After the Battle of Almansa in April 1707, Philip V of Spain recovered the Aragon, but imposed the Nueva Planta decrees in June 1707, by which the territory lost its privileges.

During the war (officially in 1707) Philip V of Spain, the first of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain, disbanded the Crown of Aragon. After this time, there are no more Aragonese monarchs. Nevertheless, Spanish monarchs up to Isabella II, while styling themselves &quot;king/queen of Spain&quot; on coins, still used some of the traditional nomenclature of the defunct Crown of Aragon in their official documents: &quot;King/Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, both Sicilies, Jerusalem, Navarra, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Sardinia, Cordova, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, the Algarve, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, the Eastern &amp; Western Indias, the Islands &amp; Mainland of the Ocean sea; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Milan; Count of Habsburg, Flanders, Tyrol, Barcelona; Lord of Biscay, Molina&quot;.

<text>The Computer Olympiad is a multi-games event in which computer programs compete against each other. For many games, the Computer Olympiads are an opportunity to claim the &quot;world&#x27;s best computer player&quot; title. First contested in 1989, the majority of the games are board games but other games such as bridge take place as well. In 2010, several puzzles were included in the competition.

== History ==

Developed in the 1980s by David Levy, the first Computer Olympiad took place in 1989 at the Park Lane Hotel in London. The games ran on a yearly basis until after the 1992 games, when the Olympiad&#x27;s ruling committee was unable to find a new organiser. This resulted in the games being suspended until 2000 when the Mind Sports Olympiad resurrected them. Recently, the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) has adopted the Computer Olympiad and tries to organise the event on an annual basis.

In the year 2024, parody website Mike Row Soft added an image of the Olympics with various Linux distros displayed inside the circles, and color-matched.
== Games contested ==
The games which have been contested at each Olympiad are:

==1st–5th Olympiads (1989–1992)==
==6th–10th Olympiads (2000–2004)==
After an eight-year hiatus, the Computer Olympiad was revived by bringing it into the Mind Sports Olympiad. The chess competition was a special event, since it was adopted by the International Correspondence Chess Association (ICCA) as the 17th World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCC 2000). The 5th Olympiad was in 2000 at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace; the 6th, in 2001 at Ad Fundunm at Maastricht University; the 7th, in 2002 in Maastricht; the 8th, in 2003 in Graz; and the 9th, in 2004 in Ramat Gan. The 7th Olympiad was adopted by the ICCA as the 10th World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC), and the 8th was held in conjugation with both 11th WCCC and the 10th Advances in Computer Games Conference. Because of this, no medals were awarded for the two chess events. The 9th was held in conjugation with WCCC and the Computers and Games 2004 Conference; no medals were awarded to the two chess events. Jonathan Schaeffer and J. W. H. M. Uiterwijk were the tournament directors.

==10th–14th Olympiads (2005–2009)==
The 10th Olympiad was in 2005 in Taipei; the 11th, in 2006 in Turin; the 12th, in 2007 at the Amsterdam Science Park; the 13th, in 2008 at the Beijing Golden Century Golf Club; and the 14th, in 2009 in Pamplona. The 10th Olympiad wasa held at the same time and location as the 11th Advances in Computer Games and its organizing committee was made up of J. W. Hellemons (chair), H. H. L. M. Donkers, M. Greenspan, T-s Hsu, H. J. van den Herik, and M. Tiessen. Hand Talk, which won the gold medal in Computer Go, was originally written in assembly language by a retired chemistry professor of Sun Yat-sen University, China. The 11th Olympiad was held in conjugation with the 14th World Computer Chess Championship and the 5th Computer and Games Conference. Human FIDE 37th Chess Olympiad co-hosted this event; the 12th, with the 15th World Computer Chess Championship and the Computer Games Workshop; the 13th, with the International Computer Games Championship, the World Computer Chess Championship, and a scientific conference on computer games; and the 14th with the World Computer Chess Championship and a scientific conference on computer games.

Rybka was retroactively disqualified from all ICCC events due to plagiarism. Rankings were adjusted appropriately.

==15th–18th Olympiads (2010–2015)==
The 15th Olympiad was held in 2010 in Kanazawa, Japan along with the 18th World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC), and a scientific conference on computer games. The 16th Olympiad was held in 2011 at Tilburg University at the same time as the 19th WCCC. The 17th Olympiad was held in 2013 at Keio University&#x27;s Collaboration Complex on the Hiyoshi Campus, and was at the same time as the 20th WCCC and a scientific conference on computer games. The 18th Olympiad was in 2015 at Leiden University and was organized by the International Computer Game Association, the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, and the Leiden Centre of Data Science.

==19th–25th Olympiads (2016–2022)==
The 19th Olympiad was held 27 June – 3 July 2016 and the 20th Olympiad was held 1–7 July 2017, both at Leiden University and organized by the International Computer Game Association, the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, and the Leiden Centre of Data Science. The 21st Olympiad was held 7–13 July 2018 in Taipei, Taiwan alongside the 10th International Conference on Computers and Games. The World Computer Chess Championships took place from 13–19 July in Stockholm, Sweden. The 22nd Olympiad was held 11–17 August 2019 in Macau, China and the 23rd (2020), 24th (2021), and 25th (2022) Olympiads were held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Summary by game==
===Abalone===
Abalone is a strategy game using a hexagonal patterned board with 14 marbles for each of two players. The objective is to push six of the opponent&#x27;s marbles off the edge of the board.

===Amazons===
Amazons is played on a 10×10 chessboard by two players each with four &quot;amazons&quot; (queen chess pieces). Moves are made to block squares and the winner is the last player able to move his pieces to an unblocked square.

===Awari===
Awari is an abstract strategy game among the Mancala family of board games (pit and pebble games).

=== Backgammon ===

Backgammon is a board game for two players where the checker-like playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice; a player wins by removing all of his pieces from the board before his opponent.

===Bridge===
Bridge is a trick-taking card game for four players.

Bridge participation in the Computer Olympiad was largely discontinued when in 1996 the American Contract Bridge League established a new official World Computer Bridge Championship, to be run annually at a major bridge tournament. Starting in 1999, that event is now co-sponsored by the World Bridge Federation.

===Chess===
Chess is a two-player board game played on a checkered game-board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces of varying characteristics, the objective being to capture one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s king piece.

Many computer-versus-computer events are held beyond those of the Computer Olympiad.

===Chinese chess===
Chinese chess is a strategy board game for two players from the same family as western or international chess. Known primarily as Xiangqi internationally, the game is referred to as Chinese chess in the Computer Olympiad competitions.

===Chinese dark chess===
Chinese dark chess is known as Banqi in Chinese.

===Clobber===

===Connect Four===

===Connect6===

===Dominoes===

===Gin rummy===

===GIPF===
===Octi===
Octi is an abstract strategy game designed by Donald Green, with similarities to checkers and chess but allowing for multiple jumping, capturing, and special movement of pieces. The object of the game is to move one&#x27;s pieces into the opponent&#x27;s starting points.
===Poker===
===Pool===

Also known as computational pool.

<doc id="64188" wikidata="Q92745" url="?curid=64188" title="Ole-Johan Dahl">
<text>Ole-Johan Dahl (12 October 1931 – 29 June 2002) was a Norwegian computer scientist. Dahl was a professor of computer science at the University of Oslo and is considered to be one of the fathers of Simula and object-oriented programming along with Kristen Nygaard.

== Career ==
Dahl was born in Mandal, Norway. He was the son of Finn Dahl (1898–1962) and Ingrid Othilie Kathinka Pedersen (1905–80). When he was seven, his family moved to Drammen. When he was thirteen, the whole family fled to Sweden during the German occupation of Norway in World War II. After the war&#x27;s end, Dahl studied numerical mathematics at the University of Oslo.

Dahl became a full professor at the University of Oslo in 1968 and was a gifted teacher as well as researcher. Here he worked on &quot;Hierarchical Program Structures&quot;, probably his most influential publication, which appeared co-authored with C.A.R. Hoare in the influential book &quot;Structured Programming&quot; of 1972 by Dahl, Edsger Dijkstra, and Hoare, perhaps the best-known academic book concerning software in the 1970s. As his career advanced, Dahl grew increasingly interested in the use of formal methods, to rigorously reason about object-orientation for example. His expertise ranged from the practical application of ideas to their formal mathematical underpinning to ensure the validity of the approach.

Dahl is widely accepted as Norway&#x27;s foremost computer scientist. With Kristen Nygaard, he produced the initial ideas for object-oriented (OO) programming in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral (NR)) as part of the Simula I (1961–1965) and Simula 67 (1965–1968) simulation programming languages, which began as an extended variant and superset of ALGOL 60. Dahl and Nygaard were the first to develop the concepts of class, subclass (allowing implicit information hiding), inheritance, dynamic object creation, etc., all important aspects of the OO paradigm. An &quot;object&quot; is a self-contained component (with a data structure and associated procedures or &quot;methods&quot;) in a software system. These are combined to form a complete system. The object-oriented approach is now pervasive in modern software development, including widely used imperative programming languages such as C++ and Java.

He received the Turing Award for his work in 2001 (with Kristen Nygaard). He received the 2002 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) John von Neumann Medal (with Kristen Nygaard) and was named Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 2000.

The Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets named the Dahl-Nygaard Prize after Dahl.

<text>Bloodletting (or blood-letting) is the deliberate withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease. Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches, was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as &quot;humours&quot; that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It was the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years. In Europe, the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 19th century. The practice has now been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions. In the beginning of the 19th century, studies had begun to show the harmful effects of bloodletting.

Today, the term &quot;phlebotomy&quot; refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion. &quot;Therapeutic phlebotomy&quot; refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells. The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience.

==In the ancient world==
Passages from the Ebers Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt.
Egyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments.
According to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the hippopotamus, confusing its red secretions with blood and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress.

In Greece, bloodletting was in use in the 5th century BC during the lifetime of Hippocrates, who mentions this practice but generally relied on dietary techniques. Erasistratus, however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting. His student Herophilus also opposed bloodletting. But a contemporary Greek physician, Archagathus, one of the first to practice in Rome, did believe in the value of bloodletting.

&quot;Bleeding&quot; a patient to health was modeled on the process of menstruation. Hippocrates believed that menstruation functioned to &quot;purge women of bad humours&quot;. During the Roman Empire, the Greek physician Galen, who subscribed to the teachings of Hippocrates, advocated physician-initiated bloodletting.

The popularity of bloodletting in the classical Mediterranean world was reinforced by the ideas of Galen, after he discovered that not only veins but also arteries were filled with blood, not air as was commonly believed at the time. There were two key concepts in his system of bloodletting. The first was that blood was created and then used up; it did not circulate, and so it could &quot;stagnate&quot; in the extremities. The second was that humoral balance was the basis of illness or health, the four humours being blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, relating to the four Greek classical elements of air, water, earth, and fire respectively. Galen believed that blood was the dominant humour and the one in most need of control. In order to balance the humours, a physician would either remove &quot;excess&quot; blood (plethora) from the patient or give them an emetic to induce vomiting, or a diuretic to induce urination.

Galen created a complex system of how much blood should be removed based on the patient&#x27;s age, constitution, the season, the weather and the place. &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; bleeding instructions following these systems were developed. Symptoms of plethora were believed to include fever, apoplexy, and headache. The blood to be let was of a specific nature determined by the disease: either arterial or venous, and distant or close to the area of the body affected. He linked different blood vessels with different organs, according to their supposed drainage. For example, the vein in the right hand would be let for liver problems and the vein in the left hand for problems with the spleen. The more severe the disease, the more blood would be let. Fevers required copious amounts of bloodletting.

==Cross-cultural bloodletting==
Therapeutic uses of bloodletting were reported in 60 distinct cultures/ethnic groups in the HRAF database, present in all inhabited continents. Bloodletting has also been reported in 15 of the 60 cultures in the probability sample files (PSF) list. The PSF is a subset of eHRAF data that includes only one culture from each of 60 macro-culture areas around the world. The prevalence of bloodletting in PSF controls for pseudo replication linked to common ancestry, suggesting that bloodletting has independently emerged many times. Bloodletting is varied in its practices cross-culturally, for example, in native Alaskan culture bloodletting was practiced for different indications, using different tools, on different body areas, by different people, and it was explained by different medical theories.

According to Helena Miton et al.&#x27;s analysis of the HRAF database and other sources, there are several cross-cultural patterns in bloodletting.

* Bloodletting is not self-administered. Out of 14 cultures in which the bloodletting practitioner was mentioned, the practitioner was always a third party. 13/14 of the cultures had practitioners with roles related to medicine, while one culture had a practitioner whose role was not related to medicine.
* Idea of bloodletting removing &#x27;bad blood&#x27; that needs to be taken out was common, and was explicitly mentioned in 10/14 cultures studied with detailed descriptions of bloodletting.
* Bloodletting is not thought to be effective against illness caused supernaturally by humans (e.g., witchcraft). This is surprising, because in most cultures witchcraft and sorcery can be blamed for ailments. But out of 14 cultures with detailed bloodletting descriptions, there was no evidence of bloodletting being used to cure witchcraft-related ailments, while bloodletting was recorded as a cure for ailments of other origins. The Azande culture has been recorded to believe that bloodletting does not work to cure human-related witchcraft ailments. 
* Bloodletting is usually administered directly to the affected area, e.g. if the patient has a headache, a cut is made on the forehead. Out of 14 cultures with information on the localization of bloodletting, 11 at least sometimes removed blood from the affected area, while 3 specifically removed blood from a different area from the area in pain. Europe is the only continent with more instances of non-colocalized than colocalized bloodletting.

In a transmission chain experiment done on people living in the US through Amazon Mechanical Turk, stories about bloodletting in a non-affected area were much more likely to transition into stories about bloodletting being administered near the area in pain than vice versa. This suggests that colocalized bloodletting could be a cultural attractor and is more likely to be culturally transmitted, even among people in the US who are likely more familiar with non-colocalized bloodletting. 

Bloodletting as a concept is thought to be a cultural attractor, or an intrinsically attractive / culturally transmissible concept. This could explain bloodletting&#x27;s independent cross-cultural emergence and common cross-cultural traits.

== Middle Ages ==
The Talmud recommended a specific day of the week and days of the month for bloodletting in the Shabbat tractate, and similar rules, though less codified, can be found among Christian writings advising which saints&#x27; days were favourable for bloodletting. During medieval times bleeding charts were common, showing specific bleeding sites on the body in alignment with the planets and zodiacs. Islamic medical authors also advised bloodletting, particularly for fevers. It was practised according to seasons and certain phases of the Moon in the lunar calendar. The practice was probably passed by the Greeks with the translation of ancient texts to Arabic and is different than bloodletting by cupping mentioned in the traditions of Muhammad. When Muslim theories became known in the Latin-speaking countries of Europe, bloodletting became more widespread. Together with cautery, it was central to Arabic surgery; the key texts &quot;Kitab al-Qanun&quot; and especially &quot;&quot; both recommended it. It was also known in Ayurvedic medicine, described in the &quot;Susruta Samhita&quot;.
==Use through the 19th century==

Bloodletting became a main technique of heroic medicine, a traumatic and destructive collection of medical practices that emerged in the 18th century.

Even after the humoral system fell into disuse, the practice was continued by surgeons and barber-surgeons. Though the bloodletting was often &quot;recommended&quot; by physicians, it was carried out by barbers. This led to the distinction between physicians and surgeons. The red-and-white-striped pole of the barbershop, still in use today, is derived from this practice: the red symbolizes blood while the white symbolizes the bandages. Bloodletting was used to &quot;treat&quot; a wide range of diseases, becoming a standard treatment for almost every ailment, and was practiced prophylactically as well as therapeutically.

A number of different methods were employed. The most common was &quot;phlebotomy&quot;, or &quot;venesection&quot; (often called &quot;breathing a vein&quot;), in which blood was drawn from one or more of the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In &quot;arteriotomy&quot;, an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In &quot;scarification&quot; (not to be confused with scarification, a method of body modification), the &quot;superficial&quot; vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded lancet, or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a vacuum within (see fire cupping). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a &quot;scarificator&quot;, used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel. One knife bar gear has slipped teeth, turning the blades in a different direction than those on the other bars. The last photo and the diagram show the depth adjustment bar at the back and sides.

Leeches could also be used. The withdrawal of so much blood as to induce syncope (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would only end when the patient began to swoon.

William Harvey disproved the basis of the practice in 1628, and the introduction of scientific medicine, &quot;la méthode numérique&quot;, allowed Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis to demonstrate that phlebotomy was entirely ineffective in the treatment of pneumonia and various fevers in the 1830s. Nevertheless, in 1838, a lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians would still state that &quot;blood-letting is a remedy which, when judiciously employed, it is hardly possible to estimate too highly&quot;, and Louis was dogged by the sanguinary Broussais, who could recommend leeches fifty at a time. Some physicians resisted Louis&#x27; work because they &quot;were not prepared to discard therapies &#x27;validated by both tradition and their own experience on account of somebody else&#x27;s numbers&#x27;.&quot;

During this era, bloodletting was used to treat almost every disease. One British medical text recommended bloodletting for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases. Bloodletting was even used to treat most forms of hemorrhaging such as nosebleed, excessive menstruation, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Before surgery or at the onset of childbirth, blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation, it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.

There were also theories that bloodletting would cure &quot;heartsickness&quot; and &quot;heartbreak&quot;. A French physician, Jacques Ferrand wrote a book in 1623 on the uses of bloodletting to cure a broken heart. He recommended bloodletting to the point of heart failure (literal).

Leeches became especially popular in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the French imported about 40 million leeches a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported 6 million leeches a year from France alone. Through the early decades of the century, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by physicians throughout Europe.

Bloodletting was also popular in the young United States of America, where Benjamin Rush (a signatory of the Declaration of Independence) saw the state of the arteries as the key to disease, recommending levels of bloodletting that were high even for the time. George Washington asked to be bled heavily after he developed a throat infection from weather exposure. Within a ten-hour period, a total of 124–126 ounces (3.75 liters) of blood was withdrawn prior to his death from a throat infection in 1799.

One reason for the continued popularity of bloodletting (and purging) was that, while anatomical knowledge, surgical and diagnostic skills increased tremendously in Europe from the 17th century, the key to curing disease remained elusive, and the underlying belief was that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all. The psychological benefit of bloodletting to the patient (a placebo effect) may sometimes have outweighed the physiological problems it caused. Bloodletting slowly lost favour during the 19th century, after French physician Dr. Pierre Louis conducted an experiment in which he studied the effect of bloodletting on pneumonia patients. A number of other ineffective or harmful treatments were available as placebos—mesmerism, various processes involving the new technology of electricity, many potions, tonics, and elixirs. Yet, bloodletting persisted during the 19th century partly because it was readily available to people of any socioeconomic status.

Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English write that the popularity of bloodletting and heroic medicine in general was because of a need to justify medical billing. Traditional healing techniques had been mostly practiced by women within a non-commercial family or village setting. As male doctors suppressed these techniques, they found it difficult to quantify various &quot;amounts&quot; of healing to charge for, and difficult to convince patients to pay for it. Because bloodletting seemed active and dramatic, it helped convince patients the doctor had something tangible to sell.

==Controversy and use into the 20th century==
Bloodletting gradually declined in popularity over the course of the 19th century, becoming rather uncommon in most places, before its validity was thoroughly debated. In the medical community of Edinburgh, bloodletting was abandoned in practice before it was challenged in theory, a contradiction highlighted by physician-physiologist John Hughes Bennett. Authorities such as Austin Flint I, Hiram Corson, and William Osler became prominent supporters of bloodletting in the 1880s and onwards, disputing Bennett&#x27;s premise that bloodletting had fallen into disuse because it did not work. These advocates framed bloodletting as an orthodox medical practice, to be used in spite of its general unpopularity. Some physicians considered bloodletting useful for a more limited range of purposes, such as to &quot;clear out&quot; infected or weakened blood or its ability to &quot;cause hæmorrhages to cease&quot;—as evidenced in a call for a &quot;fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy&quot; in 1871.

Some researchers used statistical methods for evaluating treatment effectiveness to discourage bloodletting. But at the same time, publications by Philip Pye-Smith and others defended bloodletting on scientific grounds.

Bloodletting persisted into the 20th century and was recommended in the 1923 edition of the textbook &quot;The Principles and Practice of Medicine&quot;. The textbook was originally written by Sir William Osler and continued to be published in new editions under new authors following Osler&#x27;s death in 1919.

==Therapeutic phlebotomy==
Therapeutic phlebotomy is used today in the treatment of a few diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia. It is practiced by specifically trained practitioners in hospitals, using modern techniques, and is also known as a therapeutic phlebotomy.
In most cases, phlebotomy now refers to the removal of &quot;small&quot; quantities of blood for diagnostic purposes. However, in the case of hemochromatosis, bloodletting (by venipuncture) has become the mainstay treatment option. In the U.S., according to an academic article posted in the &quot;Journal of Infusion Nursing&quot; with data published in 2010, the primary use of phlebotomy was to take blood that would one day be reinfused back into a person (blood donation).

==In alternative medicine==
Though bloodletting as a general health measure has been shown to be pseudoscience, it is still commonly indicated for a wide variety of conditions in the Ayurvedic, Unani, and traditional Chinese systems of alternative medicine. Unani is based on a form of humorism, and so in that system, bloodletting is used to correct supposed humoral imbalance.

<text>Solaris () is a 1961 science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanisław Lem. It follows a crew of scientists on a space station research facility as they attempt to understand an extraterrestrial intelligence, which takes the form of a vast ocean on the titular alien planet. The novel is one of Lem&#x27;s best-known works.

The book has been adapted many times for film, radio, and theater. Prominent film adaptations include Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s 1972 version and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 2002 version, although Lem later remarked that none of these films reflected the book&#x27;s thematic emphasis on the limitations of human rationality.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Solaris&quot; chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life inhabiting a distant alien planet named Solaris. The planet is almost completely covered with an ocean of gelatinous material that turns out to be a single, planet-encompassing entity. Terran scientists conjecture it is a living and sentient being, and attempt to communicate with it.

Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, arrives aboard Solaris Station, a scientific research station hovering near the oceanic surface of Solaris. The scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for many decades, mostly in vain. A scientific discipline known as Solaristics has degenerated over the years to simply observing, recording and categorizing the complex phenomena that occur on the surface of the ocean. Thus far, the scientists have only compiled an elaborate nomenclature of the phenomena, and do not yet understand what they really mean. Shortly before Kelvin&#x27;s arrival, the crew exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation with a high-energy X-ray bombardment. Their experimentation gives unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as individually flawed humans.

The ocean&#x27;s response to this intrusion exposes the deeper, hidden aspects of the personalities of the human scientists, while revealing nothing of the ocean&#x27;s nature itself. It does this by materializing physical simulacra (including human ones) based on the unpleasant repressed memories of the researchers, who visit the corresponding researchers. Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide, which constitutes a significant part of the plot. The &quot;visitors&quot; of the other persons are only alluded to. 

All efforts to make sense of Solaris&#x27;s activities prove futile. As Lem wrote, &quot;the peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.&quot; Lem also wrote that he deliberately chose to make the sentient alien an ocean to avoid any personification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting first contact.

==Characters==

*The protagonist, Dr. Kris Kelvin, is a psychologist recently arrived from Earth to the space station studying the planet Solaris. He had previously been cohabiting with Harey (&quot;Rheya&quot; in the Kilmartin–Cox translation), who died by suicide when he abandoned their relationship. Her exact double is his visitor aboard the space station and becomes an important character.
*Snaut (&quot;Snow&quot; in the Kilmartin–Cox translation) is the first person Kelvin meets aboard the station, and his visitor is not shown. 
*Gibarian, who had been an instructor of Kelvin&#x27;s at university, killed himself just hours before Kelvin arrives at the station. Gibarian&#x27;s visitor was a &quot;giant Negress&quot; who twice appears to Kelvin; first in a hallway soon after his arrival, and then while he is examining Gibarian&#x27;s cadaver. She seems to be unaware of the other humans she meets, or she simply chooses to ignore them.
*The last inhabitant Kelvin meets is Sartorius, the most reclusive member of the crew. He shows up only intermittently and is suspicious of the other crew members. Kelvin gets a glimpse of a straw hat that may be Sartorius&#x27;s visitor.
*Harey (&quot;Rheya&quot; in the Kilmartin–Cox translation, an anagram of &quot;Harey&quot;), who killed herself with a lethal injection after quarreling with Kelvin, returns as his visitor. Overwhelmed with conflicting emotions after confronting her, Kelvin lures the first Harey visitor into a shuttle and launches it into outer space to be rid of her. Her fate is unknown to the other scientists. Snaut suggests hailing Harey&#x27;s shuttle to learn her condition, but Kelvin objects. Harey soon reappears but with no memory of the shuttle incident. Moreover, the second Harey becomes aware of her transient nature and is haunted by being Solaris&#x27; means-to-an-end, affecting Kelvin in unknown ways. After listening to a tape recording by Gibarian, and so learning her true nature, she attempts suicide by drinking liquid oxygen. This fails because her body is made of neutrinos, stabilized by some unknown force field and has both incredible strength and the ability to quickly regenerate from all injuries. She subsequently convinces Snaut to destroy her with a device developed by Sartorius that disrupts the subatomic structure of the visitors.

==Criticism and interpretations==

The novel is the best known elaboration of Lem&#x27;s trope of the impossibility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, present in many of Lem&#x27;s novels, including his first, &quot;The Man from Mars&quot;, and his last, &quot;Fiasco&quot;.

In an interview, Lem said that the novel &quot;has always been a juicy prey for critics&quot;, with interpretations ranging from that of Freudianism, critique of contact and colonialism, to anticommunism, proponents of the latter view holding that the Ocean represents the Soviet Union and the people on the space station represent the satellite countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He also commented on the absurdity of the book cover blurb for the 1976 edition, which said the novel &quot;expressed the humanistic beliefs of the author about high moral qualities of the human&quot;. Lem noted that the critic who promulgated the Freudian idea actually blundered by basing his psychoanalysis on dialogue from the English translation, whereas his diagnosis would fail on the idioms in the original Polish text.

==English translation==

Both the original Polish version of the novel (published in 1961) and its English translation are titled &quot;Solaris&quot;. Jean-Michel Jasiensko published his French translation in 1964 and that version was the basis of Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox&#x27;s English translation (Walker and Company, 1970; Faber and Faber, 1971). Lem, who read English fluently, repeatedly voiced his disappointment with the Kilmartin–Cox version.

In 2011, Bill Johnston completed an English translation from the Polish. Lem&#x27;s wife and son reviewed this version more favorably: &quot;We are very content with Professor Johnston&#x27;s work, that seems to have captured the spirit of the original.&quot; It was released as an audio book and later in an Amazon Kindle edition (2014, ). Due to legal issues, this translation did not appear in print until 2024, when Conversation Tree Press published a fine press edition of the book.

===Cinema===
&quot;Solaris&quot; has been filmed three times:

* &quot;Solaris&quot; (1968), a Soviet TV play directed by , follows the plot quite closely and keeps the emphasis on the planet rather than the human relationships.
* &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972), a Soviet feature-length film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film loosely follows the novel&#x27;s plot, emphasizing the human relationships instead of Lem&#x27;s astrobiology theories — especially Kelvin&#x27;s life on Earth prior to his space travel to the planet. The film won the Grand Prix at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.
* &quot;Solaris&quot; (2002), an American film directed by Steven Soderbergh, starring George Clooney and produced by James Cameron. This film also emphasizes the human relationships and again excludes Lem&#x27;s scientific and philosophical themes.

Lem himself observed that none of the film versions depict much of the extraordinary physical and psychological &quot;alienness&quot; of the Solaris ocean. Responding to film reviews of Soderbergh&#x27;s version, Lem, noting that he did not see the film, wrote: 
==Cultural allusions and works based on &quot;Solaris&quot;==

<doc id="64200" wikidata="Q1773011" url="?curid=64200" title="Banknotes of the Norwegian krone">
<text>Norwegian banknotes are circulated, in addition to Norwegian coins, with a denomination of Norwegian kroner, as standard units of currency in Norway. From 1877, after the establishment of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, Norwegian banknotes of 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 10 and 5 kroner have been put into circulation. The first 200 kroner banknote was first published in 1994. The others have been in use since 1877. Banknotes of 5 and 10 kroner were in use until 1963 and 1983 when they were replaced by coins.
From 1917 to 1925 and 1940-1950 there was a shortage of small change, and 1 and 2 kroner banknotes were printed as &quot;arbitration coins banknotes.&quot; The first edition was canceled in 1926, while the second edition was formally valid right up to 1999.

==History==
From 1877, after the establishment of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, and until the present day, Norwegian banknotes have included 1000, 500, 100, and 50 kroner notes. In 1994 the first 200 kroner note was issued. 5 and 10 kroner notes were also used from 1877, but these were replaced by coins in 1963 and 1983 respectively.

During World War I and World War II and their aftermaths of 1917–1925 and 1940–1950, there was a shortage of change, so 1  krone and 2  kroner notes were printed as &quot;coin notes&quot;. The World War I edition was rendered invalid in 1926, whereas the World War II edition technically remained legal tender until 1999.

==Current banknotes==
The current design of Series VIII was introduced on 30 May 2017, with plans to be fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2019. The designs are by The Metric System and Snøhetta and use an abstract geometric design influenced by the Beaufort scale.

===Series VIII (2017 – present)===
Series VIII banknotes are printed by Oberthur Fiduciaire in France. Banknote order quantities 
==Historical banknotes==
All Norwegian notes issued since 1877 are listed below in reverse chronological order. The notes have been issued in series starting with series I in 1877 and going on series VII from 1994. As of 2012 only series VII is in circulation, while series VI is convertible at the central bank until 1 November 2012.

The world wars created a great need for cash. In 1917 a law was passed to allow for 1  krone and 2  kroner &quot;coin notes&quot; in response to a pledge from the Bank of Norway to the Ministry of Finance:
:&quot; The board of directors at the Bank of Norway has in writing on the 8th September 1917 informed the Ministry that the shortage of change has now become outright intolerable. One company after another complain that they cannot arrange the agreed salaries for their workers, and the merchants cannot change their customers&#x27; banknotes.&quot;

Subsequently, coin notes were printed until 1925 but were invalidated already in 1926 when the economy had stabilized after World War I. Coin notes of 1  krone and 2  kroner were also printed during World War II (1940−45) and up until 1950. These were not invalidated after the war. However, the complete series II printed 1901−45 was rendered invalid on 9 September 1945 and those who could not readily justify their amount of cash were only given limited compensation in new money. This was done to diminish the impact of war profiteering.

5 kroner and 10 kroner notes were used from 1877 but were replaced by coins in 1963 and 1983, respectively, based on cost-benefit analyses. Apart from the World War I coin notes in 1926 and the series II notes in 1945, all Norwegian banknotes from series I through series V, including 5 kroner and 10 kroner notes, plus the World War II coin notes, were technically valid – i.e. convertible at the Bank of Norway – all the way until 1998 (series I) and 1999 (series III, IV, V, and the World War II coin notes). The 1000 kroner and 500 kroner notes of series V were valid until 2001 and 2002 respectively.

===Series VII (1994-2020)===
;50 kroner note (outdated)

The 50 kroner note (1997) portrays Peter Christen Asbjørnsen (1812–1885), writer and collector of Norwegian folktales. Since 1999 the serial number has been printed with ultraviolet fluorescence. The previous edition (1984), no longer valid, portrays Aasmund Olavsson Vinje (1818–1879), poet, author, and proponent of Nynorsk. This was the first Norwegian banknote featuring the Nynorsk name of Norway, &quot;Noreg&quot; (compare with Bokmål: &quot;Norge&quot;).

The wear and tear on the 50 kroner notes has become so harsh in recent years, possibly from people not regarding them as very valuable any more, so that their maintenance cost is becoming a problem for the Bank of Norway. The 50 kroner note may well be replaced by a 50 kroner coin in the not too distant future.

;100 kroner note (outdated)

The 100 kroner note (1997) portrays Kirsten Flagstad (1895–1962), opera singer and first director of the Norwegian National Opera. In 2003 this note was upgraded with a holographic metal foil stripe. The previous edition (1979), no longer valid, was the first Norwegian banknote featuring a woman: Camilla Collett (1813–1895), author, feminist activist, sister of Henrik Wergeland (author and poet), and daughter of Nicolai Wergeland (priest and co-founder of the Norwegian constitution). Camilla actually replaced her brother on the 100 kroner note, where he had been the motif since 1949.

;200 kroner note (outdated)

After considerable inflation during the 1970s and 1980s, there was need for a denomination between 100 kroner and 1000 kroner in addition to 500 kroner, and so the first Norwegian 200 kroner note was issued in 1994. It portrays Kristian Birkeland (1867–1917), magnetism researcher, inventor, and co-founder of Norsk Hydro. In 2002 this note was upgraded with a holographic metal foil stripe.

The front of the 200 kroner note shows a portrait of Kristian Birkeland against a stylized pattern of the aurora borealis and a very large snowflake. Birkeland&#x27;s terrella experiment, which consisted of a small, magnetized sphere representing the Earth suspended in an evacuated box, is shown on the left. When subjected to an electron beam a glow of light would appear around the magnetic poles of the terrella, simulating the aurora.

The back of the 200 kroner note shows a map of the north polar regions including Scandinavia to the right and northern Canada to the left. A ring encircling the magnetic dip pole (located near Resolute, Canada) symbolizes the location of auroral phenomena including the satellite-determined statistical location of Birkeland currents. Birkeland&#x27;s original depiction of field-aligned currents published in 1908 is shown in the lower right corner.

;500 kroner note (outdated)

The 500 kroner note (1999) portrays Sigrid Undset (1882–1949), author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927. The note features a holographic metal foil stripe and other security measures. The previous edition (1991), no longer valid, portrays Edvard Grieg (1843–1907), world-renowned national romantic composer and pianist.

The use of the 500 kroner note has increased in recent years, especially after it was introduced to automatic teller machines along with the 200 kroner note. Conversely, the 100 kroner note has been partly displaced from ATMs, and its use has decreased.

;1000 kroner note (outdated)

The 1000 kroner note (2001) portrays Edvard Munch (1863–1944), expressionist painter and graphic artist. The note features a holographic metal foil stripe and other security measures. The previous edition (1990), no longer valid, portrays Christian Magnus Falsen (1782–1830), a co-founder of the Norwegian constitution.

The most valuable Norwegian banknote has always been the 1000 kroner note, but its value has been decimated during the years. In 100 years from 1904 to 2004 the value of 1000 kroner has decreased 55−fold, from more than 4000 loaves of bread to less than 70 loaves. (The price of a bread in 2004 was approximately 15 kroner, and the consumer price index in said period increased from 2.0 to 113.3.)

===Series VI (1979–2001)===
===Series V (1962-1985)===
===Series IV (1948-1976)===
===Series III (1945-1955)===
====&quot;Coin notes&quot; (1940-1950)====
===Series II (1901-1945)===
====&quot;Coin notes&quot; (1917-1925)====
===Series I (1877–1901)===

<doc id="64202" wikidata="Q1116640" url="?curid=64202" title="2002 Commonwealth Games">
<text>The 2002 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XVII Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Manchester 2002, were an international multi-sport event for the members of the Commonwealth held in Manchester, England, from 25 July to 4 August 2002. According to planning, this event was to be held in a country in the United Kingdom as part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the Commonwealth. England was the only bidder for the event and, in an internal process, Manchester was selected for the 2002 Games ahead of London. The Manchester bid used projects which were part of the failed bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which were awarded to Sydney, Australia. The 2002 Commonwealth Games was, prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the UK, eclipsing the London 1948 Summer Olympics in terms of teams and athletes participating. The 2002 Commonwealth Games had the largest number of events of any Commonwealth Games in history, featuring 281 events across 17 sports.

The event was considered a success for the host city, providing an opportunity to display how Manchester reeinvented itself as city, following the 1996 IRA bombings. The Games formed the main catalyst for the widespread regeneration and heavy development of Manchester and bolstered its reputation as a European and global city internationally. Rapid economic development and continued urban regeneration of the now post-industrial Manchester continued after the Games, which helped cement its place as one of the principal cultural cities in the United Kingdom.

The opening and closing ceremonies, the athletics, and the rugby sevens events were held at the City of Manchester Stadium, which was purpose-built for the Games. Unusually for a Commonwealth Games, the only sport that was held outside the host city was shooting, which was held in the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey, some from Manchester. Seventy-two associations competed in 14 individual sports and 3 team sports events.

Sporting legacy includes the British Cycling team, which inherited the Manchester Velodrome and went on to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympics and another eight gold medals at the 2012 Olympics, partly attributed to the availability of the velodrome. The stadium was leased long-term to Manchester City F.C., and, as a result, they have since found themselves in a desirable investment opportunity in the age of foreign football investment. The club was taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group led by Sheikh Mansour in 2008, a takeover that would have been far less certain without the stadium. The Games were a formative moment for Manchester and Britain, with then-IOC president Jacques Rogge viewing the games as an important litmus test as to whether Britain could host the Summer Olympics. The success of the Games quickly encouraged some speculation of a city bid for the Olympics, but London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, with London going on to win the bid on 6 July 2005 and the games were successfully staged seven years later.

== Host city selection ==

When England decided to bid for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, three English cities – London, Manchester and Sheffield -showed interest in hosting the Games. The Commonwealth Games Council of England (CGCE) had to choose one city to put forward to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). London had hosted the 1934 Commonwealth Games as well as the 1908 and 1948 Summer Olympics, while Sheffield had hosted the 1991 Summer Universiade. Manchester had unsuccessfully bid for the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and Bob Scott, chairman of the Olympic bid committees, led the bid for another big event.

Sheffield withdrew from the bidding process when the city was unable to come to agreement over financial guarantees. This left the 24 members of the CGCE to choose between Manchester and London, with Manchester winning 17–7. Cities from no other countries submitted bids and so Manchester was announced as the host city of the 2002 Games on 6 November 1995.
== Preparation and development ==
=== Venues ===


The Games&#x27; main venue was the City of Manchester Stadium (now Etihad Stadium), which hosted all athletics events, the rugby sevens and the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium was a smaller and downscaled version of that proposed during Manchester&#x27;s bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Construction started in January 2000, and was completed shortly before the Games. The cost was approximately £110 million, £77 million of which was provided by Sport England, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games the stadium featured a single lower tier running around three sides of the athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at one end, giving an overall capacity of 41,000. The stadium formed the centrepiece of an area known as Sportcity. Other venues in Sportcity include the Manchester Velodrome, which hosted cycling, and the £3.5 million National Squash Centre, which was built specifically for the Games.

Swimming and diving events took place at Manchester Aquatics Centre, another purpose-built venue, and until 2012,was the only one in the United Kingdom with two 50 metre pools.

The Manchester Arena built in 1994, at the time was the largest arena in Europe hosted netball finals and boxing preliminares.

The shooting events were held at the National Shooting Centre (NSC), Bisley (located in Surrey). The NSC saw major redevelopment of all its ranges in order to host the fullbore rifle, smallbore rifle, pistol and clay target events.

=== Athletes&#x27; village ===
The athletes&#x27; village of the event was located in the residential area of the University of Manchester Fallowfield Campus -in an area of 30 acres, being built specifically for the event and after the event, the buildings were donated to the university and turned an expansion of the housing complex.

=== Queen&#x27;s jubilee baton relay ===

The 2002 Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Baton Relay, the continuation of a tradition that started with the 1958 Games, consisted of the relay of an electronic baton, containing a personal message from Elizabeth II across 23 Commonwealth nations. The relay culminated in the arrival of the baton at the City of Manchester Stadium, opening the Games. The speech was then removed electronically from the baton, and read by Her Majesty to open the Games.

The 2002 Baton itself was designed by a company called IDEO, and was constructed of machined aluminium with the handle plated for conductivity. It weighed 1.69 kg, reached over 710 mm, and was 42.5 mm to 85 mm in diameter. The Queen&#x27;s message itself was held in an aluminium capsule inserted into the top of the Baton. On either side of the Baton were two sterling silver coins, designed by Mappin and Webb, which celebrated the City of Manchester as host of the XVII Commonwealth Games.

The Baton was also equipped with sensors that detected and monitored the Runner&#x27;s pulse rate. This information was then conveyed to a series of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), via a light behaviour module. The lens then transformed the LEDs into a shaft of bright blue pulsating light which synchronised with each new Runner. The hearts of the Runner and the Baton then beat as one until it was passed on, symbolising the journey of humanity and the essence of life.

The Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Baton Relay passed through over 500 cities, towns and villages across the UK and the Baton was carried by 5,000 individuals, with each Runner carrying the Baton up to 500 yards, however on Saturday 15 June, the baton was snatched from a runners hand in the town of Connah&#x27;s Quay, Deeside in north Wales.

The UK Baton Runners were made up of people from all walks of life including athletes, celebrities and local heroes from all over the country. Around 2500 Jubilee Runners were nominated by the community to carry the Baton, because they made a special contribution to their community or achieved a personal goal against the odds.

The judging of the Jubilee Runners was conducted by a panel of judges under the supervision of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award in January 2002. The relay was sponsored by Cadbury Schweppes, a major UK confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer.

=== Budget ===
The cost of hosting the 2002 Commonwealth Games was estimated at £300 million. Prior to the games, a £100 million was required to fill a financial black hole and the government agreed to provide the funding required, despite some believing that £300 million was too much.

=== Cultureshock and Festival Live ===

Cultureshock was the Commonwealth Games Cultural Programme which ran alongside the Games themselves. The events ranged from images of the athlete as hero in sculpture and photography (Go! Freeze, which ran at Turton Tower in Bolton) to a Zulu performance at The Lowry. There was an exhibition at the Whitworth Art Gallery called Tales of Power: West African Textiles, and a performance of the film Monsoon Wedding at Clwyd Theatr Cymru. The geographical range was from Cheshire in the south to Blackburn and Cumbria in the north, and included that year the various Melas that take place around the region.

Cultureshock also ensured that a wide range of cultural events and acts reached the &quot;man on the street&quot;, with the city centre of Manchester filled with bands, performers, and artists of various forms entertaining the thousands of visitors to the Games. It also coincided with the BBC&#x27;s 2002 Festival Live series of open-air concerts and celebrations around the country, held to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Many of the cultural events were covered by the BBC 2002 radio station covering the games.

=== Opening ceremony ===

The Project &amp; Artistic Director for the Opening Ceremony was David Zolkwer. Five-time Olympic champion Sir Steve Redgrave opened the two-and-a-quarter-hour opening ceremony by banging a large drum, which initiated a co-ordinated dance and fireworks act. The champion rower was joined on the stage by sporting stars including yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur, heptathlete Denise Lewis, long-distance runner Moses Kiptanui, swimmer Susie O&#x27;Neill and sprinter Donovan Bailey. The Grenadier Guards shared the arena with pop band S Club and Salford-born opera singer Russell Watson sang the Games&#x27; theme, &quot;Faith of the Heart&quot;, while the arrival of HM The Queen was greeted with a flypast by the Red Arrows. England football captain David Beckham helped chaperone Queen&#x27;s Baton final runner Kirsty Howard, assisting the terminally ill six-year-old to hand the baton to The Queen. A 4,000-strong cast took part in the £12 million spectacular, which in theme and tone consisted of a mix of &quot;pomp and pop&quot;, combining the ceremonial aspects of the Games with a party-style atmosphere, based on Manchester&#x27;s reputation as the party city of &quot;Madchester&quot;. The ceremony was voiced by broadcaster Anthony Davis.
The traditional athletes&#x27; parade was led by previous hosts Malaysia, and England brought up the rear before The Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth, declared the Games open:

&quot;All of us participating in this ceremony tonight, whether athletes or spectators, or those watching on television around the world, can share in the ideals of this unique association of nations,&quot;

&quot;We can all draw inspiration from what the Commonwealth stands for, our diversity as a source of strength, our tradition of tolerance ... our focus on young people, for they are our future.&quot;

&quot;It is my pleasure in this my Golden Jubilee Year to declare the 17th Commonwealth Games open.&quot;

=== Closing ceremony ===
The Project &amp; Artistic Director for the Closing Ceremony was David Zolkwer. The Queen ended 11 days of competition at a rain-drenched closing ceremony in the City of Manchester Stadium. She declared the Games closed in front of a sell-out crowd gathered in the stadium. She also called on the athletes to assemble again in four years in Melbourne and to continue displaying the &quot;friendship&quot; they had shown in Manchester. The ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair and several other dignitaries, took place in pouring rain and like the opening ceremony, mixed &quot;pomp with pop&quot;. Australian Ian Thorpe, the star of the Games with his six swimming golds, carried his national flag into the arena, along with athletes from each of the other competing countries. Around balloons were released into the rainy Manchester sky as the ceremony concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.

Closing ceremony highlights included:

*Children covering themselves with red, blue and white paint to portray a giant British flag before unveiling a giant portrait of The Queen as a Golden Jubilee gift.
*The athletes bringing their national flags into the stadium
*South African swimmer Natalie du Toit being honoured as the outstanding athlete of the Games.
*The symbolic handover of the Commonwealth Games Ceremonial Flag to Melbourne, host city for the 2006 Games.
*A spectacular presentation with over lanterns, which ended with the message &#x27;Seek Peace&#x27; lit up in vast letters on the floor of the arena.
*Coronation Street stars Steve Arnold and Tracy Shaw (who played characters Ashley and Maxine Peacock) arriving in one of 40 Morris Minors which became the centre of a song-and-dance showpiece.
*Hip-hop DJ Grandmaster Flash encouraging the massed ranks to &quot;make some noise&quot; as athletes and volunteers poured into the arena to music from the likes of Will Young, Dave Stewart, Heather Small, Jimmy Cliff and Toploader.
*Australian singer Vanessa Amorosi sang her signature tune, &quot;Shine&quot; and a song about the city of Melbourne, &quot;I&#x27;ll always be a Melbourne girl&quot; just as it began to pour with rain.

== Participating teams ==
There were 73 participating countries, territories and Commonwealth regions at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The 2002 event marked the last time Zimbabwe has participated to date; Zimbabwe formally withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations the following year.


== Calendar ==

== Sports ==

There were the maximum of 17 sports included in the schedule for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.
After experimenting with it on a smaller scale at the 1994 Commonwealth Games and dropping it at the 1998 Games, disabled competitions were held in swimming, athletics, bowls, table tennis and weightlifting (powerlifting). The medals were added to the final tally for each nation.

== Highlights ==
* Australian Ian Thorpe set a world record in the 400-metre freestyle swimming.
* English swimmer Zoë Baker set a world record in the 50-metre breaststroke.
* English track athlete Paula Radcliffe won her first major gold medal in the 5,000 metres, to record a time of 14:31.42, over 20 seconds ahead of silver medallist Edith Masai of Kenya and 1 minute 21 seconds faster than the inaugural running of the event four years earlier.
* In the final of the 100 m for men (athletics), the two English favourites (Dwain Chambers &amp; Mark Lewis-Francis) both pulled up with injuries. The race was won by Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis, winning the country&#x27;s first Commonwealth title.
*Simon Whitfield of Canada, the 2000 Olympic champion and the 2008 Olympic silver medallist, won gold in the triathlon.
* On the last day of track competition, England won gold in both the men&#x27;s 4×100 and 4×400 relays by tiny margins, recording the same time (38.62) as the Jamaican quartet in sprint relay and holding off a fast finishing Welsh team by 1/100 of a second in the longer race, with a winning time of 3:00.40.
* The women&#x27;s 4×400 relay was won by Australia after the favoured Jamaican team dropped the baton.
* In winning the triple jump England&#x27;s Jonathan Edwards simultaneously held the World, Olympic, European and Commonwealth championships and the World record. He would lose the European title a week later in Munich.
* Another world record was set in the 4000-metre team pursuit at the track cycling by the Australian team. Scot Chris Hoy took the individual time trial and 19-year-old Nicole Cooke of Wales won the women&#x27;s cycling road race.
* South African swimmer Natalie du Toit created history. As well as winning her events in the newly included disabled swimming event, the 18-year-old, missing the lower section of her left leg, made the final of the 800-metre able-bodied freestyle event in one of a small number of disabled sporting events integrated into the games.
*In gymnastics England&#x27;s Beth Tweddle and Kanukai Jackson took gold in the asymmetric bars and all around events respectively. Herodotos Giorgallas also won the first gymnastics gold ever for Cyprus when tying with Scotland&#x27;s Steve Frew.
*The host broadcaster of the games was the BBC and the International Broadcast Centre was located at the Manchester College of Arts and Technology.

== Legacy host city and nation ==
In terms of infrastructure, the Games were the catalyst for the widespread redevelopment of the east of the city, an area which had remained derelict since the departure of heavy industry some decades before. The 2002 Commonwealth Games set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy.

The venue and financial policy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games has influenced future sporting events, including the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

In comparison to other sporting events, the 2002 games were marked by financial discipline. The cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games were estimated at $4.1 billion, the London 2012 Summer Olympics are estimated to cost £9 billion, while the 2014 Commonwealth Games could cost as much as £500 million.

Sporting legacy included the City of Manchester Stadium which was turned over to Manchester City Football Club, to replace the ageing Maine Road. It is possible that this provided an incentive which led to the eventual 2008 take over by the Abu Dhabi United group led by Sheikh Mansour. Consequently, they have seen a considerable upturn in their success, with a series of transfers which has increased the profile of Manchester further, as Manchester City have become title challengers. Indeed, journalists have stated Mansour would not had bought the city had the club not had the 50,000 stadium. The Manchester Velodrome was built in 1994 in preparation for an Olympic bid, but subsequently hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Since opening in 1994, it has been cited as a catalyst for Britain&#x27;s successes in track cycling since 2002. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the Great British cycling claimed 8 of the 18 gold medals on offer, including 14 of the 54 medals available altogether. This unprecedented achievement was partly attributed the availability of a velodrome.

Local communities benefited from facilities built for the game such as the Manchester Aquatics Centre, the Northern Regional Tennis Centre and the National Squash Centre. There were comprehensive upgrades of Belle Vue and Moss Side leisure centres serve their local communities.

Olympic president Jacques Rogge said the Games had gone a long way to restoring Britain&#x27;s credibility in terms of hosting big sporting events. It has since been said that the success of the games was a major factor in reassuring the UK&#x27;s sporting authorities and the government that the country could successfully stage major successful international sporting events and that, without them, London&#x27;s successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would not have come about. Public houses and restaurants in Manchester reported a threefold increase in takings during the Games, and local tourism board Marketing Manchester estimate some more visitors will come to the city each year as a result of its increased profile. It is estimated that by 2008 £600m has been invested in the region as a result of the Games and that about 20,000 jobs had been created.

=== Logo ===

The 2002 Commonwealth Games&#x27; logo is an image of three figures standing on a podium with their arms uplifted in the jubilation of winning or in celebration, which represents the three core themes of the Games: sport, culture and friendship and the types of medalist in the games: gold, silver and bronze. The figures are captured in three colours which are red, blue and green. The red represents performance, passion and success; the blue symbolises intelligence, confidence and reliability, while the green represents loyalty, balance and generosity. The yellow background behind the figures represents the competitive, powerful and cheerful elements of the Games, while the black games&#x27; name letters representing solidarity and strength. The figures in the logo joining hands to resemble the letter &#x27;M&#x27;, which is the initial for the host city, Manchester and also a crown of the queen to represent the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign as the monarch of The United Kingdom. The logo overall represents a celebration of sharing and friendship and the pride of participating in the Games, cheerful atmosphere, sportsmanship and confidence of Manchester as the games host city. The bid logo consisted of the number &quot;22&quot; and the letter &quot;M&quot; making up a smiley face.

=== Mascot ===
The official mascot of the 2002 Commonwealth Games is a cat named Kit. The adoption of the cat as the games&#x27; mascot is to represent the young, vibrant, friendly, dynamic personality of Manchester as the games&#x27; host city.

=== Sponsors ===
Numerous companies ranging from international to local, sponsored the 2002 Games. International sponsors included Microsoft and Xerox and also companies with local links to Manchester including Guardian Media Group, PZ Cussons and United Utilities.

<text>Zaragoza () also known in English as Saragossa ( ), is the capital city of the province of Zaragoza and of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the Gállego, roughly in the centre of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.

On 1 January 2021, the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 675,301, (as of 2023, the fourth or fifth most populous in Spain) on a land area of . It is the 26th most populous municipality in the European Union. The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population. The city lies at an elevation of about above sea level.

Zaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of 2008, a world&#x27;s fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.

The city is famous for its folklore, local cuisine, and landmarks such as the Basílica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafería Palace. Together with La Seo and the Aljafería, several other buildings form part of the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The &quot;Fiestas del Pilar&quot; are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.

==Etymology==
The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called &quot;Salduie&quot; or &quot;&quot;. The Romans and Greeks called the ancient city (in Greek , ), from which derive the Arabic name (used during the Al-Andalus period), the medieval , and the modern &quot;Zaragoza&quot;.

==History==
The Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called ( in Roman sources).

===Roman Caesaraugusta===

Augustus founded the city as &quot;Caesaraugusta&quot; between 25 BC and 11 BC as a colony to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. As a Roman city, it had all the typical public buildings: forum, baths, theatre, and was an important economic centre. Many Roman ruins can still be seen in Zaragoza today.

It is thought it might have been the Apostle James who had built a chapel on the site of the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar.

On the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred on Valerian&#x27;s orders was the Church of Santa Engracia de Zaragoza. Only the crypt and the doorway survived the Peninsular War. Around the early 20th century it was rebuilt, and is now a functioning parish church.

=== Middle Ages ===
Despite the general decline of the last centuries of the Roman empire, Zaragoza suffered little. Capture by the Goths in the fifth century AD was without significant bloodshed or destruction.

In the eighth century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.

In 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Zaragoza became an independent Taifa of Zaragoza, initially controlled by the Tujibid family, then ruled by the Banu Hud from 1039. The taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, and being later governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu&#x27;taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta&#x27;in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.

On 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. The aforementioned monarch created a jurisdictional dominion in the city, which was gifted to Gaston of Béarn. The city remained a lordship up until the early 13th century.

There was a Jewish community in medieval Zaragoza, a notable center where &quot;yeshivas&quot; also incorporated the study of philosophy alongside Talmud studies.

===Early modern history===
An outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25–30,000.

In the context of the 1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed &quot;King of Aragon&quot; in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the &quot;Austracist&quot; forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orléans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.

An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called , named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafería.

===Late Modern history===

Zaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.

Railway transport came to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 with the inauguration of the Barcelona–Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estación del Norte. The Madrid–Zaragoza line was opened a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.

The July 1936 coup d&#x27;état (with Gen. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. , , , Major Cebollero and Gen. at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. After the military uprising in Africa on 17 July, the military command easily attained its objectives in Zaragoza in the early morning of 19 July, despite the city&#x27;s status as stronghold of organised labour (mostly CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, fled to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.


The rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go &quot;in crescendo&quot; along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-à-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.

The General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by José Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.

The 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US–Spain air base in Zaragoza.

Following the declaration of Zaragoza as (&quot;Pole for Industrial Development&quot;) by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.

In 1979, a fire at the Hotel Corona de Aragón fire killed at least 80 people, including members of the family of Francisco Franco. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.

Since 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Zaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.

The city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.

The municipality has a surface of , making it the ninth largest municipality in Spain.

While the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600–750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, , in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.

The Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the Gállego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.

===Climate===
Zaragoza has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April–May) and autumn (September–November), with a relative drought in summer (July–August) and winter (December–March).

Temperatures in summer are hot, and in winter a cold and dry wind blows from the northwest, the &quot;Cierzo&quot;. Night frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. Fog can be persistent in late autumn and early winter.

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
Zaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:








==Demographics==


=== Religion ===
According to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0% of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0% as practising Catholic, 6.7% as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0% as agnostic, 4.3% as atheist and 2.3% as &quot;other religions&quot;, while a 6.7% did not answer.

=== Immigration ===
In 2017, there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).

==Economy==
An Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA. 

The city&#x27;s economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World&#x27;s Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, (PLAZA), and the (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.

Zaragoza is home to a Spanish Air and Space Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1992. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135s) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, &quot;Academia General Militar&quot;, a number of brigades at &quot;San Gregorio&quot;, and other garrisons.

==Culture==
Christianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called &quot;Nuestra Señora del Pilar&quot; (&#x27;Our Lady of the Pillar&#x27;).

The Aragonese language, in decline for centuries and restricted mostly to northern Aragon, has recently attracted more people in the region. Thus, nowadays, in Zaragoza, up to 7,000 people speak Aragonese.

=== Festivals ===

The annual &quot;Fiestas del Pilar&quot; lasts for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. This date also coincides with Spain&#x27;s national holiday, El Día de la Hispanidad (Day of Hispanicity), which celebrates Spain&#x27;s cultural and historical ties with Hispanic America.

<doc id="64204" wikidata="Q200286" url="?curid=64204" title="Kinetic theory of gases">
<text>The kinetic theory of gases is a simple classical model of the thermodynamic behavior of gases. Its introduction allowed many principal concepts of thermodynamics to be established. It treats a gas as composed of numerous particles, too small to be seen with a microscope, in constant, random motion. These particles are now known to be the atoms or molecules of the gas. The kinetic theory of gases uses their collisions with each other and with the walls of their container to explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as transport properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity.

The basic version of the model describes an ideal gas. It treats the collisions as perfectly elastic and as the only interaction between the particles, which are additionally assumed to be much smaller than their average distance apart.

Due to the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility), the kinetic theory is also connected to the principle of detailed balance, in terms of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (for Brownian motion) and the Onsager reciprocal relations.

The theory was historically significant as the first explicit exercise of the ideas of statistical mechanics.

== History ==
=== Kinetic theory of matter ===

==== Antiquity ====
In about 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other. This Epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries, when Aristotlean ideas were dominant.

==== Modern era ====

===== &quot;Heat is motion&quot; =====

One of the first and boldest statements on the relationship between motion of particles and heat was by the English philosopher Francis Bacon in 1620. &quot;It must not be thought that heat generates motion, or motion heat (though in some respects this be true), but that the very essence of heat ... is motion and nothing else.&quot; &quot;not a ... motion of the whole, but of the small particles of the body.&quot; In 1623, in &quot;The Assayer&quot;, Galileo Galilei, in turn, argued that heat, pressure, smell and other phenomena perceived by our senses are apparent properties only, caused by the movement of particles, which is a real phenomenon.

In 1665, in &quot;Micrographia&quot;, the English polymath Robert Hooke repeated Bacon&#x27;s assertion, and in 1675, his colleague, Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle noted that a hammer&#x27;s &quot;impulse&quot; is transformed into the motion of a nail&#x27;s constituent particles, and that this type of motion is what heat consists of. Boyle also believed that all macroscopic properties, including color, taste and elasticity, are caused by and ultimately consist of nothing but the arrangement and motion of indivisible particles of matter. In a lecture of 1681, Hooke asserted a direct relationship between the temperature of an object and the speed of its internal particles. &quot;Heat ... is nothing but the internal Motion of the Particles of [a] Body; and the hotter a Body is, the more violently are the Particles moved.&quot; In a manuscript published 1720, the English philosopher John Locke made a very similar statement: &quot;What in our sensation is &quot;heat&quot;, in the object is nothing but &quot;motion&quot;.&quot; Locke too talked about the motion of the internal particles of the object, which he referred to as its &quot;insensible parts&quot;.
In his 1744 paper &quot;Meditations on the Cause of Heat and Cold&quot;, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov made a relatable appeal to everyday experience to gain acceptance of the microscopic and kinetic nature of matter and heat:Lomonosov also insisted that movement of particles is necessary for the processes of dissolution, extraction and diffusion, providing as examples the dissolution and diffusion of salts by the action of water particles on the of the “molecules of salt”, the dissolution of metals in mercury, and the extraction of plant pigments by alcohol.

Also the transfer of heat was explained by the motion of particles. Around 1760, Scottish physicist and chemist Joseph Black wrote: &quot;Many have supposed that heat is a tremulous ... motion of the particles of matter, which ... motion they imagined to be communicated from one body to another.&quot;

=== Kinetic theory of gases ===

In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli published &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot;, which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the pressure of the gas, and that their average kinetic energy determines the temperature of the gas. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.

Pioneers of the kinetic theory, whose work was also largely neglected by their contemporaries, were Mikhail Lomonosov (1747), Georges-Louis Le Sage (ca. 1780, published 1818), John Herapath (1816) and John James Waterston (1843), which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation.

In 1856 August Krönig created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles. In 1857 Rudolf Clausius developed a similar, but more sophisticated version of the theory, which included translational and, contrary to Krönig, also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle. In 1859, after reading a paper about the diffusion of molecules by Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. In his 1873 thirteen page article &#x27;Molecules&#x27;, Maxwell states: &quot;we are told that an &#x27;atom&#x27; is a material point, invested and surrounded by &#x27;potential forces&#x27; and that when &#x27;flying molecules&#x27; strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases.&quot;
In 1871, Ludwig Boltzmann generalized Maxwell&#x27;s achievement and formulated the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was also first stated by Boltzmann.

At the beginning of the 20th century, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was Albert Einstein&#x27;s (1905) and Marian Smoluchowski&#x27;s (1906) papers on Brownian motion, which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.

Following the development of the Boltzmann equation, a framework for its use in developing transport equations was developed independently by David Enskog and Sydney Chapman in 1917 and 1916. The framework provided a route to prediction of the transport properties of dilute gases, and became known as Chapman–Enskog theory. The framework was gradually expanded throughout the following century, eventually becoming a route to prediction of transport properties in real, dense gases.

== Assumptions ==
The application of kinetic theory to ideal gases makes the following assumptions:
* The gas consists of very small particles. This smallness of their size is such that the sum of the volume of the individual gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container of the gas. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size, and that the elapsed time during a collision between particles and the container&#x27;s wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.
* The number of particles is so large that a statistical treatment of the problem is well justified. This assumption is sometimes referred to as the thermodynamic limit.
* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container, and all these collisions are perfectly elastic.
* Interactions (i.e. collisions) between particles are strictly binary and uncorrelated, meaning that there are no three-body (or higher) interactions, and the particles have no memory.
* Except during collisions, the interactions among molecules are negligible. They exert no other forces on one another.

Thus, the dynamics of particle motion can be treated classically, and the equations of motion are time-reversible.

As a simplifying assumption, the particles are usually assumed to have the same mass as one another; however, the theory can be generalized to a mass distribution, with each mass type contributing to the gas properties independently of one another in agreement with Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressures. Many of the model&#x27;s predictions are the same whether or not collisions between particles are included, so they are often neglected as a simplifying assumption in derivations (see below).

More modern developments, such as the revised Enskog theory and the extended Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model, relax one or more of the above assumptions. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, and gases with internal degrees of freedom, because they include the volume of the particles as well as contributions from intermolecular and intramolecular forces as well as quantized molecular rotations, quantum rotational-vibrational symmetry effects, and electronic excitation. While theories relaxing the assumptions that the gas particles occupy negligible volume and that collisions are strictly elastic have been successful, it has been shown that relaxing the requirement of interactions being binary and uncorrelated will eventually lead to divergent results.

== Equilibrium properties ==
=== Pressure and kinetic energy ===

In the kinetic theory of gases, the pressure is assumed to be equal to the force (per unit area) exerted by the individual gas atoms or molecules hitting and rebounding from the gas container&#x27;s surface.

Consider a gas particle traveling at velocity, formula_1, along the formula_2-direction in an enclosed volume with characteristic length, formula_3, cross-sectional area, formula_4, and volume, formula_5. The gas particle encounters a boundary after characteristic time
formula_6

The momentum of the gas particle can then be described as
formula_7

We combine the above with Newton&#x27;s second law, which states that the force experienced by a particle is related to the time rate of change of its momentum, such that
formula_8

Now consider a large number, formula_9, of gas particles with random orientation in a three-dimensional volume. Because the orientation is random, the average particle speed, formula_10, in every direction is identical
formula_11

Further, assume that the volume is symmetrical about its three dimensions, formula_12, such that
formula_13
formula_14
formula_15
The total surface area on which the gas particles act is therefore
formula_16

The pressure exerted by the collisions of the formula_9 gas particles with the surface can then be found by adding the force contribution of every particle and dividing by the interior surface area of the volume,
formula_18
formula_19

The total translational kinetic energy formula_20 of the gas is defined as
formula_21
providing the result
formula_22

This is an important, non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a macroscopic property, to the translational kinetic energy of the molecules, which is a microscopic property.

The mass density of a gas formula_23 is expressed through the total mass of gas particles and through volume of this gas: formula_24. Taking this into account, the pressure is equal to
:formula_25

Relativistic expression for this formula is 

: formula_26,
where formula_27 is speed of light. In the limit of small speeds, the expression becomes formula_28.

=== Temperature and kinetic energy ===
Rewriting the above result for the pressure as formula_29, we may combine it with the ideal gas law

where formula_30 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_31 is the absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain
formula_32
which leads to a simplified expression of the average translational kinetic energy per molecule,
formula_33
The translational kinetic energy of the system is formula_9 times that of a molecule, namely formula_35. The temperature, formula_31 is related to the translational kinetic energy by the description above, resulting in

which becomes
{N k_\mathrm{B} }. &lt;/math&gt;|}}
Equation () is one important result of the kinetic theory:
&quot;The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law&#x27;s absolute temperature&quot;.
From equations () and (), we have

Thus, the product of pressure and volume per mole is proportional to the average
translational molecular kinetic energy.

Equations () and () are called the &quot;classical results&quot;, which could also be derived from statistical mechanics;
for more details, see:

The equipartition theorem requires that kinetic energy is partitioned equally between all kinetic degrees of freedom, &quot;D&quot;. A monatomic gas is axially symmetric about each spatial axis, so that &quot;D&quot; = 3 comprising translational motion along each axis. A diatomic gas is axially symmetric about only one axis, so that &quot;D&quot; = 5, comprising translational motion along three axes and rotational motion along two axes. A polyatomic gas, like water, is not radially symmetric about any axis, resulting in &quot;D&quot; = 6, comprising 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.

Because the equipartition theorem requires that kinetic energy is partitioned equally, the total kinetic energy is
formula_37

Thus, the energy added to the system per gas particle kinetic degree of freedom is
formula_38

Therefore, the kinetic energy per kelvin of one mole of monatomic ideal gas (&quot;D&quot; = 3) is
formula_39
where formula_40 is the Avogadro constant, and &quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant.

Thus, the ratio of the kinetic energy to the absolute temperature of an ideal monatomic gas can be calculated easily:
* per mole: 12.47 J/K
* per molecule: 20.7 yJ/K = 129 μeV/K

At standard temperature (273.15 K), the kinetic energy can also be obtained:
* per mole: 3406 J
* per molecule: 5.65 zJ = 35.2 meV.

At higher temperatures (typically thousands of kelvins), vibrational modes become active to provide additional degrees of freedom, creating a temperature-dependence on &quot;D&quot; and the total molecular energy. Quantum statistical mechanics is needed to accurately compute these contributions.

=== Collisions with container wall ===
For an ideal gas in equilibrium, the rate of collisions with the container wall and velocity distribution of particles hitting the container wall can be calculated based on naive kinetic theory, and the results can be used for analyzing effusive flow rates, which is useful in applications such as the gaseous diffusion method for isotope separation.

Assume that in the container, the number density (number per unit volume) is formula_41 and that the particles obey Maxwell&#x27;s velocity distribution:
formula_42

Then for a small area formula_43 on the container wall, a particle with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal of the area formula_43, will collide with the area within time interval formula_47, if it is within the distance formula_48 from the area formula_43. Therefore, all the particles with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal that can reach area formula_43 within time interval formula_47 are contained in the tilted pipe with a height of formula_54 and a volume of formula_55.

The total number of particles that reach area formula_43 within time interval formula_47 also depends on the velocity distribution; All in all, it calculates to be:formula_58

Integrating this over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_59, formula_60, formula_61 yields the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time:
formula_62

This quantity is also known as the &quot;impingement rate&quot; in vacuum physics. Note that to calculate the average speed formula_63 of the Maxwell&#x27;s velocity distribution, one has to integrate over formula_64, formula_65, formula_61.

The momentum transfer to the container wall from particles hitting the area formula_43 with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal, in time interval formula_47 is:
formula_71
Integrating this over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_59, formula_60, formula_61 yields the pressure (consistent with Ideal gas law):
formula_75
If this small area formula_76 is punched to become a small hole, the effusive flow rate will be:
formula_77

Combined with the ideal gas law, this yields
formula_78

The above expression is consistent with Graham&#x27;s law.

To calculate the velocity distribution of particles hitting this small area, we must take into account that all the particles with formula_79 that hit the area formula_43 within the time interval formula_47 are contained in the tilted pipe with a height of formula_82 and a volume of formula_83; Therefore, compared to the Maxwell distribution, the velocity distribution will have an extra factor of formula_84:
formula_85
with the constraint formula_86, formula_60, formula_61. The constant formula_89 can be determined by the normalization condition formula_90 to be formula_91, and overall:
formula_92

=== Speed of molecules ===
From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that
formula_93
formula_94
formula_95
where &quot;v&quot; is in m/s, &quot;T&quot; is in kelvin, and &quot;m&quot; is the mass of one molecule of gas in kg. The most probable (or mode) speed formula_96 is 81.6% of the root-mean-square speed formula_97, and the mean (arithmetic mean, or average) speed formula_63 is 92.1% of the rms speed (isotropic distribution of speeds).

See:
* Average,
* Root-mean-square speed
* Arithmetic mean
* Mean
* Mode (statistics)

=== Mean free path ===

In kinetic theory of gases, the mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision. Let formula_99 be the collision cross section of one molecule colliding with another. As in the previous section, the number density formula_100 is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume, or formula_101. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is formula_102, and it is related to the mean free path formula_103 byformula_104

Notice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume formula_102 is reciprocal of length.

== Transport properties ==
The kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means using Kinetic Theory to consider what are known as &quot;transport properties&quot;, such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, mass diffusivity and thermal diffusion.

In its most basic form, Kinetic gas theory is only applicable to dilute gases. The extension of Kinetic gas theory to dense gas mixtures, Revised Enskog Theory, was developed in 1983-1987 by E. G. D. Cohen, J. M. Kincaid and M. Lòpez de Haro, building on work by H. van Beijeren and M. H. Ernst.

=== Viscosity and kinetic momentum ===
In books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that are used in many fields. Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a Couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force &quot;F&quot;. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component formula_106 which increase uniformly with distance formula_107 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.

Inside a dilute gas in a Couette flow setup, let formula_108 be the forward velocity of the gas at a horizontal flat layer (labeled as formula_109); formula_108 is along the horizontal direction. The number of molecules arriving at the area formula_43 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal, in time interval formula_47 is
formula_115

These molecules made their last collision at formula_116, where formula_103 is the mean free path. Each molecule will contribute a forward momentum of
formula_118
where plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the forward velocity gradient formula_119 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.

Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_59, formula_60, formula_61 yields the forward momentum transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as shear stress):
formula_123

The net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus
formula_124

Combining the above kinetic equation with Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity
formula_125
gives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted formula_126 when it is a dilute gas:
formula_127

Combining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives
formula_128

Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as
formula_129
where formula_130 is the most probable speed. We note that
formula_131

and insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation (with formula_132 subsequently estimated below) for shear viscosity for dilute gases:
formula_133
and formula_134 is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the transport of momentum through the gas due to the translational motion of molecules is much larger than the transport due to momentum being transferred between molecules during collisions. The transfer of momentum between molecules is explicitly accounted for in Revised Enskog theory, which relaxes the requirement of a gas being dilute. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by
formula_135

The radius formula_136 is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter formula_137 is called collision cross section diameter or kinetic diameter of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. The radius for zero Lennard-Jones potential may then be used as a rough estimate for the kinetic radius. However, using this estimate will typically lead to an erroneous temperature dependency of the viscosity. For such interaction potentials, significantly more accurate results are obtained by numerical evaluation of the required collision integrals.

The expression for viscosity obtained from Revised Enskog Theory reduces to the above expression in the limit of infinite dilution, and can be written as
formula_138
where formula_139 is a term that tends to zero in the limit of infinite dilution that accounts for excluded volume, and formula_140 is a term accounting for the transfer of momentum over a non-zero distance between particles during a collision.

=== Thermal conductivity and heat flux ===

Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for thermal conductivity of a dilute gas:

Consider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer. Both plates have uniform temperatures, and are so massive compared to the gas layer that they can be treated as thermal reservoirs. The upper plate has a higher temperature than the lower plate. The molecules in the gas layer have a molecular kinetic energy formula_141 which increases uniformly with distance formula_107 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium energy flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.

Let formula_143 be the molecular kinetic energy of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area formula_43 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal, in time interval formula_47 is
formula_148

These molecules made their last collision at a distance formula_149 above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a molecular kinetic energy of
formula_150
where formula_151 is the specific heat capacity. Again, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the temperature gradient formula_152 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.

Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_64, formula_60, formula_61 yields the energy transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as heat flux):
formula_156

Note that the energy transfer from above is in the formula_157 direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net heat flux across the imaginary surface is thus
formula_158

Combining the above kinetic equation with Fourier&#x27;s law
formula_159
gives the equation for thermal conductivity, which is usually denoted formula_160 when it is a dilute gas:
formula_161

Similarly to viscosity, Revised Enskog Theory yields an expression for thermal conductivity that reduces to the above expression in the limit of infinite dilution, and which can be written as
formula_162
where formula_163 is a term that tends to unity in the limit of infinite dilution, accounting for excluded volume, and formula_164 is a term accounting for the transfer of energy across a non-zero distance between particles during a collision.

=== Diffusion coefficient and diffusion flux ===
Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for mass diffusivity of a dilute gas:

Consider a steady diffusion between two regions of the same gas with perfectly flat and parallel boundaries separated by a layer of the same gas. Both regions have uniform number densities, but the upper region has a higher number density than the lower region. In the steady state, the number density at any point is constant (that is, independent of time). However, the number density formula_165 in the layer increases uniformly with distance formula_107 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium molecular flow is superimposed on a Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.

Let formula_167 be the number density of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area formula_43 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_44 at angle formula_45 from the normal, in time interval formula_47 is
formula_172

These molecules made their last collision at a distance formula_149 above and below the gas layer, where the local number density is
formula_174

Again, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the number density gradient formula_175 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.

Integrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_59, formula_177, formula_61 yields the molecular transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as diffusion flux):
formula_179

Note that the molecular transfer from above is in the formula_157 direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net diffusion flux across the imaginary surface is thus
formula_181

Combining the above kinetic equation with Fick&#x27;s first law of diffusion
formula_182
gives the equation for mass diffusivity, which is usually denoted formula_183 when it is a dilute gas:
formula_184

The corresponding expression obtained from Revised Enskog Theory may be written as
formula_185
where formula_186 is a factor that tends to unity in the limit of infinite dilution, which accounts for excluded volume and the variation chemical potentials with density.

== Detailed balance ==

=== Fluctuation and dissipation ===

The kinetic theory of gases entails that due to the microscopic reversibility of the gas particles&#x27; detailed dynamics, the system must obey the principle of detailed balance. Specifically, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem applies to the Brownian motion (or diffusion) and the drag force, which leads to the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation:
formula_187 where
* is the mass diffusivity;
* is the &quot;mobility&quot;, or the ratio of the particle&#x27;s terminal drift velocity to an applied force, ;
* is the Boltzmann constant;
* is the absolute temperature.
Note that the mobility can be calculated based on the viscosity of the gas; Therefore, the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation also provides a relation between the mass diffusivity and the viscosity of the gas.

=== Onsager reciprocal relations ===

The mathematical similarities between the expressions for shear viscocity, thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient of the ideal (dilute) gas is not a coincidence; It is a direct result of the Onsager reciprocal relations (i.e. the detailed balance of the reversible dynamics of the particles), when applied to the convection (matter flow due to temperature gradient, and heat flow due to pressure gradient) and advection (matter flow due to the velocity of particles, and momentum transfer due to pressure gradient) of the ideal (dilute) gas.

<text>The Tagus ( ; ; ) is the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. The river rises in the Montes Universales between Cuenca and Teruel, in mid-eastern Spain, flows , generally westward, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Lisbon.

== Name ==
The river&#x27;s Latin name is &quot;Tagus&quot;. While the etymology is unclear, the most probable etymological origin for the hydronym &quot;Tagus&quot; is Indo-European *(s)tag- (&#x27;to drip&#x27;).

The Tagus River originates at an elevation of 1,593 meters above sea level in a place known as Fuente García, within the municipality of Frías de Albarracín in Teruel, Spain. Its source is located between the Muela de San Juan (1,830 m) and Cerro de San Felipe (1,839 m), in the Sierra de Albarracín, which belongs to the Montes Universales in the western branch of the Iberian System.

=== Course ===
The river flows through Spain for , passing through four autonomous communities (Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Madrid, and Extremadura) and a total of six provinces (Teruel, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Madrid, Toledo, and Cáceres). After forming a border between Spain and Portugal, it enters Portugal. In Portugal, it flows for through the traditional regions of Beira Baixa, Alto Alentejo, Ribatejo, and Estremadura, which include the districts of Castelo Branco, Portalegre, Santarém, and Lisbon.

The most important cities along its course are Aranjuez, Toledo, and Talavera de la Reina in Spain; and Abrantes, Santarém, and Lisbon in Portugal.

=== Basin ===
The Tagus basin has a total area of . It is the most populated basin in the Iberian Peninsula, with more than ten million inhabitants. It includes the Madrid metropolitan area and the Lisbon region. The Tagus basin has a total reservoir capacity of around .

=== Geology ===
The lower Tagus region in Portugal is a seismically active area. Major earthquakes in the Lower Tagus include those of 1309, 1531, 1755, and 1909.

=== Inverted delta ===

The Tagus river is one of the few rivers in the world to have an inverted delta. Its delta is wider at the beginning and narrows down as it approaches the sea, contrary to a typical delta. This is because it flows into the sea through a small opening in a valley. Although due to sedimentation, this delta is now only very partially inverted, with the valley now mostly filled with sediment. The delta is about wide and long, but its exit into the sea is only wide. It thus forms a large lagoon with large and very shallow sand banks which go uncovered during low tides. The delta used to be even bigger thousands of years ago.

== Hydrology ==

The hydrological regime of the Tagus is determined by the rain and snow variations typical of the central region of the Iberian Peninsula, especially in reference to the mountain formations integrated here. The river&#x27;s major floods usually occur from January to April, with an absolute maximum in March (when thawing occurs), while the lowest flows occur between July and October, with a minimum in September.

This results in a very irregular course, with strong flow oscillations. As it passes through Alcántara (Cáceres), these range from in February and March to in August and September.

This regime has been altered in the second half of the 20th century as a result of the construction of different engineering works, aimed at regulating its basin for five main uses: drinking water supply, irrigation, water diversion to an external basin (that of the Segura River), electricity production, and cooling of nuclear power plants.

== Ecology ==

The banks and areas of influence of the Tagus are home to relevant flora and fauna, representative of the central region of the Iberian Peninsula. The high degree of depopulation in some areas integrated into its basin, such as its upper and middle-lower course, has allowed the preservation of places of great ecological interest. Some of them have been legally protected, such as the Alto Tajo Natural Park (Guadalajara and Cuenca), the Monfragüe National Park (Cáceres), and the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve, near Lisbon. Around the course of the river, four endangered animal species live: the Iberian lynx, the Spanish imperial eagle, the black stork, and the black vulture.

== Historical importance ==

In addition to its geographical relevance, the Tagus has great historical importance, resulting from its connection with Toledo and Lisbon, two of the cities with the greatest weight and historical journey in the Iberian Peninsula. The first was built on a hill about 100 m high, around the meander known as Torno del Tajo, which preserved it from possible attacks and incursions.

From the Late Middle Ages, the mouth of the Tagus articulated an intense commercial activity between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. From the Renaissance, it was the main communications hub of the Portuguese Empire, which extended through America, Africa, and Asia.

== Recreational uses ==

The nearly of the Alto Tajo canyon as it passes through the natural park of the same name offer one of the best options for practicing whitewater canoeing in the central peninsula. Several adventure companies offer this activity in the vicinity of Poveda de la Sierra and Ocentejo. In the flat water modality, canoeing can be practiced in the Entrepeñas and Bolarque reservoirs. There are also important flat water canoeing clubs in Aranjuez and Talavera de la Reina.

<text>Shintaido (新体道, a Japanese word translated as ‘New Body Way’) is a system of movement which aims to use the body as a means of expression and communication. Incorporating both physical and artistic elements, it was created in Japan in the 1960s. Its roots lay in the traditional Japanese martial arts, Chinese medicine and Buddhist meditation techniques, while its creator Hiroyuki Aoki was also influenced by modern Western art and Christianity.

As well as being a practical martial art Shintaido aims to be a form of artistic expression, a healthy exercise, and a path of self-discovery and transformation.

Shintaido is practised with bare hands, but the curriculum also includes bojutsu (棒術), involving the use of the long staff (or bō, 棒), and kenjutsu (剣術), using a wooden sword (or bokuto, 木刀).

==Origins==

===Budō for the modern age===
Hiroyuki Aoki&#x27;s spiritual and artistic aspirations were not satisfied by karate as it existed in the 1960s. Striving for beauty and peace, he was searching for ‘both soft and expansive movement, spreading out to the ends of the earth – and power which could be used comfortably without turning against nature or the body.’

While studying karate under Shigeru Egami, he created his own research group which, as well as including karate practitioners, included others who had abandoned it as being too severe and unsparing, and also people with physical limitations. Then in 1964 he reached his goal of discovering a way of moving the body in a more natural, beautiful and effective manner. Yet he believed it might have taken a beginner 20 years of study to achieve this kind of movement. If it were to spearhead the new culture that he aspired for, Aoki realised that he needed system that could be learned relatively easily. He wanted to create an entire martial art that would convince the public at large – but one capable of revitalising both the body and the spirit, giving energy, refreshment and the hope of living a more colourful life, of restoring the soul day by day.

Aoki has said that he wanted to bring martial arts to the same level of attainment as the works of great Western artists such as Beethoven, Van Gogh or Dostoyevsky, or the American writers he admired, notably Henry Miller, Jackson Pollock or Walt Whitman.

===Rakutenkai (楽天会)===
To this end, on 23 September 1965, he collected an informal group around him which he called ‘Rakutenkai’, which had as its aim to &quot;pursue truth in daily life, acquire perfect liberty, live within the light of liberty, and become the light of the world&quot;.
The only requirement was that members should practise with the group at least twice a year; among its members were active high-ranking martial artists, others who had given up their practice, women, children, old people and people with physical disabilities. Aoki wanted even the least strong people to be able to enjoy the fruits of his study even though the traditional processes of the martial arts tended to be selective and exclusive. From his own experience and careful study of the texts, Aoki believed that anyone, if properly supported, could reveal him- or herself as a ‘living treasure’. So he set the group five rules:
# Stick to your own morality
# Never forget your original self
# Never judge others
# Love your neighbour as yourself
(the last was left blank, to be filled in by each person according to their own beliefs).

From this group he chose a team of around 30 instructors to conduct deep research into technique. From their experimental practice, Hiroyuki Aoki selected certain movements and techniques, and introduced them into his new system. Three fundamental kata emerged during this period: Tenshingoso (which Aoki had created by April 1966), Eiko (which the Rakutenkai discovered during a late-night practice on 1 December 1966; and Hikari (see below). In 1970 he set up his own school, Sogobudo (holistic martial art) Renmei, to revive traditional Budō by developing and teaching Shintaido.
After Rakutenkai had been disbanded a number of Aoki&#x27;s leading practitioners and teachers, who had helped him create Shintaido, left the group. Among these were Master Egamis son Masatake Egami, Kato Tomorori, Hokari Shikoh and his brother, Ito Juguro, Toshima Shigeiko and Chieko Kato. With this passing much of the creative energy left the Shintaido organisation and practice.

==Claimed Benefits==

Shintaido assumes that the challenges facing modern people are more rooted in emotional and psychological matters than physical. Shintaido offers body movements that aim to build resources to live better and develop a new &#x27;way of being&#x27; that is more intuitive, aware, and less tense; this stems from the belief that the freer the body, the more effective its movements can be.

The hope of founder Hiroyuki Aoki was to create a martial art that could reach the level of great art. so beauty and fluidity are essential aspects. The practice of Shintaido brings with it a bodily awareness and receptivity to the many messages the body transmits so that it can be used as a tool to explore the individual&#x27;s inner state of being, evolution, limitations and resources. The partner exercises aim to provide an opportunity to discover and develop the ability to communicate and affirm oneself. The dojo (道場, &quot;practice space&quot;) is a place in which to explore this concept in safety.

==Basic Forms==

Every Shintaido practice begins with warming-up exercises designed to soften and extend the body until it can move naturally, without the tensions of everyday life. This may be followed by a period of more vigorous exercises, designed to open of the body. These exercises, like everything in Shintaido, are based on effective martial arts technique.

Most of these exercises can be practised alone, with a single partner or in a group; they can be performed dynamically, formally or slowly and meditatively. Some require use of the voice.

===Tenshingoso (天真五相)===

Tenshingoso &quot;(five expressions of cosmic truth)&quot; is one of the essential forms (or kata, 型) of Shintaido. Its significance can vary depending on the context in which it is performed. As a martial technique, it is a distillation of all the principal techniques (attacks, cuts and throws) of budō. As an artistic symbol, it is a metaphor of the life-cycle, from birth to death. As a technique of personal development, it is an encyclopedia of meditation positions (mudras).

===Eiko (栄光)===

Adapted from the art of swordsmanship, Eiko &quot;(glory)&quot; is a hymn to the glory of the human adventure, taking the practitioner between earth and heaven, ideal and reality. If done with conviction, it can bring practitioners out of their ‘small world’ and plunge them into a whirl of new sensations. To do Eiko is open up the space around and within oneself; with a partner, it develops a sense of timing, concentration and gives a chance to go far beyond one&#x27;s normal limits.

===Hikari (光)===

Hikari &quot;(playing with light)&quot;, though virtually indescribable, can be considered Shintaido&#x27;s artistic masterpiece. It is a unique form of personal expression: its movements are totally free, so it has no form, and cannot be taught.

In Wakame taiso (わかめ体操, &quot;seaweed exercise&quot;) two people, face to face, alternately take the role of the seaweed and the ocean. The seaweed, rooted on the seabed, waves sinuously in response to the gentle touch of the ocean around it. This exercise can quickly induce a state of deep intensity. It also helps develop a sensitivity to attack and allows a fluid, centred response.

===Taimyo (大妙)===

The gentlest and most recent of the Shintaido kata, Taimyo &quot;(great mystery)&quot; was developed to allow older, less robust people or pregnant women to build up their strength and experience the beauty of Shintaido practice. A long and gentle kata, it contains elements of many aspects of Shintaido practice, has a therapeutic dimension, and builds a state of deep meditation.

==From relaxation and stretching to openness and freedom==

The first objective of Shintaido is to make the body and mind completely relaxed, fluid and flexible. Next it develops large movements through which we can express our vital energy and talents. Many exercises open the body, especially the hips, the stomach, chest and hands. Practitioners aim to develop an open spirit with which to approach life at large, and other people. Kumite (組み手, &quot;partner practices&quot;) allow us to test the effectiveness of the techniques we have learned: an open body, large movements and clear intention make the techniques effective. There is no competition. Each participant is encouraged to express him or herself freely and to discover his or her potential in a spirit of cooperation with, respect for and confidence in one another. A kumite may begin with a formal movement but is transformed progressively into a kind of free dance between two partners.

==Applied Shintaido==

===Shintaido bojutsu (新棒術)===

The bojutsu curriculum is one of the most popular aspects of Shintaido, and for many people provided and point first contact. Students use a long staff (or bō, 棒) to extend their movement, and later progress to the more difficult short staff (or jō, 杖).

Beginners study a range of basic movements as well as three short kata which are based on traditional Japanese bojutsu practice. These kata are:
* Hino kata (火の型, &quot;kata of fire&quot;), derived from Sakugawa (佐久川)
* Kazeno kata (風の型, &quot;kata of wind&quot;), derived from Matsukaze (松風, &quot;the wind in the pines&quot;)
* Mizuno kata (水の型, &quot;kata of water&quot;), derived from Hakuson (白樽)
There is also a kumibo kata called shinjo (真常), offered in sho (小, &quot;correct, or formal&quot;) &amp; dai (大, &quot;big, or expressive&quot;) forms.

Advanced students (from shodan and above) study the 3 long kata from which the basic kata were derived. At the highest level there is a longer kata (known colloquially as &quot;Go Down Moses&quot;) in which all 3 kata are combined into a single form.

===Shintaido karate (新空手)===

The Shintaido karate curriculum is based on a cut down version of the shotokai karate curriculum, which is the school run by Egami sensei at the time Shintaido was created. The study of karate is meant to complement the study of Shintaido itself, and is most often taken up by Shintaido students of many years experience who wish to study the history and origins of Shintaido movement. Beginners study two taikyoku (太極) and two heian (平安) katas (each is offered in sho &amp; dai forms) as well as variety of strikes, kicks and kumite arrangements. Advanced students (from shodan and above) study a range of traditional karate kata, culminating in a revisiting of the original taikyoku kata at the highest level.

==Curriculum and organisation==

Shintaido offers five Dan (段, &quot;higher level&quot;) grades: currently just four people in the world hold the highest grade (5th Dan). On average it takes ten years of practice to reach 1st Dan (the grade of Shintaido instructor). Equivalent grades are also offered in the Shintaido forms of bojutsu &amp; karate.

In Europe Kyu (級, &quot;lower level&quot;) examinations are conducted in each country. For 1st Dan and above, they are held at a European workshop organised by the European Shintaido College (ESC). Exams of 3rd Dan and above are held at international festivals held every four years at varying locations around the world.

The International Shintaido College (ISC) is the main organisation of Shintaido instructors. It meets every four years, when it also holds exams, of 3rd dan and above. Its Technical Committee (ISC-TC) comprises nine members, drawn from Shintaido&#x27;s three regions: Europe, the Americas (including Australia) and Japan. This committee aims to harmonise practice and technique around the world.

Japan, the country of Shintaido&#x27;s origin, has many instructors, most working within a national organisation (NPO). In the Western hemisphere, Shintaido is practised in USA, Canada and Brazil. The US instructors operate under the auspices of Shintaido of America. In Europe, The European Shintaido College (ESC) includes most of the Shintaido instructors in Europe, based in Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Britain, Italy, the Czech Republic and Switzerland. ESC meets annually at a ‘forum’, when exams of 1st and 2nd Dan are also held. The European Technical Committee (ETC) oversees the examinations and establishes the curriculum for all examinations in Europe. Kyu grade exams can be held nationally or locally, twice a year.

<text>The Tombstone Western Film Festival and Symposium founded in 2001 was held in July in Tombstone, Arizona, a historic western mining town (and later ghost town) in the U.S. celebrated in western films as the site of the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral between Wyatt Earp and the Clantons and McLaurys.

The program in the first year was devoted to retellings of tales from Tombstone, the second year to classic TV Western. Organizers hoped the festival would allow the town to cash in on various film and TV depictions of events in the town&#x27;s history. They invited actors such as Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Harry Carey Jr. to the event. The 2002 also included book discussions and was funded by the city government rather than private funding.

The 2003 event did not occur as the organizers participated in the Warren Earp Days festival in nearby Willcox instead.

It was reported that the 2005 iteration of the festival would be its last, as the backers had failed to find funding to continue. A reunion of the cast of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; also occurred at that year&#x27;s event. Attendees included Melissa Gilbert and Alison Arngrim.

<text>The gunfight at the O.K. Corral pitted lawmen against members of a loosely organized group of cattle rustlers and horse thieves called the Cowboys on October 26, 1881. While lasting less than a minute, the gunfight has been the subject of books and films into the 21st century. Taking place in the town of Tombstone in Arizona Territory, the battle has become one archetype of the American Old West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud between five outlaws (including two sets of brothers) and four representatives of the law, including three brothers. The trigger for the event was the local marshal&#x27;s decision to enforce a city ordinance that prohibited the carrying of weapons into town. To enforce that ordinance, the lawmen would have to disarm the Cowboys.

Among the lawmen were three brothers, Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp, as well as Wyatt’s close friend Doc Holliday. As Deputy U.S. Marshal and Town Marshal, Virgil was in charge, and it was his decision to enforce the ordinance that led to the shoot out. His two brothers and Doc Holliday were temporary assistant marshals. The Cowboys were a loosely connected group of outlaws. In Tombstone at the time of the gunfight were five members of the Cowboys: Billy Claiborne, brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury. Despite its name, the gunfight did not take place within or next to the O.K. Corral, which fronted Allen Street and had a rear entrance lined with horse stalls on Fremont Street. The shootout actually took place in a narrow lot on the side of C. S. Fly&#x27;s photography studio on Fremont Street, six doors west of the O.K. Corral&#x27;s rear entrance. Some members of the two opposing parties were initially only about apart. About thirty shots were fired in thirty seconds. During that brief battle, three men were killed, three were wounded, two ran away, and one fought but was unharmed. Ike Clanton subsequently filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday. After a thirty-day preliminary hearing and a brief stint in jail, the defendants were shown to have acted lawfully.

The gunfight was not the end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed and maimed in a murder attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, a Cowboy fired from a dark alley through the glass door of Campbell &amp; Hatch&#x27;s saloon and billiard parlor, killing Morgan. The suspects in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt&#x27;s killing of Frank Stilwell.

The gunfight was not widely known until two years after Wyatt Earp&#x27;s death, when Stuart Lake published his 1931 &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. The book was the basis for the 1939 film &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot;, with Randolph Scott and Cesar Romero, the 1946 film &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, directed by John Ford, and the 1957 film &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;, after which the shootout became known by that name. Since then, the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books, and has become an archetype for much of the popular imagery associated with the Old West.

== Background ==
Tombstone, located in Arizona Territory about from the Mexican border, was founded in March 1879 after silver was discovered in the area. Like many mining boomtowns on the American frontier, Tombstone grew rapidly. At its founding, it had a population of just 100, and only two years later, in late 1881, the population was more than 7,000 (excluding Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children), making it the largest boomtown in the American Southwest.

Silver mining and its attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants, who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. By 1881 the town boasted fancy restaurants, a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, an opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, along with 110 saloons, fourteen gambling halls, and numerous brothels, all situated among a number of dirty, hardscrabble mines.

Horse rustlers and bandits from the countryside often came to town, and shootings were frequent. In the 1880s, the theft of cattle and the smuggling of alcohol and tobacco across the border were common. The Mexican government assessed heavy export taxes on these items, and smugglers earned a handsome profit by stealing them in Mexico and selling them in Tombstone.

James, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, when the town was mostly composed of tents as living quarters, a few saloons and other buildings, and the mines. Virgil had been hired as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County, with his offices in Tombstone, only days before his arrival. In June 1881 he was also appointed as Tombstone&#x27;s town marshal (or police chief).

Though not universally liked by the townspeople, the Earp brothers tended to protect the interests of the town&#x27;s business owners and residents; even so, Wyatt helped protect outlaw &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius from being lynched after he accidentally killed Tombstone town marshal Fred White. In contrast, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan was generally sympathetic to the interests of the rural ranchers and members of the loosely organized outlaw group called the Cochise County Cowboys, or simply the Cowboys, to which Brocius belonged. (In that time and region, the term &quot;cowboy&quot; generally meant an outlaw; legitimate cowmen were instead referred to as &quot;cattle herders&quot; or &quot;ranchers&quot;.)
== Conflicting versions of events ==

Many of the sources describing the events leading up to the gunfight and details of the gunfight itself conflict with each other. Newspapers of the day were not above taking sides, and news reporting often editorialized on issues to reflect the publisher&#x27;s interests. John Clum, publisher of &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot;, had helped organize a &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; (a vigilance committee) in Tombstone in late September 1881. He was elected as Tombstone&#x27;s first mayor under the new city charter that year. Clum and his newspaper tended to side with the interests of local business owners and supported Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp. Harry Woods, the publisher of the other major newspaper, &quot;The Daily Nugget&quot;, was an undersheriff to Behan. He and his newspaper tended to side with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners) and the rural interests of the ranchers.

Much of what is known of the event is based on month-long preliminary hearings held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner&#x27;s inquest, but only the reporter from the &quot;Nugget&quot; knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.

According to the Earps&#x27; version of events, the fight was in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in violation of local ordinance, defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons and drew their pistols instead. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offered no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who was telling the truth was difficult then and remains so to this day.

Though usually opposing each other in their depiction of events, reporting by both the &quot;Epitaph&quot; and the &quot;Nugget&quot; initially supported the lawmen&#x27;s version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy &quot;Nugget&quot;, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The &quot;Nugget&quot; staff had a close relationship with Behan, but Rule&#x27;s story, as printed in the &quot;Nugget&quot; the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps&#x27; account. This varied widely from Behan&#x27;s and the Cowboys&#x27; later court testimony. 

Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the &quot;Nugget&quot; after that day supported Behan&#x27;s and the Cowboys&#x27; view of events. Other stories in the &quot;Epitaph&quot; countered the &quot;Nugget&quot;″s later view entirely and supported the lawmen. Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their deaths, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton&#x27;s wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.

Part-time newspaper reporter Howell &quot;Pat&quot; Hayhurst transcribed the testimony from the hearings in the early 1930s as part of a Federal Writers&#x27; Project, which was part of the Works Progress Administration. According to one report, Hayhurst was a friend of the Behan family. After he completed his transcription, he kept the original document in his home, where it was destroyed in a house fire.

== Origins of the conflict ==

=== Earps versus Cowboys ===
The interpersonal conflicts and feuds leading to the gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as lawmen, pimps, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became a police officer in Prescott, Arizona Territory. He followed that with a job as a night watchman before he became a constable. Wyatt had held jobs as either a guard or police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, 
Kansas.

James, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp, together with their wives, arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, during the early period of rapid growth associated with mining, when there were only a few hundred residents. Virgil was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal shortly before he arrived in town. In the summer of 1880, Morgan and Warren Earp also moved to Tombstone. Wyatt arrived hoping he could leave &quot;lawing&quot; behind. He bought a stagecoach, only to find the business was already very competitive. The Earps invested together in several mining claims and water rights. The Earps were Republicans and Northerners who had never worked as cowmen or ranchers.

The Earps quickly came into conflict with Frank and Tom McLaury, Billy and Ike Clanton, Johnny Ringo, and William &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius, among others. They were part of a large, loose association of cattle smugglers and horse thieves known as the Cowboys, outlaws who had been implicated in various crimes. Ike Clanton was prone to drinking heavily and threatened the Earp brothers numerous times.

Tombstone resident George Parson wrote in his diary, &quot;A Cowboy is a rustler at times, and a rustler is a synonym for desperado—bandit, outlaw, and horse thief.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote in an editorial, &quot;Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.&quot; During the 1880s in Cochise County, it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a &quot;Cowboy&quot;. The Cowboys teamed up for various crimes and came to each other&#x27;s aid. Virgil thought that some of the Cowboys had met at Charleston and taken &quot;an oath over blood drawn from the arm of Johnny Ringo, the leader, that they would kill us.&quot;

=== The Earps as lawmen ===
Among the lawmen involved in the O.K. Corral shooting, only Virgil had any real experience in combat. Virgil had been constable in Prescott and was the deputy United States Marshal in Tombstone. He was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County by U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake, on November 27, 1879, before the Earps arrived in Tombstone on December 1. He was appointed as Tombstone&#x27;s acting town marshal on September 30, 1880, after popular Tombstone town marshal Fred White was accidentally shot and killed by Brocius. Wyatt had been a deputy city marshal in Kansas, as well as deputy sheriff in Tombstone.

Only six weeks later, Virgil ran for the office on November 12, 1880, but lost to Ben Sippy. However, on June 6, 1881, Sippy asked for a two-week leave of absence. The city soon discovered $3,000 () in financial improprieties in Sippy&#x27;s records. A few days later Virgil was appointed as town marshal in his place. At the time of the gunfight, Virgil was both Deputy U.S. Marshal and town marshal. The city suspended him as town marshal after Ike Clanton filed murder charges.

After Wyatt first arrived in Tombstone, his business efforts yielded little profit, and he took a job as a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, guarding shipments of silver bullion. On July 28, 1880, Wyatt was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff. He held this position for only three months, until after the election of November 9, 1880, when he resigned. When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882.

Wyatt was an imposing, handsome man: blond, tall, weighing , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular. He had been a boxer and was reputed to be an expert with a pistol. According to author Leo Silva, Earp showed no fear of any man. Wyatt had been an assistant marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, along with a few other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas, during the summer of 1878.

The 1931 book &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; was a best-selling biography by Stuart N. Lake. It established Wyatt Earp&#x27;s role as a fearless lawman in the American Old West and the legend of the &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; in the public consciousness. But Lake and many others in the popular media wildly exaggerated Wyatt&#x27;s role as the central figure in the gunfight. It was only discovered much later that &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;, based on eight interviews with Earp, was largely fictional. The book and later Hollywood portrayals embellished Wyatt&#x27;s reputation and magnified his mystique as a western lawman.

Morgan Earp had been a police officer in Montana, but had no known experience with gunfighting prior to their arrival in Tombstone. While Wyatt was Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 27, 1880, Morgan Earp took over his job as shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo. Morgan also occasionally assisted Virgil and at the time of the gunfight was a special deputy policeman and drawing pay.

Doc Holliday had a reputation as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls whom he wanted to take with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for murder but acquitted, mostly based on the testimony of Webb.

Holliday had saved Wyatt Earp&#x27;s life at one time and had become a close friend. He had been living in Prescott, Arizona Territory and making a living as a gambler since late 1879. There, he first met future Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan, a sometime gambler and saloon owner. In late September 1880, Holliday followed the Earps to Tombstone.

=== Rural Cowboys vs. Tombstone interests ===
The ranch owned by Newman Haynes Clanton near Charleston, Arizona was believed to be the local center for the Cowboys&#x27; illegal activities. Tom and Frank McLaury worked with the rustlers buying and selling stolen cattle.

Many of the rural ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing influence of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained control of the country outside Tombstone, due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps&#x27; complaints about the McLaurys&#x27; and Clantons&#x27; horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.

=== Relevant law in Tombstone ===
To reduce crime in Tombstone, on April 19, 1881, the city council passed ordinance 9, requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife, dirk, pistol or rifle to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town.

The ordinance was the legal basis for City Marshal Virgil Earp&#x27;s decision to confront the Cowboys on the day of the shootout.

=== Smuggling and stock thefts ===

In the borderlands south of Tombstone there was only one passable route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Newman Haynes &quot;Old Man&quot; Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, &quot;I naturally kept my eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it.&quot;

=== Earp loses sheriff&#x27;s office to Behan ===
On July 27, 1880, Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell, whose offices were in the county seat of Tucson, appointed Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff. On October 28, 1880, Tombstone Marshal Fred White attempted to disarm some late-night revelers who were shooting their pistols in the air. When he attempted to disarm Curly Bill Brocius, the gun discharged, striking White in the abdomen. Wyatt saw the shooting and pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt later told his biographer John Flood that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time, and did not see Brocius&#x27; pistol on the ground.

Brocius waived the preliminary hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon the next day to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius&#x27;s pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White&#x27;s death.

The Tombstone council convened and appointed Virgil Earp as &quot;temporary assistant city marshal&quot; to replace White for a salary of $100 per month () until an election could be held on November 12. For the next few weeks, Virgil represented federal and local law enforcement and Wyatt represented Pima County.

In the November 2, 1880, election for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who was expected to win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly re-elected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to overturn the election. While San Simeon precinct, east of Tombstone, only had 10 registered voters, Shibell won that precinct with 103 votes to 1. Ike Clanton was the election inspector and Johnny Ringo was one of the election judges.

Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, but it was too late to re-appoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on February 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County containing Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county&#x27;s largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff&#x27;s position was worth more than $40,000 a year (equivalent to $ million in ) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid.

Behan used his existing position and his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt a position as his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan&#x27;s name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.

== Earp conflicts with Cowboys ==
Tensions between the Earp family and both the Clanton and McLaury clans increased through 1881. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst, of Company A, 12th U.S. Infantry, and Commanding Officer of Fort Bennett, asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to help him track Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. Hurst brought four soldiers, and Virgil invited Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. The posse found the mules on the McLaury&#x27;s Ranch on Babacomari Creek, northwest of Tombstone, as well as the branding iron used to change the &quot;US&quot; brand to &quot;D8.&quot;

To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst they would return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules, laughing at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He re-printed this in &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had asked him if he had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank&#x27;s intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, &quot;If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.&quot; This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.

=== March stagecoach robbery and murder ===

On the evening of March 15, 1881, a Kinnear &amp; Company stagecoach carrying $26,000 in silver bullion () was en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest freight terminal. Bob Paul, who had run for Pima County Sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot-stuffing, was temporarily working once again as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver&#x27;s seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli &quot;Bud&quot; Philpot, was ill. Philpot was riding shotgun.

Near Drew&#x27;s Station, just outside Contention City, a man stepped into the road and commanded them to &quot;Hold!&quot; Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage. Paul, in the driver&#x27;s seat, fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. Philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed. The horses spooked and Paul was not able to bring the stage under control for almost , leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul, who normally rode shotgun, later said he thought the first shot killing Philpot had been meant for him.
Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, along with temporary federal deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, former Kansas Sheriff Bat Masterson (who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon), and County Sheriff Behan set out to find the robbers. Wells Fargo issued a wanted poster offering a $3,600 reward () for the three robbers ($1,200 each), dead or alive. Robbery of a mail-carrying stagecoach was both a federal crime and territorial crime, and the posse consisted of both county and federal authorities and deputies.

The posse trailed the robbers to a nearby ranch where they found a drifter named Luther King. He would not tell who his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Doc Holliday&#x27;s girlfriend had been shot. Fearful of Holliday&#x27;s reputation, he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers&#x27; horses, and identified Bill Leonard, Harry &quot;The Kid&quot; Head, and Jim Crane as the robbers. They were all known Cowboys and rustlers. Behan and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone.

Remarkably, King walked in the front door of the jail and a few minutes later walked out the back. King had arranged with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the &quot;Nugget&quot;) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan&#x27;s partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King&#x27;s easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.

The Earps pursued the other two men for 17 days, riding for 60 hours without food and 36 hours without water, during which Bob Paul&#x27;s horse died, and Wyatt and Morgan&#x27;s horses became so weak that the two men walked back to Tombstone to obtain new horses. After pursuing the Cowboys for over they could not obtain more fresh horses and were forced to give up the chase. They returned to Tombstone on April 1. Behan submitted a bill for $796.84 () to the county for posse expenses, but he refused to reimburse the Earps for any of their costs. Virgil was incensed. They were later reimbursed by Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., but the incident caused further friction between county and federal law enforcement, and between Behan and the Earps.

After he was passed over by Johnny Behan for the position of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff&#x27;s office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881, he offered the Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects — Leonard, Head and Crane — were killed in unrelated incidents.

Ike began to fear that word of his possible cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike&#x27;s willingness to help arrest his friends.

The fallout over the Cowboys&#x27; attempt to implicate Holliday and the Earps in the robbery, along with Behan&#x27;s involvement in King&#x27;s escape, was the beginning of increasingly bad feelings between the Earp brothers and Cowboy factions.

=== Earp and Behan attracted to Josephine Marcus ===
Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were interested in the same sheriff&#x27;s position and also might have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Sadie were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. In early 1881, Sadie ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to Dr. George Goodfellow.

Wyatt Earp lived with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the 1880 census. She had a growing addiction to the opiate laudanum, which was readily available at the time. Earp remained with Blaylock until he left Tombstone in April 1882. There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Sadie and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.

Sadie, traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left for Los Angeles on March 25, 1882, and then returned to her family in San Francisco. In July 1882, Wyatt left Colorado and went to San Francisco, where he sought out Sadie and his brother Virgil, who was seeking treatment for his arm. In February or March 1883, Sadie and Earp left San Francisco for Gunnison, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. Sadie was his common-law wife for the next 46 years.

=== September stage holdup ===
Tensions between the Earps and the McLaurys further increased when another passenger stage on the &#x27;Sandy Bob Line&#x27; in the Tombstone area, bound for Bisbee, was held up on September 8, 1881. The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables since the stage was not carrying a strongbox. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as &quot;sugar&quot;, a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had, until the prior month, been a deputy for Sheriff Behan but had been fired for &quot;accounting irregularities&quot;.

Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with a sheriff&#x27;s posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been appointed Tombstone&#x27;s town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil at the same time continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.

==== Stilwell and Spence arrests ====
Frank Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the preliminary hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.

Released on bail, Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested October 13 by Marshal Virgil Earp for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred on October 8 near Contention City.

Ike and other Cowboys believed the new arrest was further evidence that the Earps were illegally persecuting the Cowboys. They told the Earps that they could expect retaliation. While Virgil and Wyatt were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Spence and Stilwell, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp. He told him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again. &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; reported &quot;that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell, veiled threats [are] being made that the friends of the accused will &#x27;get the Earps.&#x27;&quot;

==== Cowboys accuse Holliday of robbery ====
Milt Joyce, a county supervisor and owner of the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce&#x27;s Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from Joyce&#x27;s saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday&#x27;s revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce&#x27;s business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.

Holliday and his on-again, off-again mistress Big Nose Kate had many fights. After a particularly nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff John Behan and Milt Joyce saw an opportunity and exploited the situation. They plied Big Nose Kate with more booze and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the attempted stagecoach robbery and murders. Holliday was a good friend of Bill Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York, one of three men implicated in the robbery. Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday&#x27;s location at the time of the murders and Kate sobered up, revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she did not understand. With the Cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them &quot;ridiculous.&quot; Doc gave Kate some money and put her on a stage out of town.

=== Ike Clanton&#x27;s conflict with Doc Holliday ===

Wyatt Earp testified after the gunfight that five or six weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike&#x27;s meetings with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, as well as their attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.

A month later, the weekend before the shootout, Morgan Earp was concerned about possible trouble with the Cowboys. He asked Doc Holliday to come back to Tombstone from a fiesta celebration in Tucson where Holliday had been gambling. Upon his return, Wyatt Earp asked Holliday about Ike&#x27;s accusation.

On the morning of Tuesday, October 25, 1881, the day before the gunfight, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury drove in a spring wagon from Chandler&#x27;s Milk Ranch at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains to Tombstone. They were in town to sell a large number of beef stock, most of them owned by the McLaurys. Fred Dodge, an undercover detective for Wells Fargo, heard from J.B. Ayers, another undercover Wells Fargo man in Contention, that Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne were in town and planning to join Ike and Tom in Tombstone Wednesday afternoon. Dodge, who had been sick, got up and went looking for city marshal Virgil Earp. He found Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp at the Alhambra Saloon instead and told him the news.

Near midnight, Holliday saw Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon and confronted him, accusing him of lying about their previous conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother Morgan to intervene. Morgan took Holliday out onto the street and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop quarreling. Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. They talked again, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had been going on for a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, &quot;I will be ready for you in the morning.&quot; Wyatt told Ike to go home &quot;because there was no money in it.&quot; Ike sat down near Wyatt, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp &quot;You must not think I won&#x27;t be after you all in the morning.&quot; Virgil Earp went to the Occidental Saloon across the street.

== Morning of the gunfight ==

=== Events leading up to the Ike Clanton court hearing ===

After Holliday&#x27;s confrontation with Ike Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his room at Camillus Sidney &quot;Buck&quot; Fly&#x27;s Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played poker with Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth unnamed man in a back room of the Occidental Saloon until morning.

At about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed. Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton had no place to go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the telegraph office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him.

Boyle later said that Ike told him, &quot;&#x27;As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open — that they would have to fight&#x27; ... I went down to Wyatt Earp&#x27;s house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when Wyatt, his brothers, and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open.&quot; Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day. Deputy Marshal Andy Bronk also heard the talk around town. He woke Virgil, who listened, and went back to sleep. Ike&#x27;s continuous threats were not worth losing sleep over.

Later in the morning, Ike picked up his rifle and revolver from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, in violation of the city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told anyone who would listen he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At Fly&#x27;s boarding house where Holliday and his common-law wife Mary Katharine Horony were sleeping, proprietor Mary Fly heard Clanton&#x27;s threats and banged on Holliday&#x27;s door. Fly told Horony, &quot;Ike Clanton was here looking for [Holliday], and he had a rifle with him.&quot; Horony woke Holliday and relayed the threat, who replied, &quot;If God will let me live to get my clothes on, he will see me.&quot;

At about 1:00 p.m., Marshal Virgil and his Deputy Morgan Earp found Ike on Fourth Street, still armed, and Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Justice of the Peace A.O. Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Justice Wallace so a court hearing could be held.

=== Ike Clanton court hearing ===

While Wyatt waited for Virgil to return with Justice Wallace, witnesses overheard Wyatt tell Clanton, &quot;You cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, and you know that I know you are a cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, you&#x27;ve threatened my life enough, and you&#x27;ve got to fight!&quot;, Ike Clanton was heard to reply, &quot;Fight is my racket, and all I want is four feet of ground!&quot;

Ike reported in his testimony afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him right there in the courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Justice Wallace fined Ike $25 () plus court costs. Ike paid the fine and Virgil told Ike he could pick up his confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.

=== Tom McLaury&#x27;s concealed weapon ===

Outside the court house where Ike was being fined, Tombstone Deputy Marshal Wyatt almost walked into 28-year-old Tom McLaury as the two men were brought up short nose-to-nose. Tom, who had arrived in town the day before, was required by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town. When Wyatt demanded, &quot;Are you heeled or not?&quot;, McLaury said he was not armed. Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom&#x27;s pants. As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol, in his waistband or in a coat pocket lined with leather to make drawing it easier. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1:00–2:00 p.m., after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed.

Wyatt said in his deposition afterward that he had been temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits — a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, who was portrayed as a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.

It was early afternoon by the time Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still on the ground in some places. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.

=== More Cowboys enter town ===

At around 1:30–2:00 p.m., after Tom had been pistol-whipped by Wyatt, Ike&#x27;s 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom&#x27;s older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They had heard from their neighbor, Ed &quot;Old Man&quot; Frink, that Ike had been stirring up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers. They arrived from Antelope Springs, east of Tombstone, where they had been rounding up stock and had breakfasted with Ike and Tom the day before. Both Frank and Billy were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone. Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight, so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted.

Billy and Frank stopped first at the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned immediately about their brothers&#x27; beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.

=== Virgil and Wyatt Earp&#x27;s reactions ===
Wyatt said that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberg&#x27;s gun and hardware store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there and that he had tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike&#x27;s bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberg&#x27;s shop.

When Virgil Earp learned that Wyatt was talking to the Cowboys at Spangenberg&#x27;s gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified afterward that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone&#x27;s public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford&#x27;s Saloon.

From Spangenberg&#x27;s, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked out the back of the O.K. Corral and then west, stopping in a narrow, empty lot next to C. S. Fly&#x27;s boarding house.

Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with the newly arrived Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable as the law required. The statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might &quot;with good faith, and within reasonable time&quot; travel into town while carrying a firearm. This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery, hotel or saloon. The three main Tombstone corrals were all west of 4th Street between Allen and Fremont, a block or two from where Wyatt saw the Cowboys buying cartridges. Miner Ruben F. Coleman later told &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot;:

=== Behan attempts to disarm Cowboys ===

Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend of the Cowboys, later testified that he woke up about 1:30 p.m. after the late-night card game he went to get a shave at a barbershop. That is where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed. Behan stated he quickly finished his shave and went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30 p.m. he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on 4th Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly&#x27;s photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon.

The Cowboys were located in a narrow lot between the Harwood house and Fly&#x27;s 12-room boarding house and photography studio at 312 Fremont Street, where Doc Holliday roomed.

Behan later said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would give up his guns only after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were first disarmed.

The Cowboys were about a block and a half from the West End Corral at 2nd. Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom&#x27;s wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town.

While Ike Clanton later said he was planning to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, Tom and Frank&#x27;s brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers&#x27; murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.

=== Virgil decides to disarm Cowboys ===
Citizens reported to Virgil on the Cowboys&#x27; movements and their threats told him that Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, in violation of the city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboys&#x27; repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday&#x27;s room in Fly&#x27;s boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.

Several members of the citizen&#x27;s vigilance committee offered to support him with arms, but Virgil refused. He had, during the prior month, appointed Morgan as a Special Policeman. He had also appointed Wyatt as a Special Policeman while Virgil had been in Prescott on business. He had also called on Doc Holliday that morning for help with disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the &quot;marshals&quot; while he acted as &quot;deputy.&quot;

Virgil Earp picked up the shotgun he had retrieved from the Wells Fargo office earlier. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday&#x27;s walking-stick in return.

As usual, the Earps carried their revolvers in their coat pockets or in their waistbands. Wyatt Earp was carrying a .44 caliber American 1869 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down the south side of Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys&#x27; last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward the Earps, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t go down there or they will murder you!&quot; Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, &quot;I have disarmed them.&quot; Behan testified afterward that he had only said he had gone down to the Cowboys &quot;for the purpose of disarming them,&quot; not that he had actually disarmed them. One eyewitness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, testified afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, &quot;those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight.&quot;

When Behan said he had disarmed them, Virgil attempted to avoid a fight. &quot;I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and when he said he had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand.&quot; Wyatt said, &quot;I took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket.&quot; The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.

Wyatt testified he saw &quot;Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly&#x27;s photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don&#x27;t know [Wes Fuller] were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west.&quot; Addie Bourland corroborated Wyatt&#x27;s testimony, stating that she saw &quot;five men opposite my house, leaning against a small house west of Fly&#x27;s Gallery and one man was holding a horse, standing a little out from the house.&quot;

== The gunfight ==


Martha J. King was in Bauer&#x27;s butcher shop located on Fremont Street. She testified that when the Earp party passed by her location, one of the Earps on the outside of the group looked across and said to Doc Holliday nearest the store, &quot;... let them have it!&quot; to which Holliday replied, &quot;All right.&quot;

=== Physical proximity ===
When the Earps approached the lot, the four lawmen initially faced six Cowboys: Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, Billy Clanton, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, and Ike Clanton. When the Cowboys saw the officers, they stepped away from the Harwood house.

In testimony given by witnesses afterward, they disagreed about the precise location of the men before, during and after the gunfight. The coroner&#x27;s inquest and the Spicer hearing produced a sketch showing the Cowboys standing, from left to right facing Fremont Street, with Billy Clanton and then Frank McLaury near the Harwood house and Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton roughly in the middle of the lot. Opposite them and initially only about away, Virgil Earp was on the left end of the Earp party, standing a few feet inside the vacant lot and nearest Ike Clanton. Behind him a few feet near the corner of C. S. Fly&#x27;s boarding house was Wyatt. Morgan Earp was standing on Fremont Street to Wyatt&#x27;s right, and Doc Holliday anchored the end of their line in Fremont Street, a few feet to Morgan&#x27;s right.

Wyatt Earp drew a sketch in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15, 1926, that depicted Billy Clanton near the middle of the lot, close to the Harwood house. Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot. Frank was in the center between the two buildings, holding the reins of his horse. Tom was closer to C. S. Fly&#x27;s boarding house. According to Wyatt&#x27;s sketches, Morgan was on the right of the lawmen, close to the Harwood house, opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot, opposite Frank and Ike Clanton. Wyatt was to Virgil&#x27;s left, opposite Tom. Doc Holliday hung back a step or two on Fremont Street. Neither of Wyatt&#x27;s sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Claiborne, who ran from the fight.

=== Gun battle begins ===

Virgil Earp was not expecting a fight. After Behan said that he had disarmed the Cowboys, Virgil and Wyatt put the pistols they had been holding in their waistband or overcoat pocket. Holliday had a short coach gun concealed under his long jacket.

Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury wore revolvers in holsters on their belts and stood alongside their saddled horses with rifles in their scabbards conversing with a unknown man, purported to be Calico Jones, possibly in violation of the city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town.

When Virgil saw the Cowboys, he testified, he immediately commanded the Cowboys to &quot;Throw up your hands, I want your guns!&quot; Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, &quot;Throw up your hands; I have come to disarm you!&quot; Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their single action six shot revolvers as Calico Jones escaped down an adjacent alley back towards The O.K. Corral. Virgil yelled: &quot;Hold! I don&#x27;t mean that!&quot; or &quot;Hold on, I don&#x27;t want that!&quot;

Jeff Morey, who served as the historical consultant on the film &quot;Tombstone&quot;, compared testimony by partisan and neutral witnesses and came to the conclusion that the Earps described the situation accurately.

Who started shooting first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The smoke from the black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.

; First two shots
Virgil Earp reported afterward, &quot;Two shots went off right together. Billy Clanton&#x27;s was one of them.&quot; Wyatt testified, &quot;Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had the reputation of being a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury.&quot; He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: &quot;The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury.&quot; Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.

All witnesses generally agreed that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When the shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his hand to his right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse&#x27;s movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse&#x27;s back.

; Holliday shoots Tom
According to one witness, Holliday drew a &quot;large bronze pistol&quot; (interpreted by some as Virgil&#x27;s coach gun) from under his long coat, stepped around Tom McLaury&#x27;s horse, and shot him with the double-barreled shotgun in the chest at close range.

Witness C. H. &quot;Ham&quot; Light saw Tom running or stumbling westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street, away from the gunfight, while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting. Light testified that Tom fell at the foot of a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there, without moving, through the duration of the fight. Fallehy also saw Tom stagger across the street until he fell on his back. After shooting Tom, Holliday tossed the empty shotgun aside, pulled out his nickel-plated revolver, and continued to fire at Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton.

; Cowboys run

Ike Clanton had been publicly threatening to kill the Earps for several months, including very loud threats on the day before. Wyatt told the court afterward that Clanton had bragged that he would kill the Earps or Doc Holliday at his first opportunity. However, when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed Wyatt, exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, &quot;Go to fighting or get away!&quot; Clanton ran through the front door of Fly&#x27;s boarding house and escaped, unwounded. Other accounts say that Ike drew a hidden pistol and fired at the Earps before disappearing. Like Ike, Billy Claiborne was unarmed. He and Cowboy Wes Fuller, who had been at the rear of the lot, also ran from the fight as soon as the shooting began.

; Frank McLaury shot
According to &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot;, &quot;Wyatt Earp stood up and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit.&quot; Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan&#x27;s shot hit Billy in the right wrist, disabling his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He tried and failed to grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, &quot;That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him.&quot; Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank. Frank fell to the sidewalk on the east side of Fremont Street.

A number of witnesses observed a man leading a horse into the street and firing near it and Wyatt in his testimony thought this was Tom McLaury. Claiborne said only one man had a horse in the fight, and that this man was Frank, holding his own horse by the reins, then losing it and its cover, in the middle of the street. Wes Fuller also identified Frank as the man in the street leading the horse.

;Morgan Earp wounded
Though wounded, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting. One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp across the back in a wound that struck both shoulder blades and a vertebra. Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil thought it was Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton.

Frank, now entirely across Fremont street and still walking at a good pace according to Claiborne&#x27;s testimony, fired twice more before he was shot in the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.

Billy Clanton was shot in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting position near his original position at the corner of the Harwood house in the lot between the house and Fly&#x27;s Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.

A few moments later, Tom McLaury was carried from the corner of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in considerable pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, &quot;They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air.&quot; Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, &quot;Go away and let me die.&quot; Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.

== Outcome of the battle ==

Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.

=== Behan attempts arrest ===
As the wounded lawmen were carried to their homes, they passed in front of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and Johnny Behan told Wyatt Earp, &quot;I will have to arrest you.&quot; Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly: &quot;I won&#x27;t be arrested today. I am right here and am not going away. You have deceived me. You told me these men were disarmed; I went to disarm them.&quot; Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps&#x27; wounds.

=== Cowboy wounds ===
Dr. Henry M. Mathews examined the dead Cowboys late that night. He found Frank McLaury had two wounds: a gunshot beneath the right ear that horizontally penetrated his head, and a second entering his abdomen to the left of his navel. Mathews stated that the wound beneath the ear was at the base of the brain and caused instant death. Sheriff Behan testified that he had heard Morgan Earp yell &quot;I got him&quot; after Frank was shot. However, during the gunfight, Frank moved across Fremont street, putting Holliday on Frank&#x27;s right and Morgan on his left. This makes it much more likely that Holliday shot the fatal round that killed Frank.

When he examined Tom McLaury&#x27;s body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds from a single shotgun blast on the right side under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom&#x27;s hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner&#x27;s exam supported.

Dr. George Goodfellow testified about Billy Clanton&#x27;s wounds at the Spicer hearing. He stated that the angle of the wrist wound indicated that Billy&#x27;s hand could not have been raised over his head as claimed by Cowboy witnesses. In his coroner&#x27;s report, Mathews did not mention Billy&#x27;s arm wound, but witness Keefe, who examined the arm closely, testified later that Clanton was shot through the right arm, close to the wrist joint and the bullet passed through the arm from &quot;inside to outside,&quot; entering the arm close to the base of the thumb, and exiting &quot;on the back of the wrist diagonally&quot; with the latter wound larger. This indicated to the judge that Billy could not have been holding his coat&#x27;s lapels open, his arms raised, as the Cowboys testified. Dr. Mathews found two other wounds on Billy&#x27;s body. The first was from Clanton&#x27;s left nipple, and penetrated his lung. The other was in the abdomen beneath the twelfth rib, to the right of the navel. Both were fired from the front. Neither passed completely through his body. The wound to Billy Clanton&#x27;s right wrist may have been inflicted by Morgan Earp or Doc Holliday immediately at the outset of the fight as Billy was drawing his gun.

=== Weapons carried by the Cowboys ===
; Billy Clanton
Billy Clanton was armed with a Colt Frontier Six-Shooter revolver in .44-40 caliber, which was identified by its serial number at the Spicer hearing. C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton&#x27;s empty revolver in his hand where he lay and took it from him.

; Frank McLaury
Frank McLaury was also armed with a Colt Frontier Six-Shooter in .44-40 caliber, which was recovered by laundryman Fallehy on the street about from his body with two rounds remaining in it. Fallehy placed it next to Frank&#x27;s body before he was moved to the Harwood house. Dr. Mathews laid Frank&#x27;s revolver on the floor while he examined Billy and Tom. Cowboy witness Wes Fuller said he saw Frank in the middle of the street shooting a revolver and trying to remove a Winchester Rifle from the scabbard on his horse. The two Model 1873 rifles were still in the scabbards on Frank and Tom McLaury&#x27;s horses when they were found after the gunfight. If, as was customary, Frank carried only five rounds in his revolver, then he had fired only three shots.

; Tom McLaury
Witnesses differed about whether Tom McLaury was carrying a weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body and he was not wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.

Behan testified that when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom might have had a pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan&#x27;s testimony was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan&#x27;s sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.

A story by Richard Rule in the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the &quot;Nugget&quot;, told the story in the manner of the day, without attribution. Rule wrote, &quot;The Sheriff stepped out and said [to the Earps]: &#x27;Hold up boys, don&#x27;t go down there or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.&#x27;&quot; In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan &quot;was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it.&quot; The &quot;Nugget&quot; had a close relationship to Behan; it was owned by Harry Woods, who was also undersheriff to Behan, but Woods was collecting prisoners in El Paso, Texas, that day. So it is extremely likely that Rule interviewed Behan. Both Virgil and Williams&#x27; testified that Behan visited Virgil Earp that evening and said, &quot;I am your friend, and you did perfectly right.&quot; This corroborated the initial &quot;Nugget&quot; report, which upon Wood&#x27;s return was altered to a version that favored the Cowboys and which Behan later supported in his testimony at the hearing.

Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan had seen Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp and before the gunfight, none of the Earps had any way of knowing that Tom had left his revolver at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert &quot;Chris&quot; Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer&#x27;s butcher shop about 2:00 p.m. He testified that Tom&#x27;s right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom&#x27;s pants. However, the bulge in Tom&#x27;s pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 () in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.

Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday believed that Tom had a revolver at the time of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse&#x27;s neck and believed until he died that Tom&#x27;s revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.

Ruben F. Coleman also said afterward that he thought Tom was armed, though he later equivocated on this point. He was quoted in the October 27 issue of &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; in which he said, &quot;Tom McLaury fell first, but raised and fired again before he died.&quot; Coleman also testified at the coroner&#x27;s inquest one day later. Part-time newspaper reporter Howell &#x27;Pat&#x27; Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, in the Works Progress Administration. When he transcribed Coleman&#x27;s second testimony, he quoted Coleman as saying, &quot;Tom McLaury, after the first two shots were fired, ran down Fremont Street and fell ... I think that the report I gave to the &quot;Epitaph&quot; was pretty near correct as published.&quot; However, it is known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant. Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst &#x27;mutilated&#x27; the transcription. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for.

Even if Tom was not armed with a revolver, Virgil Earp testified Tom attempted to grab a rifle from the scabbard on the horse in front of him before he was killed. Judge Spicer ruled afterward that &quot;if Thomas McLaury was one of a party who were thus armed and were making felonious resistance to an arrest, and in the melee that followed was shot, the fact of his being unarmed, if it be a fact, could not of itself criminate the defendants [Earps], if they were not otherwise criminated.&quot;

; Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne
Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne both said they were unarmed when they fled the gunfight.

== Public reaction ==
The bodies of the three dead Cowboys were displayed in a window at Ritter and Reams undertakers with a sign: &quot;Murdered in the Streets of Tombstone.&quot;

=== Sympathy for Cowboys ===

The funerals for Billy Clanton (age 19), Tom McLaury (age 28) and his older brother Frank (age 33) were well attended. About 300 people joined in the procession to Boot Hill and as many as two thousand watched from the sidewalks. Both McLaurys were buried in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried nearby. The story was widely printed in newspapers across the United States. Most versions favored the lawmen. The headline in the &quot;San Francisco Exchange&quot; was, &quot;A Good Riddance&quot;.

Three days after the shootout, the ruling of the Coroner&#x27;s Jury convened by Dr. Henry Matthews neither condemned nor exonerated the lawmen for shooting the Cowboys. &quot;William Clanton, Frank and Thomas McLaury, came to their deaths in the town of Tombstone on October 26, 1881, from the effects of pistol and gunshot wounds inflicted by Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Wyatt Earp, and one—Holliday, commonly called &#x27;Doc Holliday&#x27;.&quot;

=== Spicer hearings ===

Four days after the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still recovering at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail (), which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps&#x27; efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending the outcome of the trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.

The prosecution was led by Republican District Attorney Lyttleton Price, assisted by John M. Murphy, James Robinson, and Ben Goodrich. They were joined by William McLaury, Frank and Tom&#x27;s older brother, he also being an able attorney, who played a key role on the prosecutor&#x27;s team. The Earps&#x27; attorney Thomas Fitch was an experienced trial lawyer and had earned a reputation as the &quot;silver-tongued orator of the Pacific.&quot;

Spicer took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first.

Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on the third day of the hearing. During two days on the stand, he gave strong testimony that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. Behan&#x27;s views turned public opinion against the Earps, who were free on bail. He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps on the day of the gunfight. On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7. They spent the next 16 days in jail.

Defense accounts contradicted the testimony of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution&#x27;s scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.

Three witnesses gave key evidence that swayed Justice Spicer to hold that Virgil had acted within his capacity as town marshal and that there was insufficient evidence to indict the Earps and Doc Holliday for murder.

H.F Sills was an AT&amp;SF RR engineer who had just arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved. He testified that he saw &quot;the marshal go up and speak to this other party. I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane in his right hand at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. I did not hear the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off.&quot; Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense&#x27;s testimony.

Addie Bourland was a dressmaker whose residence was across Fremont Street from Fly&#x27;s Boarding House. She testified that she saw both sides facing each other, that none of the Cowboys had held their hands up, that the firing was general, and that she had not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified.

Judge J.H. Lucas of the Cochise County Probate Court had offices in the Mining Exchange Building about from the shootout. Lucas corroborated Addie Bourland&#x27;s testimony that Billy Clanton was standing throughout the fight, which contradicted prosecution witnesses who maintained he went down immediately after being shot at close range in the belly. Spicer noted that no powder burns were found on his clothing.

These witnesses&#x27; testimony, especially that of H.F. Sills, a disinterested party, discredited much of the testimony given by Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton and the other Cowboy witnesses.

After hearing all the evidence, Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that Virgil, as the lawman in charge that day, had acted within his office and that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He described Frank McLaury&#x27;s insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a &quot;proposition both monstrous and startling!&quot; He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys&#x27; purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them. Spicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps&#x27; actions and criticized Virgil Earp&#x27;s use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp.

== In popular culture ==

The public perception of the Earp brothers&#x27; actions at the time were widely divergent. Even today, the event and its participants are viewed differently by opinionated admirers and detractors. The controversy still stimulates ongoing interest in the gunfight and related events.

=== Gunfight sketch ===
A hand-drawn sketch of the gunfight was made by John Flood with Wyatt Earp&#x27;s assistance on September 15, 1921; it was sold at auction in October 2010 for $380,000. The map describes the position of a number of witnesses and all of the participants with the exception of Ike Clanton, who fled from the gunfight.

=== Paintings ===
In 1952, Victor Clyde Forsythe, a popular painter of desert scenes and cowboy artist, painted &quot;Gunfight at O.K. Corral&quot;, a oil painting. Forsythe&#x27;s father William Bowen Forsyth and uncle Ira Chandler owned the store Chandler &amp; Forsyth C.O.D. at 328 Fremont Street, west of the back entrance to the O.K. Corral and half a block from the site of the gunfight. They claimed that they had been present and witnessed the shootout. Newspaper accounts of the painting reported that Forsythe had interviewed Tombstone residents and examined many of the existing buildings before beginning to plan his painting. In May 1988, his studio printed and sold a limited edition of 390 copies of the painting.

John Gilchriese became friends with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp&#x27;s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood inherited many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed over a number of years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled &quot;The Street Fight&quot; is . It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese&#x27;s collection, including Wyatt Earp&#x27;s own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10 ().

After Gilchriese closed his museum, the painting and other contents of the museum were sold at auction by John&#x27;s Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for the painting had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final sale price on June 25, 2004, was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014, with an estimated selling price of $40,000–$60,000 but failed to sell.

=== Origin of the gunfight&#x27;s name ===
Less than a month after the shootout it was described by a local newspaper as the &quot;Gunfight at The O.K. Corral&quot;. William Breakenridge in his 1928 book &quot;Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite&quot; described it as &quot;The Incident Near the O.K. Corral&quot;. Stuart Lake titled his chapter about the conflict &quot;At the O.K. Corral&quot; in his popular book &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. But it was the popular movie &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; that cemented the incident and its erroneous location in popular consciousness. The movie and accompanying mythologizing also altered the way that the public thought of the Earps and the outlaws. Prior to the movie, the media often criticized the Earps&#x27; actions in Tombstone. In the movies, they became the good guys, always ready to stand for what is right.

The incident has become a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and the symbolism of the fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt&#x27;s extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people&#x27;s attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.

The town of Tombstone has capitalized on interest in the gunfight. A portion of the town is a historical district that has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed in the &quot;National Register of Historic Places&quot; by the U.S. National Park Service. A local company produces daily theatrical re-enactments of the gunfight.

=== Film and television ===
With the widespread sales of televisions after World War II, producers spun out a large number of western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959, there were more than two dozen &quot;cowboy&quot; programs on each week. At least six of them were directly or indirectly connected with Wyatt Earp: &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Hugh O&#x27;Brian portrayed Earp on the namesake show &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; which ran for six seasons, and he was forever associated with that role.

A 2003 episode of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Unsolved History&quot; used modern technology to attempt to re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm was raised in the manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters&#x27; view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Claiborne) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.

The stories about the gunfight written in the 20th century affected American culture. Numerous dramatic, fictional, and documentary works have been produced about or in reference to the event, with widely varying degrees of accuracy. These works include:

=== In mathematics ===
David Williams and Paul McIlroy introduced a mathematical model for the O.K. Corral gunfight, which they published in &quot;Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society&quot; (1998). Later this model was analyzed by Sir John Kingman (1999, 2002), and Kingman and Volkov (2003). They analyzed the probability of &quot;survival of exactly S gunmen given an initially fair configuration.&quot;

<text>Potassium nitrate is a chemical compound with a sharp, salty, bitter taste and the chemical formula . It is a potassium salt of nitric acid. This salt consists of potassium cations and nitrate anions , and is therefore an alkali metal nitrate. It occurs in nature as a mineral, niter (or &quot;nitre&quot; outside the US). It is a source of nitrogen, and nitrogen was named after niter. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as saltpetre (or &quot;saltpeter&quot; in the US).

Major uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks. It is one of the major constituents of traditional gunpowder (black powder). In processed meats, potassium nitrate reacts with hemoglobin and myoglobin generating a red color, becoming highly toxic and carcinogenic.

==Etymology==
Nitre, or potassium nitrate, because of its early and global use and production, has many names. 

As for nitrate, Egyptian and Hebrew words for it had the consonants n-t-r, indicating likely cognation in the Greek &quot;nitron&quot;, which was Latinised to &quot;nitrum&quot; or &quot;nitrium&quot;. Thence Old French had &quot;niter&quot; and Middle English &quot;nitre&quot;. By the 15th century, Europeans referred to it as &quot;saltpetre&quot;, specifically Indian saltpetre (Chilean saltpetre is sodium nitrate) and later as &quot;nitrate of potash,&quot; as the chemistry of the compound was more fully understood.

The Arabs called it &quot;Chinese snow&quot; () as well as &quot;bārūd&quot; (), a term of uncertain origin that later came to mean gunpowder. It was called &quot;Chinese salt&quot; by the Iranians/Persians or &quot;salt from Chinese salt marshes&quot; ( &quot;&quot;). The Tiangong Kaiwu, published in the 17th century by members of the Qing dynasty, detailed the production of gunpowder and other useful products from nature.

==Historical production==
===From mineral sources===
In Mauryan India saltpeter manufacturers formed the Nuniya &amp; Labana
caste. Saltpeter finds mention in Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra (compiled 300BC – 300AD), which mentions using its poisonous smoke as a weapon of war, although its use for propulsion did not appear until medieval times.

A purification process for potassium nitrate was outlined in 1270 by the chemist and engineer Hasan al-Rammah of Syria in his book &quot;al-Furusiyya wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya&quot; (&quot;The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices&quot;). In this book, al-Rammah describes first the purification of &quot;barud&quot; (crude saltpeter mineral) by boiling it with minimal water and using only the hot solution, then the use of potassium carbonate (in the form of wood ashes) to remove calcium and magnesium by precipitation of their carbonates from this solution, leaving a solution of purified potassium nitrate, which could then be dried. This was used for the manufacture of gunpowder and explosive devices. The terminology used by al-Rammah indicated the gunpowder he wrote about originated in China.

At least as far back as 1845, nitratite deposits were exploited in Chile and California.

===From caves===
Major natural sources of potassium nitrate were the deposits crystallizing from cave walls and the accumulations of bat guano in caves. Extraction is accomplished by immersing the guano in water for a day, filtering, and harvesting the crystals in the filtered water. Traditionally, guano was the source used in Laos for the manufacture of gunpowder for &quot;Bang Fai&quot; rockets.

Calcium nitrate, or lime saltpetre, was discovered on the walls of stables, from the urine of barnyard animals.

=== Nitraries ===

Potassium nitrate was produced in a &quot;nitrary&quot; or &quot;saltpetre works&quot;. The process involved burial of excrements (human or animal) in a field beside the nitraries, watering them and waiting until leaching allowed saltpeter to migrate to the surface by efflorescence. Operators then gathered the resulting powder and transported it to be concentrated by ebullition in the boiler plant.

Besides &quot;Montepellusanus&quot;, during the thirteenth century (and beyond) the only supply of saltpeter across Christian Europe (according to &quot;De Alchimia&quot; in 3 manuscripts of Michael Scot, 1180–1236) was &quot;found in Spain in Aragon in a certain mountain near the sea&quot;.

In 1561, Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland, who was at war with Philip II of Spain, became unable to import saltpeter (of which the Kingdom of England had no home production), and had to pay &quot;300 pounds gold&quot; to the German captain Gerrard Honrik for the manual &quot;Instructions for making saltpeter to growe&quot; (the secret of the &quot;Feuerwerkbuch&quot; -the nitraries-).

=== Nitre bed ===
A &quot;nitre bed&quot; is a similar process used to produce nitrate from excrement. Unlike the leaching-based process of the nitrary, however, one mixes the excrements with soil and waits for soil microbes to convert amino-nitrogen into nitrates by nitrification. The nitrates are extracted from soil with water and then purified into saltpeter by adding wood ash. The process was discovered in the early 15th century and was very widely used until the Chilean mineral deposits were found.

The Confederate side of the American Civil War had a significant shortage of saltpeter. As a result, the Nitre and Mining Bureau was set up to encourage local production, including by nitre beds and by providing excrement to government nitraries. On November 13, 1862, the government advertised in the Charleston Daily Courier for 20 or 30 &quot;able bodied Negro men&quot; to work in the new nitre beds at Ashley Ferry, S.C. The nitre beds were large rectangles of rotted manure and straw, moistened weekly with urine, &quot;dung water&quot;, and liquid from privies, cesspools and drains, and turned over regularly. The National Archives published payroll records that account for more than 29,000 people compelled to such labor in the state of Virginia. The South was so desperate for saltpeter for gunpowder that one Alabama official reportedly placed a newspaper ad asking that the contents of chamber pots be saved for collection. In South Carolina, in April 1864, the Confederate government forced 31 enslaved people to work at the Ashley Ferry Nitre Works, outside Charleston.

Perhaps the most exhaustive discussion of the niter-bed production is the 1862 LeConte text. He was writing with the express purpose of increasing production in the Confederate States to support their needs during the American Civil War. Since he was calling for the assistance of rural farming communities, the descriptions and instructions are both simple and explicit. He details the &quot;French Method&quot;, along with several variations, as well as a &quot;Swiss method&quot;. N.B. Many references have been made to a method using only straw and urine, but there is no such method in this work.

====French method====
Turgot and Lavoisier created the &quot;Régie des Poudres et Salpêtres&quot; a few years before the French Revolution. Niter-beds were prepared by mixing manure with either mortar or wood ashes, common earth and organic materials such as straw to give porosity to a compost pile typically high, wide, and long. The heap was usually under a cover from the rain, kept moist with urine, turned often to accelerate the decomposition, then finally leached with water after approximately one year, to remove the soluble calcium nitrate which was then converted to potassium nitrate by filtering through potash.

====Swiss method====
Joseph LeConte describes a process using only urine and not dung, referring to it as the &quot;Swiss method&quot;. Urine is collected directly, in a sandpit under a stable. The sand itself is dug out and leached for nitrates which are then converted to potassium nitrate using potash, as above.

===From nitric acid===
From 1903 until the World War I era, potassium nitrate for black powder and fertilizer was produced on an industrial scale from nitric acid produced using the Birkeland–Eyde process, which used an electric arc to oxidize nitrogen from the air. During World War I the newly industrialized Haber process (1913) was combined with the Ostwald process after 1915, allowing Germany to produce nitric acid for the war after being cut off from its supplies of mineral sodium nitrates from Chile (see nitratite).

==Modern production==
Potassium nitrate can be made by combining ammonium nitrate and potassium hydroxide.

An alternative way of producing potassium nitrate without a by-product of ammonia is to combine ammonium nitrate, found in instant ice packs, and potassium chloride, easily obtained as a sodium-free salt substitute.

Potassium nitrate can also be produced by neutralizing nitric acid with potassium hydroxide. This reaction is highly exothermic.

On industrial scale it is prepared by the double displacement reaction between sodium nitrate and potassium chloride.

==Properties==
Potassium nitrate has an orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature, which transforms to a trigonal system at . On cooling from , another trigonal phase forms between and .

Sodium nitrate is isomorphous with calcite, the most stable form of calcium carbonate, whereas room-temperature potassium nitrate is isomorphous with aragonite, a slightly less stable polymorph of calcium carbonate. The difference is attributed to the similarity in size between nitrate () and carbonate () ions and the fact that the potassium ion () is larger than sodium () and calcium () ions.

In the room-temperature structure of potassium nitrate, each potassium ion is surrounded by 6 nitrate ions. In turn, each nitrate ion is surrounded by 6 potassium ions.

Potassium nitrate is moderately soluble in water, but its solubility increases with temperature. The aqueous solution is almost neutral, exhibiting pH 6.2 at for a 10% solution of commercial powder. It is not very hygroscopic, absorbing about 0.03% water in 80% relative humidity over 50 days. It is insoluble in alcohol and is not poisonous; it can react explosively with reducing agents, but it is not explosive on its own.

===Thermal decomposition===
Between , potassium nitrate reaches a temperature-dependent equilibrium with potassium nitrite:

==Uses==
Potassium nitrate has a wide variety of uses, largely as a source of nitrate.

===Nitric acid production===
Historically, nitric acid was produced by combining sulfuric acid with nitrates such as saltpeter. In modern times this is reversed: nitrates are produced from nitric acid produced via the Ostwald process.

===Oxidizer===

The most famous use of potassium nitrate is probably as the oxidizer in blackpowder. From the most ancient times until the late 1880s, blackpowder provided the explosive power for all the world&#x27;s firearms. After that time, small arms and large artillery increasingly began to depend on cordite, a smokeless powder. Blackpowder remains in use today in black powder rocket motors, but also in combination with other fuels like sugars in &quot;rocket candy&quot; (a popular amateur rocket propellant). It is also used in fireworks such as smoke bombs. It is also added to cigarettes to maintain an even burn of the tobacco and is used to ensure complete combustion of paper cartridges for cap and ball revolvers. It can also be heated to several hundred degrees to be used for niter bluing, which is less durable than other forms of protective oxidation, but allows for specific coloration of steel parts, such as screws, pins, and other small parts of firearms.

===Meat processing===
Potassium nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since antiquity or the Middle Ages. The widespread adoption of nitrate use is more recent and is linked to the development of large-scale meat processing. The use of potassium nitrate has been mostly discontinued because it gives slow and inconsistent results compared with sodium nitrite preparations such as &quot;Prague powder&quot; or pink &quot;curing salt&quot;. Even so, potassium nitrate is still used in some food applications, such as salami, dry-cured ham, charcuterie, and (in some countries) in the brine used to make corned beef (sometimes together with sodium nitrite). In the Shetland Islands (UK) it is used in the curing of mutton to make reestit mutton, a local delicacy. When used as a food additive in the European Union, the compound is referred to as E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the United States and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 252).

====Possible cancer risk====
Since October 2015, WHO classifies processed meat as Group 1 carcinogen (based on epidemiological studies, convincingly carcinogenic to humans).

In April 2023 the French Court of Appeals of Limoges confirmed that food-watch NGO Yuka was legally legitimate in describing Potassium Nitrate E249 to E252 as a &quot;cancer risk&quot;, and thus rejected an appeal by the French industry against the organisation.

===Fertilizer===
Potassium nitrate is used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and potassium – two of the macronutrients for plants. When used by itself, it has an NPK rating of 13-0-44.

===Pharmacology===
* Used in some toothpastes for sensitive teeth. It has been used since 1980, although the efficacy is not strongly supported by the literature.
* Used historically to treat asthma. Used in some toothpastes to relieve asthma symptoms.
* Used in Thailand as main ingredient in kidney tablets to relieve the symptoms of cystitis, pyelitis and urethritis.
* Combats high blood pressure and was once used as a hypotensive.

===Other uses===
* Used as an electrolyte in a salt bridge.
* Active ingredient of condensed aerosol fire suppression systems. When burned with the free radicals of a fire&#x27;s flame, it produces potassium carbonate.
* Works as an aluminium cleaner.
* Component (usually about 98%) of some tree stump removal products. It accelerates the natural decomposition of the stump by supplying nitrogen for the fungi attacking the wood of the stump.
* In heat treatment of metals as a medium temperature molten salt bath, usually in combination with sodium nitrite. A similar bath is used to produce a durable blue/black finish typically seen on firearms. Its oxidizing quality, water solubility, and low cost make it an ideal short-term rust inhibitor.
* In glass toughening: molten potassium nitrate bath is used to increase glass strength and scratch-resistance.
* To induce flowering of mango trees in the Philippines.
* Thermal storage medium in power generation systems. Sodium and potassium nitrate salts are stored in a molten state with the solar energy collected by the heliostats at the Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. salts, with the addition of calcium nitrate or lithium nitrate, have been found to improve the heat storage capacity in the molten salts.
* As a source of potassium ions for exchange with sodium ions in chemically strengthened glass.
* As an oxidizer in model rocket fuel called Rocket candy.
* As a constituent in homemade smoke bombs.

==In folklore and popular culture==
Potassium nitrate was once thought to induce impotence, and is still rumored to be in institutional food (such as military fare). There is no scientific evidence for such properties. In &quot;Bank Shot&quot;, El (Joanna Cassidy) propositions Walter Ballantine (George C. Scott), who tells her that he has been fed saltpeter in prison. In &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, Randle is asked by the nurses to take his medications, but not knowing what they are, he mentions he does not want anyone to &quot;slip me saltpeter&quot;. He then proceeds to imitate the motions of masturbation.

In &quot;1776&quot;, John Adams asks his wife Abigail to make saltpeter for the Continental Army. She, eventually, is able to do so in exchange for pins for sewing.

In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Arena&quot;, Captain Kirk injures a gorn using a rudimentary cannon that he constructs using potassium nitrate as a key ingredient of gunpowder.

In &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, Jenko, played by Channing Tatum, gives a rhyming presentation about potassium nitrate for his chemistry class.

In &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, Paul hires a dominatrix to impersonate a nurse and trick Raoul into consuming saltpeter in a ploy to reduce his sexual appetite for his wife.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Our Homer)&quot;, Mr. Burns is seen pouring saltpeter into his chili entry, titled Old Elihu&#x27;s Yale-Style Saltpeter Chili.

In the &quot;Sharpe&quot; novel series by Bernard Cornwell, numerous mentions are made of an advantageous supply of saltpeter from India being a crucial component of British military supremacy in the Napoleonic Wars. In &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Havoc&quot;, the French Captain Argenton laments that France needs to scrape its supply from cesspits.

In the &quot;Dr. Stone&quot; anime and manga series, the struggle for control over a natural saltpeter source from guano features prominently in the plot.

In the farming lore from the Corn Belt of the 1800s, drought-killed corn in manured fields could accumulate saltpeter to the extent that upon opening the stalk for examination it would &quot;fall as a fine powder upon the table&quot;.

In the Slovenian short story Martin Krpan from Vrh pri Sveti Trojici, the titular character and Slovene folk hero Martin Krpan illegally smuggles &quot;English salt&quot; for a living. The exact nature of &quot;English salt&quot; is a matter of debate, but it may have been a euphemism for potassium nitrate (saltpeter) due to its role in manufacturing gunpowder.

In &#x27;s first episode, Dexter&#x27;s first victim uses potassium nitrate to kill her victims.

<text>The history of Iran (or Persia, as it was known in the Western world) is intertwined with Greater Iran, a sociocultural region spanning from Anatolia to the Indus River and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf. Central to this area is modern-day Iran, which covers the bulk of the Iranian plateau.

Iran is home to one of the world&#x27;s oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC. The western part of the Iranian plateau participated in the traditional ancient Near East with Elam (in Ilam and Khuzestan), Kassites (in Kuhdesht), Gutians (in Luristan) and later with other peoples such as the Urartians (in Oshnavieh and Sardasht) in the southwest of Lake Urmia and Mannaeans (in Piranshahr, Saqqez and Bukan) in the Kurdish area. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel called the Persians the &quot;first Historical People&quot;. The Iranian empire began in the Iron Age with the rise of the Medes, who unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC. The Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), founded by Cyrus the Great, was the largest empire the world had seen, spanning from the Balkans to North Africa and Central Asia. They were succeeded by the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian empires, who governed Iran for almost 1,000 years, making Iran a leading power once again. Persia&#x27;s arch-rival during this time was the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire.

Iran endured invasions by the Macedonians, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols. Despite these invasions, Iran continually reasserted its national identity and developed as a distinct political and cultural entity. The Muslim conquest of Persia (632–654) ended the Sasanian Empire and marked a turning point in Iranian history, leading to the Islamization of Iran from the eighth to tenth centuries and the decline of Zoroastrianism. However, the achievements of prior Persian civilizations were absorbed into the new Islamic polity. Iran suffered invasions by nomadic tribes during the Late Middle Ages and early modern period, negatively impacting the region. Iran was reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid dynasty, which established Shia Islam as the empire&#x27;s official religion, marking a significant turning point in the history of Islam. Iran functioned again as a leading world power, especially in rivalry with the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, Iran lost significant territories in the Caucasus to the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian Wars.

Iran remained a monarchy until the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when it officially became an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979. Since then, Iran has experienced significant political, social, and economic changes. The establishment of the &quot;Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; led to the restructuring of its political system, with Ayatollah Khomeini as the Supreme Leader. Iran&#x27;s foreign relations have been shaped by the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), ongoing tensions with the United States, and its nuclear program, which has been a point of contention in international diplomacy. Despite economic sanctions and internal challenges, Iran remains a key player in Middle Eastern and global geopolitics.

==Prehistory==

===Paleolithic===
The earliest archaeological artifacts in Iran were found in the Kashafrud and Ganj Par sites that are thought to date back to 10,000 years ago in the Middle Paleolithic. Mousterian stone tools made by Neanderthals have also been found. There are more cultural remains of Neanderthals dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period, which mainly have been found in the Zagros region and fewer in central Iran at sites such as Kobeh, Kunji, Bisitun Cave, Tamtama, Warwasi, and Yafteh Cave. In 1949, a Neanderthal radius was discovered by Carleton S. Coon in Bisitun Cave. Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros Mountains in the caves of Kermanshah and Khorramabad and a few number of sites in Piranshahr, Alborz and Central Iran. During this time, people began creating rock art.

===Neolithic to Chalcolithic===
Early agricultural communities such as Chogha Golan in 10,000 BC along with settlements such as Chogha Bonut (the earliest village in Elam) in 8000 BC, began to flourish in and around the Zagros Mountains region in western Iran. Around about the same time, the earliest-known clay vessels and modelled human and animal terracotta figurines were produced at Ganj Dareh, also in western Iran. There are also 10,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Tepe Sarab in Kermanshah Province among many other ancient artefacts.

The south-western part of Iran was part of the Fertile Crescent where most of humanity&#x27;s first major crops were grown, in villages such as Susa (where a settlement was first founded possibly as early as 4395 cal BC) and settlements such as Chogha Mish, dating back to 6800 BC; there are 7,000-year-old jars of wine excavated in the Zagros Mountains (now on display at the University of Pennsylvania) and ruins of 7000-year-old settlements such as Tepe Sialk are further testament to that. The two main Neolithic Iranian settlements were Ganj Dareh and the hypothetical Zayandeh River Culture.

===Bronze Age===

Parts of what is modern-day northwestern Iran was part of the Kura–Araxes culture (circa 3400 BC—ca. 2000 BC), that stretched up into the neighbouring regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia.

Susa is one of the oldest-known settlements of Iran and the world. Based on C14 dating, the time of the foundation of the city is as early as 4395 BC, a time right after the establishment of the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk in 4500 BC. The general perception among archaeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, hence incorporating many aspects of Mesopotamian culture. In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state founded 4000 BC. There are also dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC. One of the earliest civilizations on the Iranian plateau was the Jiroft culture in southeastern Iran in the province of Kerman.

It is one of the most artefact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East. Archaeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC. There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs. The objects and their iconography are considered unique. Many are made from chlorite, a grey-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli. Recent excavations at the sites have produced the world&#x27;s earliest inscription which pre-dates Mesopotamian inscriptions.

There are records of numerous other ancient civilizations on the Iranian plateau before the emergence of Iranian peoples during the Early Iron Age. The Early Bronze Age saw the rise of urbanization into organized city-states and the invention of writing (the Uruk period) in the Near East. While Bronze Age Elam made use of writing from an early time, the Proto-Elamite script remains undeciphered, and records from Sumer pertaining to Elam are scarce.

Russian historian Igor M. Diakonoff stated that the modern inhabitants of Iran are descendants of mainly non-Indo-European groups, more specifically of pre-Iranic inhabitants of the Iranian Plateau: &quot;It is the autochthones of the Iranian plateau, and not the Proto-Indo-European tribes of Europe, which are, in the main, the ancestors, in the physical sense of the word, of the present-day Iranians.&quot;

===Early Iron Age===

Records become more tangible with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its records of incursions from the Iranian plateau.
As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian plateau from the Pontic–Caspian steppe. The arrival of Iranians on the Iranian plateau forced the Elamites to relinquish one area of their empire after another and to take refuge in Elam, Khuzestan and the nearby area, which only then became coterminous with Elam. Bahman Firuzmandi say that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau.
By the mid-first millennium BC, Medes, Persians, and Parthians populated the Iranian plateau. Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under Assyrian domination, like the rest of the Near East. In the first half of the first millennium BC, parts of what is now Iranian Azerbaijan were incorporated into Urartu.

==Classical antiquity==
===Median and Achaemenid Empire (678–330 BC)===


In 646 BC, Assyrian king Ashurbanipal sacked Susa, which ended Elamite supremacy in the region. For over 150 years Assyrian kings of nearby Northern Mesopotamia had been wanting to conquer Median tribes of Western Iran. Under pressure from Assyria, the small kingdoms of the western Iranian plateau coalesced into increasingly larger and more centralized states.

In the second half of the seventh century BC, the Medes gained their independence and were united by Deioces. In 612 BC, Cyaxares, Deioces&#x27; grandson, and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar invaded Assyria and laid siege to and eventually destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, which led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Urartu was later on conquered and dissolved as well by the Medes. The Medes are credited with founding Iran as a nation and empire, and established the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified empire of the Medes and Persians, leading to the Achaemenid Empire (c.550–330 BC).

Cyrus the Great overthrew, in turn, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. He was better able, through more benign policies, to reconcile his subjects to Persian rule; the longevity of his empire was one result. The Persian king, like the Assyrian, was also &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām&quot; (&quot;shāhanshāh&quot; in modern Persian) – &quot;great king&quot;, Megas Basileus, as known by the Greeks.

Cyrus&#x27;s son, Cambyses II, conquered the last major power of the region, ancient Egypt, causing the collapse of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Since he became ill and died before, or while, leaving Egypt, stories developed, as related by Herodotus, that he was struck down for impiety against the ancient Egyptian deities. After the death of Cambyses II, Darius ascended the throne by overthrowing the legitimate Achaemenid monarch Bardiya, and then quelling rebellions throughout his kingdom. As the winner, Darius I, based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the Achaemenid Empire.

Darius&#x27; first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at Persepolis. He rebuilt a canal between the Nile and the Red Sea, a forerunner of the modern Suez Canal. He improved the extensive road system, and it is during his reign that mentions are first made of the Royal Road (shown on map), a great highway stretching all the way from Susa to Sardis with posting stations at regular intervals. Major reforms took place under Darius. Coinage, in the form of the &quot;daric&quot; (gold coin) and the shekel (silver coin) was standardized (coinage had already been invented over a century before in Lydia c. 660 BC but not standardized), and administrative efficiency increased.

The Old Persian language appears in royal inscriptions, written in a specially adapted version of the cuneiform script. Under Cyrus the Great and Darius I, the Persian Empire eventually became the largest empire in human history up until that point, ruling and administrating over most of the then known world, as well as spanning the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The greatest achievement was the empire itself. The Persian Empire represented the world&#x27;s first superpower that was based on a model of tolerance and respect for other cultures and religions.
In the late sixth century BC, Darius launched his European campaign, in which he defeated the Paeonians, conquered Thrace, and subdued all coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating the European Scythians around the Danube river. In 512/511 BC, Macedon became a vassal kingdom of Persia.

In 499 BC, Athens lent support to a revolt in Miletus, which resulted in the sacking of Sardis. This led to an Achaemenid campaign against mainland Greece known as the Greco-Persian Wars, which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC, and is known as one of the most important wars in European history. In the First Persian invasion of Greece, the Persian general Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia. The war eventually turned out in defeat, however. Darius&#x27; successor Xerxes I launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including all territories to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth, however, this was also turned out in a Greek victory, following the battles of Plataea and Salamis, by which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and eventually withdrew from it. During the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians gained major territorial advantages. They captured and razed Athens twice, once in 480 BC and again in 479 BC. However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw, thus losing control of Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. Fighting continued for several decades after the successful Greek repelling of the Second Invasion with numerous Greek city-states under the Athens&#x27; newly formed Delian League, which eventually ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. In 404 BC, following the death of Darius II, Egypt rebelled under Amyrtaeus. Later pharaohs successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by Artaxerxes III.
===Greek conquest and Seleucid Empire (312 BC–248 BC)===

From 334 BC to 331 BC, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III in the battles of Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, swiftly conquering the Achaemanid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander&#x27;s empire broke up shortly after his death, and Alexander&#x27;s general, Seleucus I Nicator, tried to take control of Iran, Mesopotamia, and later Syria and Anatolia. His empire was the Seleucid Empire. He was killed in 281 BC by Ptolemy Keraunos.

===Parthian Empire (248 BC–224 AD)===


The Parthian Empireruled by the Parthians, a group of northwestern Iranian peoplewas the realm of the Arsacid dynasty. This latter reunited and governed the Iranian plateau after the Parni conquest of Parthia and defeating the Seleucid Empire in the late third century BC. It intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between and absorbed Eastern Arabia.

Parthia was the eastern arch-enemy of the Roman Empire and it limited Rome&#x27;s expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia). The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily armed and armored cataphracts and the lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers.

For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. The Parthian shot used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the Battle of Carrhae. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to annex each other&#x27;s territory.

The Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire&#x27;s organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire&#x27;s vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians. However, the Arsacid dynasty continued to exist for centuries onwards in Armenia, the Iberia, and the Caucasian Albania, which were all eponymous branches of the dynasty.

===Sasanian Empire (224–651 AD)===


The first shah of the Sasanian Empire, Ardashir I, started reforming the country economically and militarily. For a period of more than 400 years, Iran was once again one of the leading powers in the world, alongside its neighbouring rival, the Roman and then Byzantine Empires. The empire&#x27;s territory, at its height, encompassed all of today&#x27;s Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Abkhazia, Dagestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, parts of Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, parts of Pakistan, Central Asia, Eastern Arabia, and parts of Egypt.

Most of the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s lifespan was overshadowed by the frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, a continuation of the Roman–Parthian Wars and the all-comprising Roman–Persian Wars; the last was the longest-lasting conflict in human history. Started in the first century BC by their predecessors, the Parthians, and Romans, the last Roman–Persian War was fought in the seventh century. The Persians defeated the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 260 and took emperor Valerian prisoner for the remainder of his life.

Eastern Arabia was conquered early on. During Khosrow II&#x27;s rule in 590–628, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon were also annexed to the Empire. The Sassanians called their empire &quot;Erânshahr&quot; (&quot;Dominion of the Aryans&quot;, i.e., of Iranians).

A chapter of Iran&#x27;s history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the Roman Empire. During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in Anatolia, the western Caucasus (mainly Lazica and the Kingdom of Iberia; modern-day Georgia and Abkhazia), Mesopotamia, Armenia and the Levant. Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians.

However, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a &quot;casus belli&quot; to attack the Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman–Persian Wars through the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, which included the very siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, the war-exhausted Persians lost the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (632) in Hilla (present-day Iraq) to the invading Muslim forces.

The Sasanian era, encompassing the length of Late Antiquity, is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways, the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam. Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably during Sassanian times, their cultural influence extending far beyond the empire&#x27;s territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India and also playing a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art.

This influence carried forward to the Muslim world. The dynasty&#x27;s unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing, and other contributions to civilization, were taken from the Sassanian Persians into the broader Muslim world.
==Medieval period==
===Early Islamic period===
====Islamic conquest of Persia (633–651)====

In 633, when the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III was ruling over Iran, the Muslims under Umar invaded the country right after it had been in a bloody civil war. Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the House of Karen, and later Kanarangiyans of Khorasan, mutinied against their Sasanian overlords. Although the House of Mihran had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals Bahrām Chōbin and Shahrbaraz, it remained loyal to the Sasanians during their struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the House of Ispahbudhan, under their leader Farrukhzad, who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III.

Yazdegerd III fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at Merv in 651. By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of Transoxiana).

The Muslim conquest of Persia ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam. Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded but were absorbed by the new Islamic polity. As Bernard Lewis has commented:
====Umayyad era and Muslim incursions into the Caspian coast====

After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were undoubtedly either Persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the seventh century, when in 692 minting began at the capital, Damascus. The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian coins (as well as Byzantine), and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic alphabet.

During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who was not happy with the prevalence of the Persian language in the divan, ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force. In al-Biruni&#x27;s &quot;From The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries&quot; for example it is written:
There are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as setting up the &quot;dhimmah&quot; to increase taxes from the &quot;dhimmis&quot; to benefit the Muslim Arab community financially and by discouraging conversion. Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues.

In the 7th century, when many non-Arabs such as Persians entered Islam, they were recognized as mawali (&quot;clients&quot;) and treated as second-class citizens by the ruling Arab elite until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of &quot;mawali&quot;. The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.

However, all of Iran was still not under Arab control, and the region of Daylam was under the control of the Daylamites, while Tabaristan was under Dabuyid and Paduspanid control, and the Mount Damavand region under Masmughans of Damavand. The Arabs had invaded these regions several times but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, known as Farrukhan the Great (r. 712–728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, who was defeated by a combined Dailamite-Dabuyid army, and was forced to retreat from Tabaristan.

With the death of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 743, the Islamic world was launched into civil war. Abu Muslim was sent to Khorasan by the Abbasid Caliphate initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf. He took Merv defeating the Umayyad governor there Nasr ibn Sayyar. He became the de facto Abbasid governor of Khurasan. During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid declared independence from the Umayyads but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority. In 750, Abu Muslim became the leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab. Abu Muslim stormed Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, later that year.

==== Abbasid period and autonomous Iranian dynasties ====


The Abbasid army consisted primarily of Khorasanians and was led by an Iranian general, Abu Muslim Khorasani. It contained both Iranian and Arab elements, and the Abbasids enjoyed both Iranian and Arab support. The Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750. According to Amir Arjomand, the Abbasid Revolution essentially marked the end of the Arab empire and the beginning of a more inclusive, multi-ethnic state in the Middle East.

One of the first changes the Abbasids made after taking power from the Umayyads was to move the empire&#x27;s capital from Damascus, in the Levant, to Iraq. The latter region was influenced by Persian history and culture, and moving the capital was part of the Persian mawali demand for Arab influence in the empire. The city of Baghdad was constructed on the Tigris River, in 762, to serve as the new Abbasid capital.

The Abbasids established the position of vizier like Barmakids in their administration, which was the equivalent of a &quot;vice-caliph&quot;, or second-in-command. Eventually, this change meant that many caliphs under the Abbasids ended up in a much more ceremonial role than ever before, with the vizier in real power. A new Persian bureaucracy began to replace the old Arab aristocracy, and the entire administration reflected these changes, demonstrating that the new dynasty was different in many ways from the Umayyads.

By the 9th century, Abbasid control began to wane as regional leaders sprang up in the far corners of the empire to challenge the central authority of the Abbasid caliphate. The Abbasid caliphs began enlisting &quot;mamluks&quot;, Turkic-speaking warriors, who had been moving out of Central Asia into Transoxiana as slave warriors as early as the 9th century. Shortly thereafter the real power of the Abbasid caliphs began to wane; eventually, they became religious figureheads while the warrior slaves ruled.
The 9th century also saw the revolt by native Zoroastrians, known as the Khurramites, against oppressive Arab rule. The movement was led by a Persian freedom fighter Babak Khorramdin. Babak&#x27;s Iranianizing rebellion, from its base in Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, called for a return of the political glories of the Iranian past. The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of Iran and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed by Afshin, a senior general of the Abbasid Caliphate.

As the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (821–873); the Saffarids in Sistan (861–1003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the Samanids (819–1005), originally at Bukhara. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.

By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buyid dynasty (934–1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the Seljuq Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them. The balance of power in Baghdad remained as such – with the Abbasids in power in name only – until the Mongol invasion of 1258 sacked the city and definitively ended the Abbasid dynasty.

During the Abbasid period an enfranchisement was experienced by the &quot;mawali&quot; and a shift was made in political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire and c. 930 a requirement was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire be Muslim.

====Islamic golden age, Shu&#x27;ubiyya movement and Persianization process====

Islamization was a long process by which Islam was gradually adopted by the majority population of Iran. Richard Bulliet&#x27;s &quot;conversion curve&quot; indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric Umayyad period. Beginning in the Abbasid period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.

Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks participated in this attempt.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah created a movement called Shu&#x27;ubiyyah in response to the privileged status of Arabs. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested. Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context.

The Samanid dynasty led the revival of Persian culture and the first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture.

The culmination of the Persianization movement was the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian. This voluminous work, reflects Iran&#x27;s ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion, and its sense of nationhood. According to Bernard Lewis:

&quot;Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran re-emerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavour, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna...&quot;

The Islamization of Iran was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran&#x27;s society: The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine and art became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the &quot;crossroads of the major cultural highways&quot;, contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot;. During this period, hundreds of scholars and scientists vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during the Renaissance.

The most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or lived in Iran, including the most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Hakim al-Nishaburi, Imam Muslim and Imam Bukhari, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al-Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Avicenna and Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī, and the greatest shaykhs of Sufism like Rumi and Abdul-Qadir Gilani.

====Persianate states and dynasties (977–1219)====

In 977, a Turkic governor of the Samanids, Sabuktigin, conquered Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the Ghaznavids, that lasted to 1186. The Ghaznavid empire grew by taking all of the Samanid territories south of the Amu Darya in the last decade of the 10th century, and eventually occupied parts of Eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north-west India.

The Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into a mainly Hindu India. The invasion of India was undertaken in 1000 by the Ghaznavid ruler, Mahmud, and continued for several years. They were unable to hold power for long, however, particularly after the death of Mahmud in 1030. By 1040 the Seljuqs had taken over the Ghaznavid lands in Iran.

The Seljuqs, who like the Ghaznavids were Persianate in nature and of Turkic origin, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. The dynasty had its origins in the Turcoman tribal confederations of Central Asia and marked the beginning of Turkic power in the Middle East. They established a Sunni Muslim rule over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries. They set up an empire known as Great Seljuq Empire that stretched from Anatolia in the west to western Afghanistan in the east and the western borders of (modern-day) China in the north-east; and was the target of the First Crusade. Today they are regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, and they are remembered as great patrons of Persian culture, art, literature, and language.

The founder of the dynasty, Tughril Beg, turned his army against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg&#x27;s successor, Malik Shah (1072–1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the observatory where Omar Khayyám did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns. They brought Abu Hamid Ghazali, one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuq capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.

When Malik Shah I died in 1092, the empire split as his brother and four sons quarreled over the apportioning of the empire among themselves. In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by Kilij Arslan I who founded the Sultanate of Rûm and in Syria by his brother Tutush I. In Persia he was succeeded by his son Mahmud I whose reign was contested by his other three brothers Barkiyaruq in Iraq, Muhammad I in Baghdad and Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan. As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the Khwarezmshahs. The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia. Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran. In 1194 the Khwarezmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish defeated the Seljuq sultan Toghrul III in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia remained.

A serious internal threat to the Seljuqs during their reign came from the Nizari Ismailis, a secret sect with headquarters at Alamut Castle between Rasht and Tehran. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word &quot;assassin&quot; derive from these killers.

Parts of northwestern Iran were conquered in the early 13th century AD by the Kingdom of Georgia, led by Tamar the Great.

===Mongol conquest and rule (1219–1358)===
====Mongol invasion (1219–1221)====

The Khwarazmian dynasty only lasted for a few decades, until the arrival of the Mongols. Genghis Khan had unified the Mongols, and under him the Mongol Empire quickly expanded in several directions. In 1218, it bordered Khwarezm. At that time, the Khwarazmian Empire was ruled by Ala ad-Din Muhammad (1200–1220). Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph Al-Nasir. When the caliph rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad proclaimed one of his nobles caliph and unsuccessfully tried to depose an-Nasir.

The Mongol invasion of Iran began in 1219, after two diplomatic missions to Khwarezm sent by Genghis Khan had been massacred. During 1220–21 Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered. The Khwarezm-Shah fled, to die on an island off the Caspian coast.

During the invasion of Transoxiana in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle, they were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time.

While Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Persia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving in Genghis&#x27;s army. &quot;Whole regiments&quot; entirely made out of Chinese were used by the Mongols to command bomb hurling trebuchets during the invasion of Iran. Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia. One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar. Books written around the area afterward depicted gunpowder weapons which resembled those of China.

==== Destruction under the Mongols ====
Before his death in 1227, Genghis had reached western Azerbaijan, pillaging and burning many cities along the way after entering into Iran from its north east.

The Mongol invasion was by and large disastrous to the Iranians. Although the Mongol invaders eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction in Iran and other regions of the Islamic heartland (particularly the historical Khorasan region, mainly in Central Asia) marked a major change of direction for the region. Much of the six centuries of Islamic scholarship, culture, and infrastructure was destroyed as the invaders leveled cities, burned libraries, and in some cases replaced mosques with Buddhist temples.

The Mongols killed many Iranian civilians. Destruction of qanat irrigation systems in the north east of Iran destroyed the pattern of relatively continuous settlements, producing many abandoned towns which were relatively quite good with irrigation and agriculture.

==== Ilkhanate (1256–1335)====


After Genghis&#x27;s death, Iran was ruled by several Mongol commanders. Genghis&#x27; grandson, Hulagu Khan, was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion. However, by the time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions. Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next eighty years and become Persian in the process.

Hulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death. The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the Mamelukes, however, at the Battle of Ain Jalut in Palestine in 1260. Hulagu&#x27;s campaigns against the Muslims also enraged Berke, khan of the Golden Horde and a convert to Islam. Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire.

The rule of Hulagu&#x27;s great-grandson, Ghazan (1295–1304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, Rashid al-Din, brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival. The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes. As a result, commerce increased dramatically.

Items from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran. For example, Iranians developed a new style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China. After Ghazan&#x27;s nephew Abu Said died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the Jalayirids, Muzaffarids, Sarbadars and Kartids.

The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country&#x27;s population.

==== Sunnism and Shiism in pre-Safavid Iran ====
Prior to the rise of the Safavid Empire, Sunni Islam was the dominant religion, accounting for around 90% of the population at the time. According to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids. The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran. The writers of The Four Books of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars.

The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaydīs of Tabaristan (see Alid dynasties of northern Iran), the Buyids, the Kakuyids, the rule of Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304–1316) and the Sarbedaran.

Apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original Imami Shiism as well as Zaydī Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah. Shiism was the dominant sect in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar. In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.

During the 10th and 11th centuries, Fatimids sent Ismailis Da&#x27;i (missioners) to Iran as well as other Muslim lands. When Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in Iran. Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured Alamut in 1090 AD. Nizaris used this fortress until a Mongol raid in 1256.

After the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered. Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official madhhab. Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose centre wasn&#x27;t in Iran at that time. Several local Shia dynasties like Sarbadars were established during this time.

The main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when Ismail I founded the Safavid dynasty and initiated a religious policy to recognize Shi&#x27;a Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi&#x27;ite state is a direct result of Ismail&#x27;s actions.

=== Timurid Empire (1370–1507) ===


Iran remained divided until the arrival of Timur, a Turco-Mongol belonging to the Timurid dynasty. Like its predecessors, the Timurid Empire was also part of the Persianate world. After establishing a power base in Transoxiana, Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur&#x27;s campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.

His regime was characterized by tyranny and bloodshed, but also by its inclusion of Iranians in administrative roles and its promotion of architecture and poetry. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to Black Sheep Turkmen. The Black Sheep Turkmen were conquered by the White Sheep Turkmen under Uzun Hasan in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

Sufi poet Hafez&#x27;s popularity became firmly established in the Timurid era that saw the compilation and widespread copying of his &quot;divan&quot;. Sufis were often persecuted by orthodox Muslims who considered their teachings blasphemous. Sufism developed a symbolic language rich with metaphors to obscure poetic references to provocative philosophical teachings. Hafez concealed his own Sufi faith, even as he employed the secret language of Sufism (developed over hundreds of years) in his own work, and he is sometimes credited with having &quot;brought it to perfection&quot;. His work was imitated by Jami, whose own popularity grew to spread across the full breadth of the Persianate world.

===Kara Koyunlu===

The Kara Koyunlu were a Turkmen tribal federation that ruled over northwestern Iran and surrounding areas from 1374 to 1468 CE. The Kara Koyunlu expanded their conquest to Baghdad, however, internal fighting, defeats by the Timurids, rebellions by the Armenians in response to their persecution, and failed struggles with the Ag Qoyunlu led to their eventual demise.

=== Ak Koyunlu ===
Aq Qoyunlu were Turkmen under the leadership of the Bayandur tribe, tribal federation of Sunni Muslims who ruled over most of Iran and large parts of surrounding areas from 1378 to 1501 CE. Aq Qoyunlu emerged when Timur granted them all of Diyar Bakr in present-day Turkey. Afterward, they struggled with their rival Oghuz Turks, the Qara Qoyunlu. While the Aq Qoyunlu were successful in defeating Kara Koyunlu, their struggle with the emerging Safavid dynasty led to their downfall.

==Early modern period==
Persia underwent a revival under the Safavid dynasty (1502–1736), the most prominent figure of which was Shah Abbas I. Some historians credit the Safavid dynasty for founding the modern nation-state of Iran. Iran&#x27;s contemporary Shia character, and significant segments of Iran&#x27;s current borders take their origin from this era (&quot;e.g. Treaty of Zuhab&quot;).

===Safavid Empire (1501–1736)===


The Safavid dynasty was one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Iran, and &quot;is often considered the beginning of modern Persian history&quot;. They ruled one of the greatest Iranian empires after the Muslim conquest of Persia and established the Twelver school of Shi&#x27;a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in Muslim history. The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736) and at their height, they controlled all of modern Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic &quot;gunpowder empires&quot;, along with its neighbours, its archrival and principal enemy the Ottoman Empire, as well as the Mughal Empire.

The Safavid ruling dynasty was founded by Ismāil, who styled himself Shāh Ismāil I. Practically worshipped by his Qizilbāsh followers, Ismāil invaded Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Shaykh Haydar, who had been killed during his siege of Derbent, in Dagestan. Afterwards he went on a campaign of conquest, and following the capture of Tabriz in July 1501, he enthroned himself as the Shāh of Iran, minted coins in this name, and proclaimed Shi&#x27;ism the official religion of his domain.

Although initially the masters of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan only, the Safavids had, in fact, won the struggle for power in Iran which had been going on for nearly a century between various dynasties and political forces following the fragmentation of the Kara Koyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu. A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ismāil proclaimed most of Iran as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts of what is now Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples).

Tahmasp I, the son and successor of Ismail I, carried out multiple invasions in the Caucasus which had been incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran&#x27;s heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the undisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the &quot;ghazis&quot; of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic.

Shah Abbas I and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 Georgians, 300,000 Armenians and 100,000–150,000 Circassians to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society. With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the Caucasian ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so-called &quot;ghilman&quot; / غِلْمَان / &quot;servants&quot;), almost always after conversion to Shi&#x27;ism depending on given function would be, unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the harem, regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the Qajar dynasty.

The greatest of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587–1629) came to power in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590). Then he turned against the Ottomans, the archrivals of the Safavids, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq, the Caucasian provinces, and beyond by 1618. Between 1616 and 1618, following the disobedience of his most loyal Georgian subjects Teimuraz I and Luarsab II, Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating Kakheti and Tbilisi and carrying away 130,000 – 200,000 Georgian captives towards mainland Iran. His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids&#x27; archrivals, the Ottomans in the above-mentioned 1603–1618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.

He expanded commercial links with the Dutch East India Company and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the Habsburg–Persian alliance. Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control.
The Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot. It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which Isfahan is the most notable example.

Except for Shah Abbas the Great, Shah Ismail I, Shah Tahmasp I, and Shah Abbas II, many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities. The end of Abbas II&#x27;s reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles. Shah Soltan Hosain (1694–1722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.

The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan. In 1722, Peter the Great of neighbouring Imperial Russia launched the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723), capturing many of Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories, including Derbent, Shaki, Baku, but also Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad. In the midst of chaos, in the same year of 1722, an Afghan army led by Mir Wais&#x27; son Mahmud marched across eastern Iran, besieged and took Isfahan. Mahmud proclaimed himself &#x27;Shah&#x27; of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia&#x27;s imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves. By these events, the Safavid dynasty had effectively ended. In 1724, conform the Treaty of Constantinople, the Ottomans and the Russians agreed to divide the newly conquered territories of Iran amongst themselves.

===Nader Shah and his successors===

Iran&#x27;s territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated and banished the Afghans, defeated the Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories, with the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader had become so powerful he was able to depose the Safavids and have himself crowned shah. Nader was one of the last great conquerors of Asia and briefly presided over what was probably the most powerful military force in the world. To financially support his wars against Iran&#x27;s arch-rival, the Ottoman Empire, he fixed his sights on the weak but rich Mughal Empire to the east. In 1739, accompanied by his loyal Caucasian subjects including Erekle II, he invaded Mughal India, defeated a numerically superior Mughal army in less than three hours, and completely sacked and looted Delhi, bringing back immense wealth to Iran. On his way back, he also conquered all the Uzbek khanates – except for Kokand – and made the Uzbeks his vassals. He also firmly re-established Iranian rule over the entire Caucasus, Bahrain, as well as large parts of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Undefeated for years, his defeat in Dagestan, following guerrilla rebellions by the Lezgins and the assassination attempt on him near Mazandaran is often considered the turning point in Nader&#x27;s impressive career. To his frustration, the Dagestanis resorted to guerrilla warfare, and Nader with his conventional army could make little headway against them. At the Battle of Andalal and the Battle of Avaria, Nader&#x27;s army was crushingly defeated and he lost half of his entire force, as well forcing him to flee for the mountains. Though Nader managed to take most of Dagestan during his campaign, the effective guerrilla warfare as deployed by the Lezgins, but also the Avars and Laks made the Iranian re-conquest of the particular North Caucasian region this time a short lived one; several years later, Nader was forced to withdraw. Around the same time, the assassination attempt was made on him near Mazandaran which accelerated the course of history; he slowly grew ill and megalomaniac, blinding his sons whom he suspected of the assassination attempts, and showing increasing cruelty against his subjects and officers. In his later years this eventually provoked multiple revolts and, ultimately, Nader&#x27;s assassination in 1747.

Nader Shah&#x27;s death was followed by a period of anarchy in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader&#x27;s own family, the Afsharids, were soon reduced to holding on to a small domain in Khorasan. Many of the Caucasian territories broke away in various Caucasian khanates. Ottomans regained lost territories in Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence. Ahmad Shah Durrani, one of Nader&#x27;s officers, founded an independent state which eventually became modern Afghanistan. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who, in 1744, had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service, capitalized on the eruption of instability, and declared &quot;de facto&quot; independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II&#x27;s death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia, and due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous through the Zand period. From his capital Shiraz, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ruled &quot;an island of relative calm and peace in an otherwise bloody and destructive period,&quot; however the extent of Zand power was confined to contemporary Iran and parts of the Caucasus. Karim Khan&#x27;s death in 1779 led to yet another civil war in which the Qajar dynasty eventually triumphed and became kings of Iran. During the civil war, Iran permanently lost Basra in 1779 to the Ottomans, which had been captured during the Ottoman–Persian War (1775–76), and Bahrain to Al Khalifa family after Bani Utbah invasion in 1783.

==Late modern period==
===Qajar dynasty (1796–1925)===

Agha Mohammad Khan emerged victorious out of the civil war that commenced with the death of the last Zand king. His reign is noted for the reemergence of a centrally led and united Iran. After the death of Nader Shah and the last of the Zands, most of Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories had broken away into various Caucasian khanates. Agha Mohammad Khan, like the Safavid kings and Nader Shah before him, viewed the region as no different from the territories in mainland Iran. Therefore, his first objective after having secured mainland Iran, was to reincorpate the Caucasus region into Iran. Georgia was seen as one of the most integral territories. For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah&#x27;s death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the &quot;wali&quot; (viceroy) of Georgia, namely the Georgian king Erekle II (Heraclius II) who was appointed viceroy of Georgia by Nader Shah himself.

Agha Mohammad Khan subsequently demanded that Heraclius II renounce its 1783 treaty with Russia, and to submit again to Iranian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran&#x27;s neighboring rival, recognized the latter&#x27;s rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan&#x27;s ultimatum. As a response, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded the Caucasus region after crossing the Aras river, and, while on his way to Georgia, he re-subjugated Iran&#x27;s territories of the Erivan Khanate, Shirvan, Nakhchivan Khanate, Ganja khanate, Derbent Khanate, Baku khanate, Talysh Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, which comprise modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Igdir. Having reached Georgia with his large army, he prevailed in the Battle of Krtsanisi, which resulted in the capture and sack of Tbilisi, as well as the effective resubjugation of Georgia. Upon his return from his successful campaign in Tbilisi and in effective control over Georgia, together with some 15,000 Georgian captives that were moved back to mainland Iran, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just as his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier.

Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in 1797 in Shusha (now part of the Republic of Azerbaijan) and the seasoned king Heraclius died early in 1798. The reassertion of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi. The Russians were already actively occupied with an expansionist policy towards its neighboring empires to its south, namely the Ottoman Empire and the successive Iranian kingdoms since the late 17th/early 18th century. The next two years following Russia&#x27;s entrance into Tbilisi were a time of confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had been an integral part of Iran for centuries, this would lead directly to the wars of several years later, namely the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804-1813 and 1826–1828. The outcome of these two wars (in the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, respectively) proved for the irrevocable forced cession and loss of what is now eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to Imperial Russia.

The area to the north of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.

===Migration of Caucasian Muslims===
Following the official loss of vast territories in the Caucasus, major demographic shifts were bound to take place. Following the 1804–1814 war, but also per the 1826–1828 war which ceded the last territories, large migrations, so-called Caucasian Muhajirs, set off to migrate to mainland Iran. Some of these groups included the Ayrums, Qarapapaqs, Circassians, Shia Lezgins, and other Transcaucasian Muslims.

After the Battle of Ganja of 1804 during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), many thousands of Ayrums and Qarapapaqs were settled in Tabriz. During the remaining part of the 1804–1813 war, as well as through the 1826–1828 war, a large number of the Ayrums and Qarapapaqs that were still remaining in newly conquered Russian territories were settled in and migrated to Solduz (in modern-day Iran&#x27;s West Azerbaijan province). As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states; &quot;The steady encroachment of Russian troops along the frontier in the Caucasus, General Yermolov&#x27;s brutal punitive expeditions and misgovernment, drove large numbers of Muslims, and even some Georgian Christians, into exile in Iran.&quot;

From 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus departed for Turkey or Iran. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks.
Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade, which was established in the late 19th century. The initial ranks of the brigade would be entirely composed of Circassians and other Caucasian Muhajirs. This brigade would prove decisive in the following decades in Qajar history.

Furthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay included the official rights for the Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories. Until the mid-fourteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in Eastern Armenia. 
At the close of the fourteenth century, after Timur&#x27;s campaigns, the Timurid Renaissance flourished, and Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia. After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere. Following Shah Abbas I&#x27;s massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604–05, their numbers dwindled even further.

At the time of the Russian invasion of Iran, some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%. As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day Armenia), to the Russians. After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia. The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and Ottoman Turkey. As a result, by 1832, the number of ethnic Armenians had matched that of the Muslims. It would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia. Nevertheless, the city of Erivan retained a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century. According to the traveller H. F. B. Lynch, the city of Erivan was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Tatars i.e. Azeris and Persians) in the early 1890s.

Fath Ali Shah&#x27;s reign saw increased diplomatic contacts with the West and the beginning of intense European diplomatic rivalries over Iran. His grandson Mohammad Shah, who succeeded him in 1834, fell under the Russian influence and made two unsuccessful attempts to capture Herat. When Mohammad Shah died in 1848 the succession passed to his son Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, who proved to be the ablest and most successful of the Qajar sovereigns. He founded the first modern hospital in Iran.

===Constitutional Revolution and deposition===
The Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871 is believed to have caused the death of two million people.

A new era in the history of Iran dawned with the Persian Constitutional Revolution against the Shah in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy). The first Majlis (parliament) was convened on 7 October 1906.

The discovery of petroleum in 1908 by the British in Khuzestan spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the British Empire (see William Knox D&#x27;Arcy and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP). Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as The Great Game, and codified in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which divided Iran into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty.

During World War I, the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see Persian Campaign). In 1919, after the Russian Revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Iran, which was unsuccessful.

Finally, the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, who was later to become Reza Shah Pahlavi, and the subsequent establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925. In 1921, a military coup established Reza Khan, an officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the dominant figure for the next 20 years. Seyyed Zia&#x27;eddin Tabatabai was also a leader and important figure in the perpetration of the coup. The coup was not actually directed at the Qajar monarchy; according to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, it was targeted at officials who were in power and actually had a role in controlling the government — the cabinet and others who had a role in governing Iran. In 1925, after being prime minister for two years, Reza Khan became the first shah of the Pahlavi dynasty.

===Pahlavi era (1925–1979)===
==== Reza Shah (1925–1941) ====

Reza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until 16 September 1941, when he was forced to abdicate by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism, militarism, secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda. Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances.

To his supporters, his reign brought &quot;law and order, discipline, central authority, and modern amenities – schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones&quot;. However, his attempts of modernisation have been criticised for being &quot;too fast&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot;, and his reign a time of &quot;oppression, corruption, taxation, lack of authenticity&quot; with &quot;security typical of police states.&quot;

Many of the new laws and regulations created resentment among devout Muslims and the clergy. For example, mosques were required to use chairs; most men were required to wear western clothing, including a hat with a brim; women were encouraged to discard the hijab—hijab was eventually banned in 1936; men and women were allowed to congregate freely, violating Islamic mixing of the sexes. Tensions boiled over in 1935, when bazaaris and villagers rose up in rebellion at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad to protest against plans for the hijab ban, chanting slogans such as &#x27;The Shah is a new Yezid.&#x27; Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured when troops finally quelled the unrest.

====World War II====
While German armies were highly successful against the Soviet Union, the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on its borders. It rejected British and Soviet demands to expel German residents from Iran. In response, the two Allies invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in &quot;Operation Countenance&quot;. Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see &quot;Persian Corridor&quot;). Iran remained officially neutral. Its monarch Rezā Shāh was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

At the Tehran Conference of 1943, the Allies issued the Tehran Declaration which guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government and the Republic of Kurdistan respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon overthrown and the oil concessions were revoked.

====Mohammad-Reza Shah (1941–1979)====

Initially there were hopes that post-occupation Iran could become a constitutional monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran—a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.

In 1951 Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq received the vote required from the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the Abadan Crisis. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the Shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier, and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri.

=====1953: U.S. aided coup removes Mosaddeq=====

Shortly thereafter on 19 August a successful coup was headed by retired army general Fazlollah Zahedi, aided by the United States (CIA) with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies). The coup—with a black propaganda campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq — forced Mosaddeq from office. Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence was reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed. Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the National Front and Communist Tudeh Party.
Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years, splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors. In 1957 martial law was ended after 16 years and Iran became closer to the West, joining the Baghdad Pact and receiving military and economic aid from the US. In 1961, Iran initiated a series of economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country that became known as the Shah&#x27;s White Revolution.

The core of this program was land reform. Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran&#x27;s vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world. However, the reforms, including the White Revolution, did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain Islamic religious and political groups. In early June 1963 several days of massive rioting occurred in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini following the cleric&#x27;s arrest for a speech attacking the Shah.

Two years later, premier Hassan Ali Mansur was assassinated and the internal security service, SAVAK, became more violently active. In the 1970s, leftist guerilla groups such as Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK), emerged and contributed to overthrowing the Shah during the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Nearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured. The Islamic clergy, headed by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous.

Iran greatly increased its defense budget and by the early 1970s was the region&#x27;s strongest military power. Bilateral relations with Iraq were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway. In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in response, Iraq expelled thousands of Iranian nationals. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation.

In mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control. Following the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and Israel. Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernisation and to increase defense spending.

A border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the Algiers Accord on 6 March 1975.

== Contemporary period ==
=== Revolution and the Islamic Republic (1979 to present) ===

The Iranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, was the revolution that transformed Iran from an absolute monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to an Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, one of the leaders of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic. Its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations, and concluded with the approval of the new theocratic Constitution—whereby Ayatollah Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country—in December 1979.

In between, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on 1 February 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran. The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on 11 February when Iran&#x27;s military declared itself &quot;neutral&quot; after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979, after Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so a day before.

==== Ideology of the 1979 Iranian Revolution ====
The ideology of the revolutionary government was populist, nationalist and most of all Shi&#x27;a Islamic. Its unique constitution is based on the concept of &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot; the idea advanced by Khomeini that Muslims – in fact everyone – requires &quot;guardianship&quot;, in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists. Khomeini served as this ruling jurist, or supreme leader, until his death in 1989.

Iran&#x27;s rapidly modernising, capitalist economy was replaced by populist and Islamic economic and cultural policies. Much industry was nationalized, laws and schools Islamicized, and Western influences banned.

The Islamic revolution also created great impact around the world. In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam, along with &quot;fear and distrust towards Islam&quot; and particularly the Islamic Republic and its founder.

=== Khomeini (1979–1989) ===
Khomeini served as leader of the revolution or as Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to his death on 3 June 1989. This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a theocratic republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody war with Iraq.

The consolidation lasted until 1982–3, as Iran coped with the damage to its economy, military, and apparatus of government, and protests and uprisings by secularists, leftists, and more traditional Muslims—formerly ally revolutionaries but now rivals—were effectively suppressed. Many political opponents were executed by the new regimes. Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in regions comprising Khuzistan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, resulting in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. The Kurdish uprising, led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties.

In the summer of 1979 a new constitution giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist Supreme Leader and a clerical Council of Guardians power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an Assembly of Experts for Constitution. The new constitution was approved by referendum in December 1979.

==== Iran hostage crisis (1979–1981) ====

An early event in the history of the Islamic republic that had a long-term impact was the Iran hostage crisis. Following the admitting of the former Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment, on 4 November 1979, Iranian students seized US embassy personnel, labeling the embassy a &quot;den of spies.&quot; Fifty-two hostages were held for 444 days until January 1981. An American military attempt to rescue the hostages failed.

The takeover was enormously popular in Iran, where thousands gathered in support of the hostage takers, and it is thought to have strengthened the prestige of the Ayatollah Khomeini and consolidated the hold of anti-Americanism. It was at this time that Khomeini began referring to America as the &quot;Great Satan.&quot; In America, where it was considered a violation of the long-standing principle of international law that diplomats may be expelled but not held captive, it created a powerful anti-Iranian backlash. Relations between the two countries have remained deeply antagonistic and American international sanctions have hurt Iran&#x27;s economy.

==== Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) ====

During this political and social crisis, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution&#x27;s antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East. He sought to expand Iraq&#x27;s access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah&#x27;s rule.

Of chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates, the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran–Iraq War. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise.

Although Saddam Hussein&#x27;s forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi&#x27;a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, &quot;drank the cup of poison&quot; and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations.

Tens of thousands of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed when Iraq used chemical weapons in its warfare. Iraq was financially backed by Egypt, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (which also sold weapons to Iran).

There were more than 182,000 Kurdish victims of Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapons during the eight-year war. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed that Saddam engaged in chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks; these agencies unanimously confirmed that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war.

Starting on 19 July 1988 and lasting for about five months the government systematically executed thousands of political prisoners across Iran. This is commonly referred to as the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners or the 1988 Iranian Massacre. The main target was the membership of the People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party). Estimates of the number executed vary from 1,400 to 30,000.

=== Khamenei (1989–present) ===
On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named then president Ali Khamenei as the next Supreme Leader, and made a number of changes to Iran&#x27;s constitution. A smooth transition followed Khomeini&#x27;s death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;charisma and clerical standing&quot;, he developed a network of supporters within Iran&#x27;s armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations. Under his reign Iran&#x27;s regime is said – by at least one observer – to resemble more &quot;a clerical oligarchy ... than an autocracy.&quot;

==== Rafsanjani: pragmatic conservativism (1989–1997) ====
Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani succeeded Khamenei as president on 3 August 1989, as a pragmatic conservative who served two four-year terms and focused his efforts on rebuilding the country&#x27;s economy and infrastructure damaged by war, though hampered by low oil prices. Rafsanjani sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy. The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation. This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 the country remained neutral, restricting its action to the condemnation of the U.S. and allowing fleeing Iraqi aircraft and refugees into the country.

Iran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades. This admiration had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government. The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama&#x27;s ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary.

==== Khatami: reformers and conservatives struggle (1997–2005) ====
President Rafsanjani&#x27;s economic policies led to stronger relations with the outside world. But his government&#x27;s relaxation of the enforcement of certain regulations on social behavior were met with some responses of widespread disenchantment among the general population with the ulama as rulers of the country. This led to the defeat of the government&#x27;s candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist. He was beaten by an independent candidate from the Reformists, Mohammad Khatami. He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth. The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah&#x27;s regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic. Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Tehran. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.

Khatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament. Conservative elements within Iran&#x27;s government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections. This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran&#x27;s youth.

In June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran. Several human rights protests also occurred in 2006.

==== Ahmadinejad: hardline conservatism (2005–2013) ====

In the 2005 Iranian presidential election, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, mayor of Tehran, became the sixth president of Iran, after winning 62 percent of the vote in the run-off poll, against former president Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. During the authorization ceremony he kissed Khamenei&#x27;s hand in demonstration of his loyalty to him.

During this time, the American invasion of Iraq, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime and empowerment of its Shi&#x27;a majority, all strengthened Iran&#x27;s position in the region particularly in the mainly Shi&#x27;a south of Iraq, where a top Shia leader in the week of 3 September 2006 renewed demands for an autonomous Shi&#x27;a region. At least one commentator (former U.S. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen) has stated that as of 2009 Iran&#x27;s growing power has eclipsed anti-Zionism as the major foreign policy issue in the Middle East.

During 2005 and 2006, there were claims that the United States and Israel were planning to attack Iran, with the most cited reason being Iran&#x27;s civilian nuclear energy program which the United States and some other states fear could lead to a nuclear weapons program. China and Russia opposed military action of any sort and opposed economic sanctions. Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. The fatwa was cited in an official statement by the Iranian government at an August 2005 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.

In 2009, Ahmadinejad&#x27;s reelection was hotly disputed and marred by large protests that formed the &quot;greatest domestic challenge&quot; to the leadership of the Islamic Republic &quot;in 30 years&quot;. The resulting social unrest is widely known as the Iranian Green Movement. Reformist opponent Mir-Hossein Mousavi and his supporters alleged voting irregularities and by 1 July 2009, 1000 people had been arrested and 20 killed in street demonstrations. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other Islamic officials blamed foreign powers for fomenting the protest.

==== Rouhani: pragmatism (2013–2021) ====

On 15 June 2013, Hassan Rouhani won the presidential election in Iran, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes. In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran&#x27;s relations with the world.

On 2 April 2015, following eight days of tortuous discussions in Switzerland, which lasted through the night, Iran and six world powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia plus Germany) agreed on the outlines of an understanding to limit Iran&#x27;s nuclear programs, negotiators indicated, as both sides prepared for announcements. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: &quot;Found solutions. Ready to start drafting immediately.&quot; European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini tweeted that she would meet the press with Zarif after a final meeting of the seven nations in the nuclear talks. She wrote: &quot;Good news.&quot;

Reading out a joint statement, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed what she called a &quot;decisive step&quot; after more than a decade of work. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif followed with the same statement in Persian. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the top diplomats of Britain, France and Germany also briefly took the stage behind them. The deal is intended to be a provisional framework for a comprehensive agreement and was signed in 2015, and marked a significant breakthrough in the 12-year history of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.

When Donald Trump was campaigning to become President of the US, he repeatedly said he would abandon the Iran nuclear deal. After he was elected president, the USA announced its withdrawal from the agreement on 8 May 2018.

The Iranian-backed group known as Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah attacked the United States embassy in Baghdad on 31 December 2019.

On 3 January 2020, the United States military executed a drone strike at Baghdad Airport, killing Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force, an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

On 3 August 2021 Ebrahim Raisi was elected 8th President of Iran.

==== Ebrahim Raisi (2021–2024) ====
Beginning on 16 September 2022 protests started against the government of Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.

On 1 April 2024, Israel&#x27;s air strike on an Iranian consulate building in the Syrian capital Damascus killed an important senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi. In retaliation for the Israeli strike, Iran attacked Israel with over 300 drones and missiles on 13 April. However, the Iranian attack was mainly intercepted either outside Israeli airspace or over the country itself. It was the biggest missile attack in Iranian history, and its first ever direct attack on Israel. It was followed by a retaliatory missile strike by Israel on Isfahan, Iran on 19 April.

On 19 May 2024, Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash in the country’s East Azerbaijan province. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber was appointed acting president after the death of President Raisi.

==== Masoud Pezeshkian (2024–present) ==== 

On 28 July 2024, Masoud Pezeshkian was formally endorsed as Iran&#x27;s new president by Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Pezeshkian, a reformist, won in a presidential election runoff on 5 July.

On 31 July 2024, Ismail Haniyeh, political chief of Palestinian political and military organisation Hamas, was assassinated in Iran’s capital, Tehran, where he was to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian.

On 1 October 2024, Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for assassinations of Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and Abbas Nilforoushan. On 27 October, Israel responded to that attack by strikes on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan.

In December 2025, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a close ally of Iran, was a severe setback for the political influence of Iran in the region.

<text>The recorded history of the lands of what today is known as Catalonia begins with the development of the Iberian peoples while several Greek colonies were established on the coast before the Roman conquest. It was the first area of Hispania conquered by the Romans. It then came under Visigothic rule after the collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire. In 718, the area was occupied by the Umayyad Caliphate and became a part of Muslim ruled al-Andalus. The Frankish Empire conquered northern half of the area from the Muslims, ending with the conquest of Barcelona in 801, as part of the creation of a larger buffer zone of Christian counties against Islamic rule historiographically known as the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent from Frankish rule.

In 1137, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona betrothed the heiress of the Kingdom of Aragon, Petronilla, establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with Aragon, resulting in a composite monarchy later known as Crown of Aragon, while the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties merged into a state, the Principality of Catalonia, which developed an institutional system (Catalan Courts, constitutions, Generalitat) that limited the power of the kings. Catalonia sponsored and contributed to the expansion of the Crown&#x27;s trade and military, most significantly their navy. The Catalan language flourished and expanded as more territories were added to the Crown of Aragon, including Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and Athens. The Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, the end of the reign of House of Barcelona, serf and urban conflicts and a civil war (1462–1472) weakened the role of the Principality within the Crown and internationally.

The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 created a dynastic union between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile, and both realms kept their own laws, institutions, borders and currency. In 1492 the Spanish colonization of the Americas began, political power began to shift away towards Castile. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy, alongside the economic crisis and the peasants&#x27; revolts, caused the Reapers&#x27; War (1640–1652), in which a Catalan Republic was briefly established. By the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the Roussillon, were ceded to France. The status of separate state of the Principality of Catalonia came to an end after the War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714), in which the Crown of Aragon supported the claim of the Archduke Charles of Habsburg. Following Catalan capitulation on 11 September 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the Nueva Planta decrees, which suppressed Catalan political institutions and public law, and merged it into Castile as a province. These led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature. During the second half of the 17th and the 18th centuries Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late 18th century when Cádiz&#x27;s trade monopoly with American colonies ended.

In the 19th century Catalonia was severely affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. The Napoleonic occupation and subsequent war in Spain began a period of political and economic turmoil. In the second third of the century, Catalonia became a center of industrialization. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a cultural renaissance coupled with incipient nationalism while several workers movements (particularly anarchism) appeared.

In the 20th century, Catalonia enjoyed and lost varying degrees of autonomy. The Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939) established Catalan self-government and the official use of the Catalan language. Like much of Spain, Catalonia (which, in turn, expererienced a revolutionary process) fought to defend the Republic in the Civil War of 1936–1939. The Republican defeat established the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, which unleashed a harsh repression and suppressed the autonomy. With Spain devastated and cut off from international trade and the autarkic politics of the regime, Catalonia, as an industrial center, suffered severely; the economic recovery was slow. Between 1959 and 1974 Spain experienced the second-fastest economic expansion in the world known as the Spanish Miracle, and Catalonia prospered as Spain&#x27;s most important industrial and tourist area. In 1975 Franco died, bringing his regime to an end, and the new democratic Spanish constitution of 1978 recognised Catalonia&#x27;s autonomy and language. It regained considerable self-government in internal affairs and today remains one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. Since the 2010s there have been growing calls for Catalan independence.

== Prehistory ==

The first known human settlements in what is now Catalonia were at the beginning of the Middle Palaeolithic. The oldest known trace of human occupation is a mandible found in Banyoles, described by some sources as pre-Neanderthal some 200,000 years old; other sources suggest it to be only about one third that old. Some of the most important prehistoric remains were found in the caves of Mollet (Serinyà, Pla de l&#x27;Estany), the Cau del Duc in the Montgrí mountain (&quot;cau&quot; meaning &quot;cave&quot; or &quot;lair&quot;), the remains at Forn d&#x27;en Sugranyes (Reus) and the shelters Romaní and Agut (Capellades), while those of the Upper Paleolithic are found at Reclau Viver, the cave of Arbreda and la Bora Gran d&#x27;en Carreres, in Serinyà, or the Cau de les Goges, in Sant Julià de Ramis. From the next prehistoric era, the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, important remains survive, the greater part dated between 8000 BC and 5000 BC, such as those of Sant Gregori (Falset) and el Filador (Margalef de Montsant).

The Neolithic era began in Catalonia around 4500 BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally hunter-gatherer culture. The most important Neolithic remains in Catalonia are the Cave of Fontmajor (l&#x27;Espluga de Francolí), The Cave of Toll (Morà), the caves Gran and Freda (Montserrat), the shelters of Cogul and Ulldecona, or La Draga, an early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium BC.

The &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; or Eneolithic period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800 BC, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The Bronze Age occurred between 1800 and 700 BC. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the low Segre zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the Indo-Europeans through the Urnfield Culture, whose successive waves of migration began around 1200 BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements. Around the middle of the 7th century BC, the Iron Age arrived in Catalonia.

== Ancient history ==
=== Rise of the Iberian culture ===
An iron-using culture first appeared in eastern Iberia in the 8th century BC. By the 5th century BC, the Iron Age Iberian civilization had become consolidated on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula. What is now the Catalan territory was home to several distinct tribes of Iberians: the Indigetes in Empordà, the Ceretani in Cerdanya and the Airenosins in the Val d&#x27;Aran. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps Amposta or Tortosa) or Indika (Ullastret). The settlement of Castellet de Banyoles in Tivissa was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements. This, situated in the northeast of the peninsula, was discovered in 1912. Also, the &#x27;Treasure of Tivissa&#x27;, a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.

Iberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains, nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a &quot;senate&quot; by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed &quot;fides&quot;.

The Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks; Horse breeding was of particular importance to the Iberian nobility. Mining was a major contributor to the economy, from which fine metalwork and high-quality iron weapons could be produced.

The Iberian language was a Paleohispanic language. The oldest inscriptions are dated from the end of the 5th century BC, and the most recent of the end of the first century BC, even at the beginning of the 1st century AD, after being gradually replaced by Latin. In its different variants, the Iberian language was spoken in a broad coastal strip stretching from southern Languedoc to Alicante.

Greeks arrived to the Iberian coasts by the late 7th century BC. The trading colony of Empúries (in Greek &quot;Emporion&quot;, meaning &quot;market&quot;, in Latin &quot;Emporiae&quot;), was founded on the northern coast of current Catalonia by the Greek city of Phocaea in the 6th century BC. Situated on the coastal commercial route between Massalia (Marseille) and Tartessos in the far south of Hispania, the city became a center of economic and commercial activity. Another known Greek colony was Rhode (Roses), located on the coast at the northern end of the Gulf of Roses.

=== Roman times (200 B.C–400 A.D) ===

Romanization brought a second, distinct stage in the ancient history of Catalonia. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus arrived in Empúries in 218 BC, with the objective of cutting off the sources of provisions of Hannibal&#x27;s Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War. After the Carthaginian defeat, and the defeat of various Iberian tribes who rose up against Roman rule, 195 BC saw the effective completion of the Roman conquest of the territory that later became Catalonia. Romanization of the region began in earnest. The various tribes were absorbed into a common Roman culture and lost many distinct characteristics, including differences of language. Most local leaders were later admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.

Most of what is now Catalonia first became part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior; after 27 BC, they became part of Tarraconensis, whose capital was Tarraco (now Tarragona). Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuriæ (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, Latin law was granted to all cities under the reign of Vespasian (69-79 AD), while Roman citizenship was permitted to all free men of the Empire by the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of Roman law since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, wheat), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the Via Augusta, parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like aqueducts.

The Crisis of the Third Century affected the whole Roman Empire, and gravely affected the Catalan territory, where there is evidence of significant levels of destruction and abandonment of Roman villas. This period also provides the first documentary evidence of the arrival of Christianity. Conversion to Christianity, attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. The first Christian communities in the &quot;Tarraconense&quot; were founded during the 3rd century, and the diocese of &quot;Tarraco&quot; was already established by 259, when the bishop Saint Fructuosus (Fructuós) and the deacons Augurius and Eulogius were burned alive on the orders of the governor Aemilianus, under an edict issued by the emperor Valerian. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of Vandals, Swabians and Alans in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some deurbanization. While archaeological evidence shows the recovery of some urban nuclei, such as Barcino (later Barcelona), Tarraco (later Tarragona), and Gerunda (later Girona), the previous situation was not restored: the cities became smaller, and constructed defensive walls.

== From late antiquity to feudalism (400–1100) ==

=== Visigothic and Muslim rule ===

In the 5th century, as part of the invasion of the Roman Empire by Germanic tribes, the Visigoths led by Athaulf, installed themselves in the Tarraconensis (Ebro basin, 410) and when in 475 the Visigothic king Euric formed the kingdom of Tolosa (modern Toulouse), he incorporated the territory equivalent to present-day Catalonia. Later, the Visigothic kingdom lost most of its territory north of the Pyrenees and shifted its capital to Toledo. The Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania lasted until the early 8th century. The Visigothic Kingdom respected and adopted the provincial system inherited from the Romans, the Tarraconense was maintained, but after the establishment of the new province of Cantabria its extension was reduced to the Valley of the Ebro and the current Catalonia. Beginning in 654, king Recceswinth ordered the promulgation of the &quot;Liber Iudiciorum&quot; (&quot;Book of the Judges&quot;), which was the first law code that applied equally to the Goths and to the Hispano-Roman population. This compilation will be in vigor in Catalan counties until the compilation of the Usages of Barcelona by count Ramon Berenguer I, largely based on the same &quot;Liber Iudiciorum&quot;. Between 672 and 673, the eastern part of the Tarraconenis (modern Catalonia) and the province of Septimania rebelled against king Wamba, appointing dux Flavius Paulus as king in Narbonne. The rebellion was crushed by Wamba.

In 714, the Umayyad forces reached the northeastern part of the peninsula, where some important clashes took place (Zaragoza, possibly Barcelona). In 720, Narbonne fell to the joint Arab-Berber forces, followed by the conquest of what remained of the Visigothic kingdom, Septimania. The last Visigothic king Ardo died in battle in 721 and Nîmes was captured four years later.

In the time of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the 10th century, the northern border stabilized against the Frankish-ruled counties along the Llobregat and Cardener rivers and the Montsec Range. Lleida and Tortosa, the two main cities of the Muslim ruled area of today&#x27;s Catalonia (historiographically known as &quot;New Catalonia&quot;), formed the centers of defense. Many of the predominantly Christian inhabitants of these Muslim border regions converted to Islam. Especially the inhabitants of the valleys of Ebro, Segre, and Cinca as well as the plain of Lleida took over the way of life and achievements of the Muslims like the highly developed irrigation techniques. The most important Muslim cities in Catalonia were Lleida, Balaguer and Tortosa. They developed an old town (Medina) in North African style with mosque, administrative headquarters and court. They also had large markets (Suq) with workshops and homes of artisans. In some cities there were open places of worship (Musallā) and – as in Tortosa – including a military fortress. Goods were exported via the port of Tortosa. Although there were peace treaties between the caliph in Córdoba and some Catalan counts, the mutual attacks accumulated so, in 985 Almanzor, de facto ruler of the Caliphate, sacked Barcelona and captured thousands of its inhabitants.

=== Carolingian conquest ===

After repelling Muslim incursions as far north as Tours in 732, the expanding Frankish Empire set about creating a buffer zone of Christian counties in the south that became historiographically known as the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; or Gothia. The first county to be conquered from the Moors was in Septimania which became Roussillon (including the Vallespir), following the conquest of Narbonne (759).

In 785 the County of Girona (with Besalú) on the south side of the Pyrenees was captured. Ribagorça and Pallars were linked to Toulouse and were added to this county around 790. Urgell and Cerdanya were added in 798. The first records of the county of Empúries (with Perelada) are from 812, but the county was probably under Frankish control before 800. After a series of struggles, Charlemagne&#x27;s son Louis took Barcelona from the Moorish emir in 801 and set up the County of Barcelona.
The counts of the Marca Hispanica had small outlying territories, each ruled by a lesser &quot;miles&quot; with armed retainers, who owed allegiance through the Count to the Carolingian Emperor and later to the kings of West Francia.

At the end of the 9th century, the Carolingian monarch Charles the Bald designated Wilfred the Hairy – a noble descendant of a family from Conflent and son of the earlier Count of Barcelona Sunifred I – as Count of Cerdanya and Urgell (870). After Charles&#x27;s death (877), Wilfred became the Count of Barcelona and Girona (878) as well, bringing together the greater part of what was later to become Catalonia. On his death the counties were divided again among his sons, however, since then, the counties of Barcelona, Girona and Ausona (he repopulated the last one after a revolt) remained under the rule of the same person, becoming the core of the future Principality. Upon his death in 897 Wilfred, making their titles hereditaries founded the dynasty of the House of Barcelona, which ruled Catalonia until the death of Martin I, its last ruling member, in 1410.

=== The rise and fall of the &quot;aloers&quot; ===

During the 10th century, the counts became increasingly independent of the weakening Carolingians. This was publicly acknowledged in 988 when the Count of Barcelona Borrell II declined to swear fealty to Hugh Capet, the first Capetian monarch of the emerging French kingdom. Borrell was motivated by Capet&#x27;s failure to address Borrell&#x27;s petitions to Capet for assistance against Muslim incursions. During this period, the population of the Catalan counties began to increase for the first time since the Muslim invasion. During the 9th and 10th centuries, the counties increasingly became a society of &quot;aloers&quot;, peasant proprietors of small, family-based farms, who lived by subsistence agriculture and owed no formal feudal allegiance.

The 11th century was characterized by the development of feudal society, as the &quot;miles&quot; formed links of vassalage over this previously independent peasantry.
The middle years of the century were characterized by virulent class warfare. Seigniorial violence was unleashed against the peasants, utilizing new military tactics, based on contracting well-armed mercenary soldiers mounted on horses. By the end of the century, most of the &quot;aloers&quot; had been converted into vassals.

This coincided with a weakening of the power of the counts and the division of the Spanish Marches into more numerous counties, which gradually became a feudal state based on complex fealties and dependencies. During the regency of countess Ermesinde of Carcassonne the disintegration of central power was evident. From the time of the triumph of the grandson of Ermessinde, Ramon Berenguer I overlords and surrounding counts, the counts of Barcelona stood firmly as the link in a web of fealty between the counts and the Crown. Ramon Berenguer I began the codification of Catalan law in the written Usages of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count&#x27;s efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization. The response of the Catholic Church to the feudal violence was the movement of Peace and Truce of God. The first assembly of Peace and Truce was presided by Abbot Oliba in Toulouges, Roussillon in 1027. The Peace and Truce assemblies promoted the establishment of &quot;sagreres&quot;, the space surrounding the churches considered sacred territory, protected from feudal violence, under penalty of excommunication.

=== First references to the name &quot;Catalonia&quot; ===
The term &quot;Catalonia&quot; is first documented in an early 12th-century Latin chronicle called the &quot;Liber maiolichinus&quot;, where Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona is referred to as &quot;catalanicus heroes&quot;, &quot;rector catalanicus&quot;, and &quot;dux catalanensis&quot;.

Some manuscripts suggest that &quot;Catalunya&quot; (Latin &quot;Gathia Launia&quot;) &quot;Gothia&quot; (or &quot;Gauthia&quot;), &quot;Land of the Goths&quot;, since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the ancient March of Gothia, known as &quot;Gothia&quot;, whence &quot;Gothland&quot; &gt; &quot;Gothlandia&quot; &gt; &quot;Gothalania&quot; from which &quot;Catalonia&quot; has been theoretically derived. During the Middle Ages, Byzantine chroniclers claimed that &quot;Catalania&quot; derives from the local medley of Goths with Alans, initially constituting a &quot;Goth-Alania&quot;. Alternatively, the name may come from the word &quot;ca(s)telan&quot; (inhabitant of the castle) as the area had many fortifications.

== Catalonia and Aragon (1100–1469) ==

=== Dynastic union with Aragon ===

Until the middle of the 12th century, the successive counts of Barcelona tried to expand their domain in multiple directions. Ramon Berenguer III incorporated the County of Besalú, part of the County of Empúries, all of the County of Cerdanya, and also the County of Provence through his marriage to Douce of Provence. The Catalan church, for its part, became independent of the bishopric of Narbonne by restoring the archiepiscopal see of Tarragona (1118).

In 1137 the dynastic union that would later be known as Crown of Aragon was established after Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona betrothed the heiress of the Kingdom of Aragon, Petronilla, after Ramiro II of Aragon agreed to donate his kingdom and his daughter Petronilla to Barcelona&#x27;s Count, avoiding and protecting Aragon from a potential invasion and annexion by Castile. Ramon Berenguer IV used the title &quot;&quot;comes Barchinonensis&quot; (count of the Barcelonians) as his primary title and &quot;princeps Aragonensis&quot;&quot; (prince of the Aragonians) as his second title, beside his wife who retained her title of &quot;Regina&quot; (&quot;queen&quot;). Their son and heir, Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona consolidated the dynastic union as &quot;Rex Aragonum, Comes Barchinone et Marchio Provincie&quot; (&quot;king of Aragon, count of Barcelona, and marquis of Provence&quot;). Catalonia and Aragon retained their distinct traditional rights, and Catalonia its own personality with one of the first parliaments in Europe, the Catalan Courts (Catalan: &quot;Corts Catalanes&quot;).

In addition, the reign of Ramon Berenguer IV saw the Catalan conquest of Lleida and Tortosa, completing the unification of all of the territory that comprises modern Catalonia. This included a territory to the south of the Catalan counties, which became known as &quot;Catalunya Nova&quot; (&quot;New Catalonia&quot;) and which was repopulated with Catalans by the end of the 12th century.

=== Expansion and institutionalization of the Principality ===
During the reign of Alfonso, in 1173, Catalonia was regarded as a legal entity for the first time, while the Usages of Barcelona were compiled in the process to turn them into the law of Catalonia (&quot;Consuetudinem Cathalonie&quot;). Apart from the Usages, between 1170 and 1195 the &quot;Liber feudorum maior&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Comitum Barchinonensium&quot; were also compiled and written, being considered together as the &quot;three milestones of Catalan political identity&quot;.

Catalonia became the base for the Aragonese Crown&#x27;s sea power, which came to dominate a maritime empire that extended across the western Mediterranean after the conquest of Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and the accession in Sicily of the kings of Aragon. This period saw a large increase of maritime trade in Catalan ports, particularly of the Aragonese Crown&#x27;s leading city, Barcelona.

At the end of the 12th century, a series of pacts between the crowns of Aragon and Castile delimited the zones that the two would each attempt to conquer from Muslim-ruled kingdoms, (the &quot;Reconquista&quot;); to the east, in 1213, the defeat and death of Peter II of Aragon (&quot;Peter the Catholic&quot;) in the Battle of Muret put an end to the project of consolidating the Aragonese influence and power over Provence and the County of Toulouse. His successor James I of Aragon did not fully consolidate his power until 1227; once he consolidated his inherited realm, he began a series of new conquests. Over the course of the next quarter-century he conquered Majorca and Valencia. The latter became a new state, the third kingdom associated with the Crown of Aragon, with its own court and a new &quot;fuero&quot; (code of laws): the &quot;Furs de València&quot;. In contrast, the Majorcan territory together with that of the counties of Cerdanya, Vallespir, Capcir and Roussillon and the city of Montpellier were left as a kingdom for his son James II of Majorca as the Kingdom of Majorca. This division began a period of struggle that ended with the annexation of that kingdom by the Crown of Aragon in 1344 by Peter IV &quot;the Ceremonious&quot;.

In 1258, James I and Louis IX of France signed the Treaty of Corbeil: the French king, as the heir of Charlemagne, renounced his claims of feudal overlordship over Catalonia, which it was effectively independent from French rule since the end of the 10th century, while James renounced his claims in Occitania.
At the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based on the concept of a pact between the estates of the realm and the king. From 1283 onwards, legislation had to be approved in the General Court of Catalonia (or Catalan Courts), regarded the first parliamentary body of Europe that banned the royal power to create legislation unilaterally. The Courts were composed of the three estates, were presided over by the monarch as count of Barcelona, and approved the constitutions, which created a compilation of rights for the inhabitants of the Principality. In order to collect general taxes, the Courts of 1359 established a permanent representation of deputies, the Deputation of the General (Catalan: &quot;Diputació del General&quot;) and later usually known as Generalitat, which gained an important political power over the next centuries.

The Principality of Catalonia saw a prosperous period during the 13th century and the first half of the 14th. The population increased; Catalan culture expanded into the islands of the Western Mediterranean. The reign of Peter III of Aragon (&quot;the Great&quot;) included the conquest of Sicily and the successful defense against a French crusade; his son and successor Alfonso (&quot;the Generous&quot;) conquered Menorca; and Peter&#x27;s second son James II, who first acceded to the throne of Sicily and then succeeded his older brother as king of Aragon, conquered Sardinia; under James II, and Catalonia was the center of the flourishing empire. Barcelona, then the most frequent royal residence, was consolidated as the administrative center of the domains with the establishment of the Royal Archives in 1318. The Catalan Company, mercenaries led by Roger de Flor and formed by Almogavar veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, were hired by the Byzantine Empire to fight the Turks, defeating them in several battles. After the assassination of Roger de Flor by orders of the emperor&#x27;s son Michael Palaiologos (1305), the Company took revenge sacking Thrace and later Greece, where they took the duchies of Athens and Neopatras in the name of the King of Aragon. Catalan rule over the Greek lands lasted until 1390. The Crown became the protector of the united Albanian principalities after the Treaty of Gaeta.

This territorial expansion was accompanied by a great development of the Catalan trade, centered in Barcelona, creating an extensive trade network across the Mediterranean which competed with those of the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice. In this line, institutions were created that would give legal protection to merchants, such as the Consulate of the Sea and the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, one of the first compilations of maritime law. The trade allowed the formation of banking. In 1401, the local authorities created a pioneering public bank, the Taula de canvi de Barcelona, in 1401, arguably the world&#x27;s first-ever central bank.

The second quarter of the 14th century saw crucial changes for Catalonia, marked by a succession of natural catastrophes, demographic crises, stagnation and decline in the Catalan economy, and the rise of social tensions. In 1333, known as &quot;Lo mal any primer&quot; (&quot;The first bad year&quot;), a severe famine affected the lands of the Crown. Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality of Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population. The reign of Peter the Ceremonious was a time of war: the annexation of Majorca, the quelling of a rebellion in Sardinia, a rebellion by an Aragonese faction who wished to extinguish local Catalan privileges in favor of a more centralized kingdom of Aragon, and an Aragonese-Castilian war. These wars created a delicate financial situation, in a framework of demographic and economic crisis, to which was added a generation later a crisis of succession generated by the death in 1410 of Martin I without a descendant or a named successor. A two-year interregnum progressively evolved in favor of a candidate from the Castilian Trastámara dynasty, Ferdinand of Antequera, who on the Compromise of Caspe (1412), representatives of Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia appointed him monarch as Ferdinand I of Aragon. Opposition to Ferdinand, led by the alternate candidate James II, Count of Urgell, was defeated in 1413.

===The 15th century===

Ferdinand&#x27;s successor, Alfonso V (&quot;the Magnanimous&quot;), promoted a new stage of Aragonese expansion, this time over the Kingdom of Naples, over which he finally gained dominion in 1443. At the same time, though, he aggravated the social crisis in the Principality of Catalonia, both in the countryside and in the cities. Political conflict in Barcelona arose due to the disputes over the control of the Consell de Cent between two political factions, &quot;Biga&quot; and &quot;Busca&quot; looking for a solution to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the &quot;remença&quot; (serfs&#x27;) peasants subjected to the feudal abuses known as Evil customs began to organize themselves as a syndicate against seignorial pressures, searching protection from the monarch. Alfonso&#x27;s brother, John II (&quot;the Unreliable&quot;), was an exceptionally deeply hated and opposed regent and ruler – both in the Basque kingdom of Navarre and in Catalonia.

The opposition of the institutions of Catalonia to the policies of John II resulted in their support to the son of John, Charles, Prince of Viana over his denied dynastic rights. In response of the detention of Charles by his father, the Generalitat established a political body, the Council of the Principality, with whom, under menace of a conflict, John was forced to negotiate. The Capitulation of Vilafranca (1461) forced to release Charles from prison and appoint him lieutenant of Catalonia, while the king would need permission of the Generalitat to enter the Principality. The content of the Capitulation represented a culmination and consolidation of pactism and the constitutional system of Catalonia. However, the disaggrament of King John, the death of Charles shortly after and the remença uprising in 1462 led to a ten-year Catalan civil war that left the country exhausted. In 1472, the last separate ruler of Catalonia, the king René of Anjou (&quot;the Good&quot;), lost the war against King John.

The &quot;remença&quot; conflict did not reach any definitive conclusion and in 1493 France returned the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne, which it had occupied during the conflict. Ferdinand II of Aragon (&quot;the Catholic&quot;) profoundly reformed Catalan institutions, recovered without war the northern Catalan counties, increased active involvement in Italy and finally resolved the major grievances of the &quot;remences&quot; with the Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe in 1486, in exchange for a payment. The Sentencia allowed the beginning of the right to freely contract emphyteutic agreements, which led to general prosperity in the Catalan countryside throughout the next centuries. In the frame of the institutional reforms of Ferdinand, in 1481 the Catalan Courts approved the Constitució de l&#x27;Observança, which established the submission of royal power to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.

==Early modern period (1469–1808)==
=== Crown of Aragon union with Crown of Castile ===
Ferdinand&#x27;s 1469 marriage to Isabella I of Castile brought about a dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with Castile. After the 1512 invasion of the Kingdom of Navarre, in 1516 the monarchies were formally united into a single Monarchy of Spain (&quot;Kingdom of the Spains&quot;, as it was sometimes known). Each realm of the Monarchy conserved its political institutions and maintained its own courts, laws, public administration, and separate coinage of money.
When Christopher Columbus made his discovery in The Americas during a Spanish-sponsored expedition, and began to shift Europe&#x27;s trade and economic centre of gravity (and the focus of Spain&#x27;s ambitions) from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, undermining Catalonia&#x27;s economic and political importance. Aragonese and Catalan power in the Mediterranean would continue, but efforts to achieve further Spanish conquests in Europe itself largely stopped and the maritime expansion into the Atlantic and the conquest of territories in the Americas was not a Catalan enterprise. Castile and the realms of Aragon were separate states until 1716 in spite of a shared crown and the newly established colonies in the Americas and Pacific were Castilian, administered as appendages of Castile, until in 1778 Seville was the only port authorized to trade in America, and despite the dynastic union Catalans, as subjects of the Crown of Aragon, had no right to trade directly with the Castilian-ruled Americas.

By virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1516 Charles I of Spain became the first king to rule the Crowns of Castile and Aragon simultaneously by his own right. Following the death of his paternal (House of Habsburg) grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was also elected Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1519. In the 16th century, the Catalan population began a demographic recovery and some measure of economic recovering. The reign of Charles V was a relative harmonious period, during which Catalonia generally accepted the new structure of Spain, despite its own marginalization. As the focus of Spanish maritime power and of European rivalry shifted to the Atlantic, the Kingdom of Valencia became the most important kingdom of the Aragonese Crown, eclipsing Barcelona. The reign of Philip II marked the beginning of a gradual process of stagnation of Catalan economy, language, and culture. Among the most negative elements of the period were a rise in piracy along the coasts and banditry in the interior.

=== The Reapers&#x27; War ===
Conflicts had already arisen between Catalonia and the monarchy in the time of Philip II. Having exhausted the economic resources of Castile, Philip wished to avail himself of those of the other polities of the Monarchy; Catalan institutions and laws were well protected by the terms and nature of the union of crowns, and were jealously guarded by the Catalan population, who during those times saw an increase of its participation in the local and general government of the Principality. After Philip IV acceded to the throne in 1621, his minister the Count-Duke of Olivares attempted to sustain an ambitious foreign policy by taxing the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula and establishing a military contribution to the Empire in each one of them (the &quot;Unión de Armas&quot;, &quot;Union of Arms&quot;), which meant laying aside the until-then-prevailing principles of the composite monarchy, in favor of an increased centralization. Resistance in Catalonia was especially strong, given the lack of any significant apparent regional return for the sacrifices. The Catalan Courts of 1626 and 1632 were never concluded, due to the opposition of the estates against the economical and military measures of Olivares, many of which violated the Catalan constitutions. The failure of the Courts aggravated the tensions between Catalan institutions and Monarchy, favoring a scenario of rupture.
The Reapers&#x27; War (, 1640–59) started as an uprising of peasants in northern areas of Catalonia. When Spanish &quot;tercios&quot; (military corps) concentrated in Roussillon at the end of the 1630s, because of the Thirty Years&#x27; War with France, local peasants were required to lodge and provision the troops, thus creating a large tension and discomfort among them, and events such as religious sacrileges, destruction of personal properties and rape of local women by the soldiers were reported. The protest of the peasantry in the north quickly extended to Barcelona; On 7 June 1640 an uprising in Barcelona known as the Corpus de Sang, led by reapers, took the lives of various royal functionaries, Dalmau de Queralt, Count of Santa Coloma and viceroy of Catalonia was assassinated during the events. Mutinies continued; due to the few weeks later Pau Claris, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, formed a &quot;Junta de Braços&quot; or &quot;Braços Generals&quot; (States-General), a consultive body similar to the Courts. The calling was a success, and the presence of cities and feudal villages was exceptionally large. The assembly assumed the sovereignty and began to enact and apply various revolutionary measures, such as the establishment of a Council of Justice, a Council of Defense to respond to the expected Royal counter-attack and a Council of Treasury which began to issue debt and a special tax to the nobility, while maintained diplomatic contacts with the Kingdom of France, allowing the French army to cross the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula. After the fall of Tortosa to the royal armies, the break with the Spanish Monarchy became evident and the military clashes began. The Spanish armies perpetrated a massacre in Cambrils on 16 December, convincing Catalan leadership that they could not expect any pardon or negotiated solution from them.

With the Spanish royal armies approaching Barcelona, on 17 January 1641 the Junta de Braços accepted the establishment of the Catalan Republic under the protection of France, however a week later the Catalan institutions, needing more French military aid, accepted King Louis XIII of France as Count of Barcelona. Combined Catalan and French armies defeated the Spanish armies at the gates of Barcelona, in the battle of Montjuïc, on 26 January 1641. The French general Marquis of Brézé, Marshal of France was appointed viceroy of Catalonia, and the Franco-Catalan forces obtained victories in Montmeló and Lleida. However, the French administration increased its control over the Principality, and some of the same conflicts between peasants and soldiers, but this time French ones, erupted.

After major setbacks, from 1644 onwards a renewed offensive of the Spanish troops took Lleida, driven out the French and crushed the Catalan forces. Although the French were initially able to resist the offensive, the outbreak of the Fronde in 1651 diverted their efforts and by 1652 Barcelona fell after a one-year siege; most of the Principality of Catalonia was once again under control of the Monarchy of Spain, With the aim to avoid a prolongation of the conflict, Philip IV recognized in 1644 most of the rights of Catalonia. When the war between Spain and France ended in 1659, the peace treaty ceded the Catalan territories north of the Pyrenees, the counties of Roussillon and the northern half of Cerdanya, to France. Catalan institutions were suppressed in the French Roussillon, in 1700, public use of Catalan language was prohibited. Today, this region is administratively part of French &quot;Département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales.

=== War of the Spanish Succession ===

In the last decades of the 17th century during the reign of Spain&#x27;s last Habsburg king, Charles II, despite intermittent conflict between Spain and France, the population increased to approximately 500,000 inhabitants and the Catalan economy improved, not only in Barcelona, but also along the Catalan coast and even in some inland areas. The economic growth was boosted by the export of wine to England and the Dutch Republic because due to the trade war of French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert against the Dutch and later to the participation of these countries in the Nine Years&#x27; War against France, they were not able to trade with the French. This new context caused many Catalans to look to England and, especially, the Netherlands as political and economic models for Catalonia.

However, at the end of the century, after the death of the childless Charles II (1700), the Crown of Spain went to his chosen successor, Philip V of the House of Bourbon. The Grand Alliance of Austria, England and the United Provinces gave military support to a Habsburg claimant of the crown, Archduke Charles as Charles III of Spain, resulting in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14). The Principality of Catalonia initially accepted Philip V following prolonged negotiations between Philip V and the Catalan Courts between 12 October 1701 and 14 January 1702, which resulted in an agreement where Catalonia retained all its previous privileges and gained a Court of Contraventions (&quot;Tribunal de Contrafaccions&quot;), the status of free port (&quot;Port Franc&quot;) for Barcelona as well as the limited right to commerce with America, but this did not last. Repressive mesures of the viceroy Francisco de Velasco and authoritarian decisions of the king (some of them contrary to Catalan legislation), as well as the economic policy and distrust to the French absolutism caused Catalonia to switch sides. In 1705 the Archduke entered Barcelona, which was recognized as king in 1706 by the last Catalan Courts.
After a series of advances and stalemates of both sides, geopolitical changes in Europe led to peace with the signature of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), ending the possibility of Catalonia&#x27;s resistance to Bourbon rule. Despite the evacuation of the Allied armies, in July 1713 the Junta de Braços of Catalonia opted to unilaterally remain in the war in order to proctect Catalan rights and lives from Bourbon punishment, rising the Army of Catalonia and attempting to obtain help from Britain and Austria. After thirteen months of siege by Spanish and French armies which included pro-Habsburg uprisings in Catalonia&#x27;s countryside, Barcelona capitulation on 11 September 1714. The Bourbon king, determined to punish what he saw as sedition from the realms of the Crown of Aragon promulgated the Nueva Planta decrees (1707 for Aragon and Valencia, 1715 for Majorca and 1716 for Catalonia), abolishing the Catalan, Majorcan, Valencian and Aragonese institutions and rights, and with it the Catalan Courts, the Generalitat, the Consell de Cent of Barcelona and the Catalan constitutions, except those of civil law, replacing them with the Castilian ones and establishing absolutism as the new form of government, thus, ending their status as separate political entities. In order to ensure it, he created a new Royal Audience as seat of government of the province and replaced the traditional vegueries with Castilian corregimientos as the territorial division of Catalonia. Rooted in the absolutist political position of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Decrees was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation state.
He suppressed the six Catalan universities and founded a new one in Cervera (Lleida) and abolished the administrative use of the Catalan language; replacing it with Spanish. While the replacement solely affected the Royal Audience, the king provided with secret instructions to the royal officers in Catalan territory: they &quot;will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed.&quot; Half a century later, under the reign of Charles III of Bourbon, the Catalan language would also be banned from primary and secondary schools.

=== The 18th century ===
Despite the harsh internal situation, including military occupation, bandrity, new heavy taxation and the mercantilist policy of the House of Bourbon, Catalonia resumed the economic growth of the last third of the 17th century after the parentesis of the war, achieving a successful process of proto-industrialization in the course of the 18th century. The population and the economy both grew, agricultural production increased, and trade increased, complemented during the last quarter of the century with the opening of trade with America; all of these transformations tended, as in France, to undermine the Old Regime and lay the groundwork for the rise of industrialization, the first signs of which appeared in the 18th-century manufacture of cotton goods and other textiles. By the end of the 18th century, the popular classes began to experience the first effects of proletarianization.

In the 1790s, new conflicts arose on the French border, due to the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1793, after the execution of Louis XVI of France, Spain signed with Great Britain his adhesion to the First Coalition against the French Republic, and soon after, France declared war on Spain. The War of the Pyrenees, known in Catalonia as the &quot;Guerra Gran&quot; (&quot;Great War&quot;) has two main fronts: the eastern and the western Pyrenees. At first, the Spanish army entered in the Roussillon, reaching Perpignan, but the French army reacted and defeated them in Le Boulou and Colliure, penetrating in Catalonia and occupied the Empordà. The Sant Ferran Castle in Figueres (the largest fortress of the border) fell to the French after a brief siege. In 1795, after the stagnation of the front, France and Spain signed the Peace of Basel, restoring the status quo.

== Modern period (1808–1939) ==
=== Napoleonic Wars ===

In 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars, Catalonia was occupied by the troops of General Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. The official Spanish army had evaporated, but popular resistance against the French occupation occurred in Catalonia as in other parts of Spain, and eventually developed into the Peninsular War. A local army defeated the French in a series of battles at El Bruc, near Barcelona. Meanwhile, Girona was besieged by the French and defended by its inhabitants under the direction of general and military governor Mariano Álvarez de Castro. The French finally took the city on 10 December 1809, after many deaths on both sides from hunger, epidemics, and cold; Álvarez de Castro died in prison one month later.

The rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of &quot;juntas&quot; (councils) across Spain who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions, and sending delegates to the Cortes of Cádiz. In Catalonia, the juntas of Catalan corregimientos established in Lleida the Superior Junta of the Government of the Principality of Catalonia which it declared itself as depositary of the faculties of the Royal Audience of Catalonia, as well as the legislative power. At the same time, Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of Marshall Augereau, and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1813, Catalonia was directly annexed to France itself, and organized an ordinary civil administration in the form of four (later two) départements: Bouches-de-l&#x27;Èbre (prefecture: Lleida), Montserrat (Barcelona), Sègre (Puigcerdà), and Ter (Girona). French dominion in parts of Catalonia lasted until 1814, when the British General Wellington signed the armistice by which the French left Barcelona and the other strongholds that they had managed to keep until the last.

=== The Carlist wars and the liberal state ===

The reign of Ferdinand VII (reigned 1808–33) saw several Catalan uprisings and after his death, the conflict over the succession between the absolutist &quot;Carlist&quot; partisans of Infante Carlos and the liberal partisans of Isabella II led to the First Carlist War, which lasted until 1840 and was especially virulent in the Catalan territory. Catalonia was divided. The most industrialized areas support liberalism and the Catalan bourgeoisie tries to contribute to the construction of the new liberal state. As with the Basques, many Catalans fought on the Carlist side, not necessarily because they supported absolute monarchy, but because some of them hoped that restoration of the Old Regime would mean restoration of their &quot;fueros&quot; and recovery of regional autonomy.
The victory of the liberals over the absolutists led to a &quot;bourgeois revolution&quot; during the reign of Isabella II. In 1834, by decree of minister Javier de Burgos, Spain was organized into provinces, included Catalonia, which was divided in four provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona) without a common administration. The reign of Isabella II was marked by corruption, administrative inefficiency, centralism, and political and social tensions. The liberals soon divided into &quot;moderates&quot; and &quot;progressives&quot;, and in Catalonia a republican current began to develop; also, inevitably, Catalans generally favored a more federal Spain. During the second third of the century, there were various progressive uprisings in Barcelona and other places, known as bullangues. The last insurrection of the period, the Jamància (1843), which tried to expel the government of General Espartero and proposed a progressive program and postulates close to federalism, ended with Barcelona blocked and bombed by the army, representing the triumph of the moderates and its centralist politics.

The Second Carlist War (1846–1849) took place fundamentally in Catalonia, largely promoted by the displeasure of large sectors of the population with the moderate model of the liberal state that was being established at that time. This explains the collaboration of the progressives and republicans with the Carlists in 1848, coinciding with the democratic revolutions in France and the rest of Europe.

When General O&#x27;Donnell, leader of the Liberal Union, was appointed as prime minister in 1856 seems that the relationship between Catalan society and the Spanish government became more hopeful. Surprisingly, the reaction in Catalonia to the Hispano-Moroccan War was enthusiastic, and it was organized a company of Catalan volunteers that were received in Africa by the General Joan Prim, born in Reus. The fall of the government of the Liberal Union without being able to accomplish the expected reforms and the return of the moderates to power ended the hopes of Catalan society.
In September 1868, Spain&#x27;s continuing economic crisis triggered the September Revolution or &quot;La Gloriosa&quot;, resulting in the deposition of Isabella II and beginning the so-called Sexenio Democrático, the &quot;six democratic years&quot; (1868–1874). As usual, popular revolts and juntas were formed across the country, until the new government ordered its dissolution. General Joan Prim was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government (1869–1870), his government called to a parliamentary election by universal manhood suffrage for the first time in order to establish the political future of Spain. In Catalonia, federalists republicans won the overall majority of seats, while the general results in Spain gave a victory to a progressive monarchist coalition. Spain was declared a democratic monarchy and Amadeo of Savoy elected new king. Few days before the arrival of Amadeo, Prim was assassinated. Meanwhile, the federalists republicans of Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia and Balearic Islands signed the Federal Pact of Tortosa (1869) and there was a federalist revolt at the same year.
The rise of Amadeo I to the throne of Spain (1870–1873) proved unstable, his reign saw the outbreak of the Third Carlist War (1872–1876), Cuba&#x27;s fight for independence, the spread of the ideas of the First International and economic troubles, ending with the resignation of the king. This decision allowed the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874). The Republic fought against the inherited problems and with others like the cantonal insurrection. During its short existence it was unable to establish a federal republic and it had four presidents. Its first presidents, Estanislau Figueras and Francesc Pi i Margall, were Catalans. Along the period there were attempts from radical federalists to proclaim a federated Catalan State. After the fall of president Emilio Castelar, the General Pavia made a coup d&#x27;état, disbanding the Cortes and appointed General Serrano as president without parliamentary control.

=== Industrialization, Renaixença and Modernisme ===
Since the 1830s, boosted by the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside, Catalonia became a centre of Spain&#x27;s industrialization and it became one of the largest textile producers in the Mediterranean. In 1832 the Bonaplata Factory was established, the first industrial establishment in the country to make use of the steam engine. Catalonia had to contend with a grave shortage of energy resources and the weakness of the domestic Spanish market. To encourage industrial expansion, Spain established protectionist policies which reduced foreign competition domestically (although the policy of Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism). Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the Iberian Peninsula in 1848, linking Barcelona with Mataró, built with private capital. These initiatives partially benefitted the country&#x27;s industrial regions, Catalonia, the Basque Country and later Asturias. As in much of Europe, the working class lived and worked in often inhuman conditions.
As a response to the lack of energy resources, a large number of factories were installed on the margins of the rivers when the use of the water turbine widespread. Usually, the factories included a company town; Catalonia has a high density of such towns, known locally as industrial colonies (&quot;colònies industrials&quot;). They are especially concentrated in river basins along the Ter and Llobregat. In the comarca of Berguedà, for example, within 20 km there were 14 colonies. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural areas, distant any other population centres. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people. These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies.

The second third of the 19th century saw a Catalan cultural renaissance (Renaixença), a cultural movement to recover Catalan language and culture after a long period of decay. As with most of the other Romantic movements, it was noted for its admiration of the Middle Ages, which was often reflected in art and, in Barcelona, the literary contest known as Floral Games (&quot;Jocs Florals&quot;) was revived. The historical research of Antoni de Capmany, the interest in normalizing the Catalan language and the emergence of an incipient intellectuality interested in popular culture are already produced during the Enlightenment. Josep Pau Ballot wrote &quot;Gramatica y apología de la llengua cathalana&quot; between 1810 and 1813, during the French occupation. This work is realized with patriotic intention and disseminator of the use of Catalan. Between 1833 and the reestablishment of the Floral Games in 1859, the Catalan language lives in a situation of disglossy: many authors of the Renaixença wrote some literature and poetry in Catalan, but they will continue to use Spanish in their main works. However, the popular classes continued to use Catalan, and during this period popular theater in Catalan became relevant, unlike the representations of the Liceu addressed to the bourgeoisie, which used Spanish.

=== Catalan nationalism and the workers movement ===

In 1874, a coup by General Martínez Campos in Sagunto led to a restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in the person of Alfonso XII. A period of political stability, of repression of the workers movement, and of a slow growth in Catalan nationalist identity extended to the early years of the 20th century, when once again political opposition broke to the fore, especially republicanism and Catalan nationalism, but also class-based politics reflecting social tensions.

The following decades saw the rise of the political Catalanism still prevalent today: the first formulations of the modern Catalan national identity can be seen in Valentí Almirall, a relevant federalist republican. Almirall, despite being a left-wing republican, tried to unite the Catalan left and right, but he did not succeed because there were too many divergences between the two currents. He promoted the First Catalanist Congress, held in 1880, in which the different Catalanist groups were united: federal republicanism and the apolitical current, the literary one, from &quot;La Renaixença&quot; magazine, but the leftist tendencies of Almirall caused that the group of the Renaixença left the Congress and broke the agreement. However, the Congress took three fundamental agreements: creating an entity that brings together Catalanism (the Centre Català, &quot;Catalan Center&quot;), the beginning of efforts to establish the Academy of the Catalan Language, and the drafting of a document on defense of Catalan as official language. The crisis of the Centre Català was shown due the differences around the position about the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. The opposite positions led to the dissolution of the group, and the left-wing Catalan nationalism was seriously weakened for decades.

The conservative elements of Catalan nationalism founded the League of Catalonia in 1887 who, in 1891, were united with the group &quot;La Renaixença&quot;, creating the Unió Catalanista (Catalanist Union). The &quot;Unió&quot; redacted, in 1892, the Basis of Catalan regional autonomy, also known as &quot;Bases de Manresa&quot;, a program that demanded a specific autonomy for Catalonia. In 1901 Enric Prat de la Riba and Francesc Cambó formed the Regionalist League (&quot;Lliga Regionalista&quot;), which in 1906 led the successful electoral coalition Solidaritat Catalana, created by diverse Catalan political groups (from conservative to Catalan left-wing nationalists and from republicanism to carlism) as a response to Cu-Cut! affair, in which officers of the Spanish Army, angry with this satirical magazine for publish an offending joke about the war in Morocco, stormed the Cu-Cut! offices, and the subsequent &quot;Ley de Jurisdicciones&quot;, that punish the &quot;crimes&quot; and &quot;insults&quot; against the army and the symbols of the nation, putting them under military trials.

Catalan nationalism, under the leadership of Prat de la Riba, achieved in 1913 a victory in obtaining partial self-government for the &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (Catalan: &quot;Mancomunitat&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Mancomunidad&quot;), a grouping of the four Catalan provinces, presided over first by Prat de la Riba, and later by Josep Puig i Cadafalch; this was later suppressed in March 1925, during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. The Commonwealth of Catalonia established a modern infrastructure, such as roads and telephones and expanded the culture (libraries, professional education, use and regulation of Catalan language, promotion of sciences...). In 1919 the Commonwealth promoted the first project of Statute of Autonomy, but the disagreements with the government of Madrid, the opposition of sectors of Spanish society and the coincidence with the rise of the workers movement provoked the fall of the project.
The Catalan workers movement at the turn of the twentieth century consisted of three tendencies: syndicalism, socialism, and anarchism, part of the last openly embracing &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; as advocated by Alejandro Lerroux. Along with Asturias, Catalonia in general and Barcelona in particular was a center of radical labor agitation, marked by numerous general strikes, assassinations (especially in the late 1910s), and the rise of the pro-anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour, CNT, founded in Barcelona in 1910). Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909, resulting in the deaths of over 100 citizens. The anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving, after a successful strike which paralyzed much of the industry of Catalonia, the first eight-hour workday of Western Europe in 1919. The escalating violence between Catalan workers and the Catalan bourgeoisie (&quot;Pistolerismo&quot;) led the latter to embrace the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, despite his centralizing tendencies. (&quot;See also Anarchism in Spain&quot;).

The initial acceptance of the Dictatorship by the conservative League made the Catalan nationalism progressively more leftist (with the rise of parties as Acció Catalana, Catalan Republican Party or the Socialist Union of Catalonia) and, some of them, also pro-independence (Estat Català). Despite this tolerance, Primo de Rivera abolished the Commonwealth of Catalonia in 1925 and started a policy of repression against the Catalan nationalism, Catalan language and labour movement (especially anarchism and communism). In 1926, Estat Català tried to liberate Catalonia with a little army (established in the town of Prats de Molló in Roussillon, France), led by Francesc Macià, and proclaim the independent Catalan Republic, but the complot was discovered by the French police. Macià and the Catalan issue gained popularity all over the world.

During the last steps of the Dictatorship, Barcelona celebrated the 1929 International Exposition, while Spain started to suffer an economical crisis caused by the economical policy of the government and the Wall Street crash.

=== Republic and autonomy ===
After the fall of Primo de Rivera, the Catalan left made great efforts to create a united front under the leadership of left-wing independentist leader Francesc Macià, founder of Estat Català. The &quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot; (Republican Left of Catalonia, or ERC) represented a break with the electoral abstentionism that, until then had been characteristic of the Catalan workers. Advocating moderate socialism, republicanism and Catalan self-determination, the party achieved a spectacular victory in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, which preceded the 14 April proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. After a brief proclamation of the Catalan Republic (14–17 April) by the ERC leader, Francesc Macià, the Generalitat of Catalonia was revived as an autonomous government, and a Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia was approved on 9 September 1932 by the Cortes of the Republic after many discussions and political difficulties that considerably amended the original project. The Statute gave a strong, though not absolute, grant of self-government, and declared Catalan as official language in Catalonia alongside Spanish. A similar statute granted autonomy to the Basque Country, few years later. The Parliament of Catalonia was elected on 20 November 1932, and ERC won a large majority of seats, while the Regionalist League, almost hegemonic during the Monarchy, came in second place but far behind ERC.
Under its two presidents, Francesc Macià (1931–1933) and Lluís Companys (1934–1939), the Republican Generalitat, democratically led by the left, carried out a considerable task in different areas such as culture, health, education and civil law, despite the serious economic crisis that the Republic inherited, its social repercussions, the low fiscal autonomy granted by the Statute, and the political vicissitudes of the period. On 25 December 1933 Macià died and the Parliament appointed Companys as new president. Under his presidency, the Parliament continued to legislate in order to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie, approving laws like the Crop Contracts Law, which protected the tenant farmers and granted access to the land they were cultivating, but it was contested by the Regionalist League and provoking a legal dispute with the Spanish government led by Ricardo Samper, rising the tensions. Meanwhile, the Generalitat established its own Court of Cassation (Catalan: &quot;Tribunal de Cassació&quot;) and assumed executive powers in public order. The Statute was suspended in 1934, due to an uprising in Barcelona on 6 October of that year. President Companys proclaimed the Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic, as a response to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party CEDA to the government of the Republic. The CEDA was considered close to fascism and, therefore, they feared that it was the first step of this party to suppress the autonomy and take the power in Spain as Hitler and Dollfuss made in Germany and Austria. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan Government members were arrested.

As for the workers&#x27; movement, there was a crisis in the CNT (the greatest trade union in Catalonia at the time) with the break-away faction in the 1930s and its hostility against the Republic as a bourgeoisie regime growth, realizing demonstrations, general strikes and proclamations of the libertarian communism in some places like in the Alt Llobregat mining area in 1932, while the Marxist parties were progressively unified with the formation of the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM) in September 1935 and Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (Catalan: &quot;Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya&quot;, PSUC) in July 1936.

After the electoral victory of the left in the Spanish general election of February 1936 the government of the Generalitat was pardoned and reinstated in their functions. The period between that event and the military rebellion of July 1936 is considered as relatively peaceful in Catalonia, in contrast with the rest of Spain. The Parliament restored their legislative activities and the government prepared the People&#x27;s Olympiad in Barcelona, as a response against the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, which was then under control of Nazi Germany, but the same day of its planned inauguration (19 July), the Spanish Army carried out a partially failed coup d&#x27;état which led to the Spanish Civil War.

=== Civil War ===


The defeat of the initial military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona by forces of the Generalitat and workers&#x27; militias placed Catalonia firmly in the Republican camp. The loyalist victory allowed to the workers&#x27; self-armed militias, predominantly anarchists, to become the real power of the streets, which meant the beginning of a harsh repression in Catalonia against those elements of being &quot;fascist&quot; or right-wing sympathizers. Both the Generalitat and the central government were unable to stop the arbitrary revolutionary violence. During the war, there were two powers coexisting in Catalonia: the &quot;de jure&quot; power of the Generalitat and the &quot;de facto&quot; power of the armed popular militias. In order to begin the recovering of some control of the situation, Companys authorized on July 21 the establishment of a joint body by the different Catalan republican parties and the anarchist CNT and socialist UGT trade unions, The Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia (CCMA), becoming the effective Catalan government until its dissolution, two months later, replaced by a new government of the Generalitat which included anarchist ministers. Throughout Catalonia many sectors of the economy fell under the control of the CNT and the UGT, where workers&#x27; self-management was implemented. These included any kind of industry and services and thousands of dwellings previously owned by the upper classes. Initially, the newly collectivized factories encountered various problems. In response to these problems, the Generalitat, backed by the CNT approved a decree on &quot;Collectivization and Workers&#x27; Control&quot; on 24 October 1936. Under this decree all firms with more than 100 workers were to be collectivized and those with 100 or less could be collectivized if a majority of workers agreed. Violent confrontations between the workers&#x27; parties culminated in the defeat of the CNT-FAI and POUM in the 1937 May Days, against whom the PSUC unleashed strong repression. The local situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat partially lost its autonomous power within republican Spain.

The military forces of the Generalitat, weakly structured between December 1936 and May 1937 in the People&#x27;s Army of Catalonia (&quot;Exèrcit Popular de Catalunya&quot;), were concentrated on two fronts: Aragon and Majorca. The latter was an utter disaster. The Aragon front resisted firmly until 1938, when the occupation of Lleida and Balaguer destabilized it. Finally, Franco&#x27;s troops broke the republican territory in two by occupying the Valencian coastal town of Vinaròs, isolating Catalonia from the rest of Republican Spain. The defeat of the Republican army in the Battle of the Ebro led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco&#x27;s forces, who abolished completely the Catalan self-government and brought in a dictatorial regime, which took strong measures against Catalan nationalism and culture. Only forty years later, after Franco&#x27;s death (1975) and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain (1978), did Catalonia recover its autonomy and reconstitute the Generalitat (1977).

George Orwell served with the POUM in Catalonia from December 1936 until June 1937. His memoir of that time, &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, was first published in 1938 and foreshadowed the causes of Second World War. It remains one of the most widely read books on the Spanish Civil War.

==Contemporary period (1939–present)==
=== Franco&#x27;s dictatorship ===
As in the rest of Spain, the Franco era (1939–1975) in Catalonia saw the annulment of democratic liberties, the prohibition and persecution of parties, the rise of thoroughgoing censorship, and the banning of all leftist institutions. In Catalonia it also meant, yet again, the annulment of the Statute of Autonomy, the banning of the whole specifically Catalan institutions and legislation. Catalan was subject to oppression and was reduced to family use. Castilian (Spanish) became the only language of education, administration and the media. During the first years, all resistance was energetically suppressed, the prisons filled up with political prisoners, and thousands of Catalans went into exile. In addition, 4000 Catalans were executed between 1938 and 1953, among them the former president of the Generalitat Lluís Companys (taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France).

The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. The economic recovery was very slow and it was not until the second half of the 1950s that the economy of Catalonia reached the prewar levels of 1936. After an initial period in which Spain tried to build an autarky, in which the economy improved little, Franco&#x27;s regime changed its economic policies in 1959 and in the 1960s and early 1970s the economy entered a period of rapid economic expansion that became known as the Spanish Miracle. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were relatively low, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. The period was marked by agricultural modernization, a massive expansion of industry and the start of mass tourism, which it was concentrated on the coast (Costa Brava in Girona and Costa Daurada in Tarragona). As industry in Catalonia expanded, workers migrated from rural areas across Spain (particularly Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia and Galicia), to work in Barcelona and its surrounding area, turning it into one of Europe&#x27;s largest industrial metropolitan areas, which in turn led to dramatic urbanisation. Working-class opposition to Franco began to appear, usually clandestinely, and most notably in the form of the Comisiones Obreras (&quot;Workers Commissions&quot;), a return of trade union organizing, and the revival of the PSUC, while the students&#x27; protests turned frequent. In the 1970s democratic forces united under the banner of the Assembly of Catalonia (&quot;Assemblea de Catalunya&quot;), demanding political and social freedom, amnesty for the political prisoners, the reestablishment of the autonomy of Catalonia and the collaboration with the democratic forces of the rest of Spain.

During later stages of Francoist Spain, folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the mass media had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s in the theatre. During the 60s and 70s the Catalan music entered into a period of renewal and growth known as Nova Cançó. Initially appeared with Els Setze Jutges group, it quickly became a mass phenomenon that incorporated the protest song against the Dictatorship and helped bring forth prominent singers and groups such as Joan Manuel Serrat, Lluís Llach, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, Ovidi Montllor or Grup de Folk.

=== Democracy restored ===

Franco&#x27;s death initiated a period that came to be known as the &quot;democratic transition&quot;, during which democratic liberties were restored, culminating in the Spanish Constitution of 1978. This constitution recognized the existence of multiple national communities within Spain and proposed the division of the country into autonomous communities. After the first general election in 1977 the Generalitat was restored as a provisional government, headed by its president in exile Josep Tarradellas, and including representatives of the various leading forces of the time. In 1979, the new Statute of Autonomy was finally approved delegating more autonomy in matters of education and culture than the Republican 1932 Statute, but less in terms of the systems of justice and public order. In it, Catalonia is defined as a &quot;nationality&quot;, Catalan is recognized as Catalonia&#x27;s own language, and became co-official with Spanish. First election to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to Jordi Pujol, a position he would hold until 2003. During this time he also led Convergència i Unió (Convergence and Unity, CiU) a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition consisting of his own Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (Democratic Convergence of Catalonia, CDC) and the smaller and more conservative Unió Democràtica de Catalunya (Democratic Union of Catalonia, UDC).

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (called &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot;, officially refunded as the police of Catalonia in 1983), the restoration of the comarcal administrations (roughly equivalent to United States &quot;counties&quot; or United Kingdom &quot;shires&quot; or &quot;counties&quot;, but distinct from the historical Catalan counties) and a High Court in the form of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia (Catalan: &quot;Tribunal Superior de Justícia de Catalunya&quot;). Catalonia&#x27;s Law of Linguistic Normalization promoted Catalan-language media. The broadcasting network Televisió de Catalunya and its first channel TV3, which broadcast mainly in Catalan, were created in 1983. The Catalan government also provides subsidies to various means of promoting Catalan culture, including for example the making of Catalan-language films or the subtitling of foreign-language films in Catalan.

In 1992 Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics, which brought international attention to Catalonia. During the 1990s, the absence of absolute majorities in the Spanish parliament made governments reliant on support from the various nationalist parties (Catalan, Basque, Canary Islands, etc.) which was leveraged by CiU, to broaden the scope of Catalan autonomy during the last government of Felipe González (1993–1996) and the first of José María Aznar (1996–2000).

In November 2003, elections to the Generalitat gave the plurality, but not the majority of seats to CiU. Three other parties (Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia–Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, PSC-PSOE, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV)) united to take the government into a left-wing nationalist coalition, making Pasqual Maragall, (PSC-PSOE) the new president of Catalonia. This government proved unstable, especially on the issue of reforming the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. The Statute was approved by the Parliament of Catalonia on 30 September 2005, and subsequently it was sent to the Cortes Generales for review and discussion. They approved the law on 10 May 2006, on 18 June Catalan citizens ratified the Statute, and have been in force since 9 August 2006. The new Statute of Autonomy consolidated the self-government, and included the definition of Catalonia as a nation in the preamble. The internal tensions of Catalan Government provoked new elections, held in autumn 2006. The result was again a plurality, but not a majority, for CiU, and PSC-PSOE, ERC and ICV again formed a coalition, with José Montilla (PSC-PSOE) as president.

On 16 September 2005, the ICANN officially approved the domain.cat, the first domain for a language community.

=== Independence process ===

The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved by referendum, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish nationalism and the conservative People&#x27;s Party, sending the law to the partisan Constitutional Court of Spain which, in 2010, decided to declare nonvalid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, aspects of the financing, the status of the Catalan language or the references of Catalonia as a nation. As a response, on 10 July 2010, a successful demonstration was held, and the civil society started a process of organization in order to exert the right of self-determination. While the economic crisis affected profoundly Spain, CiU win the Catalan election of 2010, promising a fiscal agreement similar to the Basque. Its leader, Artur Mas, was appointed as president. Initially supported by the PP, his government carried out a program of austerity. During the National Day of Catalonia, on 11 September 2012, a massive demonstration in the streets of Barcelona organized by the organization Catalan National Assembly (&quot;Assemblea Nacional Catalana&quot;, ANC) claimed for independence and a referendum of self-determination.

On 23 January 2013, parliament approved a Declaration on the Sovereignty and right to decide of the people of Catalonia asserting that Catalonia is a sovereign entity and calls for a referendum on independence. After the impediments of Spanish institutions, on 9 November 2014 the Government of Catalonia organized the independence referendum, in which allegedly 1.6 million out of potential 5.4 million voters or 80.8% of the 2.25 million cast votes supported the independence option (as per unofficial records).

On 9 November 2015, parliament approved a Declaration to start the independence process of Catalonia asserting the start of the process to create an independent Catalan state in the form of a republic.

===2017 Independence referendum===

A controversial independence referendum was held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017, using a disputed voting process. It was declared illegal on 6 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain because it breached the Spanish Constitution. Subsequently, the European Commission agreed that the referendum was illegal. The referendum asked the question: &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?&quot;. More than 2,020,000 voters (91.96%) answered &quot;Yes&quot; and around 177,000 answered &quot;No&quot;, on a turnout of 43.03%. The Catalan government estimated that up to 770,000 votes were not cast due to polling stations being closed off during the police crackdown, although the &quot;universal census&quot; system introduced earlier in the day allowed electors to vote in any given polling station. Catalan government officials have argued that the turnout would be higher were it not for Spanish police suppression of the vote of the illegal referendum, and that were it not for closures and police successful intervention to siege the illegal votes. Up to 770,000 votes were lost as a result of the crackdowns at police stations, the Catalan government estimated, and that were it not for closures and police pressure and disproportionate violence (it is estimated that around 1,000 people were injured during that day), turnout could have been as high as 55%. On the other hand, many voters who did not support Catalan independence did not turn out.
Catalonia declared independence.
The independence motion was passed on 27 October 2017 in the Catalan assembly. The results of the parties remaining were with 70 votes in favour, 10 against and two blank ballots. Just hours after the Catalan declaration of independence, the Spanish Senate invoked Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution and authorised Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy&#x27;s government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. Rajoy declared the dissolution of the Catalan Parliament and dismissed Catalonia&#x27;s Government, including its president, Carles Puigdemont. Rajoy called a snap Catalan parliamentary election for 21 December 2017.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria was chosen to assume the functions of the President of Catalonia, as part of the actions that resulted after the activation of Article 155. Santamaria was vested total control over the Catalan administration in addition to being appointed president. Josep Lluís Trapero was also relieved of his duty as chief of the Catalan police force.

On 1 May 2018 Quim Torra was elected President of Catalonia after the Spanish courts blocked the election of Carles Puigdemont, who had the support of the Catalan Parliament after the December election; Jordi Turull, and Jordi Sànchez. Carles Puigdemont was declared non-legible after fleeing the Spanish judiciary system. Jordi Sànchez was declared non-ilegible since he was in jail awaiting trial and Jordi Turull was summoned to court and kept in jail half-way through the investiture debate.

On 1 June 2018 a motion of no confidence in the Spanish government was successful, and resulted in the downfall of Mariano Rajoy and in socialist leader Pedro Sánchez becoming new prime minister of Spain. Catalan nationalist parties were a key support to the downfall of Rajoy.
