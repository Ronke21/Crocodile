<text>The Romaniote Jews or the Romaniotes (, &quot;Rhōmaniôtes&quot;; ) are a Greek-speaking ethnic Jewish community. They are one of the oldest Jewish communities in existence and the oldest Jewish community in Europe. The Romaniotes have been, and remain, historically distinct from the Sephardim, some of whom settled in Ottoman Greece after the expulsion of Jews from Spain and Portugal after 1492.

Their distinct language was Yevanic, a Greek dialect that contained Hebrew along with some Aramaic and Turkish words, but today&#x27;s Romaniotes speak Modern Greek or the languages of their new home countries. Their name is derived from the endonym &quot;Rhōmanía&quot; (), which refers to the Eastern Roman Empire (&quot;Empire of the Romans&quot;, ). Large Romaniote communities were located in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Arta, Preveza, Volos, Chalcis, Thebes, Corinth, Patras, and on the islands of Corfu, Crete, Zakynthos, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Rhodes, and Cyprus, among others.

Most of the Jews of Greece were murdered in the Holocaust after the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II and the deportation of most of the Jews to Nazi concentration camps. After the war, a majority of the survivors emigrated to Israel, the United States, and Western Europe. Today there are still functioning Romaniote synagogues in Chalkis (which represents the oldest Jewish congregation on European soil), Ioannina, Veria, Athens, New York City, and Israel.

==Name==
The name &quot;Romaniote&quot; refers to the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantium, which included the territory of modern Greece, which this Jewish group inhabited for centuries. Historically, the Empire was commonly referred to as &quot;Rhōmanía&quot; () and its Christian citizens as &quot;Rhōmaîoi&quot;, &quot;Romans&quot; (), while the Greek-speaking Jews were called &quot;Rhōmaniôtes&quot; (Ῥωμανιῶτες), essentially meaning inhabitants of Rhōmanía.

==History==

Jews have lived in Greece since at least the Second Temple era (516 BCE – 70 CE). Recorded Jewish presence in Greece dates back over 2,300 years to the time of Alexander the Great. The earliest reference to a Greek Jew is an inscription dated , found in Oropos, a small coastal town between Athens and Boeotia, which refers to &quot;Moschos, son of Moschion the Jew&quot;, who may have been a slave.

A Hellenistic Jewish synagogue was discovered in 1829 near the ancient military port of the capital of the island of Aegina by the Scottish-German historian Ludwig Ross, who was working for the court of King Otto of Greece. The floor was covered for protection and was studied again by Thiersch in 1901, Furtwängler in 1904, E. Sukenik in 1928 and Gabriel Welter in 1932 under the auspices of the National Archaeological Service. Based on the quality of the floor&#x27;s mosaic, the building is believed to have been constructed in the 4th century CE (300–350 CE) and used until the 7th century. The mosaic floor of the synagogue consists of multi-colored tesserae that create the impression of a carpet, in a geometric pattern of blue, gray, red and white. Two Greek inscriptions were found in front of the synagogue&#x27;s entrance, on the western side of the building. Today, only part of the synagogue&#x27;s mosaic floor is extant, and it has been moved from its original location to the courtyard of the island&#x27;s Archaeological Museum.

In 1977 another ancient synagogue was discovered in Athens, the Synagogue in the Agora of Athens, which may be the synagogue in which Paul the Apostle preached. Inscriptions in the Samaritan and Greek alphabets found in Thessaloniki may originate from Samaritan synagogues. Concurrently the oldest synagogue found in the diaspora is also the oldest Samaritan synagogue: it is the Delos Synagogue, which has an inscription dated between 250 and 175 BCE

The Romaniotes are Greek Jews, distinct from both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, who trace back their history to the times of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Jews and can be subdivided in a wider sense in a Rabbanite community and in the Greco-Karaite community of the Constantinopolitan Karaites which still survives to this day. A Romaniote oral tradition says that the first Jews arrived in Ioannina shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Before the migration of the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi Jews into the Balkans and Eastern Europe, the Jewish culture in these areas consisted primarily of Romaniote Jews.

The Romaniote rites represent those of the Greek-speaking Jews of the Byzantine (or former Byzantine) Empire, ranging from southern Italy (in a narrower sense the Apulian, the Calabrian and the Sicilian Jewish communities) in the west, to much of Turkey in the east, Crete to the south, Crimea (the Krymchaks) to the north and the Jews of the early medieval Balkans and Eastern Europe.

The Sefer Yosippon was written down in the 10th century in Byzantine Southern Italy by the Greek-speaking Jewish community there. Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi, a Romaniote Jew from Achrida edited and expanded the Sefer Josippon later. This community of Byzantine Jews of southern Italy produced such prominent works like the Sefer Ahimaaz of Ahimaaz ben Paltiel, the Sefer Hachmoni of Shabbethai Donnolo, the Aggadath Bereshit and many Piyyutim. The liturgical writings of these Romaniote Jews, especially the piyyut were eminent for the development of the Ashkenazi Mahzor, as they found their way through Italy to Ashkenaz and are preserved to this day in the most Ashkenazi mahzorim.

The Jews of Southern Italy (where they were living together with their Greek-speaking Christian counterparts) continued to be Greek-speakers until the 15th century. When they were expelled and went to different regions of Greece, especially Corfu, Epirus and Thessaloniki, they could continue to speak their Greek language, even if this language was somewhat different from that of Greece.

In the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela travelled through the Byzantine Empire and recorded details about communities of Jews in Corfu, Arta, Aphilon, Patras, Corinth, Thebes, Chalkis, Thessaloniki, and Drama. The largest community in Greece at that time was in Thebes, where he found about 2000 Jews. They were engaged mostly in cloth dyeing, weaving, in the production of silverware and silk garments. At the time, they were already known as &quot;Romaniotes&quot;.

The first Romaniote synagogue coming under Ottoman rule was &quot;Etz ha-Hayyim&quot; (Hebrew: עץ החיים, lit. &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, frequently a name of Romaniote synagogues) in Prousa in Asia Minor which passed to Ottoman authority in 1324. After the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, Sultan Mehmed II found the city in a state of disarray. The city had indeed suffered many sieges, a devastating conquest by Catholic Crusaders in 1204 and even a case of the Black Death in 1347, and now had been long cut off from its hinterland, so the city was a shade of its former glory. The event of the conquest of Constantinople was written down by a Romaniote Payetan in a lament hymn, composed with several phrases from the Old Testament in the &quot;shibusi style&quot;.

As Mehmed wanted to make the city his new capital, he decreed its rebuilding. And in order to revivify Constantinople he ordered that Muslims, Christians and Jews from all over his empire be resettled in the new capital. Within months most of the Empire&#x27;s Romaniote Jews, from the Balkans and Anatolia, were concentrated in Constantinople, where they made up 10% of the city&#x27;s population. The forced resettlement, though not intended as an anti-Jewish measure, was perceived as an &quot;expulsion&quot; by the Jews. Nevertheless, the Romaniotes would remain the most influential Jewish community in the Empire for decades to come, determining the Chief Rabbis of the towns and the Hakham Bashi of the Ottoman Empire until their leading position was lost to a wave of new Jewish arrivals. These events initiated the first great numerical decline of the Romaniote community.

The number of Jews was soon bolstered by small groups of Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1421 and 1453. Waves of Sephardi Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492; many settled in Ottoman-ruled Greece. They spoke a separate language, Ladino. Thessaloniki had one of the largest (mostly Sephardi) Jewish communities in the world and a solid rabbinical tradition. On the island of Crete, the Jews historically played an important part in the transport trade. In the centuries following 1492 most of the Romaniote communities were assimilated by the more numerous Sephardim.

The status of Jewry in the Ottoman Empire often hinged on the whims of the sultan. Murad III for example ordered that the attitude of all non-Muslims should be one of &quot;humility and abjection&quot; and should not &quot;live near Mosques or in tall buildings&quot; or own slaves.

After the liberation of Ioannina on February 21, 1913, the Rabbi and the Romaniote community of Ioannina welcomed at the New Synagogue of Ioannina the liberator of the city, Crown Prince Constantine, the future King of the Hellenes Constantine I.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Romaniote community of Ioannina numbered about 4,000 people, mostly lower-class tradesmen and craftsmen. Their numbers dwindled after that due to economic emigration; after the Holocaust and in the wake of World War II, there were approximately 1,950 Romaniotes left in Ioannina. Centered around the old fortified part of the city (or Kastro), where the community had been living for centuries, they maintained two synagogues, one of which, the Kehila Kedosha Yashan Synagogue still remains today.

A strong Romaniote community was present in Corfu until the late 19th century, when a pogrom sparked by blood libel charges forced most of the Jewish community to leave the island.

==Nusach and Minhag==
The Romaniote prayer rite (Nusach) as seen in the original &quot;Mahzor Romania&quot; and the Romaniote commentaries (Minhag) on Jewish exegesis and Jewish law, vary from those of the Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrachi Jews, and are closer to those of the Italian Jews: some of these are thought to have been based on the Jerusalem Talmud instead of the Babylonian Talmud (see Eretz-Yisrael minhag). This Minhag was once widespread in Southern Italy, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia and the Crimea.

The Romaniotes spoke Judaeo-Greek for a long time, and many of them still use the Greek language today. Tobiah ben Eliezer (טוביה בר אליעזר), a Greek-speaking Talmudist and poet of the 11th century, worked and lived in the city of Kastoria. He is the author of the &quot;Lekach Tov&quot;, a midrashic commentary on the Pentateuch and the Five Megillot and also of some poems. Romaniote scholars translated the Tanakh into Greek. A polyglot edition of the Bible published in Constantinople in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) translation on one side, a Yevanic translation on the other and the Judaeo-Aramaic Targum at the bottom of the page.

In the early Romaniote rite the Torah was subdivided in Sedarim while the whole Torah was read in the Palestinian way of the Triennial cycle. The order for reading the Haftarah followed a specific custom, particular to the Romaniote rite. The Romaniote Torah scrolls are housed in &quot;tikim&quot; (&#x27;tik&#x27;, from Greek &quot;thḗkē&quot;, θήκη &quot;container&quot;), from which they are never completely taken out. Among the Romaniote Jews, tradition dictates, that the most holy Sefer Torah, the Law of Moses, be read with the scroll standing upright in its &quot;tik&quot;; it is considered improper to lay it flat.

The siddur (prayer book) for the Romaniote rite was known as the &quot;Mahzor Romania&quot;. The Romaniote Jews have their own form of wedding blessing. Upon the betrothal, seven blessings are bestowed on the bride and groom to be, while wedding wreaths are covering the heads of the groom and the bride and are interchanged on their heads. At the end of a full year, the Ketubah was read at the wedding ceremony proper. This is different in that other Jews bless the bride and groom at the time of the actual wedding. In addition, there are ritual differences in the building of the Synagogue and in the building and the use of the mikve. It is a Romaniote tradition to write on the Ketubah the year since creation of the world and the year since the destruction of the Temple.

The Romaniotes traditionally gave to a child a mystical document known as an &quot;aleph&quot;. This hand-painted &quot;birth and circumcision certificate&quot; was created by a family member and then handed down. The aleph was written in mystical codes for the purpose of warding off the wiles of Lillith, Adam&#x27;s first wife.

The Romaniotes are well known for their hymns in Judaeo-Greek and Hebrew, for their special way of cantillation, based on the Byzantine melos and for their Jewish-Greek folksongs, based on regional melodies. Jewish immigrants from Sicily brought to Ioannina the celebration of the Sicilian Purim Katan. The Jews of Ioannina call this holiday &quot;Pourimopoulo&quot;. They read the special &quot;Megillah for the Purim Katan of Syracuse&quot; and sing corresponding songs and hymns for this festivity.

The Mahzor of the Romaniote Kaffa Rite from the year 1735 gives the order to read the Megillat Antiochos in the Mincha of Shabbat Hanukkah. In the second half of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika. Today, the Romaniote Liturgy follows (with slight differences) the mainstream Sephardic usage, while the Romaniotes and the Jews of Corfu have preserved their old and own Judaeo-Greek and Hebrew &quot;piyyutim&quot;, their own way of cantillation and their special customs. A custom, which is still followed in the Etz Hayyim Synagogue of Crete, is to read on Yom Kippur the Book of Jonah in Judaeo-Greek. Another custom was to chant the Song of Songs verse by verse by alternating from Hebrew to its paraphrasing Targum Jonathan translation after the morning service on the last two days of Pessach.

Romaniote Synagogues have their own layout: the &quot;bimah&quot; (where the Torah scrolls are read out during services) is on a raised dais on the western wall, the Aron haKodesh (where the Torah scrolls are kept) is on the eastern wall and in the middle there is a wide interior aisle. Votive offerings made of silver as stars or tablets called &quot;shadayot&quot; were a thankful gift to the Synagogue of congregants who have received help, healing or salvation by God. The Romaniote term for the Passover ceremony (Seder) is חובה (&quot;Hova&quot;), which means obligation. In 2004 the Jewish Museum of Greece published a Romaniote rite Pesach-Seder CD (&quot;The Ioannina Haggadah&quot;). In the years 2017 and 2018 the Romaniote rite Haggadah and the Romaniote rite prayer book (&quot;siddur&quot;) have been published in a series, containing also Romaniote poetry, the haftarot according to the Romaniote custom and other texts. A Romaniote rite based reform &quot;siddur&quot; in Greek and Hebrew has also been published in 2018.

==Language and literature==
The intellectual pursuits of Romaniote Jews reflected in their history their geographical location within the Jewish and gentile world. Direct heir to Palestinian Jewish traditions on the one hand, they were also heir to the teachings of the Greco-Roman world. The Byzantine Jewish/Romaniote literature shows a rich blend of Hellenistic Jewish and Palestinian rabbinic traditions. Romaniote Jewry, throughout its history, expended great effort on religious poetry, which reached its peak during the period 1350–1550. The writing of piyyutim was clearly held as its own genre. In the twelfth century Hillel ben Eliakim wrote down his exegetical commentary, &quot;Sifre ve Sifra&quot;. Shemarya HaIkriti who moved after 1328 to Negroponte prepared his supercommentary to Ibn Ezra and, circa 1346–47 wrote his &quot;Sefer Amasyahu&quot;, a handbook of biblical apologetics. In tune with the intellectual currents among Romaniotes, Shemarya was trained in philosophy and was able to translate directly from Greek to Hebrew. The &quot;Sefer Yosippon&quot; was written by the Byzantine Jews of Southern Italy. R. Elnatan ben Moses Kalkes (from Kilkis) wrote a lengthy kabbalistic treatise entitled &quot;Eben Saphir&quot;. Mordecai Komatiano has left a legacy of some fifteen works on astronomy, grammar (dikduk), biblical commentaries and piyyutim; some of the later have even been included in the Karaite prayerbook. Several manuscripts containing mystical works have survived. The question of an independent Romaniote mystical tradition, probably deriving directly from Palestinian antecedents, is proved. An abridgement of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; by Yoseph HaYevani was made available to those Jews (Sephardi immigrants) who were less proficient in Greek. The Byzantine Karaites, showed a knowledge of Greek philosophical terminology. Rabbinic authors spiced their comments with Greek phrases. The familiarity of Romaniote Jewry with the Greek language is well documented. Biblical translations, piyyutim, folksongs, Ketubbot, liturgical instructions, glossaries, mystical texts and the use of Greek words in commentaries in Judaeo-Greek are known.

===Judaeo-Greek===
After World War II, the Judaeo-Greek language of Ioannina underwent a process of &quot;koinezation&quot;. The only phonetic differences to Standard Modern Greek, which could be noted shortly after the war have been [x] &gt; [s] before front vowels, unusual intonation patterns and some peculiar lexical items, mostly of Hebrew-Aramaic provenance. Lexemes, such as Hebrew-Aramaic loans, were easily identified as &quot;ours&quot; and &quot;theirs,&quot; i.e., Sephardic vs. Romaniote. While composing texts on their religion, the Greek Jews followed the literary standards of Greek syntax and morphology, using a number of Hebrew-Aramaic loanwords. The Hebrew-Aramaic component would be written down in ways reflecting traditional Romaniote pronunciation, for example &quot;Shalom&quot;, was spelled and written as &quot;Salom&quot; (Σαλώμ).

Krivoruchko states in her work &quot;Judeo-Greek in the era of globalization&quot; that Judaeo-Greek has always been interchangeable with the spoken variety of Greek, which was used by the surrounding Christian community, but had a few special features in its various geographical and chronological types (for example the Judaeo-Greek of Crete [† 1945] and that of Constantinople). Besides the few phonetic differences between Judaeo-Greek and Standard Modern Greek the most common difference has been the use of Hebrew and Aramaic loanwords in Judaeo-Greek. Considerable are also the phonetic differences between Romaniote Hebrew (look downwards on paragraph &quot;Romaniote Hebrew&quot;) and Sephardic Hebrew, for example Sephardic &quot;Shavuot&quot; was spelled as &quot;Savóth&quot; (Σαβώθ) in Judaeo-Greek.

Second and third generation Romaniote immigrants in New York city have good knowledge of Greek. In the beginning of the 21st century 90% asserted that they understand Greek while 40% could speak Greek comfortably. Over a third could read Greek satisfactorily. The number of persons fluent in the Greek Language is much lower in the group of the Greek Sephardim outside of Greece.

===Romaniote Hebrew===
The Romaniote pronunciation of the Hebrew language is very close in its major features to the common Modern Hebrew pronunciation. The vowel-system is a simple five-vowel system without either quantitative or qualitative distinctions. Typical was the absence of distinction between: the Semitic velarized and non-velarized stops [t] and [ṭ], spelled [ת/ט], and [k/q], spelled [כ/ק]. The distinction between [s] and [ṣ] (ס/צ) is maintained as [s] vs. [ts], i. e., a voiceless alveolar fricative against a voiceless alveolar affricate, a pronunciation common to Byzantine and Ashkenazic pronunciation; &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; [t], spelled [תּ/ת] (t/θ) preserved in Ashkenazic pronunciation as [t]/[s]; velar and pharyngeal [ħ] and [χ], spelled [ח/כ], both of which are pronounced [χ], as in Ashkenazic; the glottal and pharyngeal stops [ʔ] and [ʕ], spelled [ע/א], both of which are weakened to the point of almost total absence in syllable-initial and syllable-final position, another characteristic shared with the Ashkenazic tradition. שׁ was pronounced as [s] in the Romaniote tradition of Hebrew pronunciation. The loss of spirantization rule for postvocalic, non-geminated Old Hebrew b, d, g, p, t, k homorganic fricatives (this rule is not found now in either the Balkan or the North African Sephardic diaspora) may have been due Romaniote practice (it is observed partly in Yiddish Hebraisms and in the Ashkenazic pronunciation of monolingual Hebrew texts). The [ז] was pronounced as and the [ד] as [ð] which are typical sounds of the Standard Modern Greek.

The Hebrew Paleography resp. the Hebrew Epigraphy recognises a specific &quot;Byzantine&quot; or &quot;Romaniote&quot; Handwriting system of the Hebrew alphabet, which has been developed among the Soferim of the Greek-speaking lands. In many cases manuscripts of Romaniote origin from the Byzantine Empire, or from later times can be recognised as &quot;Romaniote&quot;, only with the science of Paleography, if they do not contain a Colophon (publishing) or other characteristics of identification.

==Holocaust and afterwards==

During World War II, when Greece was occupied by Nazi Germany, 86% of the Greek Jews, especially those in the areas occupied by Nazi Germany and Bulgaria, were murdered. Some Greeks collaborated with the deportations or expropriated Jewish property; a few, encouraged by the Greek Orthodox Church, sheltered Jews. Roughly 49,000 Jews—Romaniotes and Sephardim—were deported from Thessaloniki alone and murdered. Many Greek Jews were forced to pay their own tickets to the death camps. Almost all Romaniote Jews of the island of Crete, together with some resistance fighters, died on the ship &quot;Tanaḯs&quot; when it was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS &quot;Vivid&quot; on 9 June 1944.

During the German occupation, the Romaniotes&#x27; ability to speak Greek enabled them to hide better from German deportations than Sephardi Jews who spoke Ladino.

The majority of Romaniotes who survived the Holocaust left for Israel or the United States at the end of the war. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948, combined with the violence and anarchy of the Greek Civil War (1946–1949), led to an immigration of a number of Romaniotes to Israel. The great earthquake on the island of Zakynthos in 1953 led the last remaining Romaniote Jews to leave the island towards Athens. The vast majority of Romaniotes have relocated to Israel and the United States, with the world&#x27;s largest community located in New York.

==Present day==
Today approximately 4,500 to 6,000 Jews remain in Greece. Of these, only a small number are Romaniotes, who live mainly in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Chalkis and Athens. About 3,500 Jews now live in Athens, while another 1,000 live in Thessaloniki. A mixed community of Romaniote and Apulian Jews still lives on the Island of Corfu.

=== Greece ===

==== Athens ====
The Ioanniotiki Synagogue, situated above the Jewish Community of Athens offices at #8 Melidoni St., is the only Romaniote synagogue in Athens. Built in 1906, it now has services only during the High Holy Days, but can be opened for visitors upon request through the Jewish Community office.

The Jewish identity of another building found in the excavations of the ancient Agora in Athens, is questionable. It is believed that the Metroon, discovered in 1930 at the foot of the hill Hephaestion (Thesion) was used as a synagogue during its construction at the end of the 4th century CE (396–400). This view was expressed by the archaeologist H. Thompson, from the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, but was not developed into a complete theory. The Jewish identity of the Metroon was based on a small piece of marble found near the Metroon that had two Jewish symbols carved on one side, and the resemblance of the building to the synagogue of Sardis in Asia Minor.

==== Chalkis ====
The Romaniote Jewish Community of Chalkis is not the oldest one in Greece, but it is the only one in Europe that has been living in the same city for 2,500 years without interruption and the community is still active in the city&#x27;s life. The community has a synagogue and a cemetery with important and old inscriptions. The Synagogue is on Kotsou Street. It is unknown when the first synagogue in Chalkis was constructed. In 1854, during the Holy Week a great fire destroyed the synagogue. In 1855 it was re-constructed in the same size with funds offered by Sophie de Marbois-Lebrun, Duchess of Plaisance. The Synagogue opens every Friday evening and occasionally on Shabbat morning.

==== Ioannina ====
In Ioannina, the Romaniote community has dwindled to 50 mostly elderly people. The Kehila Kedosha Yashan Synagogue there is open primarily on the High Holidays, or in the case of the visit of a chazzan, or is opened for visitors on request. Immigrant Romaniotes return every summer to the old synagogue. After a long time a Bar Mitzvah (the Jewish ritual for celebrating the coming of age of a child) was held in the synagogue in 2000, and was an exceptional event for the community.

The synagogue is located in the old fortified part of the city known as &quot;Kastro&quot;, at 16 Ioustinianou street. Its name means &quot;the Old Synagogue&quot;. It was constructed in 1829, most probably over the ruins of an older synagogue. Its architecture is typical of the Ottoman era, a large building made of stone. The interior of the synagogue is laid out in the Romaniote way: the Bimah (where the Torah scrolls are read out during services) is on a raised dais on the western wall, the Aron haKodesh (where the Torah scrolls are kept) is on the eastern wall and in the middle there is a wide interior aisle. The names of the Ioanniote Jews who were killed in the Holocaust are engraved in stone on the walls of the synagogue. The Bet Chaim cemetery in Ioannina belongs to the community.

==== Volos ====
In the community of Volos many of the Romaniote pre-Sephardic traditions prevail. The community consists of Romaniotes as well as Sephardim (particularly from Larissa) and Corfiots. Ancient historic texts mention that Jews lived in the region of Magnesia, Thessaly and in particular in neighbouring Almyros as early as the 1st century AD. Historians argue that Jews have been living in ancient Demetrias since the 2nd century AD. Ancient Jewish tombstones dating back to 325–641 AD, were also discovered in the neighbouring city of Phthiotic Thebes. Moshe Pesach was Rabbi of Volos who saved Greek Jews during the Holocaust and helped to consolidate the community of Volos after World War II.

===Israel===
Most Romaniotes in Israel live in Tel Aviv. There are two Romaniote synagogues in Israel: the Zakynthos Synagogue in Tel Aviv, and the Beit Avraham Ve&#x27;ohel Sarah liKehilat Ioanina in Nachlaot, Jerusalem. The former Romaniote Yanina Synagogue in the Christian Quarter, Jerusalem is no longer in use. In Beit Avraham Ve&#x27;ohel Sarah liKehilat Ioanina in Jerusalem, the prayers today follow the Sephardic rite, but they preserve a few piyyutim from the Romaniote rite.

===United States===
Only one Romaniote synagogue (from originally several Romaniote Synagogues in New York) is in operation in the entire Western Hemisphere: Kehila Kedosha Janina, at 280 Broome Street, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where it is used by the Romaniote emigrant community. It maintains a mailing list of 3,000 Romaniote families, most of them living in the tri-state area. It is open for services every Saturday morning as well as all major Jewish holidays. The synagogue also houses a museum devoted to Greek Jewry and offers guided tours to visitors on Sundays. Like the community in Jerusalem, the prayers today follow the Sephardic rite, but they preserve a few piyyutim from the Romaniote rite.

==Genetics==

DNA research and genealogical works based on the Romaniote communities of Ioannina and Zakynthos are in progress. Nearly 4/5th of the autosomal DNA of Ashkenazi Jews is related to that of Romaniote Jews. Romaniote Jewish men have been found to belong to various branches of Y-chromosomal haplogroups E1b1b1, G, J, Q, R1a, and R1b. In 2024, a team of researchers announced that a modern Romaniote Jewish man from Greece belongs to &quot;a previously undiscovered&quot; branch of the Y-chromosomal haplogroup J-P58 found to be &quot;dating straight back 7,000 years to the Neolithic era.&quot; Romaniote Jewish mitochondrial DNA haplogroups include HV1b2, U5b, and U6a3.

<text>Ptolemy III Euergetes (, &quot;Ptolemy the Benefactor&quot;; c. 280 – November/December 222 BC) was the third pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt from 246 to 222 BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom reached the height of its military and economic power during his kingship, as initiated by his father Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

Ptolemy III was the eldest son of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe I. When Ptolemy III was young, his mother was disgraced and he was removed from the succession. He was restored as heir to the throne in the late 250s BC and succeeded his father as king without issue in 246 BC. On his succession, Ptolemy III married Berenice II, reigning queen of Cyrenaica, thereby bringing her territory into the Ptolemaic realm. In the Third Syrian War (246–241 BC), Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid empire and won a near total victory, but was forced to abandon the campaign as a result of an uprising in Egypt. In the aftermath of this rebellion, Ptolemy forged a closer bond with the Egyptian priestly elite, which was codified in the Canopus decree of 238 BC and set a trend for Ptolemaic power in Egypt for the rest of the dynasty. In the Aegean, Ptolemy III suffered a major setback when his fleet was defeated by the Antigonids at the Battle of Andros around 246 BC, but he continued to offer financial support to their opponents in mainland Greece for the rest of his reign. At his death, Ptolemy III was succeeded by his eldest son, Ptolemy IV.

==Background and early life==
Ptolemy III was born some time around 280 BC, as the eldest son of Ptolemy II and his first wife Arsinoe I, daughter of King Lysimachus of Thrace. His father had become co-regent of Egypt in 284 BC and sole ruler in 282 BC. Around 279 BC, the collapse of Lysimachus&#x27; kingdom led to the return to Egypt of Ptolemy II&#x27;s sister Arsinoe II, who had been married to Lysimachus. A conflict quickly broke out between Arsinoe I and Arsinoe II. Sometime after 275 BC, Arsinoe I was charged with conspiracy and exiled to Coptos. When Ptolemy II married Arsinoe II probably in 273/2 BC, her victory in this conflict was complete. As children of Arsinoe I, Ptolemy III and his two siblings seem to have been removed from the succession after their mother&#x27;s fall. This political background may explain why Ptolemy III seems to have been raised on Thera in the Aegean, rather than in Egypt. His tutors included the poet and polymath Apollonius of Rhodes, later head of the Library of Alexandria.

From 267 BC, a figure known as Ptolemy &quot;the Son&quot; was co-regent with Ptolemy II. He led naval forces in the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC), but revolted in 259 BC at the beginning of the Second Syrian War and was removed from the co-regency. Some scholars have identified Ptolemy the Son with Ptolemy III. This seems unlikely, since Ptolemy III was probably too young to lead forces in the 260s and does not seem to have suffered any of the negative consequences that would be expected if he had revolted from his father in 259 BC. Chris Bennett has argued that Ptolemy the Son was a son of Arsinoe II by Lysimachus. Around the time of the rebellion, Ptolemy II legitimised the children of Arsinoe I by having them posthumously adopted by Arsinoe II.

In the late 250s BC, Ptolemy II arranged the engagement of Ptolemy III to Berenice, the sole child of Ptolemy II&#x27;s half-brother King Magas of Cyrene. The decision to single Ptolemy III out for this marriage indicates that, by this time, he was the heir presumptive. On his father&#x27;s death, Ptolemy III succeeded him without issue, taking the throne on 28 January 246 BC.

==Reign==
===Cyrenaica (246 BC)===

Cyrene had been the first Ptolemaic territory outside Egypt, but Magas had rebelled against Ptolemy II and declared himself king of Cyrenaica in 276 BC. The aforementioned engagement of Ptolemy III to Berenice had been intended to lead to the reunification of Egypt and Cyrene after Magas&#x27; death. However, when Magas died in 250 BC, Berenice&#x27;s mother Apame refused to honour the agreement and invited an Antigonid prince, Demetrius the Fair, to Cyrene to marry Berenice instead. With Apame&#x27;s help, Demetrius seized control of the city, but he was assassinated by Berenice. A republican government, led by two Cyrenaeans named Ecdelus and Demophanes, controlled Cyrene for four years.

It was only with Ptolemy III&#x27;s accession in 246 BC, that the wedding of Ptolemy III and Berenice seems to have actually taken place. Ptolemaic authority over Cyrene was forcefully reasserted. Two new port cities were established, named Ptolemais and Berenice (modern Tolmeita and Benghazi) after the dynastic couple. The cities of Cyrenaica were unified in a League overseen by the king, as a way of balancing the cities&#x27; desire for political autonomy against the Ptolemaic desire for control.

===Third Syrian War (246–241 BC)===
In July 246 BC, Antiochus II, king of the Seleucid empire, died suddenly. By his first wife Laodice I, Antiochus II had had a son, Seleucus II, who was about 19 years old in 246 BC. However, in 253 BC, he had agreed to repudiate Laodice and marry Ptolemy III&#x27;s sister Berenice. Antiochus II and Berenice had a son named Antiochus, who was still an infant when his father died. A succession dispute broke out immediately after Antiochus II&#x27;s death. Ptolemy III quickly invaded Syria in support of his sister and her son, marking the beginning of the Third Syrian War (also known as the Laodicean War).

An account of the initial phase of this war, written by Ptolemy III himself, is preserved on the Gurob papyrus. At the outbreak of war, Laodice I and Seleucus II were based in western Asia Minor, while the widowed Queen Berenice was in Antioch. The latter quickly seized control of Cilicia to prevent Laodice I from entering Syria. Meanwhile, Ptolemy III marched along the Levantine coast encountering minimal resistance. The cities of Seleucia and Antioch surrendered to him without a fight in late autumn. At Antioch, Ptolemy III went to the royal palace to plan his next moves with Berenice in person, only to discover that she and her young son had been murdered.

Rather than accept defeat in the face of this setback, Ptolemy III continued his campaign through Syria and into Mesopotamia, where he conquered Babylon at the end of 246 or beginning of 245 BC. In light of this success, he may have been crowned &#x27;Great King&#x27; of Asia. Early in 245 BC, he established a governor of the land &#x27;on the other side&#x27; of the Euphrates, indicating an intention to permanently incorporate the region into the Ptolemaic kingdom.
At this point however, Ptolemy III received notice that a revolt had broken out in Egypt and he was forced to return home to suppress it. By July 245 BC, the Seleucids had recaptured Mesopotamia. The Egyptian revolt is significant as the first of a series of native Egyptian uprisings which would trouble Egypt for the next century. One reason for this revolt was the heavy tax-burdens placed on the people of Egypt by Ptolemy III&#x27;s war in Syria. Furthermore, papyri records indicate that the inundation of the Nile river failed in 245 BC, resulting in famine. Climate proxy studies suggest that this resulted from changes of the monsoon pattern at the time, resulting from a volcanic eruption which took place in 247 BC.

After his return to Egypt and suppression of the revolt, Ptolemy III made an effort to present himself as a victorious king in both Egyptian and Greek cultural contexts. Official propaganda, like &quot;OGIS&quot; 54, an inscription set up in Adulis and probably the copy of an inscription in Alexandria, vastly exaggerated Ptolemy III&#x27;s conquests, claiming even Bactria among his conquests. At the new year in 243 BC, Ptolemy III incorporated himself and his wife Berenice II into the Ptolemaic state cult, to be worshipped as the &quot;Theoi Euergetai&quot; (Benefactor Gods), in honour of his restoration to Egypt of statues found in the Seleucid territories, which had been seized by the Persians.

There may also have been a second theatre to this war in the Aegean. The general Ptolemy Andromachou, ostensibly an illegitimate son of Ptolemy II and the half-brother of Ptolemy III, captured Ephesus from the Seleucids in 246 BC. At an uncertain date around 245 BC, he fought a sea-battle at Andros against King Antigonus II of Macedon, in which the Ptolemaic forces were defeated. It appears that he then led an invasion of Thrace, where Maroneia and Aenus were under Ptolemaic control as of 243 BC. Ptolemy Andromachou was subsequently assassinated at Ephesus by Thracian soldiers under his control.

The only further action known from the war is some fighting near Damascus in 242 BC. Shortly after this, in 241 BC, Ptolemy made peace with the Seleucids, retaining all the conquered territory in Asia Minor and northern Syria. Nearly the whole Mediterranean coast from Maroneia in Thrace to the Syrtis in Libya was now under Ptolemaic control. One of the most significant acquisitions was Seleucia Pieria, the port of Antioch, whose loss was a significant economic and logistical set-back for the Seleucids.

===Later reign (241–222 BC)===

The conclusion of the Third Syrian War marked the end of military intervention in the Seleucid territories, but Ptolemy III continued to offer covert financial assistance to the opponents of Seleucus II. From 241 BC, this included Antiochus Hierax, the younger brother of Seleucus II, who rebelled against his brother and established his own separate kingdom in Asia Minor. Ptolemy III sent military forces to support him only when a group of Galatian mercenaries rebelled against him but is likely to have supported him more tacitly throughout his conflict with Seleucus II. He offered similar support to Attalus I, the dynast of Pergamum, who took advantage of this civil conflict to expand his territories in northwestern Asia Minor. When the Seleucid general Achaeus was sent in 223 BC to reconquer the territories in Asia Minor that had been lost to Attalus, Ptolemy III sent his son Magas with a military force to aid Attalus, but he was unable to prevent Attalus&#x27; defeat.
Ptolemy III maintained his father&#x27;s hostile policy to Macedonia. This probably involved direct conflict with Antigonus II during the Third Syrian War, but after the defeat at Andros in c. 245 BC, Ptolemy III seems to have returned to the policy of indirect opposition, financing enemies of the Antigonids in mainland Greece. The most prominent of these was the Achaian League, a federation of Greek city-states in the Peloponnese that were united by their opposition to Macedon. From 243 BC, Ptolemy III was the nominal leader (&quot;hegemon&quot;) and military commander of the League and supplied them with a yearly payment. After 240 BC, Ptolemy also forged an alliance with the Aetolian League in northwest Greece. From 238 to 234 BC, the two leagues waged the Demetrian War against Macedon with Ptolemaic financial support.

However, in 229 BC, the Cleomenean War (229–222 BC) broke out between the Achaian League and Cleomenes III of Sparta. As a result, in 226 BC, Aratos of Sicyon the leader of the Achaian League forged an alliance with the Macedonian king Antigonus III. Ptolemy III responded by immediately breaking off relations with the Achaian League and redirecting his financial support to Sparta. Most of the rest of the Greek states were brought under the Macedonian umbrella in 224 BC when Antigonus established the &quot;Hellenic League&quot;. However Aetolia and Athens remained hostile to Macedon and redoubled their allegiance to Ptolemy III. In Athens, in 224 BC, extensive honours were granted to Ptolemy III to entrench their alliance with him, including the creation of a new tribe named Ptolemais in his honour and a new deme named Berenicidae in honour of Queen Berenice II. The Athenians instituted a state religious cult in which Ptolemy III and Berenice II were worshipped as gods, including a festival, the Ptolemaia. The centre of the cult was the Ptolemaion, which also served as the gymnasium where young male citizens undertook civic and military training.

Cleomenes III suffered serious defeats in 223 BC and Ptolemy III abandoned his support for him in the next year – probably as a result of an agreement with Antigonus. The Egyptian king seems to have been unwilling to commit actual troops to Greece, particularly as the threat of renewed war with the Seleucids was looming. Cleomenes III was defeated and forced to flee to Alexandria, where Ptolemy III offered him hospitality and promised to help restore him to power. However, these promises were not fulfilled, and the Cleomenian War would in fact be the last time that the Ptolemies intervened in mainland Greece.

In November or December 222 BC, shortly after Cleomenes&#x27; arrival in Egypt and Magas&#x27; failure in Asia Minor, Ptolemy III died of natural causes. He was succeeded by his son Ptolemy IV without incident.

==Regime==
===Pharaonic ideology and Egyptian religion===
Ptolemy III built on the efforts of his predecessors to conform to the traditional model of the Egyptian pharaoh. He was responsible for the first known example of a series of decrees published as trilingual inscriptions on massive stone blocks in Ancient Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and demotic. Earlier decrees, like the Satrap stele and the Mendes stele, had been in hieroglyphs alone and had been directed at single individual sanctuaries. By contrast, Ptolemy III&#x27;s Canopus decree was the product of a special synod of all the priests of Egypt, which was held in 238 BC. The decree instituted a number of reforms and represents the establishment of a full partnership between Ptolemy III as pharaoh and the Egyptian priestly elite. This partnership would endure until the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty. In the decree, the priesthood praise Ptolemy III as a perfect pharaoh. They emphasise his support of the priesthood, his military success in defending Egypt and in restoring religious artefacts supposedly held by the Seleucids, and his good governance, especially an incident when Ptolemy III imported, at his own expense, a vast amount of grain to compensate for a weak inundation. The rest of the decree consists of reforms to the priestly orders (&quot;phylai&quot;). The decree also added a leap day to the Egyptian calendar of 365 days, and instituted related changes in festivals. Ptolemy III&#x27;s infant daughter Berenice died during the synod and the stele arranges for her deification and ongoing worship. Further decrees would be issued by priestly synods under Ptolemy III&#x27;s successors. The best-known examples are the Decree of Memphis passed by his son Ptolemy IV in about 218 BC and the Rosetta Stone erected by his grandson Ptolemy V in 196 BC.

The Ptolemaic kings before Ptolemy III, his grandfather Ptolemy I and his father Ptolemy II, had followed the lead of Alexander the Great in prioritising the worship of Amun, worshipped at Karnak in Thebes among the Egyptian deities. With Ptolemy III the focus shifted strongly to Ptah, worshipped at Memphis. Ptah&#x27;s earthly avatar, the Apis bull came to play a crucial role in royal new year festivals and coronation festivals. This new focus is referenced by two elements of Ptolemy III&#x27;s Pharaonic titulary: his nomen which included the phrase &quot;Mery-Ptah&quot; (beloved of Ptah), and his golden Horus name, &quot;Neb khab-used mi ptah-tatenen&quot; (Lord of the Jubilee-festivals as well as Ptah Tatjenen).

Ptolemy III financed construction projects at temples across Egypt. The most significant of these was the Temple of Horus at Edfu, one of the masterpieces of ancient Egyptian temple architecture and now the best-preserved of all Egyptian temples. The king initiated construction on it on 23 August 237 BC. Work continued for most of the Ptolemaic dynasty; the main temple was finished in the reign of Ptolemy IV in 231 BC, and the full complex was only completed in 142 BC, during the reign of Ptolemy VIII, while the reliefs on the great pylon were finished in the reign of Ptolemy XII. Other construction work took place at a range of sites, including (from north to south):
* Serapeum of Alexandria
* Temple of Osiris at Canopus;
* Decorative work on the Temple of Isis at Behbeit El Hagar, near Sebennytos;
* A sacred lake in the Temple of Montu at Medamud;
* The Gateway of Ptolemy III in the Temple of Khonsu and decorative work on the Temple of Opet at Karnak Thebes.
* Temple of Khnum at Esna
* A birth house at the Temple of Isis at Philae.

===Scholarship and culture===
Ptolemy III continued his predecessor&#x27;s sponsorship of scholarship and literature. The Great Library in the Musaeum was supplemented by a second library built in the Serapeum. He was said to have had every book unloaded in the Alexandria docks seized and copied, returning the copies to their owners and keeping the originals for the Library. Galen attests that he borrowed the official manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides from Athens and forfeited the considerable deposit he paid for them in order to keep them for the Library rather than returning them. The most distinguished scholar at Ptolemy III&#x27;s court was the polymath and geographer Eratosthenes, most noted for his remarkably accurate calculation of the circumference of the world. Other prominent scholars include the mathematicians Conon of Samos and Apollonius of Perge.

===Red Sea trade===
Ptolemy III&#x27;s reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. In the 1930s, excavations by Mattingly at a fortress close to Port Dunford (the likely Nikon of antiquity) in present-day southern Somalia yielded a number of Ptolemaic coins. Among these pieces were 17 copper coins from the reigns of Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V, as well as late Imperial Rome and Mamluk Sultanate coins.

==Marriage and issue==
Ptolemy III married his half-cousin Berenice of Cyrene in 244/243 BC. Their children were:

<text>Pistacia lentiscus (also lentisk or mastic) is a dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree of the genus &quot;Pistacia&quot; native to the Mediterranean Basin. It grows up to tall and is cultivated for its aromatic resin, mainly on the Greek island of Chios, around the Turkish town of Çeşme and northern parts of Iraq.

== Description ==
The plant is evergreen, from high, with a strong smell of resin, growing in dry and rocky areas in North Africa and Mediterranean Europe. It resists mild to heavy frosts but prefers milder winters and grows on all types of soils, and can grow well in limestone areas and even in salty or saline environments, making it more abundant near the sea. It is also found in woodlands, dehesas (almost deforested pasture areas), Kermes oak woods, wooded areas dominated by other oaks, garrigues, maquis shrublands, hills, gorges, canyons, and rocky hillsides of the entire Mediterranean area. It is a typical species of Mediterranean mixed communities which include myrtle, Kermes oak, Mediterranean dwarf palm, buckthorn and sarsaparilla, and serves as protection and food for birds and other fauna in this ecosystem. It is a very hardy pioneer species dispersed by birds. When older, it develops some large trunks and numerous thicker and longer branches. In appropriate areas, when allowed to grow freely and age, it often becomes a tree of up to . However, logging, grazing, and fires often prevent its development.

The leaves are alternate, leathery, and paripinnately compound (i.e., pinnately compound without terminal leaflet) with five or six pairs of deep-green leaflets. It presents very small flowers, the male with five stamens, the female with a 3-part style. The fruit is a drupe, first red and then black when ripe, about in diameter. The fruit, although not commonly consumed, is edible and has a tart raisin-like flavour.

&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot; is related to &quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot;, with which it hybridizes frequently in contact zones. &quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot; is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate. The mastic tree does not reach the size of the &quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot;, but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish. The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets, i.e., the stalks are flattened and with side fins, whereas these stems in &quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot; are simple. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, Canary Islands and Middle East, it can be confused with &quot;P. atlantica&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot; is native throughout the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula in the west through southern France and Turkey to Iraq and Iran in the east. It is also native to the Canary Islands.

==Ornamental use==
In urban areas near the sea, where &quot;palmitos&quot; or Mediterranean dwarf palms grow, and other exotic plants, it is often used in gardens and resorts, because of its strength and attractive appearance. Unlike other species of &quot;Pistacia&quot;, it retains its leaves throughout the year. It has been introduced as an ornamental shrub in Mexico, where it has naturalized and is often seen primarily in suburban and semiarid areas where the summer rainfall climate, contrary to the Mediterranean, does not affect it.

==Resin==
The aromatic, ivory-coloured resin, also known as mastic, is harvested as a spice from the cultivated mastic trees grown in the south of the Greek island of Chios in the Aegean Sea, where it is also known by the name &quot;Chios tears&quot;. Originally liquid, it is hardened, when the weather turns cold, into drops or patties of hard, brittle, translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white and opaque gum.
The word mastic derives from the Latin word &quot;masticare&quot; (to chew), in Greek: μαστιχάω verb &quot;mastichein&quot; (&quot;to gnash the teeth&quot;, the English word completely from the Latin masticate) or &quot;massein&quot; (&quot;to chew&quot;).

In the Kurdish parts of Iraq, the dried resin is used to make rosaries.

Within the European Union, mastic production in Chios is granted protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication names.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU PDO/PGI registration&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although the tree is native to all of the Mediterranean region, it will release its resin only on selected places, most notably, around Cesme, Turkey and in the southern portion of the Greek island of Chios, the latter being the only place in the world where it is cultivated regularly. The island&#x27;s mastic production is controlled by a co-operative of &quot;medieval&quot; villages, collectively known as the &#x27;mastichochoria&#x27; (Μαστιχοχώρια, lit. &quot;mastic villages&quot;).

===Cultivation history===
The resin is collected by bleeding the trees from small cuts made in the bark of the main branches, and allowing the sap to drip onto the specially prepared ground below. The harvesting is done during the summer between July and September. After the mastic is collected, it is washed manually and is set aside to dry, away from the sun, as it will start melting again.
Mastic resin is a relatively expensive kind of spice; it has been used principally as a chewing gum for at least 2,400 years. The flavour can be described as a strong, slightly smoky, resiny aroma and can be an acquired taste.

Some scholars identify the &quot;bakha&quot; בכא mentioned in the Bible—as in the Valley of Baca () of Psalm 84—with the mastic plant. The word &quot;bakha&quot; appears to be derived from the Hebrew word for crying or weeping, and is thought to refer to the &quot;tears&quot; of resin secreted by the mastic plant, along with a sad weeping noise which occurs when the plant is walked on and branches are broken. The Valley of Baca is thought to be a valley near Jerusalem that was covered with low mastic shrubbery, much like some hillsides in northern Israel today. In an additional biblical reference, King David receives divine counsel to place himself opposite the Philistines coming up the Valley of Rephaim, southwest of Jerusalem, such that the &quot;sound of walking on the tops of the &quot;bakha&quot; shrubs&quot; (קול צעדה בראשי הבכאים) signals the moment to attack (II Samuel V: 22–24).

Mastic is known to have been popular in Roman times when children chewed it, and in medieval times, it was highly prized for the sultan&#x27;s harem both as a breath freshener and for cosmetics. It was the sultan&#x27;s privilege to chew mastic, and it was considered to have healing properties. The spice&#x27;s use was widened when Chios became part of the Ottoman Empire, and it remains popular in North Africa and the Near East. An unflattering reference to mastic-chewing was made in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (published 1609) when Agamemnon dismisses the views of the cynic and satirist Thersites as graceless productions of &quot;his mastic jaws&quot;.

====Culinary use====
Mastic gum is principally used either as a flavouring or for its gum properties, as in mastic chewing gum.

As a spice, it continues to be used in Greece to flavour spirits and liqueurs (such as Chios&#x27;s native drink &quot;mastiha&quot;), chewing gum, and a number of cakes, pastries, spoon sweets, and desserts. Sometimes, it is even used in making cheese. Mastic resin is a key ingredient in &quot;dondurma&quot; and Turkish puddings, giving those confections their unusual texture and bright whiteness. In Lebanon and Egypt, the spice is used to flavour many dishes, ranging from soups to meats to desserts, while in Morocco, smoke from the resin is used to flavour water. In Turkey, mastic is used as a flavor of Turkish delight. Recently, a mastic-flavoured fizzy drink has also been launched, called &quot;Mast&quot;.

In the Kurdish parts of Iraq, the fresh resin is used as a spice particularly used for Torshi.

Mastic resin is a key ingredient in Greek festival breads, for example, the sweet bread &quot;tsoureki&quot; and the traditional New Year&#x27;s &quot;vasilopita&quot;. Furthermore, mastic is also essential to &quot;myron&quot;, the holy oil used for chrismation by the Orthodox Churches.

Mastic continues to be used for its gum and medicinal properties, as well as its culinary uses. Jordanian chewing gum manufacturer, Sharawi Bros., use the mastic of this shrub as a primary ingredient in their mastic-flavoured products and they distribute the gum to many deli stores worldwide. The resin is used as a primary ingredient in the production of cosmetics such as toothpaste, lotions for the hair and skin, and perfumes.
====Medicine====
People in the Mediterranean region have used mastic as a medicine for gastrointestinal ailments for several thousand years. First-century Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides wrote about the medicinal properties of mastic in his classic treatise &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; (&quot;About Medical Substances&quot;). Some centuries later, Markellos Empeirikos and Pavlos Eginitis also noticed the effect of mastic on the digestive system.

Mastic oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties, and as such is widely used in the preparation of ointments for skin disorders and afflictions. It is also used in the manufacture of plasters.

In recent years, university researchers have provided the scientific evidence for the medicinal properties of mastic. A 1985 study by the University of Thessaloniki and by the Meikai University discovered that mastic can reduce bacterial dental plaque in the mouth by 41.5%. A 1998 study by the University of Athens found that mastic oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Another 1998 University of Nottingham study claims that mastic can heal peptic ulcers by killing &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, which causes peptic ulcers, gastritis, and duodenitis. Some &quot;in vivo&quot; studies have shown that mastic gum has no effect on &quot;H. pylori&quot; when taken for short periods of time. However, a recent and more extensive study showed that mastic gum reduced &quot;H. pylori&quot; populations after an insoluble and sticky polymer (poly-β-myrcene) constituent of mastic gum was removed, and if taken for a longer period of time.

====Miscellanea====
Apart from its medicinal properties and cosmetic and culinary uses, mastic gum is also used in the production of high-grade varnish.

The mastic tree has been introduced into Mexico as an ornamental plant, where it is very prized and fully naturalized. The trees are grown mainly in suburban areas in semiarid zones, and remain undamaged, although the summer rainfall is contrary to its original Mediterranean climate.

A related species, &quot;P. saportae&quot;, has been shown by DNA analysis to be a hybrid between maternal &quot;P. lentiscus&quot; and paternal &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; (terebinth or turpentine). The hybrid has imparipinnate leaves, with leaflets semipersistent, subsessile terminal, and sometimes reduced. Usually, &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; and&quot; P. lentiscus&quot; occupy different biotopes and barely overlap: Mastic appears at lower elevations and near the sea, while the &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; most frequently inhabits inland and mountainous areas such as the Iberian System.
&quot;Dufte-Zeichen&quot; (Scents-signs), the fourth scene from &quot;Sonntag aus Licht&quot; by Karlheinz Stockhausen, is centred around seven scents, each one associated with one day of the week. &quot;Mastix&quot; is assigned to Wednesday and comes third.

==Biblical Narrative==
The mastic tree plays a central role in the narrative of Susanna in the book of Daniel in the Bible. In the story two old men falsely accuse Susanna of adultery. Their lies are exposed when one says it happened under a mastic tree, while the other says it happened under a holly oak. Since the mastic is, at most, , while the oak is, at least, their lies were obvious to all.

<doc id="60845" wikidata="Q12665" url="?curid=60845" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">
<text>Lieutenant-General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, ( ; 22 February 1857 – 8 January 1941) was a British Army officer, writer, founder of The Boy Scouts Association and its first Chief Scout, and founder, with his sister Agnes, of The Girl Guides Association. Baden-Powell wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, which, with his previous books, his 1884 &quot;Reconnaissance and Scouting&quot; and his 1899 &quot;Aids to Scouting for N.-C.Os and Men&quot; (intended for the military) and &quot;The Scout&quot; magazine helped the rapid growth of the Scout Movement.

Educated at Charterhouse School, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. His books, written for military reconnaissance and scout training, were also read by boys and used by teachers and youth organisations. In August 1907, he held an experimental camp, the Brownsea Island Scout camp to test his ideas for training boys in scouting. He wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, published in 1908 by C. Arthur Pearson Limited, for boy readership. In 1910 Baden-Powell retired from the army and formed The Scout Association.

In 1909, a rally of Scouts was held at The Crystal Palace. Many girls in Scout uniform attended and, in front of the press, a small group told Baden-Powell that they were the &quot;Girl Scouts&quot;. In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell started The Girl Guides Association.

In 1912 Baden-Powell married Olave St Clair Soames.

He gave guidance to The Scout Association and Girl Guides Association until retiring in 1937. Baden-Powell lived his last years in Nyeri, Kenya, where he died and was buried in 1941. His grave is a national monument.

== Early life ==
Baden-Powell was the penultimate son of the Rev. Prof. Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford and Church of England priest, and his third wife, Henrietta Grace nee Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth. After his father died in 1860, his mother, to identify her children with her late husband&#x27;s fame, styled the family name &quot;Baden-Powell&quot;. The name was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.

Baden-Powell&#x27;s father&#x27;s family originated in Suffolk. His mother&#x27;s earliest known Smyth ancestor was a Royalist American colonist; her mother&#x27;s father Thomas Warington was the British Consul in Naples around 1800.

Baden-Powell was born Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington, London, on 22 February 1857. He was called Stephe (pronounced &quot;Stevie&quot;) by his family. He was named after his godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer, and his third name was his mother&#x27;s surname.

Baden-Powell had four older half-siblings from the second of his father&#x27;s two previous marriages and was the fifth surviving child of his father&#x27;s third marriage:
* Warington (1847–1921)
* George (1847–1898)
* Augustus (&quot;Gus&quot;) (1849–1863), who was often ill and died young
* Francis (&quot;Frank&quot;) (1850–1933)
* Henrietta Smyth, 28 October 1851 – 9 March 1854
* John Penrose Smyth, 21 December 1852 – 14 December 1855
* Jessie Smyth 25 November 1855 – 24 July 1856
* Robert (22 February 1857 – 8 January 1941)
* Agnes (1858–1945)
* Baden (1860–1937)
The three children immediately preceding Baden-Powell had all died very young before he was born, so there was a seven-year gap between him and his next older brother Frank; so he and his two younger siblings were almost like a separate family, of which he was the eldest.

His father died when Baden-Powell was three, so he was raised by his single mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. In 1933 he said of her &quot;The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother.&quot;

He attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells and was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school named after the ancient Carthusian monastery buildings it occupied in the City of London. However, while he was a pupil there, the school moved out to new purpose-built premises in the countryside near Godalming in Surrey. He played with dolls and learnt the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. Baden-Powell&#x27;s first introduction to outdoor skills was through stalking and cooking games while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds.

== Military career ==
In 1876, Baden-Powell joined the 13th Hussars in India with the rank of lieutenant. In 1880 he was charged with the task of drawing maps of the Battle of Maiwand. He enhanced and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal Province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was mentioned in dispatches. In 1890, he was brevetted Major as military secretary and senior aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. He was posted to Malta for three years, also working as an intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. He wrote that he once travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 he published &quot;Reconnaissance and Scouting&quot;.

Baden-Powell returned to Africa in 1896, and served in the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo. This was a formative experience for him not only because he commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e., Scoutcraft), and here that he was introduced to Montana Peaked version of a western cowboy hat, of which Stetson was a prolific manufacturer, and which also came to be known as a campaign hat and the many versatile and practical uses of a neckerchief.

Baden-Powell was accused of illegally executing a prisoner of war in 1896, the Matabele chief Uwini, who had been promised his life would be spared if he surrendered. Uwini was sentenced to be shot by firing squad by a military court, a sentence Baden-Powell confirmed. Baden-Powell was cleared by a military court of inquiry, but the colonial civil authorities wanted a civil investigation and trial. Baden-Powell later claimed he was &quot;released without a stain on my character&quot;.

After Rhodesia, Baden-Powell served in the Fourth Ashanti War on the Gold Coast. In 1897, at the age of 40, he was brevetted colonel (the youngest colonel in the British Army) and given command of the 5th Dragoon Guards in India. A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;, a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, much of it a written explanation of the lessons he had learned from Burnham, to help train recruits.
==Mafeking==
Baden-Powell returned to South Africa before the Second Boer War. Although instructed to maintain a mobile mounted force on the frontier with the Boer Republics, Baden-Powell amassed stores and established a garrison at Mafeking. The subsequent Siege of Mafeking lasted 217 days. Although Baden-Powell could have destroyed his stores and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of the siege, especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell the town or its forces, he remained in the town to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating their horses. The town had been surrounded by a Boer army, at times above 8,000 men.

The siege of the small town received much attention from both the Boers and international media because Lord Edward Cecil, the son of the British Prime Minister, was besieged in the town. The garrison held out until relieved, in part thanks to cunning deceptions, many devised by Baden-Powell. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers pretended to avoid non-existent barbed wire while moving between trenches. Baden-Powell did much reconnaissance work himself. In one instance, noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line, Baden-Powell loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and sent it down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a successful attack.
A view expressed by historian Thomas Pakenham of Baden-Powell&#x27;s actions during the siege argued that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians, including members of his own African garrison. Pakenham claimed that Baden-Powell drastically reduced the rations to the native garrison. However, in 2001, after subsequent research, Pakenham changed this view.

During the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals and so on, freeing grown men to fight. Baden-Powell did not form the Cadet Corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege. However, he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;.

The siege was lifted on 17 May 1900. Baden-Powell was promoted to major-general and became a national hero. However, British military commanders were more critical of his performance and even less impressed with his subsequent choices to again allow himself to be besieged. Ultimately, his failure to understand properly the situation, and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River Pakenham claimed led to his being removed from action.

==After Mafeking==
Briefly back in the United Kingdom in October 1901, Baden-Powell was invited to visit King Edward VII at Balmoral, the monarch&#x27;s Scottish retreat, and personally invested as Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).
Baden-Powell was given the role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force, but during this phase, Baden-Powell was sent to Britain on sick leave, so he was only in command for seven months.

Baden-Powell returned to England to take up the post of Inspector-General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding this position, he was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving the force an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals. Baden-Powell was a career cavalryman, but realised that cavalry was no match against the machine gun; however, his superiors, Kitchener and French, the latter also a career cavalryman, still regarded the cavalry as indispensable, with the result that cavalry was used in the First World War with little effect, yet the major item exported from Britain to Flanders during the War was horse fodder.

In 1907, Baden-Powell was promoted to Lieutenant-General but put on the inactive list. In October 1907, he was appointed to the command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Army. During this appointment, Baden-Powell selected the location of Catterick Garrison to replace Richmond Castle which was then the Headquarters of the Northumbrian Division. 

On 19 February 1909, facing censure for his public comments about Germany as an enemy, Baden-Powell abruptly sailed in the SS &quot;Aragon&quot; via Portugal and Spain to South America. The &quot;Belfast Newsletter&quot; reported that when in March 1909 he visited Santiago de Chile for three days, &quot;He was given a warmer reception than had ever been afforded a foreigner in South America.&quot; He sailed back in the RMS Danube by 1 May 1909.

In 1910, aged 53, Baden-Powell was retired from the Army.

In 1915, Baden-Powell&#x27;s book &quot;My Adventures as a Spy&quot; was published, lending to false suggestions he had been active as a spy during the war.

== Scout Movement ==

On his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;, had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations, including Charlotte Mason&#x27;s House of Education. Following his involvement in the Boys&#x27; Brigade as a Brigade vice-president and officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from Sir William Alexander Smith, Baden-Powell decided to re-write &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot; to suit a youth readership. In August 1907, he held a camp on Brownsea Island to test out his ideas. About twenty boys attended: eight from local Boys&#x27; Brigade companies, and about twelve public school boys, mostly sons of his friends.
Baden-Powell was also influenced by Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book &quot;The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians&quot; and they met in 1906. Baden-Powell&#x27;s &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; was published in six installments in 1908 and has sold approximately 150 million copies as the fourth best-selling book of the 20th century.

Boys and girls spontaneously formed Scout troops. The Scout Movement had started by itself, first as a national, and soon an international phenomenon. A rally of Scouts was held at Crystal Palace in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell met some of the first Girl Scouts of whom 6,000 had already been registered as Scouts. In 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, formed The Girl Guides Association.

In 1912, Baden-Powell started a world tour with a voyage to the Caribbean. Another passenger was Juliette Gordon Low, an American who had been running a Guide Company in Scotland and was returning to the U.S.A. Baden-Powell encouraged her to found the Girl Scouts of the USA.
In 1929, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, he received as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007 and it has been purchased by a charity, B–P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase the car.

Baden-Powell also had impacts on youth education. By 1922, there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was over 3.3 million.
Early Scout Association &quot;Thanks badges&quot; (from 1911) and The Scout Association &quot;Medal of Merit&quot; badge had a swastika symbol on them. This was undoubtedly influenced by the use by Rudyard Kipling of the swastika on the jacket of his published books, including &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which was used by Baden-Powell as a basis for the Wolf Cubs. The swastika had been a symbol of luck in India long before being adopted by the Nazi Party in 1920, and when Nazi use of the swastika became more widespread, the Scouts stopped using it.

Nazi Germany banned Scouting, a competitor to the Hitler Youth, in June 1934, seeing it as &quot;a haven for young men opposed to the new State&quot;. Based on the regime&#x27;s view of Scouting as a dangerous espionage organisation, Baden-Powell&#x27;s name was included in &quot;The Black Book&quot;, a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom. A drawing by Baden-Powell depicts Scouts assisting refugees fleeing from the Nazis and Hitler. Tim Jeal, the author of the biography &quot;Baden-Powell&quot;, gives his opinion that &quot;Baden-Powell&#x27;s distrust of communism led to his implicit support, through naïveté, of fascism&quot;, an opinion based on two of B-P&#x27;s diary entries. Baden-Powell met Benito Mussolini on 2 March 1933, and in his diary described him as &quot;small, stout, human and genial. Told me about Balilla and workmen&#x27;s outdoor recreations which he imposed through &#x27;moral force&#x27;&quot;. On 17 October 1939, Baden-Powell wrote in his diary: &quot;Lay up all day. Read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc. – and ideals which Hitler does not practice himself.&quot;

At the 5th World Scout Jamboree in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to Scouting and retired from public Scouting life. 22 February, the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as Founder&#x27;s Day by Scouts and World Thinking Day by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World.

In his final letter to the Scouts, Baden-Powell wrote:
I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have a happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. &quot;Be prepared&quot; in this way, to live happy and to die happy – stick to your Scout Promise always – even after you have ceased to be a boy – and God help you to do it.

Baden-Powell died on 8 January 1941: his grave is in St Peter&#x27;s Cemetery in Nyeri, Kenya. His gravestone bears a circle with a dot in the centre &quot;ʘ&quot;, which is the trail sign for &quot;Going home&quot;, or &quot;I have gone home&quot;. His wife Olave moved back to England in 1942; after she died in 1977, her ashes were taken to Kenya by her grandson Robert and interred beside her husband. In 2001, the Kenyan government declared Baden-Powell&#x27;s grave a national monument.

Baden-Powell was regarded as an excellent storyteller. During his whole life he told &quot;ripping yarns&quot; to audiences. After having published &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout movement and his ideas for its future. He spent most of the last two years of his life in Africa, and many of his later books had African themes.

== Art==
Baden-Powell&#x27;s father often sketched caricatures of those present at meetings, while his maternal grandmother was also artistic. Baden-Powell painted or sketched almost every day of his life, and with equal competence with either hand. Most of his works have a humorous or informative character. His books are scattered with his pen-and-ink sketches, frequently whimsical. He did a largely unknown number of pen-and-ink sketches; he always travelled with a sketchpad that he used frequently for pencil sketches and &quot;cartoons&quot; for later watercolour paintings. He also created a few sculptures. There is no catalogue of his works, many of which appear in his books, and twelve paintings hang in the British Scout Headquarters at Gilwell Park. There was an exhibition of his work at the Willmer House Museum, Farnham, Surrey, from 11 April – 12 May 1967; a text-only catalogue was produced.

== Personal life ==
In January 1912, Baden-Powell was en route to New York on a world speaking tour, on the ocean liner , when he met Olave St Clair Soames. She was 23, while he was 55; they shared the same birthday, 22 February. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell&#x27;s fame. To avoid press intrusion, they married in private on 30 October 1912, at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Parkstone. 100,000 Scouts had each donated a penny (1d) to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift, a 20 h.p. Standard motor car (not the Rolls-Royce they were presented in 1929). There is a display about their marriage inside St Peter&#x27;s Church, Parkstone. Baden-Powell began to suffer persistent headaches which were considered by his doctor to be psychosomatic and were treated with dream analysis.

Baden-Powell and his wife had three children :- 
* Arthur Robert Peter (known as Peter) (1913–1962), who succeeded his father in the barony; 
* Heather Grace (1915–1986), who in Q2 1940 in Alton, Hants, married John Hall King (1913–2004); they had two sons, the elder of whom, Michael, was drowned in the sinking of in 1966; the younger was Timothy; 
* Betty St Clair (1917–2004), who, in Alton on 24 September 1936 married Gervas Clay; they had a daughter and three sons. 
When Olave&#x27;s sister Auriol Davidson (née Soames) died in 1919, Olave and Robert took her three daughters into their family and brought them up.
In 1919 the couple moved to Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire, named as such as it was bought on Armistice Day (11 November 1918). The Bentley house was a gift from her father. 

In 1939, they moved to a cottage he had commissioned in Nyeri, Kenya, near Mount Kenya, where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named &quot;Paxtu&quot;, was located on the grounds of the Outspan Hotel, owned by Eric Sherbrooke Walker, Baden-Powell&#x27;s first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors. Walker also owned the Treetops Hotel, approximately 10 miles (17 km) out in the Aberdare Mountains, often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the Happy Valley set. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small museum.

Three of Baden-Powell&#x27;s many biographers comment (after his wife had died in 1977) on his sexuality; the first two (in 1979 and 1986) focused on his relationship with his close friend Kenneth McLaren. Tim Jeal&#x27;s later (1989) biography discusses the relationship and finds no evidence that this friendship was erotic. Jeal then examines Baden-Powell&#x27;s views on women, his appreciation of the male form, his military relationships, and his marriage, concluding that, in his personal opinion, Baden-Powell was a repressed homosexual. Jeal&#x27;s arguments and conclusion are dismissed by Procter and Block (2009) as &quot;amateur psychoanalysis&quot;, for which there is no physical evidence.

==Recognition==
In 1937, Baden-Powell was appointed to the Order of Merit, one of the most exclusive awards in the British honours system, and he was also awarded 28 decorations by foreign states, including the Grand Officer of the Portuguese Order of Christ, the Grand Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer (1920), the Commander of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur (1925), the First Class of the Hungarian Order of Merit (1929), the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark, the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion, the Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix, and the Order of Polonia Restituta.

The Scout Association&#x27;s Silver Wolf Award was originally worn by Robert Baden-Powell. The World Organization of the Scout Movement&#x27;s Bronze Wolf Award, for exceptional services to world Scouting, was first awarded to Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then &quot;International Committee&quot; on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. He was also the first recipient of the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Silver Buffalo Award in 1926.

In 1927, at the Swedish National Jamboree, he was awarded by the &quot;Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund&quot; with the &quot;&quot;Großes Dankabzeichen des ÖPB&quot;. In 1931, Baden-Powell received the highest award of the First Austrian Republic (&quot;Großes Ehrenzeichen der Republik am Bande&quot;) out of the hands of President Wilhelm Miklas. Baden-Powell was also one of the first and few recipients of the &quot;Goldene Gemse&quot;, the highest award conferred by the Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund.


In 1931, Major Frederick Russell Burnham dedicated Mount Baden-Powell in California to his friend from forty years before. Today, their friendship is honoured in perpetuity with the dedication of the adjoining peak, Mount Burnham.

Baden-Powell was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize on numerous occasions, including 10 separate nominations in 1928. He was awarded the Wateler Peace Prize in 1937. In 2002, Baden-Powell was named 13th in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. As part of the Scouting 2007 Centenary, Nepal renamed Urkema Peak to Baden-Powell Peak.

In June 2020, following the George Floyd protests in Britain and the removal of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council (BCP Council) announced that a statue of Baden-Powell on Poole Quay would be removed temporarily for its protection, amid fears for its safety. Police believed it was on a list of monuments to be destroyed or removed, and that it was a target for protestors due to perceptions that Baden-Powell had held homophobic and racist views. The statue was installed by the BCP Council in 2008.

Following opposition to its removal, including from residents, and past and present scouts, some of whom camped nearby to ensure it stayed in place, BCP Council had the statue boarded up instead. Mark Howell, deputy leader of the BCP Council was quoted as saying, &quot;It is our intention that the boarding is removed at the earliest, safe opportunity.&quot;

<text>The land of Goshen (, &quot;ʾEreṣ Gōšen&quot;) is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the area in Egypt that was allotted to the Hebrews by the Pharaoh during the time of Joseph (Book of Genesis, ). They dwelt in Goshen up until the time of the Exodus, when they left Egypt. It is believed to have been located in the eastern Nile Delta, lower Egypt; perhaps at or near Avaris, the seat of power of the Hyksos kings.

==Biblical text==
The land of Goshen is mentioned in the biblical books of Genesis and Exodus. In the story of Joseph, which comprises the final chapters of Genesis, the patriarch Jacob is facing famine and sends ten of his sons to Egypt to buy grain. Joseph, another of Jacob&#x27;s sons, is a high official in Egypt and allows his father and brothers to settle in Egypt. In Genesis 45:10, Goshen is treated as being close to Joseph, who lives at the pharaoh&#x27;s court and in Genesis 47:5 Goshen is called &quot;the best part&quot; of the land of Egypt. But it is also implied to be somewhat set apart from the rest of Egypt, because Joseph tells his family to present themselves to the pharaoh as keepers of livestock, &quot;in order that you may settle in the land of Goshen, because all shepherds are abhorrent to the Egyptians.&quot; Genesis 47:11 interchanges the &quot;land of Rameses&quot; with Goshen: &quot;Joseph settled his father and his brothers and granted them a holding in the land of Egypt, in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed.&quot;

In Exodus, Jacob&#x27;s descendants, the Israelites, continue to live in Egypt and grow numerous. The name of Goshen appears only twice in Exodus, in the narration of the Plagues of Egypt, in which Goshen as the dwelling place of the Israelites is spared the plague of flies and plague of hail that afflict the Egyptians.

A place named Goshen is also mentioned in the Book of Joshua, where the Israelites are continuing with their conquest of the Promised Land. Joshua 11:16 states: &quot;So Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland.&quot; However, this Goshen is generally considered to refer to a region located in the east of Judah between the Negev and the Hill Country, rather than to the Egyptian Goshen.

==Etymology==
Some Egyptologists have suggested a connection with the name &quot;gsm&quot; used in reference to a lake in &quot;Papyrus Anastasi IV&quot;, as the name appears to have been used as a toponym in the Wādī Ṭumīlāt. This name &quot;gsm&quot; is considered by some scholars to have been most probably a Semitic loanword, possibly deriving from the Semitic root &quot;gšm&quot; &quot;rain, storm&quot;. Donald Redford, while not disputing the location of Goshen, gives a different origin for the name, deriving it from &quot;Gasmu,&quot; the rulers of the Bedouin Qedarites who occupied the eastern Delta from the 7th century BCE, but John Van Seters thinks this unlikely. Mark Janzen argues that the lack of references to the Land of Goshen in biblical texts from the 6th century BCE or later makes Redford&#x27;s proposal unlikely.

==Identification==

In 1885, Édouard Naville identified Goshen as the 20th nome of Egypt, located in the eastern Delta, and known as &quot;Gesem&quot; or &quot;Kesem&quot; during the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt (672–525 BCE). It covered the western end of the Wadi Tumilat, the eastern end being the district of Succoth, which had Pithom as its main town, extended north as far as the ruins of Pi-Ramesses (the &quot;land of Rameses&quot;), and included both crop land and grazing land.

The scholars Isaac Rabinowitz, Israel Ephʿal, Jan Retsö, and David F. Graf identify the land of Goshen with the parts of the Qedarite kingdom of &quot;Arabia&quot; located to the east of the Nile Delta and around Pithom, and which became known to ancient Egyptians as () and to Jews as the (), that is the , after either the Qedarite king Gešem or after his dynasty. Although the scholar John Van Seters has opposed the identification of ʾEreṣ Gōšen with the Qedarite territories in eastern Egypt based on claims that the Qedarites never ruled the region of the Wādī Ṭumīlāt, the discovery in the Wādī Ṭumīlāt region of Qedarite remains, such as a shrine to the goddess al-Lāt, makes Van Seters&#x27;s opposition to this identification untenable.

The scholars Sarah I. Groll, Manfred Bietak and Mark Janzen reject any connection between the Land of Goshen and the territories of the Qedarite king Gešem, proposing instead that the biblical placename is related to the lake &quot;gsm&quot; mentioned in &quot;Papyrus Anastasi IV&quot;. In their view, the biblical land should be identified with the western part of the Wādī Ṭumīlāt with its large overflow lake.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in category theory, an additive category is a preadditive category C admitting all finitary biproducts.

== Definition ==
There are two equivalent definitions of an additive category: One as a category equipped with additional structure, and another as a category equipped with &quot;no extra structure&quot; but whose objects and morphisms satisfy certain equations.

=== Via preadditive categories ===
A category C is preadditive if all its hom-sets are abelian groups and composition of morphisms is bilinear; in other words, C is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups.

In a preadditive category, every finitary product is necessarily a coproduct, and hence a biproduct, and conversely every finitary coproduct is necessarily a product (this is a consequence of the definition, not a part of it). The empty product, is a final object and the empty product in the case of an empty diagram, an initial object. Both being limits, they are not finite products nor coproducts. 

Thus an additive category is equivalently described as a preadditive category admitting all finitary products and with the null object or a preadditive category admitting all finitary coproducts and with the null object

=== Via semiadditive categories ===
We give an alternative definition.

Define a semiadditive category to be a category (note: not a preadditive category) which admits a zero object and all binary biproducts. It is then a remarkable theorem that the Hom sets naturally admit an abelian monoid structure. A proof of this fact is given below.

An additive category may then be defined as a semiadditive category in which every morphism has an additive inverse. This then gives the Hom sets an abelian group structure instead of merely an abelian monoid structure.

=== Generalization ===

More generally, one also considers additive -linear categories for a commutative ring . These are categories enriched over the monoidal category of -modules and admitting all finitary biproducts.

== Examples ==

The original example of an additive category is the category of abelian groups Ab. The zero object is the trivial group, the addition of morphisms is given pointwise, and biproducts are given by direct sums.

More generally, every module category over a ring is additive, and so in particular, the category of vector spaces over a field is additive.

The algebra of matrices over a ring, thought of as a category as described below, is also additive.

== Internal characterisation of the addition law ==

Let C be a semiadditive category, so a category having all finitary biproducts. Then every hom-set has an addition, endowing it with the structure of an abelian monoid, and such that the composition of morphisms is bilinear.

Moreover, if C is additive, then the two additions on hom-sets must agree. In particular, a semiadditive category is additive if and only if every morphism has an additive inverse.

This shows that the addition law for an additive category is &quot;internal&quot; to that category.

To define the addition law, we will use the convention that for a biproduct, &quot;pk&quot; will denote the projection morphisms, and &quot;ik&quot; will denote the injection morphisms.

The &quot;diagonal morphism&quot; is the canonical morphism , induced by the universal property of products, such that for . Dually, the &quot;codiagonal morphism&quot; is the canonical morphism , induced by the universal property of coproducts, such that for .

For each object , we define:

* the addition of the injections to be the diagonal morphism, that is ;
* the addition of the projections to be the codiagonal morphism, that is .

Next, given two morphisms , there exists a unique morphism such that equals if , and 0 otherwise.

We can therefore define .

This addition is both commutative and associative. The associativity can be seen by considering the composition
:formula_1

We have , using that .

It is also bilinear, using for example that and that .

We remark that for a biproduct we have . Using this, we can represent any morphism as a matrix.

== Matrix representation of morphisms ==

Given objects and in an additive category, we can represent morphisms as -by- matrices
:formula_2 where formula_3

Using that , it follows that addition and composition of matrices obey the usual rules for matrix addition and multiplication.
Thus additive categories can be seen as the most general context in which the algebra of matrices makes sense.

Recall that the morphisms from a single object  to itself form the endomorphism ring .
If we denote the -fold product of  with itself by , then morphisms from to are &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries from the ring .

Conversely, given any ring , we can form a category  by taking objects &quot;An&quot; indexed by the set of natural numbers (including 0) and letting the hom-set of morphisms from to be the set of -by- matrices over , and where composition is given by matrix multiplication. Then is an additive category, and equals the -fold power .

This construction should be compared with the result that a ring is a preadditive category with just one object, shown here.

If we interpret the object as the left module , then this &quot;matrix category&quot; becomes a subcategory of the category of left modules over .

This may be confusing in the special case where or is zero, because we usually don&#x27;t think of matrices with 0 rows or 0 columns. This concept makes sense, however: such matrices have no entries and so are completely determined by their size. While these matrices are rather degenerate, they do need to be included to get an additive category, since an additive category must have a zero object.

Thinking about such matrices can be useful in one way, though: they highlight the fact that given any objects and in an additive category, there is exactly one morphism from to 0 (just as there is exactly one 0-by-1 matrix with entries in ) and exactly one morphism from 0 to (just as there is exactly one 1-by-0 matrix with entries in ) – this is just what it means to say that 0 is a zero object. Furthermore, the zero morphism from to is the composition of these morphisms, as can be calculated by multiplying the degenerate matrices.

== Additive functors ==

A functor between preadditive categories is &quot;additive&quot; if it is an abelian group homomorphism on each hom-set in C. If the categories are additive, then a functor is additive if and only if it preserves all biproduct diagrams.

That is, if is a biproduct of  in C with projection morphisms and injection morphisms , then should be a biproduct of  in D with projection morphisms and injection morphisms .

Almost all functors studied between additive categories are additive. In fact, it is a theorem that all adjoint functors between additive categories must be additive functors (see here). Most of the interesting functors studied in category theory are adjoints.

=== Generalization ===

When considering functors between -linear additive categories, one usually restricts to -linear functors, so those functors giving an -module homomorphism on each hom-set.

== Special cases ==

* A &quot;pre-abelian category&quot; is an additive category in which every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.
* An &quot;abelian category&quot; is a pre-abelian category such that every monomorphism and epimorphism is normal.
Many commonly studied additive categories are in fact abelian categories; for example, Ab is an abelian category. The free abelian groups provide an example of a category that is additive but not abelian.

<text>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA; ) is an American animal rights nonprofit organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, and led by Ingrid Newkirk, its international president.

Founded in March 1980 by Newkirk and animal rights activist Alex Pacheco, the organization first gained attention in the summer of 1981 during what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case. The organization opposes factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and other activities it considers to be exploitation of animals.

The organization&#x27;s controversial campaigns have been credited with drawing media attention to animal rights issues, but have also been widely criticized for their disruptive nature. Its use of euthanasia has resulted in legal action and a response from Virginia lawmakers.

==History==
===Ingrid Newkirk===

Ingrid Newkirk was born in England in 1949, and raised in Hertfordshire and later New Delhi, India, where her father—a navigational engineer—was stationed. Newkirk, now an atheist, was educated in a convent, the only British girl there. She moved to the United States as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead. She became an animal-protection officer for Montgomery County, Maryland, and then the District of Columbia&#x27;s first woman poundmaster. By 1976 she was head of the animal disease control division of D.C.&#x27;s Commission on Public Health and in 1980 was among those named as &quot;Washingtonians of the Year&quot;.
In 1980, after her divorce, she met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and they fell in love and began living together. Newkirk read Peter Singer&#x27;s influential book, &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just &quot;five people in a basement&quot;, as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco&#x27;s from the UK, Kim Stallwood, a British activist who went on to become the national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.

===Silver Spring monkeys===
The group first came to public attention in 1981 during the Silver Spring monkeys case, a dispute about experiments conducted by researcher Edward Taub on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal laboratory, triggered an amendment in 1985 to the United States Animal Welfare Act, and became the first animal-testing case to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld a Louisiana State Court ruling that denied PETA&#x27;s request for custody of the monkeys.

Pacheco had taken a job in May 1981 inside a primate research laboratory at the institute, intending to gain firsthand experience of working inside an animal laboratory. Taub had been cutting sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to the monkeys&#x27; fingers, hands, arms, and legs—a process called &quot;deafferentation&quot;—so that the monkeys could not feel them; some of the monkeys had had their entire spinal columns deafferented. He then used restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food and water to force the monkeys to use the deafferented parts of their bodies. The research led in part to the discovery of neuroplasticity and a new therapy for stroke victims called constraint-induced movement therapy.

Pacheco went to the laboratory at night, taking photographs that showed the monkeys living in what the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research&#x27;s &quot;ILAR Journal&quot; called &quot;filthy conditions&quot;. He passed his photographs to the police, who raided the lab and arrested Taub. Taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to animals, the first such conviction in the United States of an animal researcher; the conviction, though, was overturned on appeal. Norm Phelps writes that the case followed the highly publicized campaign of Henry Spira in 1976 against experiments on cats being performed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and Spira&#x27;s subsequent campaign in April 1980 against the Draize test. These and the Silver Spring monkey case jointly put animal rights on the agenda in the United States.

The 10-year battle for custody of the monkeys—described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a vicious mud fight, during which both sides accused the other of lies and distortion— transformed PETA into a national, then international, movement. By February 1991, it claimed over 350,000 supporters, a paid staff of over 100, and an annual budget of over $7 million.

=== PETA India ===
PETA India was founded in 2000 and is based in Mumbai, India.

PETA and the NGO Animal Rahat, authorized by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), participated in a nine-month investigation of 16 circuses in India. After it was said that &quot;animals used in circuses were subjected to chronic confinement, physical abuse, and psychological torment&quot;, AWBI, in 2013, banned the registration of elephants for performance.

PETA India put up billboards prior to a 2020 annual religious event Eid al-Adha where animals are ritualistically slaughtered. The billboards depicted goats with the words &quot;I am a living being and not just meat. Change your view towards us and become a vegan.&quot; and &quot;I am ME, Not Mutton. See the Individual. Go Vegan.&quot; Muslim clerics wanted to take down the billboards, saying that it was hurtful to their religious sentiments.

In July 2020, PETA put up billboards saying &quot;This Rakshabandhan, protect me: Go leather-free&quot;.

===Locations===
PETA was based in Rockville, Maryland, until 1996, when it moved to Norfolk, Virginia. It opened a Los Angeles division in 2006 and also has offices in Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. In addition, PETA has international affiliates.

==Philosophy and activism==
===Profile===
PETA is an animal rights organization that opposes speciesism, and the abuse of animals in any way, such as for food, clothing, entertainment, or research.

In 2020, PETA&#x27;s website claimed they had 6.5 million supporters, and received donations of $49 million for 2019.

===Campaigns and consumer boycotts===

The organization is known for aggressive media stunts, combined with a solid base of celebrity support—in addition to its honorary directors, Paul McCartney, Alicia Silverstone, Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Ellen DeGeneres, and many other notable celebrities have appeared in PETA ads. Every week, Newkirk holds what &quot;The New Yorker&quot; calls a &quot;war council&quot;, with two dozen of her top strategists gathered at a square table in the PETA conference room, with no suggestion considered too &quot;kooky or unkind&quot;. PETA also gives an annual prize, called the Proggy Award (for &quot;progress&quot;), to individuals or organizations dedicated to animal welfare or who distinguish themselves through their efforts within the area of animal welfare.

Many of the campaigns have focused on large corporations. Fast food companies such as KFC, Wendy&#x27;s, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA&#x27;s consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond&#x27;s, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald&#x27;s and Kraft Foods to exert influence. The campaigns have delivered results for PETA. McDonald&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s introduced vegetarian options after PETA targeted them; and Polo Ralph Lauren said it would no longer use fur. Avon, Estée Lauder, Benetton, and Tonka Toy Co. all stopped testing products on animals, the Pentagon stopped shooting pigs and goats in wounds tests, and a slaughterhouse in Texas was closed down.

As part of its anti-fur action, PETA supporters have infiltrated hundreds of fashion shows in the U.S. and Europe and one in China, throwing red paint on the catwalks and unfurling banners. Celebrities and supermodels have posed naked for the group&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur&quot; campaign—some men, but mostly women—triggering criticism from some feminist animal rights advocates. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writes that PETA activists have crawled through the streets of Paris wearing leg-hold traps and thrown around money soaked in fake blood at the International Fur Fair. They sometimes engage in pie-throwing—in January 2010, Canadian MP Gerry Byrne compared them to terrorists for throwing a tofu cream pie at Canada&#x27;s fishery minister Gail Shea in protest of the seal slaughter, a comment Newkirk called a silly chest-beating exercise. &quot;The thing is, we make them gawk&quot; she told &quot;Satya&quot; magazine, &quot;maybe like a traffic accident that you have to look at.&quot;

PETA has also objected to the practice of mulesing (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.

In 2011, PETA named five orcas as plaintiffs and sued SeaWorld over the animals&#x27; captivity, seeking their protection under the Thirteenth Amendment. A federal judge heard the case and dismissed it in early 2012. In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it was building new orca tanks that would almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales. PETA responded that a &quot;larger prison is still a prison.&quot; In 2016, SeaWorld admitted that it had been sending its employees to pose as activists to spy on PETA. Following an investigation by an outside law firm, SeaWorld&#x27;s Board of Directors directed management to end the practice.

In 2011, Patricia de Leon was the Hispanic spokesperson for PETA&#x27;s anti-bullfighting campaign.

Some campaigns have been particularly controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader Yasser Arafat asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was blown up during an attack in Jerusalem.

To reduce milk consumption, it created the &quot;Got Beer?&quot; campaign, a parody of the dairy industry&#x27;s series of Got Milk? ads, which featured celebrities with milk &quot;mustaches&quot; on their upper lips. When the mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, PETA ran a photograph of him with a white mustache and the words &quot;Got prostate cancer?&quot; to illustrate their claim that dairy products contribute to cancer, an ad that caused an outcry in the United States. After PETA placed ads in school newspapers linking milk to acne, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and strokes, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and college officials complained it encouraged underage drinking; the British Advertising Standards Authority asked that the ads be discontinued after complaints from interest groups such as The National Farmers&#x27; Unions.

In August 2011, it was announced that PETA will be launching a soft pornography website in the .xxx domain. PETA spokesperson Lindsay Rajt told the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;We try to use absolutely every outlet to stick up for animals,&quot; adding that &quot;We are careful about what we do and wouldn&#x27;t use nudity or some of our flashier tactics if we didn&#x27;t know they worked.&quot; PETA also used nudity in its &quot;Veggie Love&quot; ad which it prepared for the Super Bowl, only to have it banned by the network. PETA&#x27;s work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women&#x27;s rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying &quot;They&#x27;re the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty.&quot;

PETA has approached cities to pressure them to change their names, including Fishkill, New York in 1996, Hamburg, New York in 2003, and Commerce City, Colorado in 2007.

PETA sometimes issues isolated statements or press releases, commenting on current events. After Lady Gaga wore a dress made of meat in 2010, PETA issued a statement objecting to the dress. After a fisherman in Florida was bitten by a shark in 2011, PETA proposed an advertisement showing a shark devouring a human, with the caption &quot;Payback Is Hell, Go Vegan&quot;. The proposed ad drew criticism from relatives of the injured fisherman. After Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer admitted that he had killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015, PETA&#x27;s president, Newkirk, issued a statement on behalf of PETA in which she said: 

===Undercover work===
PETA sends its staff undercover into industries and other facilities that use animals to document the alleged abuse of animals. Investigators may spend many months as employees of a facility, making copies of documents and wearing hidden cameras.

==== 1990s ====
* In 1984, PETA produced a 26-minute film, &quot;Unnecessary Fuss&quot;, based on 60 hours of research video footage stolen by the Animal Liberation Front during a break-in at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s head injury clinic. The footage showed experiments on the baboons with a hydraulic device intended to simulate whiplash. The publicity led to investigations, suspension of grant funding, the firing of a veterinarian, the closure of the research lab, and a period of probation for the university.
* In 1990, two PETA activists posed as employees of Carolina Biological, where they took pictures and video footage inside the company, alleging that cats were being mistreated. Following the release of PETA&#x27;s tapes, the USDA conducted its own inspection and subsequently charged the company with seven violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Four years later, an administrative judge ruled that Carolina Biological had not committed any violations.
* In 1990, Bobby Berosini, a Las Vegas entertainer, lost his wildlife license as well as (on appeal) a later lawsuit against PETA, after PETA broadcast an undercover film of him slapping and punching orangutans in 1989.
* In 1997, PETA made a film from footage obtained by PETA member Michele Rokke, who went undercover to report on UK company Huntingdon Life Sciences, which aired on television. Huntingdon sued PETA, and PETA agreed to drop its campaign against Huntingdon.
* In 1999, a North Carolina grand jury indicted three workers at a hog farm after three-months of videotaping by a PETA operative while he was employed at the farm. The veterinarian who oversaw the farm said the video PETA had made from the footage was a distortion and was made by someone who &quot;lied during his employment interview&quot;.

====2000s====
* In 2004, PETA released video tapes taken from eight-months of undercover filming in a West Virginia slaughterhouse that supplies chicken to the fast food industry. The recordings showed workers stomping on live chickens and throwing dozens against a wall. The parent corporation sent in their inspectors and told the plant to take corrective measures or risk losing their contract. Eleven employees were fired and the company introduced an anti-cruelty pledge for workers to sign.
* For 11 months PETA shot footage inside a facility in Virginia operated by Covance (now Fortrea). Alleging that the footage showed primates being choked, hit, and denied medical attention, PETA sent the video and a 253-page complaint to the United States Department of Agriculture. The department investigated and the company was fined $8,720. In June 2005, the company filed a lawsuit in the United States against PETA and the investigator for fraud, breach of employee contract, and conspiracy. PETA agreed to hand over all video footage and written notes to the company, and agreed to a ban on conducting any infiltration of the company for five years.
* In 2006, PETA filmed a trainer at Carson &amp; Barnes Circus instructing others to beat the elephants to make them obey. A company spokesman said they stopped using electrical prods on animals after the video was released.
* In 2007, the owners of a chinchilla ranch in Michigan sued PETA after pretending in 2004 to be interested buyers and secretly filming them, creating a video &quot;Nightmare on Chinchilla Farm&quot;. A judge dismissed the case, writing &quot;Undercover investigations are one of the main ways our criminal justice system operates,&quot; and noted that investigative television shows &quot;often conduct undercover investigations to reveal improper, unethical, or criminal behavior.&quot;
* In 2008, the famous Spanish singer Alaska collaborated with PETA in a joint campaign with AnimaNaturalis, posing nude in a picture to raise awareness for what she considers cruel activity, bullfighting.

====2010s====
* In 2013, PETA investigated angora rabbit farms in China and released video footage showing farmers ripping out the wool from live rabbits while they screamed. In 2015, Inditex announced they would discontinue their use of angora and donated their existing inventory to Syrian refugees. Seventy other retailers had also stopped selling angora wool since the release of PETA&#x27;s graphic video footage.
* Between 2012 and 2014, PETA investigated sheep shearing sheds in the wool industry in Australia and the US. PETA sent reports and film footage to local authorities alleging that shearers had kicked and beat sheep, stomped on their heads, necks and legs, punched them with clippers, slammed them onto the floor, and sewed up cuts without pain relief. An American Wool Council spokesperson said &quot;We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally. Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.&quot;
* In 2014, PETA conducted an undercover investigation of the horse-racing industry, filming seven hours of footage that, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;showed mistreatment of the horses to be widespread and cavalier.&quot; Noted trainer Steve Asmussen and his top assistant trainer, Scott Blasi, were accused &quot;of subjecting their horses to cruel and injurious treatments, administering drugs to them for nontherapeutic purposes, and having one of their jockeys use an electrical device to shock horses into running faster.&quot; The newspaper noted that this investigation &quot;was PETA&#x27;s first significant step into advocacy in the horse racing world.&quot; In November 2015, as a result of PETA&#x27;s investigation, Asmussen was fined $10,000 by the New York State Gaming Commission. Robert Williams, executive director of the commission, said, &quot;We recognize PETA for playing a role in bringing about changes necessary to make thoroughbred racing safer and fairer for all.&quot; By contrast, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which also received PETA&#x27;s allegations, found that Asmussen did not violate any of its rules. Asmussen remains under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After a thorough investigation, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission did not bring any charges against Asmussen, stating the allegations &quot;had neither a factual or scientific basis.&quot; While the fine from the New York State Gaming Commission was for a minor transgression, the most serious charges were deemed unfounded.
* In 2015, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported, PETA investigated Sweet Stem Farm, a pig farm that supplies meat to Whole Foods. The resulting video footage &quot;featured images of pigs, some allegedly sick and not given appropriate care, crowded into hot pens and roughly handled by employees,&quot; contradicting both the farm&#x27;s own video self-portrait and Whole Foods&#x27; claims about &quot;humane meat&quot; (a term that PETA maintains is an oxymoron). &quot;The Post&quot; notes that &quot;[i]n the wake of the PETA investigation, Whole Foods has removed the Sweet Stem video from its Web site.&quot; PETA subsequently filed a class-action lawsuit against Whole Foods, &quot;alleging that the chain&#x27;s claims about animal welfare amount to a &#x27;sham.&#x27;&quot; The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal magistrate, who ruled that the store&#x27;s signage &quot;amounted to permissible &#x27;puffery&#x27;&quot; and that &quot;the statement that &#x27;no cages&#x27; were used to raise broiler chickens was not misleading merely because Whole Foods failed to also disclose that poultry suppliers normally do not use cages in the first place.&quot;
* Other PETA investigations from around this time focused on crocodile and alligator farms in Texas and Zimbabwe, a monkey breeding facility in Florida, pigeon racing in Taiwan, ostrich slaughterhouses and tanneries in South Africa.
* CBS News reported in November 2016 that PETA had captured footage from restaurants that serve live octopus, shrimp, and other marine animals. The group&#x27;s video showed &quot;an octopus writhing as its limbs are severed by a chef at T Equals Fish, a Koreatown sushi restaurant in Los Angeles.&quot; PETA noted that octopuses &quot;are considered among the most intelligent invertebrates&quot; and &quot;are capable of feeling pain just as a pig or rabbit would.&quot;
* In December 2016, PETA released video footage from an investigation at Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s dog laboratory, which deliberately breeds dogs to contract muscular dystrophy. PETA claims that for &quot;35 years, dogs have suffered in cruel muscular dystrophy experiments ... which haven&#x27;t resulted in a cure or treatment for reversing the course of muscular dystrophy in humans.&quot; The &quot;Houston Press&quot; noted that &quot;Texas A&amp;M has been less than transparent about the research, and in some cases has denied that the dogs experience pain or discomfort.&quot; Among other efforts, PETA placed a billboard to oppose the ineffectual research on animals.
* Bio Corporation, a company that supplies dead animals for study and dissection, was the subject of a November 2017 PETA undercover investigation. It was claimed that video footage showed workers at the company&#x27;s facility in Alexandria, Minnesota &quot;drowning fully-conscious pigeons, injecting live crayfish with latex and claiming that they sometimes would freeze turtles to death.&quot; PETA brought 25 charges of cruelty to animals against the company. Drowning is not considered an acceptable form of euthanasia, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, and its standards of humane euthanasia must be followed by companies certified by the United States Department of Agriculture such as Bio Corporation. On April 18, 2018, the case was dismissed and all charges dropped based on the Alexandria City Attorney&#x27;s Office&#x27;s assessment that the allegations of cruelty against either pigeons or crayfish were not sufficiently supported. Daniel Paden, PETA&#x27;s director of evidence analysis, said that PETA is &quot;reviewing its options to protect animals killed at Bio Corporation.&quot;
* In 2018, police raided a PetSmart store in Tennessee, after receiving video footage from PETA. Police confiscated six animals: a guinea pig, mice, and hamsters. PetSmart sued the ex-employee, Jenna Jordan, claiming she was a paid PETA operative who obtained employment at PetSmart stores in Arizona, Florida and Tennessee to obtain recordings which she provided to PETA. Jordan was accused of committing &quot;animal neglect, theft of confidential information, unlawfully surveilled private conversations, and filing false reports with law enforcement under false pretenses in three states.&quot; In 2019, PetSmart added PETA as a defendant in the lawsuit.
* On May 1, 2018, PETA released an investigation of the mohair industry that led more than 80 retailers, including UNIQLO and Zappos, to drop products made with mohair. The video evidence &quot;depicts goats being thrown around wood floors, dunked in poisonous cleaning solution or having their ears mutilated with pliers. ... [E]mployees are shown cutting goats&#x27; throats, breaking their necks, electrically shocking them and beheading them.&quot;

===Ag-gag laws===

Various U.S. states have passed ag-gag laws to prevent animal rights and animal welfare groups from conducting undercover investigations of operations that use animals. In response, PETA has been involved with other groups bringing lawsuits, citing First Amendment protections for free speech.
* In 2017, a federal judge ruled Utah&#x27;s ag-gag law an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment in a case brought against the state by PETA, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and Amy Meyer, the director of the Utah Animal Rights Coalition.
* In 2018, Idaho&#x27;s ag-gag law was struck down as unconstitutional in a case brought by ACLU-Idaho, the ALDF and PETA.
* In 2019, a federal judge struck down Iowa&#x27;s 2012 ag-gag law in a case filed in 2017 by co-plaintiffs PETA, ALDF, ACLU-Iowa, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Bailing Out Benji, and Center for Food Safety.
* In 2020, in the case of &quot;PETA et al v. Stein&quot;, Judge Schroeder struck four subsections of North Carolina&#x27;s 2015 Property Protection Act, writing &quot;the law is declared unconstitutional as applied to them in their exercise of speech.&quot; The plaintiffs included PETA, Center for Food Safety, ALDF, Farm Sanctuary, Food &amp; Water Watch, Government Accountability Project, Farm Forward, and the ASPCA.

===Legal proceedings===
Two PETA employees were acquitted in 2007 of cruelty to animals after at least 80 euthanized animals were left in dumpsters in a shopping center in Ahoskie, North Carolina, over the course of a month in 2005; the two employees were seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van. The animals had been euthanized after being removed from shelters in Northampton and Bertie counties. A Bertie County Deputy Sheriff stated that the two employees assured the Bertie Animal Shelter that &quot;they were picking up the dogs to take them back to Norfolk where they would find them good homes.&quot; During the trial, Daphna Nachminovitch, the supervisor of PETA&#x27;s Community Animal Project, said PETA began euthanizing animals in some rural North Carolina shelters after it found the shelters killing animals in ways PETA considers inhumane, including by shooting them. She also stated that the dumping of animals did not follow PETA&#x27;s policy.

In November 2014, a resident of Accomack County, Virginia, produced video evidence that two workers in a van marked with a PETA logo had entered his property in a trailer park and taken his dog, who was then euthanized. He reported the incident to the police, who identified and charged two PETA workers, but the charges were later dropped by the commonwealth attorney on the grounds that it was not possible to prove criminal intent. The trailer park&#x27;s manager had contacted PETA after a group of residents moved out, leaving their dogs behind, which is why the workers were on the property. The state later determined that PETA had violated state law by failing to ensure that the Chihuahua, who was not wearing a collar or tag, was properly identified and for failing to keep the dog alive for five days before euthanizing the animal. Citing a &quot;severity of this lapse in judgment,&quot; the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued PETA a first-ever violation and imposed a $500 fine. The contract worker who had taken the dog was dismissed by PETA.

In 2015, PETA sued British nature photographer David Slater in US court as a next friend for a wild macaque monkey, whom they named Naruto. PETA argued that the monkey was entitled to the copyright of a selfie it had taken while handling Slater&#x27;s camera, and naming themselves to be the administrator of any copyright revenue. The monkey selfie copyright dispute was originally dismissed by Judge Orrick who wrote there is no indication that the Copyright Act extends to animals and a monkey could not own a copyright. PETA appealed, but the Court of Appeals found in favor of Slater saying that &quot;PETA&#x27;s real motivation in this case was to advance its own interests, not Naruto&#x27;s.&quot; The decision cited &quot;Cetacean v. Bush (2004)&quot; that says animals cannot sue unless Congress makes it clear in the statute that animals can sue, and added that &quot;next friend&quot; representation cannot be applied to animals. The court also wrote: 

===Video games===

PETA has created a number of satirical video games with such names as &quot;How Green Is My Diet?&quot; and &quot;KKK or AKC? Spot the Difference&quot;. PETA uses these games to spread attention about animal rights and animal welfare and to advocate vegetarian and vegan diets. PETA&#x27;s head of online marketing Joel Bartlett said &quot;We&#x27;ve found that parody games are extremely popular. By connecting our message with something people are already interested in, we&#x27;re able to create more buzz.&quot;

In 2017, Ingrid Newkirk sent a letter of complaint to Nintendo about their video game &quot;1-2-Switch&quot;, during which players get to milk a cow. In her letter, Newkirk called the game &quot;unrealistic&quot; and wrote &quot;you&#x27;ve taken all the cruelty out of milking&quot;. She also suggested that &quot;instead of sugarcoating the subject, Nintendo switch to simulating activities in which no animals suffer.&quot;

In March 2020, PETA issued a &quot;Vegan Guide to Animal Crossing&quot; for the video game &quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot;.

=== Labels ===
PETA certifies beauty and cosmetics companies with &quot;Beauty without Bunnies&quot; bunny labels in two tiers. In the first tier (&quot;Animal Test-Free&quot;), the entire company does not use animal testing. The company may still produce non-vegan products. In the second tier (&quot;Cruelty-Free&quot;), the company may not produce non-vegan products. The company is animal test-free and also vegan, i.e. does not use any animal-derived ingredients. If a company carries the PETA &quot;animal test-free&quot; or &quot;cruelty-free&quot; label, it must also have signed agreements with its suppliers that they do not use animal testing.

PETA also awards a &quot;vegan&quot; label to clothing and furniture products (instead of entire companies), which means that the products are free from animal-derived ingredients, but the companies can still produce non-vegan products.
==Positions==
===Direct action and the ALF===

Newkirk is outspoken in her support of direct action, writing that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without what she calls the militarism component: &quot;Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out.&quot; Newkirk is a strong supporter of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilities: &quot;When I hear of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, my heart sings.&quot; Newkirk was quoted in 1999, &quot;When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals&#x27; social needs, I find it small wonder that the laboratories aren&#x27;t all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I&#x27;d light a match.&quot;

===Euthanasia===

PETA is a strong proponent of euthanasia. They oppose the no-kill movement, and rather than adoption programs, PETA prefers to aim for zero births through spaying and neutering. They recommend not breeding pit bulls, and support euthanasia in certain situations for animals in shelters, such as those being housed for long periods in cramped cages.

=== Pet as a derogatory term ===
PETA considers the word pet to be &quot;derogatory and patronises the animal&quot;, and prefers the term &quot;companion&quot; or &quot;companion animal&quot;. &quot;Animals are not pets&quot;, Newkirk has said.

===Hearing-ear and seeing-eye dogs===
PETA supports hearing dog programs when animals are sourced from shelters and placed in homes, but opposes seeing-eye-dog programs &quot;because the dogs are bred as if there are no equally intelligent dogs literally dying for homes in shelters, they are kept in harnesses almost 24/7&quot;.

===Animal testing===

PETA opposes animal testing—whether toxicity testing, basic or applied research, or for education and training—on both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it. The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, and irrelevant to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including embryonic stem cell research and in vitro cell research.

===National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/White Coat Waste Project===
The White Coat Waste Project (WCWP), a group of activists that hold that taxpayers should not have to pay $20 billion every year for experiments on animals, said that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided $400,000 in taxpayer money to fund experiments in which 28 beagles were infected by disease-causing parasites. The White Coat Project found reports that said dogs taking part in the experiments were &quot;vocalizing in pain&quot; after being injected with foreign substances. Following public outcry, PETA made a call to action that all members of the National Institute of Health resign effective immediately and that there is a &quot;need to find a new NIH director to replace the outgoing Francis Collins who will shut down research that violates the dignity of nonhuman animals.&quot; In 2019, the WCWP discovered a USDA funded lab in Beltsville, Maryland which conducted toxoplasmosis experiments on kittens resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 kittens over 36 years. This discovery led to the USDA banning all taxpayer funded kitten experiments. In 2024, the WCWP also reported that taxpayer money was used to fund beagle experiments in China, which drew widespread condemnation, including a call from PETA to end taxpayer-funded animal experiments globally.

== Controversies ==

===High euthanasia rates===

PETA&#x27;s euthanasia practices have drawn intense scrutiny from lawmakers and criticism from animal rights activists for years. The consistently high percentage of animals euthanized at PETA&#x27;s shelter has been controversial.

In 2008, meat industry lobby group the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) said in a news release that &quot;[a]n official report filed by PETA itself shows that the animal rights group put to death nearly every dog, cat, and other pet it took in for adoption in 2006,&quot; with a kill rate of 97.4 percent. In 2012, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said that it had in the past considered changing PETA&#x27;s status from &quot;shelter&quot; to &quot;euthanasia clinic&quot;, citing PETA&#x27;s willingness to take in &quot;anything that comes through the door, and other shelters won&#x27;t do that.&quot; PETA acknowledged that it euthanized 95% of the animals at its shelter in 2011.

PETA calls their shelter in Norfolk, Virginia a &quot;shelter of last resort&quot;, claiming they only receive old, sick, injured, badly behaved, and otherwise unadoptable animals. Operating as open admission, they take in animals &quot;no one else will&quot;, and consider death &quot;a merciful end&quot;. In 2014, PETA euthanized over 80% of the shelter&#x27;s animals and justified its euthanasia policies as &quot;mercy killings&quot;.

Fueled by public outrage from a 2014 incident where PETA workers took a pet chihuahua from its porch and euthanized it the same day, along with documentation that of the 1,606 cats and 1,025 dogs accepted by the shelter that same year, 1,536 cats and 788 dogs were euthanized, the Virginia General Assembly passed Senate Bill 1381 in 2015 aimed at curtailing the operation of PETA&#x27;s shelter. The bill defines a private animal shelter as &quot;a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.&quot;

Though risking their legal access to euthanasia drugs, PETA has continued their practices. In the chihuahua case, PETA paid a fine and settled a civil claim with the family three years later.

=== Child targeted messaging ===
PETA has also been criticized for aiming its message at young people. In the past the company has passed out pamphlets such as &quot;Your Daddy Kills Animals&quot;, and &quot;Your Mommy Kills Animals&quot;, both warning children from letting their &quot;addicted to killing&quot; parents have contact with their pets. The pamphlet was criticized by the Center for Consumer Freedom, who said &quot;There&#x27;s going to be long-term psychological damage from these kids being exposed to the material that PETA puts in front of them on a regular basis.&quot;

As part of its 1999 &quot;McCruelty&quot; campaign, PETA attempted to distribute &quot;Unhappy Meals&quot; to young audiences: a parody of McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal. When describing the box, they explained that &quot;PETA&#x27;s spoof of a McDonald&#x27;s chicken sandwich box features the image of a knife-wielding Ronald McDonald, along with pictures of birds who have been mutilated and scalded alive. The inside of the Unhappy Meal box is stained with blood and contains a blood-filled packet urging McDonald&#x27;s to &quot;Ketchup With the Times&quot;, a paper cutout of a menacing Ronald McDonald with PETA&#x27;s parody &quot;I&#x27;m Hatin&#x27; It&quot; logo, a bloody plastic chicken, and a &quot;Chicken McCruelty&quot; T-shirt wrapped up like a sandwich.&quot; The violent imagery was decried by parents who stated &quot;I don&#x27;t want my son to be around something like this.&quot; As part of the same campaign, PETA attempted to place a large statue of a crippled, scalded chicken in front of a McDonalds&#x27;s in Little Rock, but were denied, and released a short comic book titled Ronald McDonald Kills Animals, in which Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and the Hamburglar unite to kill Birdie&#x27;s parents, feed them to her unknowingly, then eat her as well.

A similar &quot;Kentucky Fried Cruelty&quot; campaign occurred in 2004, when PETA criticized KFC and distributed &quot;Buckets of Blood&quot; to children: the buckets (meant to mimic KFC&#x27;s buckets of chicken) included a bag of fake blood, feathers, and bones; a bloody plastic chicken; and a cardboard caricature of a blood-spattered Colonel Sanders holding a butcher knife toward a terrified-looking chicken.

A 2013 ad titled Traditional Thanksgiving Dinner from your Family Butcher, was developed using lenticular technology to show parents a benign Thanksgiving promo, but show their children a mother stabbing a live turkey while her children look on in shock.

=== &quot;It&#x27;s Still Going On&quot; campaign ===
PETA&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Still Going On&quot; campaign features newspaper ads comparing widely publicized murder-cannibalization cases to the deaths of animals in slaughterhouses. The campaign has attracted significant media attention, controversy and generated angry responses from the victims&#x27; family members. Ads were released in 1991 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, in 2002 describing the deaths of the victims of serial killer Robert William Pickton, and in 2008 describing the killing of Tim McLean. In several cases, newspapers have refused to run the ads.

=== &quot;Holocaust on Your Plate&quot; campaign ===
In 2003 PETA composed the &quot;Holocaust on Your Plate&quot; exhibition—eight panels juxtaposing images of Holocaust and concentration camp victims with scenes of factory farming, battery cages, animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter, along with captions stating that &quot;Like the Jews murdered in concentration camps, animals are terrorized when they are housed in huge filthy warehouses and rounded up for shipment to slaughter. The leather sofa and handbag are the moral equivalent of the lampshades made from the skins of people killed in the death camps.&quot;

The exhibition was quickly criticized by Abraham Foxman and the Anti-Defamation League, who said, &quot;the effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent&quot; and &quot;[r]ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a way to make sure such catastrophes never happen again.&quot; Alex Herschaft had made similar comparisons in the past, but criticized PETA&#x27;s use as &quot;careless and reckless&quot; and impersonal. Elie Wiesel was appalled to find the campaign used his own image, calling it possibly the greatest disappointment of his life, and reiterating that &quot;I am not afraid of forgetfulness, I am afraid of banalization, of trivialization and this is part of it.&quot; Other detractors included the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Wesley Smith.

As a response to critics of the UK campaign asking for a ban or some form of censorship, PETA accused them of book burning to further imply Nazi mentality. In 2004 a complaint was made by Paul Spiegel and the Central Council of Jews in Germany, asking the German court to order PETA to halt the campaign and threatening to sue. In July 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA&#x27;s campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity, and upheld the ban in 2012.

The exhibit had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: &quot;The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible—that we can do anything we want to those we decide are &#x27;different or inferior&#x27;—is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We&#x27;re asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms.&quot; In addition, PETA claimed a direct influence by the prominent Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, whose grandson, Stephen R. Dujack, supported the exhibition when it traveled to New York, and quotations for the exhibit also pulled from the writings of German philosopher Theodor Adorno. Karen Davis and Gary Yourofsky both voiced their support of the exhibition.

=== &quot;Are Animals the New Slaves?&quot; exhibit ===
In 2005, the NAACP criticized the &quot;Are Animals the New Slaves?&quot; exhibit, which showed images of African-American lynching victims and slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows. Lee Hall, the then director of Friends of Animals, supported the criticism, stating that, &quot;While African-Americans have been systematically degraded by being compared with nonhuman beings, are we to think that angry responses to the pairing of man and monkey were unanticipated?&quot;

Vakiya Courtney, then executive director of America&#x27;s Black Holocaust Museum, was outraged; images from the exhibit included one taken at the site of the attempted lynching of the museum founder James Cameron, and the successful lynching of his two friends. &quot;How can you possibly compare the brutality that our ancestors experienced here, and the brutality that people like Dr. Cameron had to overcome, to animal cruelty?&quot; Cameron, himself, had a similar response: &quot;They may have treated us like animals back then, but there is no way we should be compared to animals today.&quot;

===&quot;Got Autism?&quot; campaign===
In 2008 and in 2014, PETA conducted an advertising campaign linking milk with autism. Their &quot;Got Autism?&quot; campaign, a play on words mocking the milk industry&#x27;s Got Milk? ad campaign that ran from 1993 to 2014, stated &quot;Studies have shown a link between cow&#x27;s milk and autism.&quot; PETA also claimed milk was strongly linked to cancer, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and other diseases. When pressed, PETA cited two scientific papers, one from 1995 and one from 2002 using very small samplings of children (36 and 20), and neither showed a correlation nor a causation between milk and autism. Newer studies from 2010 and 2014 came to the same conclusion. Despite having been corrected, in 2014, PETA&#x27;s Executive Vice President confirmed their position, and additionally stated that dairy consumption contributes to asthma, chronic ear infection, constipation, iron deficiency, anemia, and cancer.

Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist and assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine, wrote &quot;This is clearly, in my opinion, a campaign of fear mongering based upon a gross distortion of the scientific evidence. The purpose is to advocate for a vegan diet, which fits [PETA&#x27;s] ideological agenda. They are likely aware that it is easier to spread fears than to reassure with a careful analysis of the scientific evidence.&quot;

PETA&#x27;s campaign has received backlash from the autism community. A 2008 PETA billboard was taken down by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. In 2017, British food writer, journalist and hunger relief activist Jack Monroe, demanded PETA remove their recipes from their website &quot;with immediate effect coz I wrote them with my autism&quot;. PETA removed their recipes, but did not remove the &quot;Got Autism?&quot; article from their website until 2021. It has been argued that the frowny face in the campaign image negatively stereotypes autistic people.

===&quot;KKK or AKC?&quot; controversy===
In 2009, PETA members dressed up in Ku Klux Klan robes and protested at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show where they passed out brochures implying the Klan and American Kennel Club have the same goal of &quot;pure bloodlines&quot;. This protest was continued in the PETA video game &quot;KKK or AKC? Spot the Difference.&quot;

===Criticism of Steve Irwin===

PETA has been critical of Australian wildlife expert and zookeeper Steve Irwin. In 2006, when Irwin died, PETA Vice President Dan Mathews said Irwin had made a career out of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott was disgusted by the comments and said PETA should apologize to Irwin&#x27;s family and the rest of Australia, and &quot;Isn&#x27;t it interesting ... how they [PETA] want to treat animals ethically, but cannot even think for a minute whether or not their outlandish comments are ethical towards their fellow human beings.&quot;

In 2019, PETA criticized Google for creating a slideshow Google Doodle of Steve Irwin posthumously honoring his 57th birthday. PETA started a Twitter campaign against Irwin, with several tweets criticizing Google for forwarding a dangerous message, and wrote that Irwin was killed while harassing a stingray and that he forced animals to perform. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor wrote &quot;PETA can add &#x27;insulting a deceased cultural icon&#x27; to its infamous repertoire.&quot;

=== Anti-carnivore sex strike ===
In 2022, PETA&#x27;s German division called for a sex strike in which women would refrain from sexual activities with men who ate meat, and also called for men who ate meat to be banned from procreating. When pressed on the ban, Laura Weyman-Jones (the Australian division&#x27;s marketing manager) said that it was a &quot;conversation starter&quot;, and not an actual request or threat. The company did not reverse its position that meat consumption was a form of toxic masculinity, harmful to the environment, increased male impotency, and should be sin-taxed at an additional 41%.

=== Human barbecue stunt protest ===

During Holy Week in the Philippines, a PETA Asia member stripped down to her underwear and laid down on a grill to depict a &quot;human barbecue&quot; in front of Quiapo Church in Quiapo, Manila, calling Filipinos to abstain from eating meat even when not abstaining from meat during Lent. The stunt protest drew attention and controversy from churchgoers, and a complaint was filed by the church with the Manila Police District. No formal complaint was made, and as such, the members involved were eventually released.

==Domain name disputes==
In February 1995, a parody website calling itself &quot;People Eating Tasty Animals&quot; registered the domain name &quot;peta.org&quot;. PETA sued, claiming trademark violation, and won the suit in 2001; the domain is currently owned by PETA. While still engaged in legal proceedings over &quot;peta.org&quot;, PETA themselves registered the domains &quot;ringlingbrothers.com&quot; and &quot;voguemagazine.com&quot;, using the sites to accuse Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and Vogue of animal cruelty. PETA later surrendered the domains under threat of similar legal action over trademark infringement.

==Position within the animal rights movement==

The more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grass-roots members, is soft on the idea of animal rights, that it should stop the use of media stunts and nudity in its campaigning, and stop &quot;hogging the spotlight at the expense of its allies in the movement&quot;.

Robert Garner of the University of Leicester has written that PETA has shaken up the animal rights movement, setting up new groups and radicalizing old ones. According to reviews at Philanthropedia, &quot;PETA paved the way for other national organizations to delve into what used to be controversial issues and are now more mainstream concerns.&quot; Michael Specter considers PETA to be the radical that helps the more mainstream message to succeed.

Because of PETA&#x27;s euthanasia rates at their &quot;shelter of last resort&quot;, attorney Nathan Winograd, advocate for the No Kill movement, calls Newkirk of PETA &quot;The Butcher of Norfolk&quot;.

Gary L. Francione, professor of law at Rutgers Law School and a proponent of abolitionism, says that PETA is not an animal rights group because of their willingness to work with industries that use animals to achieve incremental change. Francione says PETA trivializes the movement with their &quot;Three Stooges&quot; theory of animal rights, making the public think progress is underway when the changes are only cosmetic. &quot;Their campaigns are selected more for media image than content.&quot; Francione has criticized PETA for having caused grassroots animal rights groups to close, groups that were essential for the survival of the animal rights movement, and rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione wrote that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group.

<text>Carlisle ( , ; from ) is a city located in the Northern English county of Cumbria. It is administrated by Cumberland Council, which covers an area similar to the historic county of Cumberland.

Carlisle&#x27;s early history is marked by the establishment of a human settlement to serve forts along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in Roman Britain. Due to its proximity to Scotland (being located south of the current Anglo-Scottish border), Carlisle Castle and the city became an important military stronghold in the Middle Ages. The castle served as a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots in 1568 and currently hosts the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment and the Border Regiment Museum. In the early 12th century, a priory was built and gained cathedral status with a diocese in 1133 (city status at the time meant the settlement became a city) while the county of Cumberland was created.

In the 19th century, the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution began a process of socioeconomic transformation in Carlisle, which developed into a densely populated mill town. This, combined with its strategic position, allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important railway town, with seven railway companies sharing Carlisle railway station. Nicknamed the &#x27;Great Border City&#x27;, Carlisle today is a main cultural, commercial and industrial centre within the British borders.

==History==
=== Ancient Carlisle ===
The ancient history of Carlisle is derived mainly from archaeological evidence and the works of the Roman historian Tacitus. The earliest recorded inhabitants in the area were the Carvetii tribe of Britons who made up the main population of ancient Cumbria and North Lancashire. According to Boethius and John of Fordun, writing in the 18th and 19th centuries, Carlisle existed before the arrival of the Romans in Britain and was one of the strongest British towns at the time. In the time of the emperor Nero, it was said to have burned down. The Roman settlement was named Luguvalium, based on a native name that has been reconstructed as Brittonic *Luguwaljon, &quot;[city] of Luguwalos&quot;, a masculine Celtic given name meaning &quot;strength of Lugus&quot;.

Excavations undertaken along Annetwell Street in the 1970s dated the Roman timber fort constructed at the site of present Carlisle Castle to the winter of AD 73. It protected a strategic location on the Roman road to the north and overlooking the confluence of the Caldew and Eden rivers.

The fort at Carlisle was reconstructed in 83 using oak timbers from further afield, rather than local alder as a possible result of the increased Roman control of the area. At this time the Roman fort was garrisoned by a 500-strong cavalry regiment, the &quot;&quot;.

By the early 2nd century, Carlisle was established as a prominent stronghold. The &#x27;Stanegate&#x27; frontier, which consisted of Luguvalium and several other forts in a line east to Corbridge, was proving a more stable frontier against the Picts than those established deeper into Caledonia. In 122, the province was visited by Hadrian, who approved a plan to build a wall the length of the frontier. A new fort, Petriana, was therefore built in the Stanwix area of the city north of the river on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. It was the largest fort along the wall and was completed in stone by around 130. Like Luguvalium, which lay within sight, Petriana housed a nominal 1,000-strong cavalry regiment, the &quot;Ala Gallorum Petriana&quot;, the sole regiment of this size along the wall. Hadrian&#x27;s successor Antoninus Pius abandoned the frontier and attempted to move further north; he built the Antonine Wall between the firths of Forth and Clyde. It was not a success and, after 20 years, the garrisons returned to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

At one time, Carlisle broke off from Rome when Marcus Carausius assumed power over the territory. He was assassinated and suffered &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, but a surviving reference to him has been uncovered in Carlisle. Coins excavated in the area suggest that Romans remained in Carlisle until the reign of Emperor Valentinian II, from 375 to 392.

===Middle Ages===
The period of late antiquity after Roman rule saw Cumbria organised as the native British kingdom of Rheged. It is likely that the kingdom took its name from a major stronghold within it; this has been suggested to have been broadly coterminous with the &#x27;, Carlisle. King Urien and his son and successor Owain became the subjects of a great deal of Arthurian legend. Their capital has been identified as the listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain, which later developed into , whence the city&#x27;s modern Welsh name Caerliwelydd. Rheged came under Northumbrian control before 730, probably by inheritance after Rienmelth, daughter of Royth and great-granddaughter of Urien, married Oswy, King of Northumbria. For the rest of the first millennium, Carlisle was an important stronghold contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. In 685, St Cuthbert, visiting the Queen of Northumbria in her sister&#x27;s monastery at Carlisle, was taken to see the city walls and a marvellously constructed Roman fountain.

By the time of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, Carlisle was in the possession of the Scots. It was not recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. This changed in 1092, when William the Conqueror&#x27;s son William Rufus invaded the region and incorporated Carlisle into England. The construction of Carlisle Castle began in 1093 on the site of the Roman fort, south of the River Eden. The castle was rebuilt in stone in 1112, with a keep and the city walls. The walls enclosed the city south of the castle and included three gates to the east, south, and north called the Irish or Caldew Gate, the English or Botcher Gate, and the Scotch or Ricker Gate respectively. The names of the gates exist in road names in Carlisle today. Carlisle Cathedral was founded as an Augustinian priory and became a cathedral in 1133. In 1157, Carlisle became the seat of the new county of Carliol (a name that was originally an abbreviation of Latin &quot;Carlioliensis&quot;, meaning &quot;[Bishop] of Carlisle&quot;); in 1177 the county was renamed Cumberland.

The conquest of Cumberland was the beginning of a war between Scotland and England which saw the region centred around Carlisle change hands a number of times. It was a major stronghold after the construction of the castle. During the wars, the livelihood of the people on the borders was devastated by armies from both sides. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other sought security through their own strength and cunning, and they improved their livelihoods at their enemies&#x27; expense. These peoples were known as the Border Reivers and Carlisle was the major city within their territories.

The Reivers became so much of a nuisance to the Scottish and English governments that, in 1525, the Archbishop of Glasgow Gavin Dunbar cursed all the reivers of the borderlands. The curse was detailed in 1,069 words, beginning: &quot;I curse their head and all the hairs of their head; I curse their face, their brain (innermost thoughts), their mouth, their nose, their tongue, their teeth, their forehead, their shoulders, their breast, their heart, their stomach, their back, their womb, their arms, their leggs, their hands, their feet and every part of their body, from the top of their head to the soles of their feet, before and behind, within and without.&quot;

===Early Modern era===

After the Pilgrimage of Grace, Henry VIII, concerned at the weakness of his hold on the North, employed (1539) the engineer Stefan von Haschenperg to modernise the defences of Carlisle. von Haschenperg was sacked in 1543 for having &quot;spent great treasures to no purpose&quot;; but (by him and his successors) at the north end the castle towers were converted to artillery platforms, at the south the medieval Bochard gate was converted into the Citadel, an artillery fortification with two massive artillery towers. The death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603 and her succession by James VI of Scotland as King James I of England allowed more determined and coordinated efforts to suppress reiving. The borderers were not quick to change their ways and many were hanged and whole families were exiled to Ireland. It was not until 1681 that the problem of the reivers was acknowledged as no longer an issue.

Following the personal union of the crowns Carlisle Castle should have become obsolete as a frontier fortress, but the two kingdoms continued as separate states. In 1639, with war between the two kingdoms looming, the castle was refortified using stone from the cathedral cloisters. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the castle was garrisoned for the king. It endured a long siege from October 1644 until June 1645 when the Royalist forces surrendered after the Battle of Naseby. The city was occupied by a parliamentary garrison, and subsequently by their Scots allies. In 1646, the Scots, now holding Carlisle pending payment of monies owed them by the English Parliament, improved its fortifications, destroying the cathedral&#x27;s nave to obtain the stone to rebuild the castle. Carlisle continued to remain a barracks thereafter. In 1698 travel writer Celia Fiennes wrote of Carlisle as having most of the trappings of a military town and that it was rife with alcohol and prostitutes.

In 1707 an act of union was passed between England and Scotland, creating Great Britain, but Carlisle remained a garrison town. The tenth, and most recent siege in the city&#x27;s history took place after Charles Edward Stuart took Carlisle in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. When the Jacobites retreated across the border to Scotland they left a garrison of 400 men in Carlisle Castle. Ten days later Prince William, Duke of Cumberland took the castle and executed 31 Jacobites on the streets of Carlisle.

===Industrial Revolution===

Although Carlisle continued to garrison soldiers, becoming the headquarters of the Border Regiment, the city&#x27;s importance as a military town decreased as the industrial age took over. The post of Governor of Carlisle as garrison commander was abolished in 1838.

In the early 19th century textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers built factories in the city mostly in the Denton Holme, Caldewgate and Wapping suburbs in the Caldew Valley. These included Carr&#x27;s of Carlisle, Kangol, Metal Box and Cowans Sheldon. Shaddon Mill, in Denton Holme, became famous for having the world&#x27;s 8th tallest chimney and was the largest cotton mill in England.

The expanding industries brought about an increase in population as jobs shifted from rural farms towards the cities. This produced a housing shortage where at one point 25,000 people in the city only had 5,000 houses to live in. People were said to be herded together with animal houses, slaughter houses and communal lavatories with open drains running between them. Living conditions were so bad that riots were common and some people emigrated. The problem wasn&#x27;t solved until the end of the 19th century when mass housing was built west of the city walls.

In 1823 a canal was built to Fisher&#x27;s Cross (Port Carlisle) to transport goods produced in the city. This enabled other industrial centres such as Liverpool to link with Carlisle via the Solway. This was short-lived and when the canal operators ran into financial difficulty the waterway was filled in. A railway was built in place of the canal.

Carlisle became a major railway centre on the West Coast Main Line with connections to the east. At one time seven companies used Carlisle Citadel railway station. Before the building of the Citadel railway station the city had several other railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle had the largest railway marshalling yard in Europe, Kingmoor, which, reduced in size, is operational and used by railfreight companies.

The Strand Road drill hall opened in 1874.

===Modern history===

At the start of the 20th century, the population had grown to over 45,000. Transport was improved by the City of Carlisle Electric Tramways from 1900 until 1931, and the first cinema was built in 1906. In 1912, the boundaries of Carlisle were extended to include Botcherby in the east and Stanwix in the north.

Carlisle was subject to the decline in the textile industry experienced throughout Britain as new machinery made labour unnecessary. In 1916, during the First World War, the government took over the public houses and breweries in Carlisle because of drunkenness among construction and munitions workers from the munitions factory at Gretna. This experiment nationalised brewing. As the Carlisle Board of Control, and subsequently the Carlisle &amp; District State Management Scheme, it lasted until 1971.

During the Second World War, Carlisle hosted over 5,000 evacuees, many of whom arrived from Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding towns.

A shopping centre (including a new central library) was built to the east and north-east of the market cross and opened in 1986. The area east of the market cross had formerly been occupied by narrow alleyways of housing and small shops (on a layout which had not changed much since medieval times) and referred to locally as &quot;The Lanes&quot;. Carlisle city centre was pedestrianised in 1989.

On the evening of Friday, 7 January 2005, the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril burst their banks due to as much as 180 mm rainfall upstream that day. 2,700 homes were flooded and three people died. The city&#x27;s police and fire stations were flooded along with Brunton Park football stadium. The police, fire service and Carlisle United F.C. were mobilised, the latter as far as Morecambe. At the time of the flood, emergency services also had to respond to cases of car-related arson in the city.

==City centre==
Carlisle is the only city in Cumbria. The city centre is largely pedestrianised and the Lanes shopping centre is home to around 75 shops.

Carlisle has a compact historic centre with a castle, cathedral and semi-intact city walls, as well as other medieval buildings including the Guildhall and Tithe Barn. The Citadel towers, which until 2016 also served as offices for Cumbria County Council, were designed by Thomas Telford, with the eastern tower incorporating part of the 16th-century building. The first Citadel building was a Tudor fortification replacing the medieval Englishgate, designed by the Moravian military engineer Stefan von Haschenperg in 1541. Next to the Citadel is Carlisle railway station, designed by William Tite in the neo-Tudor style, considered by Historic England to be among the most important early railway stations in England.

==Governance==
===Historical===
Carlisle has held city status since the Middle Ages and a borough constituency or parliamentary borough for centuries, at one time returning two MPs. In 1835 it became a municipal borough which was promoted to county borough status in 1914. The city&#x27;s boundaries have changed several times since 1835, most notably between 1974 and 2023, when under the Local Government Act 1972 the city and county borough and the Border Rural District were abolished and new enlarged City of Carlisle non-metropolitan district was created within the newly formed administrative county of Cumbria.

The municipal borough contained several civil parishes or parts of parishes but these were merged into a single civil parish of Carlisle in 1904. The civil parish was abolished on 1 April 1974, although parts of the urban fringe are in the parishes of Stanwix Rural, Kingmoor and St Cuthbert Without. Carlisle unsuccessfully applied to become a Lord Mayoralty in 2002. Carlisle City Council had its headquarters at the 1960s Civic Centre in Rickergate, the tallest building in the city.

At the time of the 2001 census, the population of Carlisle was 71,773, with 100,734 living in the district. In the 2011 census, the city&#x27;s population had risen to 75,306, with 107,524 in the district.

On 1 April 2023 the City of Carlisle local government district was abolished, and the boundaries of the City of Carlisle were redefined to cover the following wards: Belah and Kingmoor, Botcherby and Harraby North, Cathedral and Castle, Currock and Upperby, Denton Holme and Morton South, Harraby South and Parklands, Newtown and Morton North, Sandsfield and Morton West and Stanwix and Houghton.

Charter trustees were formed from the councillors that cover the said areas. They act as appropriate bodies in which historic rights and privileges of Carlisle, including the mayoralty will continue until a governance review will determine the need of a city council.

===Parliament===
The current member of Parliament is Julie Minns, representing the Labour Party.

Carlisle used to be within the North West England constituency of the European Parliament.

===Former county council===

Carlisle elected 18 county councillors to the former Cumbria County Council. Its headquarters were located at Cumbria House on Botchergate.

===Former district council===

Until April 2023 Carlisle was governed by a district council, Carlisle City Council and a County Council, Cumbria County Council. After the 2019 elections the Conservative Party ran a minority administration on the district council with the support of the Independents. The district council covered a large rural area with many villages and towns including Dalston, Brampton, Longtown, Wetheral, Bewcastle and Scotby.

===Unitary authority===
Cumberland Council, the local authority for Cumberland, is a unitary authority, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. It operated as a shadow authority until taking up its powers on 1 April 2023. Cumberland Council replaced Cumbria County Council, Allerdale Borough Council, Carlisle City Council and Copeland Borough Council.

The first election to Cumberland Council was held on 5 May 2022. All 46 seats were up for election. Labour won a majority of 30 seats. Conservatives have 7 seats, Liberal Democrats 4 seats, Independents 3 seats and Green Party 2 seats. Turnout was 36.1%.

==Geography==
Carlisle is situated on a slight rise, in the Cumberland Ward, at the confluence of the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril.

An important centre for trade, it is located west of Newcastle upon Tyne, north of Lancaster, south-east of Glasgow, south of Edinburgh, north-west of York, and north-north-west of London. Nearby towns and villages include Longtown (north), Penrith (south), Brampton (east), Wigton (west), Haggbeck, Harker, Carwinley, Blackford, Houghton, Scotby, Wreay and Rockcliffe.
===Climate===
Carlisle experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). In January 2005 Carlisle was hit by strong gales and heavy rain, and on Saturday 8 January 2005 all roads into Carlisle were closed owing to severe flooding, the worst since 1822, which caused three deaths. Even worse flooding than in 2005 affected Carlisle between 4 and 6 December 2015. During this time, nearly 36 hours of incessant rainfall breached flood defences and left several areas submerged – including Bitts Park, Hardwicke Circus and Warwick Road. This left the Sands Centre (and the nearby Shell petrol station and Bitts Park), marooned from the rest of the city. As several other areas of Cumbria were also badly affected (particularly Appleby and Wigton), all trains to Scotland were postponed indefinitely, with trains on the West Coast Mainline going no further than Preston, as nearby Lancaster suffered flooding and problems with electricity supply. Prime Minister David Cameron visited the city on 7 December 2015 to assess the damage, having earlier called an emergency Cobra meeting.
===Divisions and suburbs===

In the north of Carlisle are the suburbs of Kingstown, Lowry Hill and Moorville, formerly part of the parish of Kingmoor. To the south of them are Stanwix, Edentown, Etterby, St Ann&#x27;s Hill and Belah which were added to Carlisle in 1912. The parish of Stanwix Rural exists but only includes a small part of Carlisle&#x27;s urban area, Whiteclosegate.

To the immediate south of Stanwix is the River Eden. On the opposite bank is the city centre bounded on the west by the West Coast Main Railway line and the River Caldew. In the past industry flourished on the banks of the River Caldew, especially Denton Holme and Caldewgate on the west bank and Wapping, around the former Metal Box works, on the east. West of Caldewgate and north of Denton Holme the suburbs of Newtown, Morton, Sandsfield Park, Longsowerby, Raffles and Belle Vue developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

The eastern side of the city centre developed in the 19th century into a more affluent area along the main A69 road. It links with the former village of Botcherby to which a large council estate was added in the mid-20th century and later still Durranhill Housing Estate.

South of the city centre is the Botchergate/St Nicholas area of late Victorian terraced housing similar to that found in Denton Holme and Caldewgate. The Botchergate East area until recently had older slum dwellings.

To the south west of Botchergate and St Nicholas are the former villages now suburbs of Upperby and Currock. The urban area spills over the former county borough boundary into Blackwell and Durdar in the civil parish of St Cuthbert Without.

Between Upperby and Botcherby is Harraby, a former village once part of St Cuthbert Without and the largest suburb of Carlisle. Harraby is subdivided into Harraby East, New Harraby, Harraby Green, Old Harraby, Petteril Bank and the Durranhill Industrial Estate. Adjoining Harraby to the south but outside the former borough boundary is the hamlet of Carleton.

==Transport==
===Road===
Carlisle is linked to the rest of England via the M6 motorway to the south, and to Scotland via the M74/A74 towards Glasgow and the north. Many trunk roads begin or terminate in Carlisle, including the A6 to Penrith and Luton (historically the main road to the south prior to the opening of the M6), the A595 to western Cumbria, the A69 to Newcastle upon Tyne and the A7 to Edinburgh.

===Rail===

Carlisle became a major railway centre with, at one time, seven different companies using Carlisle Citadel railway station. Prior to the building of the Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway marshaling yard in Europe, at Kingmoor, which, although reduced in size, is still operational and used by railfreight companies such as Colas Rail, DB Cargo UK, Freightliner and occasionally Direct Rail Services.

Today, Carlisle railway station is a principal station on the West Coast Main Line. Other lines branch off to Newcastle, along the Tyne Valley line; Leeds, along the Settle and Carlisle line; Glasgow Central, via Dumfries along the Glasgow South Western Line which connects Ayr and Stranraer for the Stena Line ferry to Port of Belfast or P&amp;O Ferries to Larne Harbour; and west Cumbria along the Cumbrian Coast line to Whitehaven, Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster. Services are operated by ScotRail, Avanti West Coast, Northern and TransPennine Express. Kingmoor Traction Maintenance Depot is a major facility north of Carlisle, operated by Direct Rail Services.

===Bus services===
Most local bus services in the city are operated by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire. Previously, local independent operator, Reays Coaches, operated a number of local routes, many of which were in competition with Stagecoach.

The bus station is situated on Drury Lane, off Lonsdale Street. It has seven stands, each of which are covered by a waiting shelter, as well as a travel centre.

The present station was built in the 1990s to replace a larger station that was partially on the same site and had access from Lowther Street, where the Earls Lane shopping area is now. It is owned and managed by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire. The main operators at the bus station are Stagecoach North East, Borders Buses, National Express and Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire.

===Air===
Carlisle Lake District Airport is a small regional airport located east north-east of the city. The nearest major airport is Newcastle International Airport, near the east coast, which is around away from Carlisle.

==Trade and industry==

Carlisle became an industrial city in the 19th and early 20th centuries with many textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers opening up mostly in the Denton Holme, Caldewgate and Wapping areas which lie in the Caldew Valley area of Carlisle. (One such manufacturer located in the Denton Holme area was Ferguson Printers, a large textile printing factory that had stood for many years before its closure in the early 1990s). In the early 19th century, a canal was dug connecting Caldewgate with the sea at Port Carlisle. The canal was later filled in and became a railway line.

Carlisle was served by two electricity power stations. James Street station was built by the corporation and operated from 1899 until 1927. Willow Holme power station, north west of the city, was built and operated by the corporation from 1923 until nationalisation of the industry in 1948. It was closed down in 1980 and demolished in 1988.

Famous firms that were founded or had factories in Carlisle included Carr&#x27;s of Carlisle (now part of United Biscuits), Kangol, Metal Box (now part of Crown Holdings) and Cowans Sheldon. Cowans Sheldon originated in the city in the mid 19th century and became one of the world&#x27;s most important railway and marine engineering firms, manufacturing finally ceased in Carlisle in 1987. Others include the construction firms of John Laing and Story Contracting. Pirelli Carlisle opened in 1969.

The hauliers Eddie Stobart Logistics who were founded in nearby Hesket Newmarket and were once part of the Stobart Group, had their HQ in Carlisle. Although they no longer have their HQ in Carlisle they still employ staff in the city. Robsons Border Transport Limited, J &amp; W Watt Limited and F Brown (Carlisle) Limited, all substantial road hauliers, had their HQ in Carlisle.

Until 2004, Carlisle&#x27;s biggest employer was Cavaghan &amp; Gray, which became part of Northern Foods and was subsequently acquired by 2 Sisters Food Group which operated from two sites in the Harraby area of Carlisle producing chilled foods for major supermarket chains. The London Road site closed in 2005 with the loss of almost 700 jobs as production was transferred to the nearby Eastern Way site or other factories around the UK.

There are various light industrial estates and business parks located on the fringes of Carlisle and on former industrial sites close to the city centre. The largest being the Kingstown Industrial Estate, which is located just off the A7 road near to the M6 motorway.

On 28 March 2005, Carlisle was granted Fairtrade City status.

==Education==
The University of Cumbria has four campuses in Carlisle on Fusehill Street, Brampton Road, Paternoster Row and Newcastle Street. The university provides a wide range of degree courses in higher education such as Information technology, Applied Psychology, Art, Business, Law, Media, Social Work and Teacher Education.

==Culture==

===Art and history===
The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery was opened in 1893 by the Carlisle Corporation. The museum features resident exhibits detailing the history of Roman occupancy of the region, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the Border Reivers. Tullie House, named after the Jacobean mansion in which it is located, hosts travelling exhibitions. The museum has received many awards and was expanded in 1990 and 2000.

The city&#x27;s Guildhall Museum is based in a 14th-century house and the Border Regiment Military Museum is in the castle.

===Music and theatre===
====Past====
Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, in Lowther Street, was constructed in 1874 as the Victoria Hall, and started screening films in 1897. An early music director at the turn of the century was Howard Ellis Carr. After the interior was damaged by fire in 1904, it was rebuilt to designs by architects Beadle &amp; Hope, and reopened in 1905 as Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Films and variety shows were staged, until around 1919, when it staged only live productions and plays. Robert David MacDonald was artistic director at the theatre. After being briefly renamed Municipal Theatre in the 1960s, the theatre closed in early 1963 and reopened as the Regal Bingo Club in late 1963. This closed in the 1970s and the building was demolished in 1980, replaced by a car park.

====Present====
Sands Centre Sports Hall is Carlisle&#x27;s main entertainment venue which sometimes hosts touring musicians, theatre and comedians. The West Walls Theatre is situated in the city centre, an amateur theatre. The Old Fire Station opened in 2015 after being converted into a performing arts venue, it hosts touring bands, live stand-up comedy, dramas and art exhibitions. Brunton Park stadium has hosted live music including an Elton John concert in 2007.

Carlisle Music Festival takes place in Carlisle Cathedral each year. The defunct Brampton Live, the largest folk festival in the north of England, formerly took place in Brampton. Over the weekend of 14/15 May 2011, Carlisle Lake District Airport hosted Europe&#x27;s largest free music festival, Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend. The festival&#x27;s headline acts included Lady Gaga and the Foo Fighters. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church hosts an annual series of instrumental and chamber music concerts organised by North Cumbria Recitals.

===Food===
Every August the Carlisle Food Fair is held in the pedestrianised area of the city centre. It plays host to produce from across the continent and features local produce including Cumberland sausage, Cumberland sauce, Farmhouse Cheese and Cumberland Mustard.

In 2012, &quot;Fair Food Carlisle&quot; was awarded the runner-up prize in the government&#x27;s &quot;Buy Better Together Challenge&quot; competition. The &quot;Buy Better Together Challenge&quot; was launched by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to work together to negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The challenge received 110 entries and to seven finalists were selected. The &quot;Fair Food Carlisle&quot; scheme uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses.

===Media===

From 1961 to 2009, Carlisle was home to Border Television which served Cumbria, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and parts of Northumberland.

Initially based at studios in the Harraby area of the city, the station was controversially merged with ITV Tyne Tees in 2009 as part of wide-ranging cutbacks to ITV&#x27;s regional output.

As of 2009, ITV Border&#x27;s news and sales operations are based at offices in the north of the city, although production of its nightly news programme, &quot;Lookaround&quot;, is based at Tyne Tees&#x27; Gateshead studios.

As of 2014, ITV Border is again producing a full regional news service, along with two hours a week of current affairs and features programming, aimed specifically at southern Scotland.

On BBC One, the city is served by the regional programme, &quot;BBC Look North&quot;. 

Television signals are received from the Caldbeck TV transmitter.

&quot;The Cumberland News&quot; is the local broadsheet paper published on Fridays. The &quot;News and Star&quot; is the evening paper. Both are published by Carlisle-based CN Group. Carlisle is home to BBC Radio Cumbria, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland and Hospital Radio Echo, which was established in 1965 and is the hospital radio station to Cumberland Infirmary, 24 hours a day.

==Sport==
===Football===

====Association====

Carlisle is represented in English football by Carlisle United, who currently play in the fourth tier of English football after being relegated to Football League Two in 2024. The club has played at Brunton Park on Warwick Road (A69) since 1909. In November 2011 plans were unveiled for the club to move to a 12,000-seat stadium in Kingmoor Park.

The club&#x27;s first Football League tenure began in 1928 when it was elected to the northern section of the Football League Third Division, replacing Durham City. Its past achievements include reaching the Football League Cup semi-finals (its best run in either of the two domestic cups) in 1969, and winning promotion to the top flight (then the Football League First Division) in 1974. The club topped the English league after winning its first three games of the 1974-75 season, but failed to keep up its good form and was relegated after just one season. In 1987 the club returned to the Football League Fourth Division, and in 2004 was relegated to the Football Conference – the first former top division club to do so – only to regain their Football League place after one year. In 1999, Carlisle United escaped relegation from the Football League on the final day of the season when on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass scored an injury time winner against Plymouth Argyle. The 2–1 win meant that Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference.

Though Carlisle United has rarely attracted the national football headlines, the club has fielded high-profile players. Some have achieved fame at bigger clubs after spending their early careers at the club. These include Peter Beardsley, Stan Bowles, Steve Harkness, Matt Jansen and Rory Delap. Many older players spent their later years at Carlisle United after playing for bigger clubs. These include Michael Bridges, Mervyn Day, Kevin Gray and David McCreery. Former managers include Bill Shankly, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Harry Gregg, Mick Wadsworth, Nigel Pearson and Paul Simpson. Since Workington was voted out of the Football League in 1977, Carlisle United were the only Cumbrian team to play senior football until Barrow A.F.C. rejoined the EFL in 2020.

Celtic Nation F.C. was a Carlisle-based semi-professional club who played in the Northern Football League Division One. They folded in April 2015 after a season of financial problems. Nation started out in 2004 as Gillford Park F.C. and played in the Northern Football Alliance league and won four promotions in 8 years. In 2012 Scottish millionaire Frank Lynch who is based in America, started putting money into the club and changed its name to Celtic Nation. After two years, Lynch withdrew his financial support and the club struggled before folding.

Carlisle City are a semi professional side who play in the Northern Football League. After spending 40 years in the Northern Football Alliance league, they were promoted to the North West Counties Football League in 2016, before being switched to their current league (at the same level) in 2019. They play at Gillford Park after taking over the lease from Celtic Nation in the summer of 2015.

Northbank Carlisle was a club which played its football in the Northern Football Alliance Premier Division. After forty years, the club decided to fold its senior team. Northbank still operates as a youth academy.

====Rugby codes====
Carlisle has two rugby union clubs: Carlisle RFC and Creighton RUFC. Carlisle RFC play at Warwick Road, alongside Carlisle United Football Club. Creighton RUFC originally played near Cumberland Infirmary but sold its ground to housing development company Story Homes in 2004 in exchange for new facilities off Cumwhinton Road, near Junction 42 of the M6. Former England rugby union captain Steve Borthwick is a native of Carlisle.

The rugby league team, Carlisle merged with Barrow and left Carlisle. Amateur rugby league club, Carlisle Centurions played in the National Division of the Rugby League Conference until they withdrew in 2010.

====Gridiron====
Carlisle Border Reivers were an American football team that played in Division 2 North until they folded in 2013. They rebranded as the Carlisle Kestrels in 2019, the team&#x27;s original name. They play at Gillford Park.

===Racing===
In 1904, Carlisle Racecourse was established to the south of the city, it is now a first-class racecourse. Horse racing has been held in Carlisle for centuries before the racecourse was formally established.

Three greyhound racing venues existed in Carlisle during the late 1920s. All three were independent (not affiliated to the sport&#x27;s governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and were known as a flapping tracks, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The first was located at Gillford Park (home of the Carlisle Centurions RL and more recently Celtic Nation F.C.). The second was on pasture land in the former village of Harraby and was conducted by the Carlisle and Cumberland Greyhound Racing Sports Ltd. The third was north west of Carlisle on the Sheepmount playing fields and more recently the athletics track.

===Other sport===
Carlisle Cricket Club and Cumbria County Cricket Club play at the Edenside Ground north of the city centre. Cumberland is classed as a minor county by the ECB. The club has won the &quot;Minor Counties Championship&quot; twice. The remains of a Roman bathhouse associated with the Roman fort of Petriana have been excavated at the site.

Carlisle has several golf clubs, including Stoneyholme within the city, and Carlisle Golf Club which hosts regional qualifying to the Open Championship.

In 2012, Carlisle was one of the official stop-off points for the Olympic torch before it made its way down to the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London&#x27;s Olympic Stadium.

==Armed forces==

As a frontier town for over a millennium and a half, Carlisle is a military city. It is the most besieged place in the British Isles, having been besieged at least ten times, and has garrisoned troops for most of its history. Cumbria&#x27;s County regiment, the Border Regiment made its headquarters at Carlisle Castle. The regiment was amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) to become the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and subsequently the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment where its lineage continues. From 1720 to 1959, the regiment fought in many campaigns, including the French and Indian War, the Battle of Culloden, the First World War and the Second World War.

===RAF Carlisle===

RAF Carlisle also known as 14 MU was located at Kingstown near the present-day Asda. The station closed in 1996 after nearly sixty years in a variety of roles. First established as RAF Kingstown in 1938, it was originally a bomber station, then one of the RAF&#x27;s Elementary Flying Training Schools and latterly a post-war storage facility.

===RAF Spadeadam===

The largest RAF station by area in the country and one of only two electronic warfare ranges in Europe, RAF Spadeadam is located outside the City of Carlisle but maintains strong links with the local community; in 2018, it was awarded the Freedom of the City of Carlisle.

===Royal Observer Corps, Carlisle Group===
During the Second World War the air raid warning organisation No 32 Group Carlisle Royal Observer Corps operated in the city centre controlled from RAF Kingstown. The association with Kingstown developed further in 1962 when the ROC ceased its aircraft spotting role for the RAF and took on a new role plotting nuclear explosions and warning the public of radioactive fallout for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO). A new administration building and a protected, hardened Nuclear Reporting bunker was built at RAF Carlisle. The nuclear bunker was a standard above-ground structure and both the bunker and headquarters hutting were on a separate site at Crindledyke outside the main gates of RAF Carlisle. The Carlisle group was redesignated no 22 Group ROC.

The ROC constructed a smaller nuclear reporting post, Kingstown post (OS ref:NY 3837 5920), on the main RAF Carlisle site. The post was an underground protected bunker for a crew of three observers. The headquarters bunker accommodated an operational crew of around 100 with dormitory and canteen facilities an operations room and life support plant.

The Royal Observer Corps was stood down and its parent organisation the UKWMO was disbanded in December 1995 after the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence. The ROC buildings were demolished in 1996 and replaced by a cellphone communications mast. The foundations of the nuclear bunker can still be partially seen outlined in the concreted yard, which also contains the Air Training Corps hut during recent further development of the site.

==Legend and folklore==
=== Arthurian legend ===

There are many legends and folkloric stories about the city during the Dark Ages, such as the &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;, about the nephew of King Arthur and the &quot;free man&quot; of the city.

In a 14th-century poem, legend has it that Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table, stayed at the Castle of Carlisle while on a hunting expedition in the haunted Inglewood Forest. He then slept with the Carle&#x27;s wife and killed him. This poem has strong parallels with another 14th century poem about Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The story has since been re-adapted many times, most recently in films from 1973, 1984 and 2021.

By some accounts, Carlisle is also none other than Camelot, the mythical seat of King Arthur&#x27;s court.

=== Curse of Carlisle ===
In local folklore, the &quot;Curse of Carlisle&quot; is a 16th-century curse that is said to have been invoked by Archbishop Dunbar of Glasgow in 1525 upon cross-border families, known as the Border Reivers, who lived by stealing cattle and pillaging. For the millennium celebrations, the local council commissioned a 14-tonne granite artwork inscribed with all 1,069 words of the curse. Following the installation of the stone, Carlisle suffered floods, foot-and-mouth disease, job losses and a &quot;goal famine&quot; for the football team. In response to this, the city council considered removing the stone; however, Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled &quot;high priest of the British white witches&quot;, proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: &quot;A curse can only work if people believe in it. I think at the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse.&quot;

<text>The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein. It is based on Margaret Landon&#x27;s novel &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical&#x27;s plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher who is hired as part of the King&#x27;s drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway&#x27;s St. James Theatre. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals.

In 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence. Holtzmann realized that Landon&#x27;s book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical. The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon&#x27;s book, but he was unavailable. They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner.

The musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner). Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances. A hit West End London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with the 1956 film for which Brynner won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the musical was recorded several times. In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death.

Christopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the Tony Award for Best Revival, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of &quot;The King and I&quot; continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world.

== Historical background ==
Mongkut, King of Siam, was about 57 years old in 1861. He had lived half his life as a Buddhist monk, was an able scholar, and founded a new order of Buddhism and a temple in Bangkok (paid for by his half-brother, King Nangklao). Through his decades of devotion, Mongkut acquired an ascetic lifestyle and a firm grasp of Western languages. When Nangklao died in 1850, Mongkut became king. At that time, various European countries were striving for dominance, and American traders sought greater influence in Southeast Asia. He ultimately succeeded in keeping Siam an independent nation, partly by familiarizing his heirs and harem with Western ways.

In 1861, Mongkut wrote to his Singapore agent, Tan Kim Ching, asking him to find a British lady to be governess to the royal children. At the time, the British community in Singapore was small, and the choice fell on a recent arrival there, Anna Leonowens (1831–1915), who was running a small nursery school in the colony. Leonowens was the Anglo-Indian daughter of an Indian Army soldier and the widow of Thomas Owens, a clerk and hotel keeper. She had arrived in Singapore two years previously, claiming to be the genteel widow of an officer and explaining her dark complexion by stating that she was Welsh by birth. Her deception was not detected until long after her death, and had still not come to light when &quot;The King and I&quot; was written.

Upon receiving the King&#x27;s invitation, Leonowens sent her daughter, Avis, to school in England, to give Avis the social advantage of a prestigious British education, and traveled to Bangkok with her five-year-old son, Louis. King Mongkut had sought a Briton to teach his children and wives after trying local missionaries, who used the opportunity to proselytize. Leonowens initially asked for $150 in Singapore currency per month. Her additional request, to live in or near the missionary community to ensure she was not deprived of Western company, aroused suspicion in Mongkut, who cautioned in a letter, &quot;we need not have teacher of Christianity as they are abundant here&quot;. King Mongkut and Leonowens came to an agreement: $100 per month and a residence near the royal palace. At a time when most transport in Bangkok was by boat, Mongkut did not wish to have to arrange for the teacher to get to work every day. Leonowens and Louis temporarily lived as guests of Mongkut&#x27;s prime minister, and after the first house offered was found to be unsuitable, the family moved into a brick residence (wooden structures decayed quickly in Bangkok&#x27;s climate) within walking distance of the palace.

In 1867, Leonowens took a six-month leave of absence to visit her daughter Avis in England, intending to deposit Louis at a school in Ireland and return to Siam with Avis. However, due to unexpected delays and opportunities for further travel, Leonowens was still abroad in late 1868, when Mongkut fell ill and died. Leonowens did not return to Siam, although she continued to correspond with her former pupil, the new king Chulalongkorn.

== Creation ==
In 1950, British actress Gertrude Lawrence&#x27;s business manager and attorney, Fanny Holtzmann, was looking for a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon novel &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (a fictionalized version of Leonowens&#x27; experiences) was sent to her by Landon&#x27;s agent. According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Holtzmann was worried that Lawrence&#x27;s career was fading. The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; closed in 1943. Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; would be ideal for her client, who purchased the rights to adapt the novel for the stage.

Holtzmann initially wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but he declined. She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar&#x27;s wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, and asked her to see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in &quot;André Charlot&#x27;s London Revue of 1924&quot; on Broadway and on tour in North America.
Rodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon&#x27;s novel as a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. It consists of vignettes of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them. Rodgers and Hammerstein could see no coherent story from which a musical could be made until they saw the 1946 film adaptation, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, and how the screenplay united the episodes in the novel. Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. Lawrence&#x27;s voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. Lawrence&#x27;s temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior. In spite of this, they admired her acting – what Hammerstein called her &quot;magic light&quot;, a compelling presence on stage – and agreed to write the show. For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star&#x27;s usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control in the hands of the two authors.

Hammerstein found his &quot;door in&quot; to the play in Landon&#x27;s account of a slave in Siam writing about Abraham Lincoln. This would eventually become the narrated dance, &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot;. Since a frank expression of romantic feelings between the King and Anna would be inappropriate in view of both parties&#x27; upbringing and prevailing social mores, Hammerstein wrote love scenes for a secondary couple, Tuptim, a junior wife of the King, and Lun Tha, a scholar. In the Landon work, the relationship is between Tuptim and a priest, and is not romantic. The musical&#x27;s most radical change from the novel was to have the King die at the end of the musical. Also, since Lawrence was not primarily a singer, the secondary couple gave Rodgers a chance to write his usual &quot;soaring&quot; romantic melodies. In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hammerstein indicated that he wrote the first scene before leaving for London and the West End production of &quot;Carousel&quot; in mid-1950; he wrote a second scene while there.

The pair had to overcome the challenge of how to represent Thai speech and music. Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with Lorenz Hart titled &quot;Chee-chee&quot;, did not wish to use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using open fifths and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears. Hammerstein faced the problem of how to represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. For the King&#x27;s style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic way of talking, which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. The forceful style reflected the King&#x27;s personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, &quot;A Puzzlement&quot;. Many of the King&#x27;s lines, including his first utterance, &quot;Who? Who? Who?&quot;, and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon&#x27;s version. Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.

With Rodgers laid up with back trouble, Hammerstein completed most of the musical&#x27;s book before many songs were set to music. Early on, Hammerstein contacted set designer Jo Mielziner and costume designer Irene Sharaff and asked them to begin work in coordination with each other. Sharaff communicated with Jim Thompson, an American who had revived the Thai silk industry after World War II. Thompson sent Sharaff samples of silk cloth from Thailand and pictures of local dress from the mid-19th century. One such picture, of a Thai woman in western dress, inspired the song &quot;Western People Funny&quot;, sung by the King&#x27;s chief wife, Lady Thiang, while dressed in western garb.
Producer Leland Hayward, who had worked with the duo on &quot;South Pacific&quot;, approached Jerome Robbins to choreograph a ballet for &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot;. Robbins was very enthusiastic about the project and asked to choreograph the other musical numbers as well, although Rodgers and Hammerstein had originally planned little other dancing. Robbins staged &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot; as an intimate performance, rather than a large production number. His choreography for the parade of the King&#x27;s children to meet their teacher (&quot;March of the Royal Siamese Children&quot;) drew great acclaim. Robert Russell Bennett provided the orchestrations, and Trude Rittmann arranged the ballet music.

The pair discussed having an Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King&#x27;s wives. The lyrics for that scene proved to be very difficult for Hammerstein to write. He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as &quot;I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay&quot; and &quot;The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey).&quot; Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna&#x27;s relationship with the King. &quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot;, the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, and at the end of the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on &quot;South Pacific&quot;, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.

== Casting and auditions ==

Although the part of the King was only a supporting role to Lawrence&#x27;s Anna, Hammerstein and Rodgers thought it essential that a well-known theatrical actor play it. The obvious choice was Rex Harrison, who had played the King in the movie, but he was booked, as was Noël Coward. Alfred Drake, the original Curly in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, made contractual demands which were deemed too high. With time running short before rehearsals, finding an actor to play the King became a major concern. Mary Martin, the original Nellie Forbush in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, suggested that her co-star in a 1946 musical set in China, &quot;Lute Song&quot;, try for the role. Rodgers recounted the audition of the Russian-American performer, Yul Brynner:
Brynner termed Rodgers&#x27; account &quot;very picturesque, but totally inaccurate&quot;. He recalled that as an established television director (in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Starlight Theatre&quot;, for example), he was reluctant to go back on the stage. His wife, his agent and Martin finally convinced him to read Hammerstein&#x27;s working script, and once he did, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to do the project. In any case, Brynner&#x27;s fierce, mercurial, dangerous, yet surprisingly sensitive King was an ideal foil for Lawrence&#x27;s strong-willed, yet vulnerable Anna, and when the two finally came together in &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, where the King hesitantly touches Anna&#x27;s waist, the chemistry was palpable.
Pre-rehearsal preparations began in late 1950. Hammerstein had wanted Logan to direct and co-write the book, as he had for &quot;South Pacific&quot;, but when Logan declined, Hammerstein decided to write the entire book himself. Instead of Logan, the duo hired as director John van Druten, who had worked with Lawrence years earlier. The costume designer, Sharaff, wryly pointed the press to the incongruity of a Victorian British governess in the midst of an exotic court: &quot;The first-act finale of &quot;The King and I&quot; will feature Miss Lawrence, Mr. Brynner, and a pink satin ball gown.&quot; Mielziner&#x27;s set plan was the simplest of the four Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals he had worked on, with one main set (the throne room), a number of front-stage drops (for the ship and Anna&#x27;s room, for example) and the entire stage cleared for &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot;.

The show was budgeted at $250,000 (US$ in dollars) making it the most expensive Rodgers and Hammerstein production to that point, and prompting some mockery that costs exceeded even their expensive flop &quot;Allegro&quot;. Investors included Hammerstein, Rodgers, Logan, Martin, Billy Rose and Hayward. The children who were cast as the young princes and princesses came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, including Puerto Rican or Italian, though none were Thai. Johnny Stewart was the original Prince Chulalongkorn but left the cast after only three months, replaced by Ronnie Lee. Sandy Kennedy was Louis, and Broadway veteran Larry Douglas played Lun Tha.

Shortly before rehearsals began in January 1951, Rodgers had the first Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, including Lawrence&#x27;s own songs. Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer&#x27;s actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. Hammerstein and Rodgers&#x27; doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. James Poling, a writer for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing &quot;Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?&quot;:
At his first meeting with Sharaff, Brynner, who had only a fringe of hair, asked what he was to do about it. When told he was to shave it, Brynner was horror-struck and refused, convinced he would look terrible. He finally gave in during tryouts and put dark makeup on his shaved head. The effect was so well-received that it became Brynner&#x27;s trademark.

Lawrence&#x27;s health caused her to miss several rehearsals, though no one knew what was wrong with her. When the tryout opened in New Haven, Connecticut on February 27, 1951, the show was nearly four hours long. Lawrence, suffering from laryngitis, had missed the dress rehearsal but managed to make it through the first public performance. The &quot;Variety&quot; critic noted that despite her recent illness she &quot;slinks, acts, cavorts, and in general exhibits exceedingly well her several facets for entertaining&quot;, but the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; printed that her &quot;already thin voice is now starting to wear a great deal thinner&quot;. Leland Hayward came to see the show in New Haven and shocked Rodgers by advising him to close it before it went any further. Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45 minutes too long. Gemze de Lappe, who was one of the dancers, recalled one cut that she regretted:

This song, &quot;Waiting&quot;, was a trio for Anna, the King, and the Kralahome (the King&#x27;s prime minister). &quot;Who Would Refuse?&quot;, the Kralahome&#x27;s only solo, was also dropped. Left without a note to sing, Mervyn Vye abandoned the show and was replaced by John Juliano. &quot;Now You Leave&quot;, a song for Lady Thiang (played by Dorothy Sarnoff in the original production), was also cut. After the cuts, Rodgers and Hammerstein felt that the first act was lacking something. Lawrence suggested that they write a song for Anna and the children. Mary Martin reminded them of a song that had been cut from &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Suddenly Lucky&quot;. Hammerstein wrote a new lyric for the melody, and the resulting song became &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;. &quot;Western People Funny&quot; and &quot;I Have Dreamed&quot; were also added in Boston.

Brynner regretted that there were not more tryout performances, feeling that the schedule did not give him an adequate opportunity to develop the complex role of the King. When he told this to Hammerstein and Rodgers, they asked what sort of performance they would get from him, and he responded, &quot;It will be good enough, it will get the reviews.&quot;

== Plot ==

=== Act 1 ===
In 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, arrives in Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his many children. Anna&#x27;s young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King&#x27;s prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna refuses to be intimidated (&quot;I Whistle a Happy Tune&quot;). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are expected to live – a violation of Anna&#x27;s contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house. She considers returning to Singapore aboard the vessel that brought them, but goes with her son and the Kralahome.
Several weeks pass, during which Anna and Louis are confined to their palace rooms. The King receives a gift from the king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives. She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart (&quot;My Lord and Master&quot;). The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this. She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives. They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom (&quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot;). The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well. The princes and princesses enter in procession (&quot;March of the Royal Siamese Children&quot;). Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.

Anna has not given up on the house, and teaches the children proverbs and songs extolling the virtues of home life, to the King&#x27;s irritation. The King has enough worries without battling the schoolteacher, and wonders why the world has become so complicated (&quot;A Puzzlement&quot;). The children and wives are hard at work learning English (&quot;The Royal Bangkok Academy&quot;). The children are surprised by a map showing how small Siam is compared with the rest of the world (&quot;Getting to Know You&quot;). As the crown prince, Chulalongkorn, disputes the map, the King enters a chaotic schoolroom. He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about &quot;home&quot;. Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children. The King orders her to obey as &quot;my servant&quot;; she repudiates the term and hurries away. The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action. Meanwhile, Lun Tha comes upon Tuptim, and they muse about having to hide their relationship (&quot;We Kiss in a Shadow&quot;).
In her room, Anna replays the confrontation in her mind, her anger building (&quot;Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?&quot;). Lady Thiang, the King&#x27;s head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged to take over Siam as a protectorate. Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support (&quot;Something Wonderful&quot;). Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. Anna &quot;guesses&quot; – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, that can be presented to the guests. News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house &quot;as provided in agreement, etc., etc.&quot;

=== Act 2 ===

The wives are dressed in their new European-style gowns, which they find confining (&quot;Western People Funny&quot;). In the rush to prepare, the question of undergarments has been overlooked, and the wives have practically nothing on underneath their gowns. When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the &quot;evil eye&quot; and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna&#x27;s, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.

As final preparations for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she should be ready to leave after the performance (&quot;I Have Dreamed&quot;). Anna encounters them, and they confide in her (&quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot;, reprise). The play (&quot;Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot;, narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party. The anti-slavery message is blunt.
After the play, Sir Edward reveals that the British threat has receded, but the King is distracted by his displeasure at Tuptim&#x27;s rebellious message. After Sir Edward leaves, Anna and the King express their delight at how well the evening went, and he presents her with a ring. Secret police report that Tuptim is missing. The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care, as Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries to explain to him the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance (&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;). He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna&#x27;s gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her. Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.

Several months pass with no contact between Anna and the King. Anna is packed and ready to board a ship leaving Siam. Chulalongkorn arrives with a letter from the King, who has been unable to resolve the conflicts within himself and is dying. Anna hurries to the King&#x27;s bedside and they reconcile. The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn. The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King. The prince orders the end of the custom of kowtowing that Anna hated. The King grudgingly accepts this decision. As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies. Anna kneels by the late King, holding his hand and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.

=== Original productions ===

&quot;The King and I&quot; opened on Broadway on March 29, 1951, with a wide expectation of a hit by the press and public. Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether it was better than &quot;South Pacific&quot;. Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the St. James Theatre. Margaret Landon, author of the book on which the musical was based, was not invited to opening night.

Brynner turned in an outstanding performance that night, nearly stealing the show. Lawrence knew that the company was nervous because of her illnesses. The director, John van Druten, described how her opening night performance put all worries to rest: &quot;She came on the stage with a new and dazzling quality, as if an extra power had been granted to the brilliance of her stage light. She was radiant and wonderful.&quot; The rave reviews in the newspapers lifted Lawrence&#x27;s spirits, and she expected a lengthy run as Anna, first on Broadway, then in London&#x27;s West End, and finally on film. Lawrence won a Tony Award for her leading role, while Brynner won the award for best featured actor. The show won the Tony for best musical, and designers Mielziner and Sharaff received awards in their categories.

De Lappe remembered the contrast between Lawrence&#x27;s indifferent singing voice and the force of her performance:
====Lawrence&#x27;s death and aftermath====
Lawrence had not yet discovered that she was nearing death from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing while walking or dancing a total of during a 3 hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence found it hard to bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Her understudy, Constance Carpenter, began to replace her in matinees. Later in the year Lawrence&#x27;s strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence&#x27;s performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that &quot;eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500 people&quot;. On August 16, 1952, she fainted following a matinee performance and was admitted to the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, at the age of 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of &quot;The King and I&quot; was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed in her honor, and she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.

Carpenter assumed the role of Anna and went on to play it for 620 performances. Other Annas during the run included Holm, Annamary Dickey and Patricia Morison. Although Brynner later boasted of never missing a show, he missed several, once when stagehands at the St. James Theatre accidentally struck him in the nose with a piece of scenery, another time due to appendicitis. Also, for three months in 1952 (and occasionally in 1953), Alfred Drake replaced Brynner. One young actor, Sal Mineo, began as an extra, then became an understudy for a younger prince, then an understudy and later a replacement for Crown Prince Chulalongkorn. Mineo began a close friendship and working relationship with Brynner which would last for more than a decade. Another replacement was Terry Saunders as Lady Thiang. She reprised the role in the 1956 film. The last of the production&#x27;s 1,246 performances was on March 20, 1954. The run was, at the time, the fourth longest ever for a Broadway musical. A U.S. national tour began on March 22, 1954, at the Community Theatre, Hershey, Pennsylvania, starring Brynner and Morison. The tour played in 30 cities, closing on December 17, 1955, at the Shubert Theatre, Philadelphia.

The original London production opened on October 8, 1953, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was warmly received by both audiences and critics; it ran for 946 performances. The show was restaged by Jerome Whyte. The cast featured Valerie Hobson, in her last role, as Anna; Herbert Lom as the King; and Muriel Smith as Lady Thiang. Martin Benson played the Kralahome, a role he reprised in the film. Eve Lister was a replacement for Hobson, and George Pastell replaced Lom during the long run. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre columnist Brooks Atkinson saw the production with Lister and Pastell, and thought the cast commonplace, except for Smith, whom he praised both for her acting and her voice. Atkinson commented, &quot;&quot;The King and I&quot; is a beautifully written musical drama on a high plane of human thinking. It can survive in a mediocre performance.&quot;

The musical was soon premiered in Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe.

=== Early revivals ===

The first revival of &quot;The King and I&quot; in New York was presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company in April and May 1956 for three weeks, starring Jan Clayton and Zachary Scott, directed by John Fearnley, with Robbins&#x27; choreography recreated by June Graham. Muriel Smith reprised her London role of Lady Thiang, and Patrick Adiarte repeated his film role, Chulalongkorn. This company presented the musical again in May 1960 with Barbara Cook and Farley Granger, again directed by Fearnley, in another three-week engagement. Atkinson admired the purity of Cook&#x27;s voice and thought that she portrayed Anna with &quot;a cool dignity that gives a little more stature to the part than it has had before.&quot; He noted that Granger brought &quot;a fresh point of view – as well as a full head of hair&quot;. Joy Clements played Tuptim, and Anita Darian was Lady Thiang. City Center again presented the show in June 1963, starring Eileen Brennan and Manolo Fabregas, directed by Fearnley. Clements and Darian reprised Tuptim and Thiang respectively. In the final City Center Light Opera production, Michael Kermoyan played the King opposite Constance Towers for three weeks in May 1968. Darian again played Lady Thiang. For all of these 1960s productions, Robbins&#x27; choreography was reproduced by Yuriko, who had played the role of Eliza in the original Broadway production and reprised the role in the City Center productions.

The Music Theatre of Lincoln Center, with Rodgers as producer, presented the musical in mid-1964 at the New York State Theater, starring Risë Stevens and Darren McGavin, with Michael Kermoyan as the Kralahome. Lun Tha, Tuptim and Thiang were played by Frank Porretta, Lee Venora and Patricia Neway. Costumes were by Irene Sharaff, the designer for the original productions and the film adaptation. The director was Edward Greenberg, with the Robbins choreography again reproduced by Yuriko. This was Music Theatre&#x27;s debut production, a five-week limited engagement.

&quot;The King and I&quot; was revived at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre on October 10, 1973, running for 260 performances until May 25, 1974, starring Sally Ann Howes as Anna and Peter Wyngarde as the King. Roger Redfarn directed, and Sheila O&#x27;Neill choreographed. The production, which began in June 1973 with a tour of the English provinces, earned mixed to warm reviews. Michael Billington in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the revival &quot;well played and well sung&quot;. Although he was enthusiastic about Howes as Anna, Billington thought Wyngarde &quot;too fragile to be capable of inspiring unholy terror&quot;. He praised Redfarn&#x27;s production – &quot;whipped along at a good pace and made a sumptuous eyeful out of the interpolated ballet on &#x27;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&#x27;.&quot; Less favorably, Robert Cushman in &quot;The Observer&quot; thought the production &quot;scenically and economically under-nourished&quot;. He liked Wyngarde&#x27;s King (&quot;a dignified clown&quot;) but thought Howes not formidable enough to stand up to him as Anna. He noted that &quot;she sings beautifully and the songs are the evening&#x27;s real justification&quot;.

=== Brynner reprises the role ===

In early 1976, Brynner received an offer from impresarios Lee Gruber and Shelly Gross to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from laryngitis that he lip-synched, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the orchestra pit. The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening in New York at the Uris Theatre (today the Gershwin Theatre) on May 2, 1977. The production featured Martin Vidnovic as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated. Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography. Sharaff again designed costumes, and Michael Kermoyan reprised the role of the Kralahome, while June Angela was Tuptim. The run lasted 696 performances, almost two years, during which each of the stars took off three weeks, with Angela Lansbury replacing Towers and Kermoyan replacing Brynner. The production was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical.

Brynner insisted on renovations to the Uris before he would play there, stating that the theatre resembled &quot;a public toilet&quot;. He also insisted that dressing rooms on the tour and at the Uris be arranged to his satisfaction. According to his biographer Michelangelo Capua, for years afterwards, performers thanked Brynner for having backstage facilities across the country cleaned up. &quot; New York Times&quot; reviewer Clive Barnes said of the revival, &quot;The cast is a good one. Mr. Brynner grinning fire and snorting charm is as near to the original as makes little difference&quot; and called Towers &quot;piquantly ladylike and sweet without being dangerously saccharine&quot;. However, fellow &quot;Times&quot; critic Mel Gussow warned, later in the run, that &quot;to a certain extent [Brynner] was coasting on his charisma&quot;.
The tour was extended in 1979, after the New York run, still starring Brynner and Towers. The production then opened in the West End, at the London Palladium, on June 12, 1979, and was reported to have the largest advance sale in English history. Brynner stated, &quot;It is not a play, it is a happening.&quot; Virginia McKenna starred in London as Anna, winning an Olivier Award for her performance. June Angela again played Tuptim, and John Bennett was the Kralahome. It ran until September 27, 1980.

Brynner took only a few months off after the London run ended, which contributed to his third divorce; he returned to the road in early 1981 in an extended U.S. tour of the same production, which eventually ended on Broadway. Mitch Leigh produced and directed, and Robbins&#x27; choreography was reproduced by Rebecca West, who also danced the role of Simon of Legree, which she had danced at the Uris in 1977. Patricia Marand played Anna, Michael Kermoyan was again the Kralahome, Patricia Welch was Tuptim. During 1981, Kate Hunter Brown took over as Anna, continuing in the role for at least a year and a half. By 1983, Mary Beth Peil was playing Anna. On September 13, 1983, in Los Angeles, Brynner celebrated his 4,000th performance as the King; on the same day he was privately diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and the tour had to shut down for a few months while he received painful radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer saw Brynner&#x27;s &quot;absolutely last farewell tour&quot; in December 1984 and wrote of the star:
The production reached New York in January 1985, running for 191 performances at the Broadway Theatre, with Brynner, Peil, Welch and West still playing their roles. The part of Eliza was played by the leading man&#x27;s fourth wife, Kathy Lee Brynner, and newcomer Jeffrey Bryan Davis played Louis. During the run, Brynner was unable to sing &quot;A Puzzlement&quot;, due to what was announced as a throat and ear infection, but he &quot;projected bursting vitality to the top of the balcony.&quot; He received a special Tony Award for his role as the King and had come to dominate the musical to such an extent that Peil was nominated merely for a featured actress Tony as Anna. Leigh was nominated for a Tony for his direction. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich praised Brynner but was ambivalent about the production, which he called &quot;sluggish&quot;, writing that Brynner&#x27;s &quot;high points included his fond, paternalistic joshing with his brood in &#x27;The March of the Siamese Children,&#x27; his dumb-show antics while attempting to force the English schoolteacher Anna to bow, and, of course, the death scene. ... The star aside, such showmanship is too often lacking in this &quot;King and I.&quot; The last performance was a special Sunday night show, on June 30, 1985, in honor of Brynner and his 4,625th performance of the role. Brynner died less than four months later, on October 10, 1985.

From August 1989 to March 1990, Rudolf Nureyev played the King in a North American tour opposite Liz Robertson, with Kermoyan as the Kralahome, directed by Arthur Storch and with the original Robbins choreography. Reviews were uniformly critical, lamenting that Nureyev failed to embody the character, &quot;a King who stands around like a sulky teenager who didn&#x27;t ask to be invited to this party. ... Not even his one dance number ... goes well. ... Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s King [is] supposed to be a compelling personality [but Nureyev&#x27;s] bears no resemblance to the man described ... in the &quot;Something Wonderful&quot; number. The show therefore comes across as something of a charade ... with everyone pretending to be dealing with a fearsome potentate who, in fact, is displaying very little personality at all.&quot;

=== Renshaw&#x27;s production: 1991 to 2003 ===
The first major revival to break away from the original staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by Christopher Renshaw, starring Hayley Mills as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script when reshaping the piece into what he called &quot;an authentic Thai experience&quot;. The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo). The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit. Renshaw &quot;cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land&quot;, and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors. He also asked choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Jerome Robbins to create a &quot;spiritual&quot; ballet, for the King&#x27;s entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II. According to Renshaw, &quot;The reds and golds were very much inspired by what we saw at the royal palace&quot;, and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok. For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large emerald Buddha loomed over Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, &quot;The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides in the form of the elephant.&quot;

Stanley Green, in his &quot;Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre&quot;, viewed the central theme of &quot;The King and I&quot; as &quot;the importance of mutual understanding between people of differing ethnic and cultural backgrounds&quot;, but Renshaw felt the musical suffered from 1950s attitudes when &quot;Orientalism was used as an exoticism rather than a real understanding of the particular culture.&quot; He stated that his production was informed by authentic Thai cultural, aesthetic and religious ideas that he learned from visiting Thailand. A feature in &quot;Playbill&quot; commented that the production focused on the &quot;clash of ideologies and cultures, of East versus West&quot;. Theatre arts professor Eileen Blumenthal, however, called the production &quot;a &quot;King and I&quot; for the age of political correctness&quot;. While she acknowledged that the musical&#x27;s treatment of Asian cultures had come to be viewed as insensitive over the decades since its premiere, she argued that Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s script was more sensitive than most orientalist literature of its day, in that &quot;West learns from East as well as the other way around&quot;, and that, moreover, the musical&#x27;s treatment of its Asian subject is fantastical, not intended to be realistic. She concluded that the show is a documentary of &quot;who we&#x27;ve been&quot; in the West, and that &quot;The King and I&quot; should not be suppressed, because it is &quot;too good&quot;.

The production was reproduced on Broadway, opening on April 11, 1996, at the Neil Simon Theatre, starring Donna Murphy as Anna, who won a Tony Award for her performance, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the King, with Randall Duk Kim as the Kralahome, Jose Llana as Lun Tha, Joohee Choi as Tuptim and Taewon Yi Kim as Lady Thiang. Jenna Ushkowitz made her Broadway debut as one of the children. The production was nominated for eight Tony Awards, winning best revival and three others, with acting nominations for Phillips and Choi, who each won Theatre World Awards, and seven Drama Desk Awards, winning for Outstanding Revival of a Musical; Renshaw won for his direction. The production was praised for &quot;lavish ... sumptuous&quot; designs by Roger Kirk (costumes) and Brian Thomson (sets), who both won Tony and Drama Desk Awards for their work. Faith Prince played the role of Anna later in the run, followed by Marie Osmond. The revival ran on Broadway for 780 performances, and Kevin Gray replaced Phillips. The production then toured in the U.S., starring Mills and Victor Talmadge. Other Annas on this tour included Osmond, Sandy Duncan, Stefanie Powers and Maureen McGovern, who ended the tour in Chicago in June 1998.

The production opened on May 3, 2000, at the London Palladium, directed by Renshaw and choreographed by Lubovitch, and using the Kirk and Thomson designs. It reportedly took in £8 million in advance ticket sales. The cast included Elaine Paige as Anna and Jason Scott Lee as the King, with Sean Ghazi as Luan Tha and Ho Yi as the Kralahome. Lady Thiang was, again, played by Taewon Yi Kim, of whom &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Her &#x27;Something Wonderful&#x27; was just that.&quot; The show was nominated for an Olivier Award for outstanding musical. Later in the run, Lee was replaced as the King by Paul Nakauchi. The revival was generally well received. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; said: &quot;The King and I&quot; waltzed back to the West End in triumph last night.&quot; The &quot;Daily Express&quot; observed, &quot;Love it or loathe it, &quot;The King and I&quot; is an unstoppable smash.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, however, noted a lack of chemistry between the leads, commenting that &quot;there’s something not entirely right in Siam when the greatest applause is reserved for Lady Thiang&quot;. Replacements included Josie Lawrence as Anna, Keo Woolford as the King and Saeed Jaffrey as the Kralahome. The show closed on January 5, 2002. It toured the UK in 2002 and 2003, with Stefanie Powers and then Marti Webb as Anna and Ronobir Lahiri as the King.

=== 2004 to present ===
Another U.S. national tour began in mid-2004, directed by Baayork Lee (who appeared in the original production at age 5), with choreography by Susan Kikuchi, reproducing the Robbins original. Sandy Duncan again starred as Anna, while Martin Vidnovic played the King. He had played Lun Tha in the 1977 Broadway production and voiced the King in the 1999 animated film. Stefanie Powers took over for Duncan throughout 2005. Near the end of the tour in November 2005, &quot;Variety&quot; judged that Lee had successfully &quot;harnessed the show&#x27;s physical beauty and its intrinsic exotic flavor.&quot;

Jeremy Sams directed, and Kikuchi choreographed, a limited engagement of the musical in June 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. It starred Maria Friedman and Daniel Dae Kim. A U.K. national tour starred Ramon Tikaram as the King and Josefina Gabrielle as Anna, directed by Paul Kerryson, with choreography by David Needham. It opened in December 2011 in Edinburgh and continued into May 2012. In June 2014, Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris presented an English-language production of &quot;The King and I&quot; directed by Lee Blakeley and choreographed by Peggy Hickey, with sets by Jean-Marc Puissant, costumes by Sue Blane and lighting by Rick Fisher, starring Susan Graham as Anna, Lambert Wilson as the King and Lisa Milne as Lady Thiang. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a grand new staging that has set French critics searching for superlatives.&quot; In April 2016, this production transferred to Lyric Opera of Chicago featuring Kate Baldwin as Anna, Paolo Montalban as the King and Ali Ewoldt and was enthusiastically received by the critics.

The Renshaw production was revived again in April 2014 by Opera Australia for performances in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, directed by Renshaw and featuring Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes. Some critics questioned anew the portrayal of the Siamese court as barbaric and asked why a show where &quot;the laughs come from the Thai people mis-understanding British ... culture&quot; should be selected for revival.

A fourth Broadway revival began previews on March 12 and opened on April 16, 2015, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. The production was directed by Bartlett Sher and starred Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Anna and Ken Watanabe, as the King, in his American stage debut. It featured Ruthie Ann Miles as Lady Thiang, Paul Nakauchi as the Kralahome, Ashley Park as Tuptim, Conrad Ricamora as Lun Tha, Jake Lucas as Louis Leonowens, and Edward Baker-Duly as Sir Edward Ramsey. Choreography by Christopher Gattelli was based on the original Jerome Robbins dances. The designers included Michael Yeargan (sets), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting). Reviews were uniformly glowing, with Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it a &quot;resplendent production&quot;, praising the cast (especially O&#x27;Hara), direction, choreographer, designs and orchestra, and commenting that Sher &quot;sheds a light [on the vintage material] that isn&#x27;t harsh or misty but clarifying [and] balances epic sweep with intimate sensibility.&quot; The production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Leading Actress (for O&#x27;Hara), Best Featured Actress (for Miles) and best costume design (for Zuber), and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. Replacements for the King included Jose Llana Hoon Lee and Daniel Dae Kim. Replacements for Anna included Marin Mazzie. The revival closed on June 26, 2016, after 538 performances. A U.S. national tour of the production began in November 2016. The cast included Laura Michelle Kelly as Anna, Llana as the King and Joan Almedilla as Lady Thiang. The production was reproduced at the London Palladium from June through September 2018. O&#x27;Hara and Watanabe reprised their roles, with Naoko Mori and Ruthie Ann Miles sharing the role of Lady Thiang, Na-Young Jeon as Tuptim, Dean John-Wilson as Lun Tha and Takao Osawa as the Kralahome. It was nominated for 6 Olivier Awards, including Best Musical Revival. The production was filmed and shown in theatres in late 2018.

A tour of the Lincoln Center production began in February 2023 in the U.K. and Ireland, directed by Sher, choreographed by Gattelli and starring Darren Lee as the King and Helen George as Anna. The cast also features Dean John-Wilson as Lun Tha. Designers include Yeargan (sets), Zuber (costumes) and Holder (lights). The tour continued until January 2024, when the production moved into the Dominion Theatre in the West End for a limited run until March 2024.

&quot;The King and I&quot; continues to be a popular choice for productions by community theatres, school and university groups, summer camps and regional theatre companies.

== Adaptations ==
The musical was filmed in 1956 with Brynner re-creating his role opposite Deborah Kerr. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won five, including Best Actor for Brynner, with Kerr nominated for Best Actress. Sharaff won for best costume design. The film was directed by Walter Lang (who was also nominated for an Oscar) and choreographed by Robbins. Marni Nixon dubbed the singing voice of Anna, and Rita Moreno played Tuptim. Saunders as Thiang, Adiarte as Chulalongkorn and Benson as the Kralahome reprised their stage roles, as did dancers Yuriko and de Lappe. Alan Mowbray appeared in the new role of the British Ambassador, while Sir Edward Ramsey (demoted to the Ambassador&#x27;s aide) was played by Geoffrey Toone. The movie&#x27;s script was faithful to the stage version, although it cut a few songs; reviews were enthusiastic. Thomas Hischak, in his &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia&quot;, states: &quot;It is generally agreed that the [movie] is the finest film adaptation of any R &amp; H musical&quot;. Thai officials judged the film offensive to their monarchy and banned both film and musical in 1956.

A non-musical 1972 TV comedy series, starring Brynner, was broadcast in the U.S. by CBS but was cancelled in mid-season after 13 episodes. It followed the main storyline of the musical, focusing on the relationship between the title characters. Samantha Eggar played &quot;Anna Owens&quot;, with Brian Tochi as Chulalongkorn, Keye Luke as the Kralahome, Eric Shea as Louis, Lisa Lu as Lady Thiang, and Rosalind Chao as Princess Serena. The first episode aired on September 17, 1972, and the last aired on December 31, 1972. Margaret Landon was unhappy with this series and charged the producers with &quot;inaccurate and mutilated portrayals&quot; of her literary property; she unsuccessfully sued for copyright infringement.

&quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot; was a Broadway revue, directed by Robbins, showcasing scenes from some of his most popular earlier works on Broadway. The show ran from February 1989 to September 1990 and won six Tony Awards, including best musical. It featured &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; and &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot; ballet, with Kikuchi as Eliza. Yuriko was the choreographic &quot;reconstruction assistant&quot;.

Rich Animation Studios, Morgan Creek Productions and Warner Bros. Pictures released a 1999 animated film adaptation of the musical. Except for using some of the songs and characters, the story is unrelated to the Rodgers and Hammerstein version. Geared towards children, the adaptation includes cuddly animals, including a dragon. Voices were provided by Miranda Richardson as Anna (speaking), Christiane Noll as Anna (singing), Martin Vidnovic as the King, Ian Richardson as the Kralahome and Adam Wylie as Louis. Hischak dislikes the film but praises the vocals, adding that one compensation of the film is hearing Barbra Streisand sing a medley of &quot;I Have Dreamed&quot;, &quot;We Kiss in a Shadow&quot; and &quot;Something Wonderful&quot;, which is borrowed from Streisand&#x27;s 1985 &quot;The Broadway Album&quot; and played under the film&#x27;s closing credits. He expressed surprise &quot;that the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization allowed it to be made&quot; and noted that &quot;children have enjoyed &quot;The King and I&quot; for five decades without relying on dancing dragons&quot;. Ted Chapin, president of that organization, has called the film his biggest mistake in granting permission for an adaptation.

== Music and recordings ==

=== Musical treatment ===
In his music, Rodgers sought to give some of the music an Asian flavor. This is exhibited in the piercing major seconds that frame &quot;A Puzzlement&quot;, the flute melody in &quot;We Kiss in a Shadow&quot;, open fifths, the exotic 6/2 chords that shape &quot;My Lord and Master&quot;, and in some of the incidental music. The music for &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot; was for the most part written not by Rodgers, but by dance music arranger Trude Rittmann, though &quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot; and a snatch of &quot;A Puzzlement&quot; are quoted within it.

Before Rodgers and Hammerstein began writing together, the AABA form for show tunes was standard, but many of the songs in &quot;The King and I&quot; vary from it. &quot;I Have Dreamed&quot; is an almost continuous repetition of variations on the same theme, until the ending, when it is capped by another melody. The first five notes (an eighth note triplet and two half notes) of &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; also carry the melody all the way through the refrain. According to Mordden, this refusal to accept conventional forms &quot;is one reason why their frequently heard scores never lose their appeal. They attend to situation and they unveil character, but also, they surprise you.&quot;

According to Rodgers&#x27; biographer William Hyland, the score for &quot;The King and I&quot; is much more closely tied to the action than that of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;which had its share of purely entertaining songs&quot;. For example, the opening song, &quot;I Whistle a Happy Tune&quot;, establishes Anna&#x27;s fear upon entering a strange land with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip. Hyland calls &quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot; an archetypical Rodgers ballad: simple, with only two chords in the first eight bars, but moving in its directness.

=== Recordings ===
The original cast recording of &quot;The King and I&quot; was released by Decca Records in 1951. While John Kenrick admires it for the performances of the secondary couple, Larry Douglas and Doretta Morrow, and for the warmth of Lawrence&#x27;s performance, he notes that &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; was abridged, and there are no children&#x27;s voices – the chorus in &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; is made up of adults. In 2000, the recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Later in the same year Patrice Munsel and Robert Merrill made the first studio recording of selections from the musical. Hischak comments that in the 1953 London cast album, Valerie Hobson&#x27;s vocals were no stronger than Lawrence&#x27;s and that the highlight is Muriel Smith&#x27;s &quot;Something Wonderful&quot; in a disc with too many cuts. He calls Anna&#x27;s songs &quot;well served&quot; by Marni Nixon&#x27;s singing in the 1956 film soundtrack and judges the recording as vocally satisfying. Kenrick describes the film soundtrack as a &quot;mixed bag&quot;: he is pleased that it includes several songs cut from the film, and he praises Nixon&#x27;s vocals, but he dislikes the supporting cast and suggests watching the movie instead for its visual splendor.
Kenrick prefers the 1964 Lincoln Center cast recording to the earlier ones, especially approving of the performances of Risë Stevens as Anna and Patricia Neway as Lady Thiang. The recording, for the first time, included the narrated ballet music for &quot;The Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot;. Because a single LP limited a single-disc album to about fifty minutes, its inclusion required the absence of some of the other numbers. Kenrick finds the recording of the 1977 Broadway revival cast to be &quot;[e]asily the most satisfying &quot;King &amp; I&quot; on CD&quot;. He judges it to be Brynner&#x27;s best performance, calling Towers &quot;great&quot; and Martin Vidnovic, June Angela and the rest of the supporting cast &quot;fabulous&quot;, though lamenting the omission of the ballet. Hischak, in contrast, says that some might prefer Brynner in his earlier recordings, when he was &quot;more vibrant&quot;. Kenrick enjoys the 1992 Angel studio recording mostly for the Anna of Julie Andrews, who he says is &quot;pure magic&quot; in a role she never performed on stage. Kenrick praises the performance of both stars on the 1996 Broadway revival recording, calling Lou Diamond Phillips &quot;that rarity, a King who can stand free of Brynner&#x27;s shadow&quot;. Hischak finds the soundtrack to the 1999 animated film with Christiane Noll as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the King, as well as Barbra Streisand singing on one track, more enjoyable than the movie itself, but Kenrick writes that his sole use for that CD is as a coaster.

== Critical reception ==
Opening night reviews of the musical were strongly positive. Richard Watts in the &quot;New York Post&quot; termed it &quot;[a]nother triumph for the masters&quot;. Critic John Mason Brown stated, &quot;They have done it again.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: &quot;This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and &quot;The King and I&quot; is a beautiful and lovable musical play.&quot; Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Even those of us who find [the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to take pleasure in the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them.&quot; Otis Guernsey wrote for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Musicals and leading men will never be the same after last night ... Brynner set an example that will be hard to follow ... Probably the best show of the decade.

The balance of opinion among the critics of the original London production was generally favorable, with a few reservations. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Ivor Brown predicted that the piece would &quot;settle down for some years at Drury Lane.&quot; The anonymous critic of &quot;The Times&quot; compared the work to Gilbert and Sullivan: &quot;Mr. Rodgers charmingly echoes Sullivan in the king&#x27;s more topsy-turvy moments; and Mr. Hammerstein attends very skilfully to the lurking Gilbertian humour.&quot; Less favorably, in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, John Barber called the work &quot;this treacle-bin &quot;Mikado&quot;&quot;, and declared that only one of the cast, Muriel Smith, could really sing.
In 1963, &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Lewis Funke said of the musical, &quot;Mr. Hammerstein put all of his big heart into the simple story of a British woman&#x27;s adventures, heartaches, and triumphs. ... A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [Landon&#x27;s book] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity.&quot; Fourteen years later, another &quot;Times&quot; reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical &quot;unsophisticated and untroubled. Even its shadows are lightened with a laugh or a sweetly sentimental tear ... we can even be persuaded to take death as a happy ending&quot;.

The reworked 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; disliked it: &quot;This latest &quot;King and I&quot; might look like a million dollars as a regional production; on Broadway ... it&#x27;s a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, there has been a serious failure of the theatrical imagination.&quot; But Liz Smith enthused: &quot;&quot;The King and I&quot; is perfect&quot;; and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote, of the subsequent tour, &quot;&quot;The King and I&quot; is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey.&quot; Critic Richard Christiansen in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: &quot;Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [&quot;The King and I&quot;] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that&#x27;s a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age.&quot; When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the &quot;Financial Times&quot; called it &quot;a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals&quot;.

The 2015 Broadway revival initially received uniformly glowing reviews. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;resplendent production&quot; and commented:

Marilyn Stasio, in &quot;Variety&quot;, termed the production &quot;sumptuous&quot; and &quot;absolutely stunning&quot;. She noted a &quot;still pertinent theme: the dissonant dynamic when Western civilization tries to assert its values on ancient Eastern cultures.&quot; In &quot;USA Today&quot;, Elysa Gardner wrote of the grins and tears evoked by the production. &quot;[W]atching these people from vastly different cultures carefully but joyfully reach for common ground ... can be almost unbearably moving. ... [Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s] textured humanity and appeals for tolerance, like their shimmering scores, only gain resonance as time passes.&quot; The production&#x27;s attempts to achieve historical accuracy and explore the work&#x27;s dark themes with a modern sensibility led some reviewers to conclude that it succeeds at converting the musical&#x27;s orientalism into &quot;a modern critique of racism and sexism&quot;. Other commentators, however, such as composer Mohammed Fairouz, argued that an attempt at sensitivity in production cannot compensate for &quot;the inaccurate portrayal of the historic King Mongkut as a childlike tyrant and the infantilization of the entire Siamese population of the court&quot;, which demonstrate a racist subtext in the piece, even in 1951 when it was written. Benjamin Ivry opined that &quot;the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization should shelve the [musical] as a humanitarian gesture toward Southeast Asian history and art&quot;.

Fifty years after its premiere, Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest summed up the musical:

<text>Dixon is a city in northeastern Solano County, California, United States, located from the state capital, Sacramento. It has a hot-summer mediterranean climate on the Köppen climate classification scale. Its population was 18,988 at the 2020 United States census. Other nearby cities include Vacaville, Winters, Davis, Woodland, and Rio Vista.

==History==

The first semi-permanent European settlement to develop in the Dixon area emerged during the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century when the community of Silveyville was founded in 1852 by Elijah Silvey as a halfway point between the Pacific coast and the rich gold fields of Sacramento along a route commonly traveled by miners. In 1868, Central Pacific railroad came through the area and missed Silveyville by a few miles. As a result, local leaders decided to physically relocate Silveyville closer to the tracks in order to enjoy the benefits of commerce and travel. One of the first buildings that still stands in Dixon from the 1871 move is the Dixon Methodist Church located at 209 N. Jefferson Street.

Originally, the city was named &quot;Dicksville&quot; after Thomas Dickson who donated 10 acres of his land for the construction of a railroad depot following the completion of the tracks and subsequent relocation of Silveyville to the now-Dixon area. However, when the first rail shipment of merchandise arrived from San Francisco in 1872, it was mistakenly addressed to &quot;Dixon&quot;—a name that has been used since, mainly out of simplicity. Up to now, the urban landscape of the town can be seen to have developed mostly in between the railroad tracks and Interstate-80.

As of 2024 the Dixon city council consists of Steve Bird, Mayor, Kevin Johnson, Vice Mayor, representing District 3, Jim Ernest, representing District 1, Thom Bogue, representing District 2, and Don Hendershot, representing District 4.

The city operates a municipal police and fire department, and water system &amp; wastewater treatment plant.

Historically, the Voice of America ran a shortwave transmitter site that was formerly owned and operated by NBC. NBC built the site in 1944, and it broadcast under the call signs KNBA, KNBH, KNBI, KNBC, and KNBX. The station was closed between September 2, 1979, and October 1, 1983, and briefly reopened for Spanish language broadcasting until 1988. The station served as a relay to both NBC International programming overseas, and as a relay of KNBR and its programming overseas, mostly the Pacific area. There is also a military transmission site, the Dixon Naval Radio Transmitter Facility.

Located on the shores of San Pablo Bay, the city had a population of 126,090 at the 2020 United States census.

The city of Vallejo was once part of the Rancho Suscol Mexican land grant of 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Gen. Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the North Bay region. Gen. Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836.

In 1846, independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the Bear Flag Revolt which resulted in Gen. Vallejo&#x27;s imprisonment in Sutter&#x27;s Fort. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. Gen. Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California.

===Post-Conquest era===

In 1851, Vallejo was declared to become the official California State Capitol, with the new government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. However, Vallejo did not follow through with constructing a Capitol State Building for them to meet in. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to Benicia, which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. Benicia is named after Vallejo&#x27;s wife, Benicia de Vallejo. After the legislature left, the government established a naval shipyard on Mare Island, which helped the city overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.

The U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.
Although the town is named after Gen. Vallejo, the man regarded as the true founder of Vallejo is John B. Frisbie. After his daughter Epifania married Frisbie, Gen. Vallejo granted him power of attorney for the land grant. It was Frisbie who hired E. H. Rowe, the man who designed the city layout and who named the east–west streets after states and the north–south streets after California counties.

===Modern era===
Mare Island Naval Shipyard was a critical submarine facility during WW II, both for constructing and overhauling vessels.

Downtown Vallejo retains many of its historic Victorian and Craftsman homes.

On May 6, 2008, the city council voted 7–0 to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, at the time becoming the largest California city to do so. Stephanie Gomes, Vallejo City Councilwoman, largely blamed exorbitant salaries and benefits for Vallejo firefighters and police officers. Reportedly, salaries and benefits for public safety workers accounted for at least 80 percent of Vallejo&#x27;s general-fund budget. On November 1, 2011, a federal judge released Vallejo from bankruptcy after nearly three years.

== Geography ==

According to United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Land area is , and (38.09%) is water. The Napa River flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into San Pablo Bay, in the northeastern part of San Francisco Bay.

Vallejo is located on the southwestern edge of Solano County, California in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California. Vallejo borders the city of Benicia to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the Carquinez Strait to the south and the San Pablo Bay to the west.

Several faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The San Andreas Fault and Hayward Faults are the most active faults, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the Concord Fault to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. 

Historically there have been local cinnabar mines in the Vallejo area. The Hastings Mine and St. John&#x27;s Mine contribute ongoing water contamination for mercury; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area&#x27;s spring water. Both Rindler Creek and Blue Rock Springs Creek have been affected.

=== Climate ===
Vallejo has a mild, coastal Mediterranean climate and can be an average of cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as San Francisco and Oakland. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between in January and in July. However, summer is very long with June–September being almost equal in historical average temperatures. This seasonal lag sees October averages being higher than in May in spite of it being after the Equinox (meaning less daylight than darkness).

The artist-run Vallejo Art Walk scheduled on the second Friday of every month in downtown Vallejo has been recognized as a hub for artists in the Bay Area and the entirety of California.

=== LGBT community ===
As early as the 1940s and before, Vallejo is known to have had a well-formed gay community, which was a short drive or boat ride away from San Francisco. At one time Vallejo boasted eight gay bars. After a migration of gays and lesbians from San Francisco in the decade 2000–2009, openly gay members of the community encountered what they described as a backlash against them. The school district was threatened by the ACLU with a lawsuit for harassment on behalf of a 17-year-old lesbian by school administrators. The school settled the lawsuit with the student. The school agreed to pay her $25,000, adopt a more stringent non-discrimination policy, and include a curriculum that positively portrayed gay and lesbian people.

The Government of Vallejo is defined under the Charter of the City of Vallejo. It is a council–manager government and consists of the Mayor, City Council, and numerous departments and officers under the supervision of the City Manager, such as the Vallejo Police Department, Vallejo Fire Department, Vallejo Public Works Department, and Vallejo Economic Development Department.

In 2008 the government of Vallejo filed for bankruptcy. A judge declared the bankruptcy over in 2011, but analysts have noted that the city did little to resolve its largest expense—public pensions—and may face a second round of bankruptcy.

As of September 2022, there were 69,546 registered voters in Vallejo; of these, 40,818 (58.7%) are Democrats, 8,751 (12.6%) are Republicans, and 15,612 (22.4%) stated no party preference.

The Council allocated $3.4 million to the Vallejo PB process and since then, Vallejo residents and business and property owners have been developing and designing project ideas. They have vetted and reduced more than 800 project ideas to 36 projects that will be on the ballot. Vallejo residents 14 years of age and older will vote and choose six out of 36 projects to vote on from May 11 through May 18, 2013.

The second cycle of participatory budgeting in Vallejo was initiated on February 4, 2014, with $2.4 million allocated. A public vote open to all residents of Vallejo age 16 and over took place in October 2014.

===Police===
Vallejo has had one of California&#x27;s highest rates of police killings in recent years. A 2023 &quot;Vallejo Sun&quot; story described Vallejo&#x27;s police department as &quot;one of California’s most deadly.&quot; In 2020, the department engaged a consulting firm to assess how to address extensive killings by its officers. The firm issued 45 recommendations, which were endorsed by the California attorney general; but according to reporting from the &quot;Vallejo Free Press&quot; and &quot;ProPublica&quot;, only two of the recommendations had been fully implemented by 2022.

Vallejo has seen a rate of killings by police officers that is significantly higher than the national average and other Bay Area cities. These incidents included the fatal shooting of Willie McCoy by six officers in 2019 and the shooting of Sean Monterrosa, who was unarmed, during protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. One of the officers who killed McCoy had previously killed an unarmed man as he fled, while another killed three men over a five-month period and was later promoted. Vallejo Police killed 19 people between 2010 and 2020. In 2012, police shootings accounted for six of the 20 homicides to occur in the city, and the frequency of officer-involved shootings stood at around 38 times the national rate.

<text>Benicia ( , ) is a city in Solano County, California, located on the north bank of the Carquinez Strait in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It served as the capital of California for nearly thirteen months from 1853 to 1854. The population was 27,131 at the 2020 United States census. Benicia is just east of Vallejo and across the strait from Martinez.

==History==


The City of Benicia was founded on May 19, 1847, by Dr. Robert Semple, Thomas O. Larkin, and Comandante General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, on land donated to them by General Vallejo in December 1846. It was named for the General&#x27;s wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo, a member of the Carrillo family of California, a prominent Californio dynasty. The General intended that the city be named &quot;Francisca&quot; after his wife, but this name was dropped when the former city of &quot;Yerba Buena&quot; changed its name to &quot;San Francisco,&quot; so her second given name was used instead. In his memoirs, William Tecumseh Sherman contended that Benicia was &quot;the best natural site for a commercial city&quot; in the region.

In February 1848, first word of gold found at Sutter&#x27;s Mill was leaked at a Benicia Tavern, thus starting the California Gold Rush. Benicia became a way station on the way to the Sierras.

In March 1850, Benicia became one of the first incorporated cities in California, a month after Sacramento. Benicia was the original county seat of Solano County. The lower floor of the Benicia Masonic Hall, built in 1850 with lumber donated by Benicia founder Robert Semple on land donated by Alexander Riddell, was used as the County court room and offices prior to the completion of Benicia&#x27;s city hall. In 1858, the county seat was moved to Fairfield.

In 1853, Benicia became the third site selected to serve as the California State capital, after San Jose and nearby Vallejo, and its newly constructed city hall was California&#x27;s capitol from February 11, 1853, to February 25, 1854. Soon after, the legislature was moved to the courthouse in Sacramento, which has remained the State capital ever since. The restored capitol is part of the Benicia Capitol State Historic Park, and is the only building remaining of the State&#x27;s pre-Sacramento capitols.

The original campus of Mills College was founded in Benicia in 1852 as the &quot;Young Ladies Seminary&quot;, and was the first women&#x27;s college west of the Rocky Mountains. Before moving to Oakland in 1871, it was located on West I Street, just north of First Street.

From 1860 to 1861, Benicia was indirectly involved in the Pony Express. When riders missed their connection with a steamer in Sacramento, they would continue on to Benicia and cross over to Martinez via the ferry. One of the earliest companies in California, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, established a major shipyard in Benicia in the 19th century. The prolific shipbuilder Matthew Turner formed the Matthew Turner Shipyard at Benicia in 1883.
Benicia became an important wheat storage and shipping site. It was also the site of the United States Army&#x27;s Benicia Arsenal.

On December 1, 1879, the Central Pacific Railroad rerouted the Sacramento-Oakland portion of its transcontinental line to Benicia and established a major railroad ferry across the Carquinez Strait from Benicia to Port Costa. The world&#x27;s largest ferry, the Solano, later joined by the even larger Contra Costa, carried entire trains across the Carquinez Strait from Benicia to Port Costa, whence they continued on to the Oakland Pier.

On June 5, 1889, the legendary prize fight between James J. Corbett and Joe Choynski was held on a barge off the coast of Benicia. The match lasted 28 rounds, and is now commemorated by a plaque near Southampton Bay.

===Modern era===

In 1901, the world&#x27;s first long-distance powerline crossing over Carquinez Strait was built. After California&#x27;s wheat output dropped in the early 20th century and especially after the Southern Pacific (which took over the operations of the Central Pacific) opened a railroad bridge to Martinez on October 15, 1930, eliminating the ferry crossing and the Benicia station, Benicia declined until the economic boom of World War II, in which the population doubled to about 7,000 residents.

A major fire on March 22, 1945, destroyed a half-block of businesses, including the nearly-century-old “old brewery”, and the Solano Hotel, with flames briefly threatening the old state capitol, now a historical landmark. A roof fire was quickly extinguished and the structure was not badly damaged. Losses were estimated at $125,000.

Two developments in the early 1960s completely changed Benicia: The closing of the Benicia Arsenal in 1960–64, and the completion of the Benicia–Martinez Bridge in 1962. The closing of the Arsenal removed Benicia&#x27;s traditional economic base, but allowed city leaders to create an industrial park on Arsenal land which eventually provided more revenue for the city than the Army had. The completion of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge made it possible for the city to become a suburb of San Francisco and Oakland, and suburban development in the Benicia hills began in the late 1960s.

On December 20, 1968, near the Benicia water pumping station on Lake Herman Road, the Zodiac Killer made his debut by killing Vallejo natives David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen as they rested or &quot;necked&quot; in Faraday&#x27;s car. Near the same area on July 4 of the following year, the killer struck again, killing Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin and injuring Michael Mageau at the Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, immediately next to Benicia.

Northeast of the town&#x27;s residential areas an oil refinery was built and completed in 1969 by Humble Oil (later Exxon Corporation). The refinery was later bought by Valero Energy Corporation, a San Antonio-based oil company, in 2000.

Between 1970 and 1995, the population of Benicia grew steadily at a rate of about 1,000 people per year, and the city changed from a poor, blue-collar town of 7,000 to a white-collar bedroom suburb of 27,000.

<text>The Transamerica Pyramid is a pyramid-shaped 48-story modernist skyscraper in San Francisco, California, United States, and the second tallest building in the San Francisco skyline. Located at 600 Montgomery Street between Clay and Washington Streets in the city&#x27;s Financial District, it was the tallest building in San Francisco from its completion in 1972 until 2018 when the newly-constructed Salesforce Tower surpassed its height. The building no longer houses the headquarters of the Transamerica Corporation, which moved its U.S. headquarters to Baltimore, Maryland. The building is still associated with the company by being depicted on the company&#x27;s logo. Designed by architect William Pereira and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company, the building stands at . On completion in 1972 it was the eighth-tallest building in the world. It is also a popular tourist site. In 2020, the building was sold to NYC investor Michael Shvo, who in 2022 hired Norman Foster to redesign the interiors and renovate the building.

==History==
The Transamerica building was commissioned by Transamerica CEO John (Jack) R. Beckett, with the claim that he wished to allow light in the street below. Built on the site of the historic Montgomery Block, it has a structural height of and has 48 floors of retail and office space.

Construction began in 1969 and finished in 1972, and was overseen by San Francisco–based contractor Dinwiddie Construction, now Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company. Transamerica moved its headquarters to the new building from across the street, where it had been based in a -shaped building now occupied by the Church of Scientology of San Francisco.

Although the tower is no longer Transamerica Corporation headquarters, it is still associated with the company and is depicted in the company&#x27;s logo. The building is evocative of San Francisco and has become one of the many symbols of the city. Designed by architect William Pereira, it faced opposition during planning and construction and was sometimes referred to by detractors as &quot;Pereira&#x27;s Prick&quot;. John King of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; summed up the improved opinion of the building in 2009 as &quot;an architectural icon of the best sort – one that fits its location and gets better with age.&quot; King also wrote in 2011 that it is &quot;a uniquely memorable building, a triumph of the unexpected, unreal and engaging all at once. ... It is a presence and a persona, snapping into different focus with every fresh angle, every shift in light.&quot;

The Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper west of Chicago when constructed, surpassing the then Bank of America Center, also in San Francisco. It was surpassed by the Aon Center, Los Angeles, in 1974.

The building is thought to have been the intended target of a terrorist attack, involving the hijacking of airplanes as part of the Bojinka plot, which was foiled in 1995.

In 1999, Transamerica was acquired by Dutch insurance company Aegon. When the non-insurance operations of Transamerica were later sold to GE Capital, Aegon retained ownership of the building as an investment. In 2020, the building was purchased by SHVO and Deutsche Finance America for $650 million. In 2022, SHVO and partners hired architect Norman Foster to undertake a $250 million renovation.

The Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco from 1972 to 2017, when it was surpassed by the under-construction Salesforce Tower. It is one of 39 San Francisco high rises reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as potentially vulnerable to a large earthquake, due to a flawed welding technique.

==Design==
The land use and zoning restrictions for the parcel limited the number of square feet of office that could be built upon the lot, which sits at the north boundary of the financial district.

The building is a tall, four-sided pyramid with two &quot;wings&quot; to accommodate an elevator shaft on the east and a stairwell and a smoke tower on the west. The top of the building is the spire. There are four cameras pointed in the four cardinal directions at the top of this spire forming the &quot;Transamerica Virtual Observation Deck.&quot; Four monitors in the lobby, whose direction and zoom can be controlled by visitors, display the cameras&#x27; views 24 hours a day. An observation deck on the 27th floor was closed: the Pyramid&#x27;s official website says that it was closed to the public in 2001, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that it has been closed &quot;[s]ince the late 1990s&quot;. It was replaced by the virtual observation deck a few years later. The video signal from the &quot;Transamericam&quot; was used for years by a local TV news station for live views of traffic and weather in downtown San Francisco.

The top of the Transamerica Pyramid is covered with aluminum panels. During the Christmas holiday season, on Independence Day, and during the anniversary of 9/11, a brightly twinkling beacon called the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; is lit at the top of the pyramid.

== Gallery ==
== Park ==

At the base of the building is a half-acre privately owned public space designed by Tom Galli called Redwood Park. A number of redwood trees were transplanted to this park from the Santa Cruz Mountains when the tower was built. It is currently closed as part of the remodel project. It features a fountain and pond designed by Anthony Guzzardo, containing a jumping frog and lily pads bronze sculpture commemorating &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot; by Mark Twain (sculpture by Richard Clopton, 1996); a Glenna Goodacre bronze sculpture of children at play (1989); a bronze plaque honoring the dogs Bummer and Lazarus, celebrating their skill at catching rats; and benches and tables offering respite to workers and visitors alike.

==Specifications==
* The building&#x27;s façade is covered in crushed quartz, giving the building its light color.
* The four-story base contains of concrete and over of steel rebar.
* It has 3,678 windows.
* The building&#x27;s foundation is thick, the result of a 3-day, 24-hour continuous concrete pour. Several thousand dollars in coins were thrown into the pit by observers surrounding the site at street level during the pouring, for good luck. 
* Only two of the building&#x27;s 18 elevators reach the top floor.
* The original proposal was for a building, which for a year would have been the second-tallest completed building in the world. The proposal was rejected by the city planning commission, saying it would interfere with views of San Francisco Bay from Nob Hill.
* The building is on the site that was the temporary home of A. P. Giannini&#x27;s Bank of Italy after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed its office. Giannini founded Transamerica in 1928 as a holding company for his financial empire. Bank of Italy later became Bank of America.
* There is a plaque commemorating two famous dogs, Bummer and Lazarus, at the base of the building.
* The hull of the whaling vessel &quot;Niantic&quot;, an artifact of the 1849 California Gold Rush, lay almost beneath the Transamerica Pyramid, and the location is marked by a historical plaque outside the building (California Historical Landmark #88).
* The aluminum cap is indirectly illuminated from within to balance the appearance at night.
* The two wings increase interior space at the upper levels. One extension is the top of elevator shafts while the other is a smoke evacuation tower for fire-fighting.
* A glass pyramid cap sits at the top and encloses a red aircraft warning light and the brighter seasonal beacon.
* Because of the shape of the building, the majority of the windows can pivot 360 degrees so they can be washed from the inside.
* The spire is hollow and lined with a 100-foot steel stairway at a 60-degree angle, followed by two steel ladders.
* The conference room (with 360 degree views of the city) is located on the 48th floor.
* Construction began in 1969 and the first tenants moved in during the summer of 1972.

<doc id="60871" wikidata="Q184240" url="?curid=60871" title="Luminescence">
<text>Luminescence is a spontaneous emission of radiation from an electronically or vibrationally excited species not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. A luminescent object emits &quot;cold light&quot; in contrast to incandescence, where an object only emits light after heating. Generally, the emission of light is due to the movement of electrons between different energy levels within an atom after excitation by external factors. However, the exact mechanism of light emission in vibrationally excited species is unknown. 

The dials, hands, scales, and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as &quot;luminising&quot;.

==Types==
* Ionoluminescence, a result of bombardment by fast ions
* Radioluminescence, a result of bombardment by ionizing radiation
* Electroluminescence, a result of an electric current passed through a substance
** Cathodoluminescence, a result of a luminescent material being struck by electrons
* Chemiluminescence, the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction
** Bioluminescence, a result of biochemical reactions in a living organism
** Electrochemiluminescence, a result of an electrochemical reaction
** Lyoluminescence, a result of dissolving a solid (usually heavily irradiated) in a liquid solvent
** Candoluminescence, is light emitted by certain materials at elevated temperatures, which differs from the blackbody emission expected at the temperature in question.
* Mechanoluminescence, a result of a mechanical action on a solid
** Triboluminescence, generated when bonds in a material are broken when that material is scratched, crushed, or rubbed
** Fractoluminescence, generated when bonds in certain crystals are broken by fractures
** Piezoluminescence, produced by the action of pressure on certain solids
** Sonoluminescence, a result of imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound
* Crystalloluminescence, produced during crystallization
* Thermoluminescence, the re-emission of absorbed energy when a substance is heated
** Cryoluminescence, the emission of light when an object is cooled (an example of this is wulfenite)
* Photoluminescence, a result of the absorption of photons
** Fluorescence, traditionally defined as the emission of light that ends immediately after the source of excitation is removed. As the definition does not fully describe the phenomenon, quantum mechanics is employed where it is defined as there is no change in spin multiplicity from the state of excitation to emission of light.
** Phosphorescence, traditionally defined as persistent emission of light after the end of excitation. As the definition does not fully describe the phenomenon, quantum mechanics is employed where it is defined as there is a change in spin multiplicity from the state of excitation to the emission of light.

==Applications==
* Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light via electro-luminescence.
* Phosphors, materials that emit light when irradiated by higher-energy electromagnetic radiation or particle radiation
* Laser, and lamp industry
* Phosphor thermometry, measuring temperature using phosphorescence
* Thermoluminescence dating
* Thermoluminescent dosimeter
* Non-disruptive observation of processes within a cell.

Luminescence occurs in some minerals when they are exposed to low-powered sources of ultraviolet or infrared electromagnetic radiation (for example, portable UV lamps) at atmospheric pressure and atmospheric temperatures. This property of these minerals can be used during the process of mineral identification at rock outcrops in the field or in the laboratory.

==History==
The term &quot;luminescence&quot; was first introduced in 1888 by German physicist Eilhard Wiedemann.

<doc id="60872" wikidata="Q1002506" url="?curid=60872" title="Fairfield, Ohio">
<text>Fairfield is a city in southern Butler County, Ohio, United States. It is a suburb located about north of Cincinnati and is situated on the east bank of the Great Miami River. The population was 44,907 as of the 2020 census. Incorporated in 1955 from portions of Fairfield Township, it includes the former hamlets of Symmes Corner, Fair Play, Furmandale, and Stockton. The Fairfield City School District is one of the largest in Ohio and serves both the City of Fairfield and Fairfield Township.

==History==

===Early history===
Prior to European settlement the Fairfield area was home to several Indian tribes, most prominently the Shawnee and the Miami. The prehistoric Hopewell and Adena peoples constructed numerous earthworks around the city, though most were unwittingly removed by early settlers in order to accommodate farm fields.

The area that is now Fairfield was part of the original Symmes Purchase. Also known as the Miami Purchase, the region was acquired by Judge John Cleves Symmes from the Continental Congress in 1788 and included much of the land between the Little Miami and Great Miami rivers that became the present day counties of Hamilton, Butler, and Warren.

As the area was settled hamlets developed to serve the surrounding countryside. Judge Symmes&#x27; great-nephew, Celadon Symmes, was the founder and first settler of Symmes Corner. Located at the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Nilles Road it now serves as Fairfield&#x27;s town center. 
The hamlet of Fair Play was located on the east bank of the Great Miami River. It was known for its mills, including Ohio&#x27;s first paper mill. The community was destroyed by a flood in the late 1800s. Today the Miami Chapel Cemetery and the Fair Play School are some of the few remaining vestiges of the village.

In the 1850s, the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railway (today CSX) was extended through Fairfield, fostering the development of several communities. The villages of Schencks Station and Stockton were established along the rail line. Schencks Station was located near the present-day intersection of Symmes Road and State Route 4 and was named for local landowner Aaron Schenck. Stockton could be found at the crossroads of State Route 4 and Seward Road. Originally known as Jones Station, the village provided area farms with necessities including a smithy, a general store, churches, and a school. In between the two communities was the village of Furmandale; also known as Schnapstown or Snaptown. Located at the current intersection of Winton and Nilles roads, the community took its name from Nathaniel Furman who operated a private school for girls within the community. A few miles to the east of these communities was the Miami-Erie Canal which, prior to the arrival of the railroad, enabled early settlers to move their commodities to market.

===Growth and incorporation===
Fairfield remained a quiet, primarily agricultural community until the mid-20th century. As the City of Hamilton grew its industry expanded south into present day Fairfield. Fisher Body, a manufacturing division of General Motors, established a plant at the northeast corner of State Route 4 and Symmes Road near the location of what was Schencks Station. During the same timeframe Fairfield started to experience residential growth, initially as a southern suburb of Hamilton. In 1954 a group of citizens wishing to avoid annexation into Hamilton organized an incorporation campaign. The initial petition was to create a municipal corporation from Fairfield Township in its entirety. A referendum was held in April 1954 with incorporation failing by a vote of 1,219 to 831. A renewed effort focused on those precincts that voted affirmatively. A second referendum was held in July 1954 with incorporation winning by a vote of 738 to 216. Fairfield was established as a statutory village in 1955 with a mayor-council form of government.

The next 30 years represented a period of rapid growth for the community. By 1960 the village had exceeded a population of 5,000 and was reclassified as a statutory city. The Interstate 275 beltway was constructed around Cincinnati in the late 1970s. The new road provided easy access to Fairfield from the northern Cincinnati suburbs, thus providing an additional high quality transportation route. This, in turn, drove substantial commercial and residential investment in the community.

===Growing pains and stabilization===
The city&#x27;s form-of-government was a subject of debate almost from its inception. In 1961 a charter commission was formed to study the issue. After due consideration the commission recommended adoption of a charter with the council-administrator form of government, but the initiative was rejected by the voters. The question resurfaced in 1971, but did not progress beyond council conversations. In 1976 the issue gained momentum with form-of-government becoming an issue in council campaigns. In 1978 a charter commission was established and charged with framing a charter that would establish a council-administrator form-of-government. The city&#x27;s second charter commission spent eight months researching the charters of various Ohio communities. A referendum was held on June 5, 1979, in which the issue was approved by a vote of 1,423 to 1,265. The council-administrator (later council-manager) form went into effect on January 1, 1980.

General Motors announced that the Hamilton-Fairfield Chevrolet Pontiac Canada Group, known as the Fisher Body plant, would be phased out in the first quarter of 1989. The effect of the plant closing was a loss of 2,500 jobs and 28 percent of the city&#x27;s income tax revenue, amounting to $1.7 million.

The city regained economic balance in the 1990s and experienced wide, diverse business development. With a population of 39,729 at the beginning of 1990, the city&#x27;s explosive population growth had begun to slow, allowing it to focus on quality development of remaining residential and commercial areas. During this time, Fairfield updated and expanded its sanitary sewers, established detention basins for better stormwater control, continued to address road improvements, and established a community center.

In 1995, Fairfield withdraw from Fairfield, Union, and Springfield townships via a paper township called &quot;Heritage Township&quot;, reusing a name from a previous failed attempt to incorporate Symmes and Deerfield townships as a city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Butler County line serves as Fairfield&#x27;s southern corporate boundary with a small portion of the City extending into Hamilton County. This portion contains no population. The city is bounded on the north by the City of Hamilton and the eponymously named Fairfield Township; the east by West Chester and Fairfield townships; the south by the cities of Springdale and Forest Park as well as Springfield and Colerain townships; and on the west by Fairfield and Ross townships. 
The city is bisected by a major rail line and is served by several interstate, federal and state highways which provide for excellent access. This transportation infrastructure has contributed to Fairfield&#x27;s economic success.

Most of Fairfield sits on top of the Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer; one of the largest underground reservoirs in the Midwest. The aquifer provides a clean and safe source of drinking water for communities up and down the course of the Great Miami River. The cities of Fairfield, Hamilton and Cincinnati operate water production facilities within Fairfield corporate boundaries; all of which draw from the aquifer.

==Economy==
Fairfield has a highly diversified economy without a dominant industry, though two of the city&#x27;s top employers are insurance companies. The corporate headquarters of insurance company Cincinnati Financial is located in Fairfield.

Jungle Jim&#x27;s International Market is a regional tourism destination featuring food and beverage items from all over the world. Jim Bonaminio started the market in 1971 as a produce stand. A reluctant planning commission approved his request on the condition that he would ultimately construct a permanent storefront. Today Jungle Jim&#x27;s International Market has 50,000 weekly shoppers and annual sales of nearly $100 million.

===Top employers===
As of 2022, Fairfield&#x27;s largest employers were:
==Government==

The City of Fairfield is a charter municipality and operates under the council-manager form of government, combining the strong political leadership of elected officials with the professional expertise of an appointed city manager. Legislative authority under this form of government is vested in City Council, the body that is chosen by the electorate. Council hires the manager to serve as the city&#x27;s full-time chief executive officer. Fairfield City Council consists of seven members, three of who are elected at-large with the remainder elected by ward. Council members serve staggered, four-year terms with the ward members running together followed two years later by the at-large members and the Mayor. The Mayor, who is directly elected and also serves a four-year term, acts as the official and ceremonial head of the government and presides over all meetings of Council. Mayoral duties include the right to introduce legislation and to take part in discussion of all matters before Council with the right to vote in the event of a tie. The Mayor appoints the chairs of the various council committees and issues official proclamations. Council, in addition to appointing the city manager and passing legislation, approves the annual operating, capital and tax budgets, contracts in the city&#x27;s name, levies taxes, appoints board and commission members, and appoints the law director and the clerk of council.

The city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city, implements Council action, hires and oversees the staff, prepares and implements the annual operating and capital budgets and keeps the elected officials advised of the city&#x27;s financial sustainability.

The Fairfield Municipal Court is part of the city from a budgetary perspective, but otherwise operates as a completely autonomous agency. Municipal court judges in Ohio are elected to six-year terms on a nonpartisan judicial ballot.

==Recreation==

Fairfield operates a parks and recreation system with over 500 acres of parkland. Harbin Park is the city&#x27;s largest at 230 acres. It annually hosts the Cincinnati Cyclocross, a cycling competition spread over three days and three Greater Cincinnati communities. Harbin also plays host to the city&#x27;s Red White &amp; Kaboom fireworks show held annually on July 3 in celebration of Independence Day. 

Marsh Lake Park was acquired from the Martin–Marietta Corporation in 2017. The city had, since the early 1990s, leased the eastern portion of the property from Martin–Marietta. Per the terms of an agreement between the city and the company the property was deeded to Fairfield upon the cessation of mining operations in 2017. 

Huffman Park is one of the city&#x27;s newest recreational facilities. It was donated, developed and dedicated in 2012 in memory of Fairfield residents Anna and Harold Huffman who owned and lived on the property for more than 50 years. Funding for the development of the park was provided by the Anna &amp; Harold W. Huffman Foundation. It promotes ecology with plantings of native species and a prairie that provides wildlife habitat.

In addition to the park system, city facilities include the Community Arts Center; the 1817 Elisha Morgan Mansion; and the Village Green Amphitheater that hosts the seasonal Groovin&#x27; on the Green Concert Series, 4th Friday Concert Series and the Village Green Farmer&#x27;s Market. The city operates two municipal golf courses and an aquatic center.

Fairfield is also home to Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy, which has coached various Olympians.

==Transportation==
Public transit in the city is provided by the Butler County Regional Transit Authority and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority.

==Education==

<text>Photoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) is light emission from any form of matter after the absorption of photons (electromagnetic radiation). It is one of many forms of luminescence (light emission) and is initiated by photoexcitation (i.e. photons that excite electrons to a higher energy level in an atom), hence the prefix &quot;photo-&quot;. Following excitation, various relaxation processes typically occur in which other photons are re-radiated. Time periods between absorption and emission may vary: ranging from short femtosecond-regime for emission involving free-carrier plasma in inorganic semiconductors up to milliseconds for phosphoresence processes in molecular systems; and under special circumstances delay of emission may even span to minutes or hours.

Observation of photoluminescence at a certain energy can be viewed as an indication that an electron populated an excited state associated with this transition energy.

While this is generally true in atoms and similar systems, correlations and other more complex phenomena also act as sources for photoluminescence in many-body systems such as semiconductors. A theoretical approach to handle this is given by the semiconductor luminescence equations.

== Forms ==
Photoluminescence processes can be classified by various parameters such as the energy of the exciting photon with respect to the emission.
Resonant excitation describes a situation in which photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed and equivalent photons are very rapidly re-emitted. This is often referred to as resonance fluorescence. For materials in solution or in the gas phase, this process involves electrons but no significant internal energy transitions involving molecular features of the chemical substance between absorption and emission. In crystalline inorganic semiconductors where an electronic band structure is formed, secondary emission can be more complicated as events may contain both coherent contributions such as resonant Rayleigh scattering where a fixed phase relation with the driving light field is maintained (i.e. energetically elastic processes where no losses are involved), and incoherent contributions (or inelastic modes where some energy channels into an auxiliary loss mode),

The latter originate, e.g., from the radiative recombination of excitons, Coulomb-bound electron-hole pair states in solids. Resonance fluorescence may also show significant quantum optical correlations.

More processes may occur when a substance undergoes internal energy transitions before re-emitting the energy from the absorption event. Electrons change energy states by either resonantly gaining energy from absorption of a photon or losing energy by emitting photons. In chemistry-related disciplines, one often distinguishes between fluorescence and phosphorescence. The former is typically a fast process, yet some amount of the original energy is dissipated so that re-emitted light photons will have lower energy than did the absorbed excitation photons. The re-emitted photon in this case is said to be red shifted, referring to the reduced energy it carries following this loss (as the Jablonski diagram shows). For phosphorescence, electrons which absorbed photons, undergo intersystem crossing where they enter into a state with altered spin multiplicity (see term symbol), usually a triplet state. Once the excited electron is transferred into this triplet state, electron transition (relaxation) back to the lower singlet state energies is quantum mechanically forbidden, meaning that it happens much more slowly than other transitions. The result is a slow process of radiative transition back to the singlet state, sometimes lasting minutes or hours. This is the basis for &quot;glow in the dark&quot; substances.

Photoluminescence is an important technique for measuring the purity and crystalline quality of semiconductors such as GaN and InP and for quantification of the amount of disorder present in a system.

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is a method where the sample is excited with a light pulse and then the decay in photoluminescence with respect to time is measured. This technique is useful for measuring the minority carrier lifetime of III-V semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs).

== Photoluminescence properties of direct-gap semiconductors ==
In a typical PL experiment, a semiconductor is excited with a light-source that provides photons with an energy larger than the bandgap energy.
The incoming light excites a polarization that can be described with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Once the photons are absorbed, electrons and holes are formed with finite momenta formula_1 in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The excitations then undergo energy and momentum relaxation towards the band-gap minimum. Typical mechanisms are Coulomb scattering and the interaction with phonons. Finally, the electrons recombine with holes under emission of photons.

Ideal, defect-free semiconductors are many-body systems where the interactions of charge-carriers and lattice vibrations have to be considered in addition to the light-matter coupling. In general, the PL properties are also extremely sensitive to internal electric fields and to the dielectric environment (such as in photonic crystals) which impose further degrees of complexity. A precise microscopic description is provided by the semiconductor luminescence equations.

=== Ideal quantum-well structures ===

An ideal, defect-free semiconductor quantum well structure is a useful model system to illustrate the fundamental processes in typical PL experiments. The discussion is based on results published in Klingshirn (2012) and Balkan (1998).

The fictive model structure for this discussion has two confined quantized electronic and two hole subbands, e1, e2 and h1, h2, respectively.
The linear absorption spectrum of such a structure shows the exciton resonances of the first (e1h1) and the second quantum well subbands (e2, h2), as well as the absorption from the corresponding continuum states and from the barrier.

==== Photoexcitation ====

In general, three different excitation conditions are distinguished: resonant, quasi-resonant, and non-resonant. For the resonant excitation, the central energy of the laser corresponds to the lowest exciton resonance of the quantum well. No, or only a negligible amount of the excess, energy is injected to the carrier system. For these conditions, coherent processes contribute significantly to the spontaneous emission. The decay of polarization creates excitons directly. The detection of PL is challenging for resonant excitation as it is difficult to discriminate contributions from the excitation, i.e., stray-light and diffuse scattering from surface roughness. Thus, speckle and resonant Rayleigh-scattering are always superimposed to the incoherent emission.

In case of the non-resonant excitation, the structure is excited with some excess energy. This is the typical situation used in most PL experiments as the excitation energy can be discriminated using a spectrometer or an optical filter. One has to distinguish between quasi-resonant excitation and barrier excitation.

For quasi-resonant conditions, the energy of the excitation is tuned above the ground state but still below the barrier absorption edge, for example, into the continuum of the first subband. The polarization decay for these conditions is much faster than for resonant excitation and coherent contributions to the quantum well emission are negligible. The initial temperature of the carrier system is significantly higher than the lattice temperature due to the surplus energy of the injected carriers. Finally, only the electron-hole plasma is initially created. It is then followed by the formation of excitons.

In case of barrier excitation, the initial carrier distribution in the quantum well strongly depends on the carrier scattering between barrier and the well.

==== Relaxation ====

Initially, the laser light induces coherent polarization in the sample, i.e., the transitions between electron and hole states oscillate with the laser frequency and a fixed phase. The polarization dephases typically on a sub-100 fs time-scale in case of nonresonant excitation due to ultra-fast Coulomb- and phonon-scattering.

The dephasing of the polarization leads to creation of populations of electrons and holes in the conduction and the valence bands, respectively. The lifetime of the carrier populations is rather long, limited by radiative and non-radiative recombination such as Auger recombination. During this lifetime a fraction of electrons and holes may form excitons, this topic is still controversially discussed in the literature. The formation rate depends on the experimental conditions such as lattice temperature, excitation density, as well as on the general material parameters, e.g., the strength of the Coulomb-interaction or the exciton binding energy.

The characteristic time-scales are in the range of hundreds of picoseconds in GaAs; they appear to be much shorter in wide-gap semiconductors.

Directly after the excitation with short (femtosecond) pulses and the quasi-instantaneous decay of the polarization, the carrier distribution is mainly determined by the spectral width of the excitation, e.g., a laser pulse. The distribution is thus highly non-thermal and resembles a Gaussian distribution, centered at a finite momentum. In the first hundreds of femtoseconds, the carriers are scattered by phonons, or at elevated carrier densities via Coulomb-interaction. The carrier system successively relaxes to the Fermi–Dirac distribution typically within the first picosecond. Finally, the carrier system cools down under the emission of phonons. This can take up to several nanoseconds, depending on the material system, the lattice temperature, and the excitation conditions such as the surplus energy.

Initially, the carrier temperature decreases fast via emission of optical phonons. This is quite efficient due to the comparatively large energy associated with optical phonons, (36meV or 420K in GaAs) and their rather flat dispersion, allowing for a wide range of scattering processes under conservation of energy and momentum. Once the carrier temperature decreases below the value corresponding to the optical phonon energy, acoustic phonons dominate the relaxation. Here, cooling is less efficient due their dispersion and small energies and the temperature decreases much slower beyond the first tens of picoseconds. At elevated excitation densities, the carrier cooling is further inhibited by the so-called hot-phonon effect. The relaxation of a large number of hot carriers leads to a high generation rate of optical phonons which exceeds the decay rate into acoustic phonons. This creates a non-equilibrium &quot;over-population&quot; of optical phonons and thus causes their increased reabsorption by the charge-carriers significantly suppressing any cooling. Thus, a system cools slower, the higher the carrier density is.

==== Radiative recombination ====
The emission directly after the excitation is spectrally very broad, yet still centered in the vicinity of the strongest exciton resonance. As the carrier distribution relaxes and cools, the width of the PL peak decreases and the emission energy shifts to match the ground state of the exciton (such as an electron) for ideal samples without disorder. The PL spectrum approaches its quasi-steady-state shape defined by the distribution of electrons and holes. Increasing the excitation density will change the emission spectra. They are dominated by the excitonic ground state for low densities. Additional peaks from higher subband transitions appear as the carrier density or lattice temperature are increased as these states get more and more populated. Also, the width of the main PL peak increases significantly with rising excitation due to excitation-induced dephasing and the emission peak experiences a small shift in energy due to the Coulomb-renormalization and phase-filling.

In general, both exciton populations and plasma, uncorrelated electrons and holes, can act as sources for photoluminescence as described in the semiconductor-luminescence equations. Both yield very similar spectral features which are difficult to distinguish; their emission dynamics, however, vary significantly. The decay of excitons yields a single-exponential decay function since the probability of their radiative recombination does not depend on the carrier density. The probability of spontaneous emission for uncorrelated electrons and holes, is approximately proportional to the product of electron and hole populations eventually leading to a non-single-exponential decay described by a hyperbolic function.

=== Effects of disorder ===
Real material systems always incorporate disorder. Examples are structural defects in the lattice or disorder due to variations of the chemical composition. Their treatment is extremely challenging for microscopic theories due to the lack of detailed knowledge about perturbations of the ideal structure. Thus, the influence of the extrinsic effects on the PL is usually addressed phenomenologically. In experiments, disorder can lead to localization of carriers and hence drastically increase the photoluminescence life times as localized carriers cannot as easily find nonradiative recombination centers as can free ones.

Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have studied the photoinduced entropy (i.e. thermodynamic disorder) of InGaN/GaN p-i-n double-heterostructure and AlGaN nanowires using temperature-dependent photoluminescence. They defined the photoinduced entropy as a thermodynamic quantity that represents the unavailability of a system&#x27;s energy for conversion into useful work due to carrier recombination and photon emission. They have also related the change in entropy generation to the change in photocarrier dynamics in the nanowire active regions using results from time-resolved photoluminescence study. They hypothesized that the amount of generated disorder in the InGaN layers eventually increases as the temperature approaches room temperature because of the thermal activation of surface states, while an insignificant increase was observed in AlGaN nanowires, indicating lower degrees of disorder-induced uncertainty in the wider bandgap semiconductor. To study the photoinduced entropy, the scientists have developed a mathematical model that considers the net energy exchange resulting from photoexcitation and photoluminescence.

== Photoluminescent materials for temperature detection ==

In phosphor thermometry, the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence process is exploited to measure temperature.

== Experimental methods ==

&quot;Photoluminescence spectroscopy&quot; is a widely used technique for characterisation of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors and molecules. The technique itself is fast, contactless, and nondestructive. Therefore, it can be used to study the optoelectronic properties of materials of various sizes (from microns to centimeters) during the fabrication process without complex sample preparation. For example, photoluminescence measurements of solar cell absorbers can predict the maximum voltage the material could produce. In chemistry, the method is more often referred to as fluorescence spectroscopy, but the instrumentation is the same. The relaxation processes can be studied using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to find the decay lifetime of the photoluminescence. These techniques can be combined with microscopy, to map the intensity (confocal microscopy) or the lifetime (fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy) of the photoluminescence across a sample (e.g. a semiconducting wafer, or a biological sample that has been marked with fluorescent molecules). Modulated photoluminescence is a specific method for measuring the complex frequency response of the photoluminescence signal to a sinusoidal excitation, allowing for the direct extraction of minority carrier lifetime without the need for intensity calibrations. It has been used to study the influence of interface defects on the recombination of excess carriers in crystalline silicon wafers with different passivation schemes.

<text>Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated when a material is mechanically pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed (see tribology). The phenomenon is not fully understood but appears in most cases to be caused by the separation and reunification of static electric charges, see also triboelectric effect. The term comes from the Greek (&quot;to rub&quot;; see tribology) and the Latin &quot;lumen&quot; (light). Triboluminescence can be observed when breaking sugar crystals and peeling adhesive tapes.

&quot;Triboluminescence&quot; is often a synonym for &quot;fractoluminescence&quot; (a term mainly used when referring only to light emitted from fractured crystals). Triboluminescence differs from piezoluminescence in that a piezoluminescent material emits light when deformed, as opposed to broken. These are examples of mechanoluminescence, which is luminescence resulting from any mechanical action on a solid.

==History==
=== Quartz rattlers of the Uncompahgre Ute indigenous people ===
The Uncompahgre Ute indigenous people from Central Colorado are one of the first documented groups of people in the world credited with the application of mechanoluminescence involving the use of quartz crystals to generate light. The Ute constructed unique ceremonial rattles made from buffalo rawhide which they filled with clear quartz crystals collected from the mountains of Colorado and Utah. When the rattles were shaken at night during ceremonies, the friction and mechanical stress of the quartz crystals impacting together produced flashes of light visible through the translucent buffalo hide.

===Early scientific reports===
The first recorded observation is attributed to English scholar Francis Bacon when he recorded in his 1620 &quot;Novum Organum&quot; that &quot;It is well known that all sugar, whether candied or plain, if it be hard, will sparkle when broken or scraped in the dark.&quot; The scientist Robert Boyle also reported on some of his work on triboluminescence in 1663. In 1675. Astronomer Jean-Felix Picard observed that his barometer was glowing in the dark as he carried it. His barometer consisted of a glass tube that was partially filled with mercury. The empty space above the mercury would glow whenever the mercury slid down the glass tube.

In the late 1790s, sugar production began to produce more refined sugar crystals. These crystals were formed into a large solid cone for transport and sale. This solid sugar cone had to be broken into usable chunks using a sugar nips device. People began to notice that tiny bursts of light were visible as sugar was &quot;nipped&quot; in low light, an established example of triboluminescence.

== Mechanism of action ==
There remain a few ambiguities about the effect. The current theory of triboluminescence—based upon crystallographic, spectroscopic, and other experimental evidence—is that upon fracture of asymmetrical materials, charge is separated. When the charges recombine, the electrical discharge ionizes the surrounding air, causing a flash of light. Research further suggests that crystals that display triboluminescence often lack symmetry and are poor conductors. However, there are substances which break this rule, and which do not possess asymmetry, yet display triboluminescence, such as hexakis(antipyrine)terbium iodide. It is thought that these materials contain impurities, which make the substance locally asymmetric. Further information on some of the possible processes involved can be found in the page on the triboelectric effect.

The biological phenomenon of triboluminescence is thought to be controlled by recombination of free radicals during mechanical activation.

== Examples ==

=== In common materials ===

Certain household materials and substances can be seen to exhibit the property:
* Ordinary pressure-sensitive tape (&quot;Scotch tape&quot;) displays a glowing line where the end of the tape is being pulled away from the roll. Soviet scientists observed in 1953 that unpeeling a roll of tape in a vacuum produced X-rays. The mechanism of X-ray generation was studied further in 2008. Similar X-ray emissions have also been observed with metals.
* Opening an envelope sealed with polymer glue may generate light that can be viewed as blue flashes in darkness.
* When sugar crystals are crushed, tiny electrical fields are created, separating positive and negative charges that create sparks while trying to reunite. Wint-O-Green Life Savers work especially well for creating such sparks, because wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate) is fluorescent and converts ultraviolet light into blue light.

A diamond may begin to glow while being rubbed; this occasionally happens to diamonds while a facet is being ground or the diamond is being sawn during the cutting process. Diamonds may fluoresce blue or red. Some other minerals, such as quartz, are triboluminescent, emitting light when rubbed together.

Triboluminescence as a biological phenomenon is observed in mechanical deformation and contact electrification of epidermal surface of osseous and soft tissues, during chewing food, at friction in joints of vertebrae, during sexual intercourse, and during blood circulation.

Water jet abrasive cutting of ceramics (e.g., tiles) creates a yellow/orange glow at the point of impact of very high-speed flow.

=== Chemicals notable for their triboluminescence ===
* Europium tetrakis (dibenzoylmethide)triethylammonium emits particularly bright red flashes upon the destruction of its crystals.
* Triphenylphosphinebis(pyridine)thiocyanatocopper(I) emits a reasonably strong blue light when crystals of it are fractured. This luminescence is not as extreme as the red luminescence; however, it is still very clearly visible to the naked eye in standard settings.
* N-acetylanthranilic acid emits a deep blue light when its crystals are fractured.

==Fractoluminescence==
&quot;Fractoluminescence&quot; is often used as a synonym for triboluminescence. It is the emission of light from the fracture (rather than rubbing) of a crystal, but fracturing often occurs with rubbing. Depending upon the atomic and molecular composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures, a charge separation can occur, making one side of the fractured crystal positively charged and the other side negatively charged. Like in triboluminescence, if the charge separation results in a large enough electric potential, a discharge across the gap and through the bath gas between the interfaces can occur. The potential at which this occurs depends upon the dielectric properties of the bath gas.

===EMR propagation during fracturing===
The emission of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) during plastic deformation and crack propagation in metals and rocks has been studied. The EMR emissions from metals and alloys have also been explored and confirmed. Molotskii presented a dislocation mechanism for this type of EMR emission. In 2005, Srilakshmi and Misra reported an additional phenomenon of secondary EMR during plastic deformation and crack propagation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys.

EMR during the micro-plastic deformation and crack propagation from several metals and alloys and transient magnetic field generation during necking in ferromagnetic metals were reported by Misra (1973–75), which have been confirmed and explored by several researchers. Tudik and Valuev (1980) were able to measure the EMR frequency during tensile fracture of iron and aluminum in the region 100 THz by using photomultipliers. Srilakshmi and Misra (2005a) also reported an additional phenomenon of secondary electromagnetic radiation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys. If a solid material is subjected to stresses of large amplitudes, which can cause plastic deformation and fracture, emissions such as thermal, acoustic, ions, and exo-emissions occur.

====Deformation induced EMR====
The study of deformation is essential for the development of new materials. Deformation in metals depends on temperature, type of stress applied, strain rate, oxidation, and corrosion. Deformation-induced EMR can be divided into three categories: effects in ionic crystal materials, effects in rocks and granites, and effects in metals and alloys. EMR emission depends on the orientation of the grains in individual crystals since material properties are different in differing directions. Amplitude of the EMR pulse increases as long as the crack grows as new atomic bonds are broken, leading to EMR. The Pulse starts to decay as the cracking halts. Observations from experiments showed that emitted EMR signals contain mixed frequency components.

====Test methods to measure EMR====
The most widely used tensile test method is used to characterize the mechanical properties of materials. From any complete tensile test record, one can obtain important information about the material&#x27;s elastic properties, the character and extent of plastic deformation, yield, and tensile strengths and toughness. The information obtained from one test justifies the extensive use of tensile tests in engineering materials research. Therefore, investigations of EMR emissions are mainly based on the tensile test of the specimens. From experiments, it can be shown that tensile crack formation excites more intensive EMR than shear cracking, increasing the elasticity, strength, and loading rate during uniaxial loading increases amplitude. Poisson&#x27;s ratio is a key parameter for EMR characterization during triaxial compression. If the Poisson&#x27;s ratio is lower, it is harder for the material to strain transversally and hence there is a higher probability of new fractures.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, a Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic process describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, &quot;What happens next depends only on the state of affairs &quot;now&quot;.&quot; A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Markov processes are named in honor of the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.

Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes. They provide the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, and have found application in areas including Bayesian statistics, biology, chemistry, economics, finance, information theory, physics, signal processing, and speech processing.

The adjectives &quot;Markovian&quot; and &quot;Markov&quot; are used to describe something that is related to a Markov process.

==Principles==
=== Definition ===
A Markov process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property (sometimes characterized as &quot;memorylessness&quot;). In simpler terms, it is a process for which predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based solely on its present state and—most importantly—such predictions are just as good as the ones that could be made knowing the process&#x27;s full history. In other words, conditional on the present state of the system, its future and past states are independent.

A Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either a discrete state space or a discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).

=== Types of Markov chains ===
The system&#x27;s state space and time parameter index need to be specified. The following table gives an overview of the different instances of Markov processes for different levels of state space generality and for discrete time v. continuous time:

Note that there is no definitive agreement in the literature on the use of some of the terms that signify special cases of Markov processes. Usually the term &quot;Markov chain&quot; is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is, a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), but a few authors use the term &quot;Markov process&quot; to refer to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) without explicit mention. In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see Markov model). Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.

While the time parameter is usually discrete, the state space of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space. However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or countably infinite state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see Variations). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.

=== Transitions ===
The changes of state of the system are called transitions. The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a transition matrix describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.

A discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps. The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the integers or natural numbers, and the random process is a mapping of these to states. The Markov property states that the conditional probability distribution for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.

Since the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future. However, the statistical properties of the system&#x27;s future can be predicted. In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.

==History==
Andrey Markov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906. Markov Processes in continuous time were discovered long before his work in the early 20th century in the form of the Poisson process. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences, motivated by a disagreement with Pavel Nekrasov who claimed independence was necessary for the weak law of large numbers to hold. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains.

In 1912 Henri Poincaré studied Markov chains on finite groups with an aim to study card shuffling. Other early uses of Markov chains include a diffusion model, introduced by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest in 1907, and a branching process, introduced by Francis Galton and Henry William Watson in 1873, preceding the work of Markov. After the work of Galton and Watson, it was later revealed that their branching process had been independently discovered and studied around three decades earlier by Irénée-Jules Bienaymé. Starting in 1928, Maurice Fréchet became interested in Markov chains, eventually resulting in him publishing in 1938 a detailed study on Markov chains.

Andrey Kolmogorov developed in a 1931 paper a large part of the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier&#x27;s 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener&#x27;s work on Einstein&#x27;s model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmogorov&#x27;s work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.

==Examples==

*Mark V. Shaney is a third-order Markov chain program, and a Markov text generator. It ingests the sample text (the Tao Te Ching, or the posts of a Usenet group) and creates a massive list of every sequence of three successive words (triplet) which occurs in the text. It then chooses two words at random, and looks for a word which follows those two in one of the triplets in its massive list. If there is more than one, it picks at random (identical triplets count separately, so a sequence which occurs twice is twice as likely to be picked as one which only occurs once). It then adds that word to the generated text. Then, in the same way, it picks a triplet that starts with the second and third words in the generated text, and that gives a fourth word. It adds the fourth word, then repeats with the third and fourth words, and so on.

*Random walks based on integers and the gambler&#x27;s ruin problem are examples of Markov processes. Some variations of these processes were studied hundreds of years earlier in the context of independent variables. Two important examples of Markov processes are the Wiener process, also known as the Brownian motion process, and the Poisson process, which are considered the most important and central stochastic processes in the theory of stochastic processes. These two processes are Markov processes in continuous time, while random walks on the integers and the gambler&#x27;s ruin problem are examples of Markov processes in discrete time.
*A famous Markov chain is the so-called &quot;drunkard&#x27;s walk&quot;, a random walk on the number line where, at each step, the position may change by +1 or −1 with equal probability. From any position there are two possible transitions, to the next or previous integer. The transition probabilities depend only on the current position, not on the manner in which the position was reached. For example, the transition probabilities from 5 to 4 and 5 to 6 are both 0.5, and all other transition probabilities from 5 are 0. These probabilities are independent of whether the system was previously in 4 or 6.
*A series of independent states (for example, a series of coin flips) satisfies the formal definition of a Markov chain. However, the theory is usually applied only when the probability distribution of the next state depends on the current one.

===A non-Markov example===
Suppose that there is a coin purse containing five coins worth 25¢, five coins worth 10¢ and five coins worth 5¢, and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If formula_1 represents the total value of the coins set on the table after draws, with formula_2, then the sequence formula_3 is &quot;not&quot; a Markov process.

To see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus formula_4. If we know not just formula_5, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that formula_6 with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value formula_5 we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about formula_8 are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to formula_5.

However, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining formula_1 to represent the &quot;total value&quot; of the coins on the table, we could define formula_1 to represent the &quot;count&quot; of the various coin types on the table. For instance, formula_12 could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model could be represented by formula_13 possible states, where each state represents the number of coins of each type (from 0 to 5) that are on the table. (Not all of these states are reachable within 6 draws.) Suppose that the first draw results in state formula_14. The probability of achieving formula_15 now depends on formula_16; for example, the state formula_17 is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the formula_18 state depends exclusively on the outcome of the formula_19 state.

==Formal definition==

===Discrete-time Markov chain===

A discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... with the Markov property, namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:

:formula_20 if both conditional probabilities are well defined, that is, if formula_21

The possible values of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; form a countable set &quot;S&quot; called the state space of the chain.

====Variations====
*Time-homogeneous Markov chains are processes where formula_22 for all &quot;n&quot;. The probability of the transition is independent of &quot;n&quot;.
*Stationary Markov chains are processes where formula_23 for all &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Every stationary chain can be proved to be time-homogeneous by Bayes&#x27; rule.A necessary and sufficient condition for a time-homogeneous Markov chain to be stationary is that the distribution of formula_24 is a stationary distribution of the Markov chain.
*A Markov chain with memory (or a Markov chain of order &quot;m&quot;) where &quot;m&quot; is finite, is a process satisfying formula_25 In other words, the future state depends on the past &quot;m&quot; states. It is possible to construct a chain formula_26 from formula_27 which has the &#x27;classical&#x27; Markov property by taking as state space the ordered &quot;m&quot;-tuples of &quot;X&quot; values, i.e., formula_28.

===Continuous-time Markov chain===

A continuous-time Markov chain (&quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot;)&quot;t&quot; ≥ 0 is defined by a finite or countable state space &quot;S&quot;, a transition rate matrix &quot;Q&quot; with dimensions equal to that of the state space and initial probability distribution defined on the state space. For &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;, the elements &quot;q&quot;&quot;ij&quot; are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state &quot;i&quot; to state &quot;j&quot;. The elements &quot;q&quot;&quot;ii&quot; are chosen such that each row of the transition rate matrix sums to zero, while the row-sums of a probability transition matrix in a (discrete) Markov chain are all equal to one.

There are three equivalent definitions of the process.

====Infinitesimal definition====

Let formula_29 be the random variable describing the state of the process at time &quot;t&quot;, and assume the process is in a state &quot;i&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;. 
Then, knowing formula_30, formula_31 is independent of previous values formula_32, and as &quot;h&quot; → 0 for all &quot;j&quot; and for all &quot;t&quot;,
formula_33
where formula_34 is the Kronecker delta, using the little-o notation.
The formula_35 can be seen as measuring how quickly the transition from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; happens.

====Jump chain/holding time definition====
Define a discrete-time Markov chain &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; to describe the &quot;n&quot;th jump of the process and variables &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, &quot;S&quot;3, ... to describe holding times in each of the states where &quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot; follows the exponential distribution with rate parameter −&quot;q&quot;&quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

====Transition probability definition====
For any value &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and times indexed up to this value of &quot;n&quot;: &quot;t&quot;0, &quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2, ... and all states recorded at these times &quot;i&quot;0, &quot;i&quot;1, &quot;i&quot;2, &quot;i&quot;3, ... it holds that
:formula_36
where &quot;p&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the solution of the forward equation (a first-order differential equation)
:formula_37

with initial condition P(0) is the identity matrix.

===Finite state space===
If the state space is finite, the transition probability distribution can be represented by a matrix, called the transition matrix, with the (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;)th element of P equal to
:formula_38

Since each row of P sums to one and all elements are non-negative, P is a right stochastic matrix.

====Stationary distribution relation to eigenvectors and simplices====
A stationary distribution is a (row) vector, whose entries are non-negative and sum to 1, is unchanged by the operation of transition matrix P on it and so is defined by
:formula_39

By comparing this definition with that of an eigenvector we see that the two concepts are related and that
:formula_40
is a normalized (formula_41) multiple of a left eigenvector e of the transition matrix P with an eigenvalue of 1. If there is more than one unit eigenvector then a weighted sum of the corresponding stationary states is also a stationary state. But for a Markov chain one is usually more interested in a stationary state that is the limit of the sequence of distributions for some initial distribution.

The values of a stationary distribution formula_42 are associated with the state space of P and its eigenvectors have their relative proportions preserved. Since the components of π are positive and the constraint that their sum is unity can be rewritten as formula_43 we see that the dot product of π with a vector whose components are all 1 is unity and that π lies on a simplex.

====Time-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state space====

If the Markov chain is time-homogeneous, then the transition matrix P is the same after each step, so the &quot;k&quot;-step transition probability can be computed as the &quot;k&quot;-th power of the transition matrix, P&quot;k&quot;.

If the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then there is a unique stationary distribution . Additionally, in this case P&quot;k&quot; converges to a rank-one matrix in which each row is the stationary distribution :
:formula_44
where 1 is the column vector with all entries equal to 1. This is stated by the Perron–Frobenius theorem. If, by whatever means, formula_45 is found, then the stationary distribution of the Markov chain in question can be easily determined for any starting distribution, as will be explained below.

For some stochastic matrices P, the limit formula_45 does not exist while the stationary distribution does, as shown by this example:
:formula_47
:formula_48
(This example illustrates a periodic Markov chain.)

Because there are a number of different special cases to consider, the process of finding this limit if it exists can be a lengthy task. However, there are many techniques that can assist in finding this limit. Let P be an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix, and define formula_49

It is always true that
:formula_50

Subtracting Q from both sides and factoring then yields
:formula_51
where I&quot;n&quot; is the identity matrix of size &quot;n&quot;, and 0&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot; is the zero matrix of size &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;. Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so Q must be a stochastic matrix (see the definition above). It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above and the fact that Q is a stochastic matrix to solve for Q. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in P is 1, there are &quot;n+1&quot; equations for determining &quot;n&quot; unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in Q and substitutes each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitutes the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector 0, and next left-multiplies this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find Q.

Here is one method for doing so: first, define the function &quot;f&quot;(A) to return the matrix A with its right-most column replaced with all 1&#x27;s. If [&quot;f&quot;(P − I&quot;n&quot;)]−1 exists then

:formula_52
:Explain: The original matrix equation is equivalent to a system of n×n linear equations in n×n variables. And there are n more linear equations from the fact that Q is a right stochastic matrix whose each row sums to 1. So it needs any n×n independent linear equations of the (n×n+n) equations to solve for the n×n variables. In this example, the n equations from &quot;Q multiplied by the right-most column of (P-In)&quot; have been replaced by the n stochastic ones.
One thing to notice is that if P has an element P&quot;i&quot;,&quot;i&quot; on its main diagonal that is equal to 1 and the &quot;i&quot;th row or column is otherwise filled with 0&#x27;s, then that row or column will remain unchanged in all of the subsequent powers P&quot;k&quot;. Hence, the &quot;i&quot;th row or column of Q will have the 1 and the 0&#x27;s in the same positions as in P.

====Convergence speed to the stationary distribution====
As stated earlier, from the equation formula_53 (if exists) the stationary (or steady state) distribution is a left eigenvector of row stochastic matrix P. Then assuming that P is diagonalizable or equivalently that P has &quot;n&quot; linearly independent eigenvectors, speed of convergence is elaborated as follows. (For non-diagonalizable, that is, defective matrices, one may start with the Jordan normal form of P and proceed with a bit more involved set of arguments in a similar way.)

Let U be the matrix of eigenvectors (each normalized to having an L2 norm equal to 1) where each column is a left eigenvector of P and let Σ be the diagonal matrix of left eigenvalues of P, that is, Σ = diag(&quot;λ&quot;1,&quot;λ&quot;2,&quot;λ&quot;3...,&quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Then by eigendecomposition
:formula_54

Let the eigenvalues be enumerated such that:
:formula_55

Since P is a row stochastic matrix, its largest left eigenvalue is 1. If there is a unique stationary distribution, then the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector is unique too (because there is no other which solves the stationary distribution equation above). Let u&quot;i&quot; be the &quot;i&quot;-th column of U matrix, that is, u&quot;i&quot; is the left eigenvector of P corresponding to λ&quot;i&quot;. Also let x be a length &quot;n&quot; row vector that represents a valid probability distribution; since the eigenvectors u&quot;i&quot; span formula_56 we can write
:formula_57

If we multiply x with P from right and continue this operation with the results, in the end we get the stationary distribution &#x27;. In other words, &#x27; = a1 u1 ← xPP...P = xP&quot;k&quot; as &quot;k&quot; → ∞. That means
:formula_58

Since &#x27; is parallel to u1(normalized by L2 norm) and &#x27;(&quot;k&quot;) is a probability vector, &#x27;(&quot;k&quot;) approaches to a1 u1 = &#x27; as &quot;k&quot; → ∞ with a speed in the order of &quot;λ&quot;2/&quot;λ&quot;1 exponentially. This follows because formula_59 hence &quot;λ&quot;2/&quot;λ&quot;1 is the dominant term. The smaller the ratio is, the faster the convergence is. Random noise in the state distribution can also speed up this convergence to the stationary distribution.

===General state space===
====Harris chains====
Many results for Markov chains with finite state space can be generalized to chains with uncountable state space through Harris chains.

The use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.

====Locally interacting Markov chains====
&quot;Locally interacting Markov chains&quot; are Markov chains with an evolution that takes into account the state of other Markov chains. This corresponds to the situation when the state space has a (Cartesian-) product form.
See interacting particle system and stochastic cellular automata (probabilistic cellular automata).
See for instance &quot;Interaction of Markov Processes&quot;
or.

==Properties==
Two states are said to &quot;communicate&quot; with each other if both are reachable from one another by a sequence of transitions that have positive probability. This is an equivalence relation which yields a set of communicating classes. A class is &quot;closed&quot; if the probability of leaving the class is zero. A Markov chain is &quot;irreducible&quot; if there is one communicating class, the state space.

A state has period if is the greatest common divisor of the number of transitions by which can be reached, starting from . That is:
:formula_60
The state is &quot;periodic&quot; if formula_61; otherwise formula_62 and the state is &quot;aperiodic&quot;.

A state &quot;i&quot; is said to be &quot;transient&quot; if, starting from &quot;i&quot;, there is a non-zero probability that the chain will never return to &quot;i&quot;. It is called &quot;recurrent&quot; (or &quot;persistent&quot;) otherwise. For a recurrent state &quot;i&quot;, the mean &quot;hitting time&quot; is defined as:
:formula_63

State &quot;i&quot; is &quot;positive recurrent&quot; if formula_64 is finite and &quot;null recurrent&quot; otherwise. Periodicity, transience, recurrence and positive and null recurrence are class properties — that is, if one state has the property then all states in its communicating class have the property.

A state &quot;i&quot; is called &quot;absorbing&quot; if there are no outgoing transitions from the state.

=== Irreducibility ===
Since periodicity is a class property, if a Markov chain is irreducible, then all its states have the same period. In particular, if one state is aperiodic, then the whole Markov chain is aperiodic.

If a finite Markov chain is irreducible, then all states are positive recurrent, and it has a unique stationary distribution given by formula_65.

===Ergodicity===
A state &quot;i&quot; is said to be &quot;ergodic&quot; if it is aperiodic and positive recurrent. In other words, a state &quot;i&quot; is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of 1, and has finite mean recurrence time.

If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic. Equivalently, there exists some integer formula_66 such that all entries of formula_67 are positive.

It can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number &quot;N&quot; such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number &quot;N&quot;. In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with &quot;N&quot; = 1.

A Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.

==== Terminology ====
Some authors call any irreducible, positive recurrent Markov chains ergodic, even periodic ones. In fact, merely irreducible Markov chains correspond to ergodic processes, defined according to ergodic theory.

Some authors call a matrix &quot;primitive&quot; iff there exists some integer formula_66 such that all entries of formula_67 are positive. Some authors call it &quot;regular&quot;.

==== Index of primitivity ====
The &quot;index of primitivity&quot;, or &quot;exponent&quot;, of a regular matrix, is the smallest formula_66 such that all entries of formula_67 are positive. The exponent is purely a graph-theoretic property, since it depends only on whether each entry of formula_72 is zero or positive, and therefore can be found on a directed graph with formula_73 as its adjacency matrix. 

There are several combinatorial results about the exponent when there are finitely many states. Let formula_74 be the number of states, then

* The exponent is formula_75. The only case where it is an equality is when the graph of formula_72 goes like formula_77.
* If formula_72 has formula_79 diagonal entries, then its exponent is formula_80.
* If formula_73 is symmetric, then formula_82 has positive diagonal entries, which by previous proposition means its exponent is formula_83.
* (Dulmage-Mendelsohn theorem) The exponent is formula_84 where formula_85 is the girth of the graph. It can be improved to formula_86, where formula_87 is the diameter of the graph.

=== Measure-preserving dynamical system ===
If a Markov chain has a stationary distribution, then it can be converted to a measure-preserving dynamical system: Let the probability space be formula_88, where formula_89 is the set of all states for the Markov chain. Let the sigma-algebra on the probability space be generated by the cylinder sets. Let the probability measure be generated by the stationary distribution, and the Markov chain transition. Let formula_90 be the shift operator: formula_91. Similarly we can construct such a dynamical system with formula_92 instead.

Since &quot;irreducible&quot; Markov chains with finite state spaces have a unique stationary distribution, the above construction is unambiguous for irreducible Markov chains.

In ergodic theory, a measure-preserving dynamical system is called &quot;ergodic&quot; iff any measurable subset formula_93 such that formula_94 implies formula_95 or formula_96 (up to a null set).

The terminology is inconsistent. Given a Markov chain with a stationary distribution that is strictly positive on all states, the Markov chain is &quot;irreducible&quot; iff its corresponding measure-preserving dynamical system is &quot;ergodic&quot;.

===Markovian representations===
In some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the &quot;current&quot; and &quot;future&quot; states. For example, let &quot;X&quot; be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process &quot;Y&quot;, such that each state of &quot;Y&quot; represents a time-interval of states of &quot;X&quot;. Mathematically, this takes the form:
:formula_97
If &quot;Y&quot; has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of &quot;X&quot;.

An example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an autoregressive time series of order greater than one.

===Hitting times===
The &quot;hitting time&quot; is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.

====Expected hitting times====
For a subset of states &quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;S&quot;, the vector &quot;k&quot;&quot;A&quot; of hitting times (where element formula_98 represents the expected value, starting in state &quot;i&quot; that the chain enters one of the states in the set &quot;A&quot;) is the minimal non-negative solution to

:formula_99

===Time reversal===
For a CTMC &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot;, the time-reversed process is defined to be formula_100. By Kelly&#x27;s lemma this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.

A chain is said to be &quot;reversible&quot; if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. Kolmogorov&#x27;s criterion states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.

=== Embedded Markov chain ===

One method of finding the stationary probability distribution, , of an ergodic continuous-time Markov chain, &quot;Q&quot;, is by first finding its embedded Markov chain (EMC). Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a jump process. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, &quot;S&quot;, is denoted by &quot;s&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, and represents the conditional probability of transitioning from state &quot;i&quot; into state &quot;j&quot;. These conditional probabilities may be found by

:formula_101

From this, &quot;S&quot; may be written as
:formula_102
where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix and diag(&quot;Q&quot;) is the diagonal matrix formed by selecting the main diagonal from the matrix &quot;Q&quot; and setting all other elements to zero.

To find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find formula_103 such that
:formula_104

with formula_103 being a row vector, such that all elements in formula_103 are greater than 0 and formula_107 = 1. From this, may be found as
:formula_108

(&quot;S&quot; may be periodic, even if &quot;Q&quot; is not. Once is found, it must be normalized to a unit vector.)

Another discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a δ-skeleton—the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at intervals of δ units of time. The random variables &quot;X&quot;(0), &quot;X&quot;(δ), &quot;X&quot;(2δ), ... give the sequence of states visited by the δ-skeleton.

== Special types of Markov chains ==

=== Markov model ===

Markov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:
===Bernoulli scheme===

A Bernoulli scheme is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is independent of even the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states). A Bernoulli scheme with only two possible states is known as a Bernoulli process.

Note, however, by the Ornstein isomorphism theorem, that every aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain is isomorphic to a Bernoulli scheme; thus, one might equally claim that Markov chains are a &quot;special case&quot; of Bernoulli schemes. The isomorphism generally requires a complicated recoding. The isomorphism theorem is even a bit stronger: it states that &quot;any&quot; stationary stochastic process is isomorphic to a Bernoulli scheme; the Markov chain is just one such example.

===Subshift of finite type===

When the Markov matrix is replaced by the adjacency matrix of a finite graph, the resulting shift is termed a topological Markov chain or a subshift of finite type. A Markov matrix that is compatible with the adjacency matrix can then provide a measure on the subshift. Many chaotic dynamical systems are isomorphic to topological Markov chains; examples include diffeomorphisms of closed manifolds, the Prouhet–Thue–Morse system, the Chacon system, sofic systems, context-free systems and block-coding systems.

==Applications==
Markov chains have been employed in a wide range of topics across the natural and social sciences, and in technological applications. They have been used for forecasting in several areas: for example, price trends, wind power, stochastic terrorism, and solar irradiance. The Markov chain forecasting models utilize a variety of settings, from discretizing the time series, to hidden Markov models combined with wavelets, and the Markov chain mixture distribution model (MCM).

===Physics===
Markovian systems appear extensively in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, whenever probabilities are used to represent unknown or unmodelled details of the system, if it can be assumed that the dynamics are time-invariant, and that no relevant history need be considered which is not already included in the state description. For example, a thermodynamic state operates under a probability distribution that is difficult or expensive to acquire. Therefore, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method can be used to draw samples randomly from a black-box to approximate the probability distribution of attributes over a range of objects.

Markov chains are used in lattice QCD simulations.

===Chemistry===
A reaction network is a chemical system involving multiple reactions and chemical species. The simplest stochastic models of such networks treat the system as a continuous time Markov chain with the state being the number of molecules of each species and with reactions modeled as possible transitions of the chain. Markov chains and continuous-time Markov processes are useful in chemistry when physical systems closely approximate the Markov property. For example, imagine a large number &quot;n&quot; of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is &quot;n&quot; times the probability a given molecule is in that state.

The classical model of enzyme activity, Michaelis–Menten kinetics, can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step the reaction proceeds in some direction. While Michaelis-Menten is fairly straightforward, far more complicated reaction networks can also be modeled with Markov chains.

An algorithm based on a Markov chain was also used to focus the fragment-based growth of chemicals in silico towards a desired class of compounds such as drugs or natural products. As a molecule is grown, a fragment is selected from the nascent molecule as the &quot;current&quot; state. It is not aware of its past (that is, it is not aware of what is already bonded to it). It then transitions to the next state when a fragment is attached to it. The transition probabilities are trained on databases of authentic classes of compounds.

Also, the growth (and composition) of copolymers may be modeled using Markov chains. Based on the reactivity ratios of the monomers that make up the growing polymer chain, the chain&#x27;s composition may be calculated (for example, whether monomers tend to add in alternating fashion or in long runs of the same monomer). Due to steric effects, second-order Markov effects may also play a role in the growth of some polymer chains.

Similarly, it has been suggested that the crystallization and growth of some epitaxial superlattice oxide materials can be accurately described by Markov chains.

===Biology===
Markov chains are used in various areas of biology. Notable examples include:
* Phylogenetics and bioinformatics, where most models of DNA evolution use continuous-time Markov chains to describe the nucleotide present at a given site in the genome.
* Population dynamics, where Markov chains are in particular a central tool in the theoretical study of matrix population models.
* Neurobiology, where Markov chains have been used, e.g., to simulate the mammalian neocortex.
* Systems biology, for instance with the modeling of viral infection of single cells.
* Compartmental models for disease outbreak and epidemic modeling.

===Testing===
Several theorists have proposed the idea of the Markov chain statistical test (MCST), a method of conjoining Markov chains to form a &quot;Markov blanket&quot;, arranging these chains in several recursive layers (&quot;wafering&quot;) and producing more efficient test sets—samples—as a replacement for exhaustive testing.

===Solar irradiance variability===
Solar irradiance variability assessments are useful for solar power applications. Solar irradiance variability at any location over time is mainly a consequence of the deterministic variability of the sun&#x27;s path across the sky dome and the variability in cloudiness. The variability of accessible solar irradiance on Earth&#x27;s surface has been modeled using Markov chains, also including modeling the two states of clear and cloudiness as a two-state Markov chain.

===Speech recognition===
Hidden Markov models have been used in automatic speech recognition systems.

===Information theory===
Markov chains are used throughout information processing. Claude Shannon&#x27;s famous 1948 paper &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, which in a single step created the field of information theory, opens by introducing the concept of entropy by modeling texts in a natural language (such as English) as generated by an ergodic Markov process, where each letter may depend statistically on previous letters. Such idealized models can capture many of the statistical regularities of systems. Even without describing the full structure of the system perfectly, such signal models can make possible very effective data compression through entropy encoding techniques such as arithmetic coding. They also allow effective state estimation and pattern recognition. Markov chains also play an important role in reinforcement learning.

Markov chains are also the basis for hidden Markov models, which are an important tool in such diverse fields as telephone networks (which use the Viterbi algorithm for error correction), speech recognition and bioinformatics (such as in rearrangements detection).

The LZMA lossless data compression algorithm combines Markov chains with Lempel-Ziv compression to achieve very high compression ratios.

===Queueing theory===
Markov chains are the basis for the analytical treatment of queues (queueing theory). Agner Krarup Erlang initiated the subject in 1917. This makes them critical for optimizing the performance of telecommunications networks, where messages must often compete for limited resources (such as bandwidth).

Numerous queueing models use continuous-time Markov chains. For example, an M/M/1 queue is a CTMC on the non-negative integers where upward transitions from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;i&quot; + 1 occur at rate &quot;λ&quot; according to a Poisson process and describe job arrivals, while transitions from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;i&quot; – 1 (for &quot;i&quot; &gt; 1) occur at rate &quot;μ&quot; (job service times are exponentially distributed) and describe completed services (departures) from the queue.

===Internet applications===

The PageRank of a webpage as used by Google is defined by a Markov chain. It is the probability to be at page formula_109 in the stationary distribution on the following Markov chain on all (known) webpages. If formula_110 is the number of known webpages, and a page formula_109 has formula_112 links to it then it has transition probability formula_113 for all pages that are linked to and formula_114 for all pages that are not linked to. The parameter formula_115 is taken to be about 0.15.

Markov models have also been used to analyze web navigation behavior of users. A user&#x27;s web link transition on a particular website can be modeled using first- or second-order Markov models and can be used to make predictions regarding future navigation and to personalize the web page for an individual user.

===Statistics===
Markov chain methods have also become very important for generating sequences of random numbers to accurately reflect very complicated desired probability distributions, via a process called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In recent years this has revolutionized the practicability of Bayesian inference methods, allowing a wide range of posterior distributions to be simulated and their parameters found numerically.

===Conflict and combat===
In 1971 a Naval Postgraduate School Master&#x27;s thesis proposed to model a variety of combat between adversaries as a Markov chain &quot;with states reflecting the control, maneuver, target acquisition, and target destruction actions of a weapons system&quot; and discussed the parallels between the resulting Markov chain and Lanchester&#x27;s laws.

In 1975 Duncan and Siverson remarked that Markov chains could be used to model conflict between state actors, and thought that their analysis would help understand &quot;the behavior of social and political organizations in situations of conflict.&quot;

===Economics and finance===
Markov chains are used in finance and economics to model a variety of different phenomena, including the distribution of income, the size distribution of firms, asset prices and market crashes. D. G. Champernowne built a Markov chain model of the distribution of income in 1953. Herbert A. Simon and co-author Charles Bonini used a Markov chain model to derive a stationary Yule distribution of firm sizes. Louis Bachelier was the first to observe that stock prices followed a random walk. The random walk was later seen as evidence in favor of the efficient-market hypothesis and random walk models were popular in the literature of the 1960s. Regime-switching models of business cycles were popularized by James D. Hamilton (1989), who used a Markov chain to model switches between periods of high and low GDP growth (or, alternatively, economic expansions and recessions). A more recent example is the Markov switching multifractal model of Laurent E. Calvet and Adlai J. Fisher, which builds upon the convenience of earlier regime-switching models. It uses an arbitrarily large Markov chain to drive the level of volatility of asset returns.

Dynamic macroeconomics makes heavy use of Markov chains. An example is using Markov chains to exogenously model prices of equity (stock) in a general equilibrium setting.

Credit rating agencies produce annual tables of the transition probabilities for bonds of different credit ratings.

===Social sciences===
Markov chains are generally used in describing path-dependent arguments, where current structural configurations condition future outcomes. An example is the reformulation of the idea, originally due to Karl Marx&#x27;s , tying economic development to the rise of capitalism. In current research, it is common to use a Markov chain to model how once a country reaches a specific level of economic development, the configuration of structural factors, such as size of the middle class, the ratio of urban to rural residence, the rate of political mobilization, etc., will generate a higher probability of transitioning from authoritarian to democratic regime.

===Music===
Markov chains are employed in algorithmic music composition, particularly in software such as Csound, Max, and SuperCollider. In a first-order chain, the states of the system become note or pitch values, and a probability vector for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be MIDI note values, frequency (Hz), or any other desirable metric.


A second-order Markov chain can be introduced by considering the current state &quot;and&quot; also the previous state, as indicated in the second table. Higher, &quot;n&quot;th-order chains tend to &quot;group&quot; particular notes together, while &#x27;breaking off&#x27; into other patterns and sequences occasionally. These higher-order chains tend to generate results with a sense of phrasal structure, rather than the &#x27;aimless wandering&#x27; produced by a first-order system.

Markov chains can be used structurally, as in Xenakis&#x27;s Analogique A and B. Markov chains are also used in systems which use a Markov model to react interactively to music input.

Usually musical systems need to enforce specific control constraints on the finite-length sequences they generate, but control constraints are not compatible with Markov models, since they induce long-range dependencies that violate the Markov hypothesis of limited memory. In order to overcome this limitation, a new approach has been proposed.

===Games and sports===
Markov chains can be used to model many games of chance. The children&#x27;s games Snakes and Ladders and &quot;Hi Ho! Cherry-O&quot;, for example, are represented exactly by Markov chains. At each turn, the player starts in a given state (on a given square) and from there has fixed odds of moving to certain other states (squares).

Markov chain models have been used in advanced baseball analysis since 1960, although their use is still rare. Each half-inning of a baseball game fits the Markov chain state when the number of runners and outs are considered. During any at-bat, there are 24 possible combinations of number of outs and position of the runners. Mark Pankin shows that Markov chain models can be used to evaluate runs created for both individual players as well as a team.
He also discusses various kinds of strategies and play conditions: how Markov chain models have been used to analyze statistics for game situations such as bunting and base stealing and differences when playing on grass vs. AstroTurf.

===Markov text generators===
Markov processes can also be used to generate superficially real-looking text given a sample document. Markov processes are used in a variety of recreational &quot;parody generator&quot; software (see dissociated press, Jeff Harrison, Mark V. Shaney, and Academias Neutronium). Several open-source text generation libraries using Markov chains exist.

<text>Diamond cutting is the practice of shaping a diamond from a rough stone into a faceted gem. Cutting diamonds requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty.

The first guild of diamond cutters and polishers (Diamantaire) was formed in 1375 in Nuremberg, Germany, and led to the development of various types of &quot;cut&quot;. This has two meanings in relation to diamonds. The first is the shape: square, oval, and so on. The second relates to the specific quality of cut within the shape, and the quality and price will vary greatly based on the cut quality. Since diamonds are one of the hardest materials, special diamond-coated surfaces are used to grind the diamond down. The first major development in diamond cutting came with the &quot;Point Cut&quot; during the later half of the 14th century: the Point Cut follows the natural shape of an octahedral rough diamond crystal, eliminating some waste in the cutting process.

Diamond cutting, as well as overall processing, is concentrated in a few cities around the world. The main diamond trading centers are Antwerp, Tel Aviv, and Dubai from where roughs are sent to the main processing centers of India and China. Diamonds are cut and polished in Surat, India and the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen. India in recent years has held between 90% of the world market in polished diamonds and China has held the rest of the world market share in a recent year. Other important diamond centers are New York City and Amsterdam.

==Diamond cutting process==
The basic diamond cutting process includes these steps; &quot;planning&quot;, &quot;cleaving&quot; or &quot;sawing&quot;, &quot;bruting&quot;, &quot;polishing&quot;, and &quot;final inspection&quot;. A simplified round brilliant cut process includes the following stages:
* Planning – Modern day planning of a diamond is done using computer software. 
* Marking – Outlining the best possible shape and cut of the diamond.
* Sawing the rough stone – depending on the shape of rough diamond as not all diamonds are sawn.
* Table
* Bruting the girdle.
* Blocking 8 main pavilion facets – these facets are divided into 4 corners and 4 pavilions as the corners and pavilions run in different directions due to the atomic structure of the diamond.
* Crown – the crown consist of 8 main facets and are divided into 4 corners and 4 Bezels.
* Final bruting – ensuring the diamonds girdle is perfectly round and smooth. 
* Polishing all 16 main facets.
* Brillianteering – Adding and polishing 8 stars and 16 pavilion and 16 crown halves.
* Quality control – checking for symmetry, polish and cut (angles) after the diamond is completed.

This is just one, although a fairly common way of creating a round brilliant cut. The actual process also includes many more stages depending on the size and quality of the rough stone. For example, bigger stones are first scanned to get the three-dimensional shape, which is then used to find the optimal usage. The scanning may be repeated after each stage and bruting may be done in several steps, each bringing the girdle closer to the final shape.

It is possible only because the hardness of diamond varies widely according to the direction in which one is trying to cut or grind.

===Planning===
Diamond manufacturers analyze diamond rough from an economic perspective, with two objectives steering decisions made about how a faceted diamond will be cut. The first objective is that of maximum return on investment for the piece of diamond rough. The second is how quickly the finished diamond can be sold. Scanning devices are used to get a 3-dimensional computer model of the rough stone. Also, inclusions are photographed and placed on the 3D model, which is then used to find an optimal way to cut the stone.

====Maximizing value====

The process of maximizing the value of finished diamonds, from a rough diamond into a polished gemstone, is both an art and a science. The choice of cut is influenced by many factors. Market factors include the exponential increase in value of diamonds as weight increases, referred to as &quot;weight retention&quot;, and the popularity of certain shapes amongst consumers. Physical factors include the original shape of the rough stone, and location of the inclusions and flaws to be eliminated.

=====Weight retention=====
The weight retention analysis studies the diamond rough to find the best combination of finished stones as it relates to &quot;per carat&quot; value. For instance, a 2.20-carat (440 mg) octahedron may produce (i) either two half-carat (100 mg) diamonds whose combined value may be higher than that of (ii) a 0.80-carat (160 mg) diamond plus a 0.30-carat (60 mg) diamond that could be cut from the same rough diamond.

The round brilliant cut and square brilliant cuts are preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly shaped crystals, such as macles are more likely to be cut in a &quot;fancy cut&quot;—that is, a cut other than the round brilliant—which the particular crystal shape lends itself to.

Even with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight, about 50%. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve the weight. Since the per-carat price of a diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat (200 mg) diamonds are the result of compromising &quot;cut quality&quot; for &quot;carat weight&quot;.

=====Color retention=====

In colored diamonds, cutting can influence the color grade of the diamond, thereby raising its value. Certain cut shapes are used to intensify the color of the diamond. The radiant cut is an example of this type of cut.

Natural green color diamonds most often have merely a surface coloration caused by natural irradiation, which does not extend through the stone. For this reason green diamonds are cut with significant portions of the original rough diamond&#x27;s surface (&quot;naturals&quot;) left on the finished gem. It is these &quot;naturals&quot; that provide the color to the diamond.

====Turnaround minimization====
The other consideration of diamond planning is how quickly a diamond will sell. This consideration is often unique to the type of manufacturer. While a certain cutting plan may yield a better value, a different plan may yield diamonds that will sell sooner, providing an earlier return on the investment.

===Cleaving or sawing===
Cleaving is the separation of a piece of diamond rough into separate pieces, to be finished as separate gems. During the planning stage, diamond manufacturers identify cleavage planes, and use those planes to decide how to split the diamond. Diamond manufacturers make a groove in the diamond with a laser or saw or another diamond, and then split the diamond by placing a steel blade in the groove and giving a gentle tap. Cleavage can be along any of the four planes parallel to the faces of an octahedral diamond (i.e. perpendicular to body diagonals of the unit cell).

Sawing is the use of a diamond saw or laser to cut the diamond rough into separate pieces. Unlike cleaving, this step does not involve cleavage planes. This step gives diamonds their initial shape.

===Bruting===
Bruting is the art of cutting a diamond to make the girdle round. In the modern era diamonds are rounded using either a laser, a diamond disk impregnated with diamonds, or spinning two diamonds so they cut against each other. Industrial diamonds can also be used for bruting a diamond round. Modern computer software measures the roundness of each diamond and &quot;ideal cut&quot; diamonds have to round within a tenth of a millimeter to qualify as an excellent cut diamond.

===Diamond polishing===

Diamond polishing is the final polishing of the diamond. In a diamond factory, one would find a diamond &quot;crossworker&quot; who first places the main facets on a diamond (blocking the diamond). This is done to ensure maximum weight, clarity and best angles for the specific shape of diamond. After initial crossworking is complete, the diamond is finalized by smoothing the main facets by the crossworker, which is known as polishing the diamond. After the main facets have been polished by the crossworker, the final facets are polished onto the diamond by a &quot;brillianteer&quot;. The facets added are the stars, top and bottom halves are also known as upper and lower girdle facets.

===Final inspection===
The final stage involves thoroughly cleaning the diamond in acids, and examining the diamond to see whether it meets the quality standards of the manufacturer.

==Recutting==
Due to changes in market desirability and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuates. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value at that time in the market and desirability. An example of this is the &quot;marquise&quot; cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or pear shape. The &quot;marquise&quot; can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5 to 10% in total weight. For example, a 1.10-carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a pear shape instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the pear shape.

In the 18th century there was a trend for recutting Indian diamonds to suit English tastes. The Koh-i-Noor&#x27;s original cut weighed a little over 186.00 carats. When it was recut to an oval-shaped brilliant, almost 80 carats were lost.

Other aspects are affected in recutting for value as well, such as the clarity. If an original shape contained inclusions on the tips, the recut would yield an increase in clarity since trimming down to a new shape would yield a cleaner overall finished diamond.

<doc id="60878" wikidata="Q615544" url="?curid=60878" title="The Lion in Winter">
<text>The Lion in Winter is a 1966 play by James Goldman, depicting the personal and political conflicts of Henry II of England, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, their children and their guests during Christmas 1183. It premiered on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre on March 3, 1966, starring Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Eleanor. It was adapted by Goldman into an Academy Award-winning 1968 film of the same name, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Katharine Hepburn. The play has been produced numerous times, including Broadway and West End revivals.

==Synopsis==

Set during Christmas 1183 at Henry II of England&#x27;s castle in Chinon, Anjou, Angevin Empire, the play opens with the arrival of Henry&#x27;s wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he has had imprisoned since 1173. The story concerns the gamesmanship between Henry, Eleanor, their three surviving sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, and their Christmas Court guest, the King of France, Philip II &quot;Augustus&quot; (), who was the son of Eleanor&#x27;s ex-husband, Louis VII of France (by his third wife, Adelaide). Also involved is Philip&#x27;s half-sister Alais (by Louis VII&#x27;s second wife Constance), who has been at court since she was betrothed to Richard at age eight, but has since become Henry&#x27;s mistress.

==Productions==
The play premiered at the Ambassador Theatre on March 3, 1966, playing for 92 performances and closing on May 21, 1966. Directed by Noel Willman, it starred Robert Preston as Henry, Rosemary Harris as Eleanor, James Rado as Richard, Christopher Walken as Philip, and Suzanne Grossman as Alais. Harris won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.

Screen legend Joan Fontaine starred as Eleanor in a 1979 Vienna&#x27;s English Theatre (VET) production, whose director Cyril Frankel had helmed Fontaine&#x27;s 1966 vehicle &quot;The Witches&quot; (which would prove her cinematic swansong). Headlining an otherwise British cast, Fontaine spent a month rehearsing in London prior to the production&#x27;s October premiere in Vienna for a projected run into the winter with further European engagements TBA, Fontaine hoping the production would afford her a London stage debut. In fact, after her second performance in Vienna, Fontaine would be sidelined by pneumonia: the actress would recall that the production was resultantly canceled although there are indications of further performances with VET regular Mary Martlew stepping into the role of Eleanor. Fontaine had grown enamored of the role of Eleanor to the point of hoping to headline an American tour leading to a Broadway revival: however Fontaine would only be able to headline two regional theatrical productions of the play, firstly at the Fiesta Dinner Playhouse in San Antonio in May/June 1982 followed by a December 1980/January 1981 production at the Beverly Dinner Playhouse in New Orleans, the latter directed by Eric Berry and featuring Andrew Parks as Geoffrey. Nevertheless, in 2008 Fontaine, then aged 91, would advise &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that &quot;Eleanor of Aquitaine...was my all-time favorite role&quot;.

Veteran screen actor George Peppard (&quot;The A-Team&quot;) produced and starred in a 1992 production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; which ran at the Walnut Street Theatre (Philadelphia) from January 11 to February 16; co-starring Susan Clark as Eleanor, the production encored March 24 to April 5 at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse (Palm Beach) and April 7 to April 26 at Parker Playhouse (Fort Lauderdale).

The play made its professional British debut in 1994 with a touring version with David McCallum as Henry and Siân Phillips as Eleanor headlining a cast which included Victor McGuire as Richard, Stephen McGann as Geoffrey, and Christien Anholt as Philip. Subsequent to its January 25 to February 12 premiere engagement at the Churchill Theatre (Bromley), the production played engagements at the Richmond Theatre, affording the play its London area debut with a February 21 to 26 engagement, Darlington Civic Theatre, and New Victoria Theatre (Woking), before wrapping with an April 4 to 9 engagement at Theatre Royal, Bath. &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; would not make its West End debut until 2011 when a production directed by Trevor Nunn and headlined by Robert Lindsay as Henry and Joanna Lumley as Eleanor opened at Theatre Royal Haymarket on November 15. Also featuring Tom Bateman as Richard, James Norton as Geoffrey, and Rory Fleck-Byrne as Philip, the production&#x27;s limited run ended on January 28, 2012.

In 1999 Roundabout Theatre Company returned &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; to Broadway for a limited (March 11 to May 30) run at the Olympia Theatre. Starring Laurence Fishburne as Henry and Stockard Channing as Eleanor, the latter earning a Tony nomination, the production was directed by Michael Mayer, and also featured Neal Huff as Geoffrey, Keith Nobbs as John, Roger Howarth as Philip, and Emily Bergl as Alais.

Dee Hoty played Eleanor opposite Randall Duk Kim as Henry at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts from August 14 to 26, 2000, Hoty stepping in when originally-cast Sharon Gless had a scheduling conflict. Hoty would again play Eleanor in a Two River Theater (Monmouth County NJ) production starring Michael Cumpsty as Henry which ran November 18 to December 4, 2016. The play was produced in 2002 by the Unseam&#x27;d Shakespeare Company.

In 2011 Stephanie Zimbalist and Eric Pierpoint starred as Eleanor and Henry in a Santa Barbara production which ran at the Alcehama Theater December 1 to 18, 2011: co-starring Rick Cosnett as Richard and Daniel David Stewart as John, the production was directed by Jenny Sullivan. The play formed part of the summer and fall 2012 seasons at the American Shakespeare Center&#x27;s Blackfriars Playhouse, presented in complementary repertory with William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot;. A 2014 production by the Colony Theater Company in Burbank, California starred Mariette Hartley as Eleanor and Ian Buchanan as Henry. Brendan Ford played Richard, and Hartley&#x27;s daughter Justine as Alais, directed by Stephanie Vlahos.

A 2016 Guthrie Theater (Minneapolis) production starring Laila Robins as Eleanor and Kevyn Morrow as Henry ran from November 19 to December 31. Veteran soap opera stars Robert Newman and Kim Zimmer - supercouple Josh Lewis and Reva Shayne on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; - played Henry and Eleanor in a 2017 production which ran July 25 to August 6 at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan. In 2018 Tom Butcher (&quot;The Bill&quot;) starred as Henry in the English Theatre Frankfurt (August 31 to October 18) production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. In 2019 Sheldon Epps directed the Laguna Playhouse (November 10 to 24) production which starred Gregory Harrison as Henry, Frances Fisher as Eleanor, and Burt Grinstead as Richard.

James Goldman’s &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; played at Court Theatre, Chicago, Illinois from November 3 to December 3, 2024.  John Hoogenakker portrayed King Henry II.  Rounding out the talented cast were Rebecca Spence, Kenneth La’Ron Hamilton, Brandon Miller, Shane Kenyon, Netta Walker, and Anthony Baldasare.

==Characters==
*Henry II, King of England (Male, 50) – Though aging, Henry is still very nearly as vital as he ever was. His manipulations of family and others are portrayed as spontaneous and emotional as opposed to the well-thought-out stratagems of Eleanor, and the cold, calculating machinations of Geoffrey.
*Queen Eleanor (Female, 61) – Eleanor is the wife of Henry and a beautiful woman of hot temperament, and great authority and presence. She has been a queen for nearly 46 years and is thoroughly capable of holding her own in a man&#x27;s world. She schemes against Henry and loves him intensely at the same time. She has contempt for her children but is not willing to see them harmed.
*John (Male, 16) – He is the youngest son of Henry and Eleanor. He is sulky and sullen, with a boyish outlook on his position; many in the play describe him as a spoiled brat. He is described in the play as pimply and smelling of compost. He is Henry&#x27;s favourite, but also the weakest. He vacillates throughout the play, not out of cleverness, but out of fear and weakness. He is easily tricked and manipulated by Geoffrey.
*Geoffrey (Male, 25) – He is a son of Henry and Eleanor, and a man of energy and action. He is attractive, charming and has the strongest intellect of the family; he is also a cold, amoral schemer. His view of himself is of one who yearned greatly for the love of his parents while receiving none. Yet the play leaves open to question whether any of Henry&#x27;s three sons should be thought to have been truly loved by either Henry or Eleanor, and not merely used by King and Queen as pawns in their ceaseless scheming against one another. 
*Richard (Male, 26) – The eldest surviving son of Henry and Eleanor, their second son Henry having recently died. Richard is handsome, graceful and impressive and has been a famous soldier since his middle teens. War is his profession and he is good at it. He is easily the strongest and toughest of the three sons/princes. Richard and Philip II have been sexually involved prior to the action of the play. However, Philip declares that he participated in the affair purely for political purposes, whereas Richard indicates he had genuine affection for Philip.
*Alais Capet (Female, 23) – She is in love with Henry. Everyone underestimates her intellect and power. She is initially portrayed as innocent, but by the end of the play has begun to acquire a ruthless streak of her own, insisting that Henry imprison his three sons for the rest of their lives in the dungeon.
*Philip II, King of France (Male, 18) – He has been King of France for three years. He is not initially as accomplished as Henry in manipulating people, but seems to acquire greater skills at this during the play. He is impressive and handsome without being pretty.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; is fictional, and none of the dialogue and actions is historical. There was not a Christmas Court at Chinon in 1183, but the events leading up to the story are generally accurate. There is no definitive evidence that Alais was Henry&#x27;s mistress (although Richard later resisted marrying Alais on the basis of that claim). The real Henry had many mistresses (and several illegitimate children). Eleanor had persuaded their sons to rebel against Henry in 1173, and for her role in the rebellion, she was imprisoned by Henry until his death in 1189. While some historians have theorized that Richard was homosexual, historians remain divided on the question.

==Dramatic adaptations==

===Films===
The play was adapted into a 1968 film, with Peter O&#x27;Toole as Henry and Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor, and a 2003 television movie with Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close.

===Pastiches and parodies===
A radio parody of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; entitled &quot;The Leopard in Autumn&quot; by Neil Anthony was originally broadcast in BBC Radio 4 in 2001 and 2002 and re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011. Broadcast in two series, it starred David Swift as Prince Ludovico, the ambitious and henpecked ruler of Monte Guano (the smallest and most inconsequential city-state in Renaissance Italy), Siân Phillips as his wife Princess Plethora, Graham Crowden as Francesco (Ludovico&#x27;s perpetually drunken secretary), Saskia Wickham as Countess Rosalie (Ludovico&#x27;s mistress [with Plethora&#x27;s full knowledge and approval]), and as Ludovico&#x27;s perpetually squabbling sons: Nick Romero as the excessively religious Salvatore (whose ambition is to become Pope some day), Paul Bigley as Allesandro (an eternally hopeful would-be artist and inventor) and Christopher Kellen as Guido (a fierce follower of Martin Luther).

The Fox TV drama &quot;Empire&quot; is explicitly based on &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. It concerns a dysfunctional family that owns a record label named Empire, with all the members scheming and manipulating for power. There are numerous allusions to the play: the family is named Lyon, the father runs an empire while the mother, a very formidable woman, has been imprisoned for many years. Together, they have three sons: a serious, studious, master manipulator son; an intelligent, talented son, who is gay and the mother&#x27;s favorite but rejected by the father; and a youngest son who is a favorite of the father, but who is spoiled and irresponsible. The recently freed mother schemes with the father and three sons for control of their empire, while at the same time slinging numerous verbal barbs at each other.

<text>Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon, in which a material emits light in response to the passage of an electric current or to a strong electric field. This is distinct from black body light emission resulting from heat (incandescence), chemical reactions (chemiluminescence), reactions in a liquid (electrochemiluminescence), sound (sonoluminescence), or other mechanical action (mechanoluminescence), or 
organic electroluminescence.

==Mechanism==

Electroluminescence is the result of radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a material, usually a semiconductor. The excited electrons release their energy as photons – light. Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by doping the material to form a p-n junction (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as light-emitting diodes) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the phosphors in electroluminescent displays).

It has been recently shown that as a solar cell improves its light-to-electricity efficiency (improved open-circuit voltage), it will also improve its electricity-to-light (EL) efficiency.

==Characteristics==

Electroluminescent technologies have low power consumption compared to competing lighting technologies, such as neon or fluorescent lamps. This, together with the thinness of the material, has made EL technology valuable to the advertising industry. Relevant advertising applications include electroluminescent billboards and signs. EL manufacturers can control precisely which areas of an electroluminescent sheet illuminate, and when. This has given advertisers the ability to create more dynamic advertising that is still compatible with traditional advertising spaces.

An EL film is a so-called Lambertian radiator: unlike with neon lamps, filament lamps, or LEDs, the brightness of the surface appears the same from all angles of view; electroluminescent light is not directional. The light emitted from the surface is perfectly homogeneous and is well-perceived by the eye. EL film produces single-frequency (monochromatic) light that has a very narrow bandwidth, is uniform and visible from a great distance.

In principle, EL lamps can be made in any color. However, the commonly used greenish color closely matches the peak sensitivity of human vision, producing the greatest apparent light output for the least electrical power input. Unlike neon and fluorescent lamps, EL lamps are not negative resistance devices so no extra circuitry is needed to regulate the amount of current flowing through them. A new technology now being used is based on multispectral phosphors that emit light from 600 to 400nm depending on the drive frequency; this is similar to the color-changing effect seen with aqua EL sheet but on a larger scale.

==Examples of electroluminescent materials==
Electroluminescent devices are fabricated using either organic or inorganic electroluminescent materials. The active materials are generally semiconductors of wide enough bandwidth to allow the exit of the light.

The most typical inorganic thin-film EL (TFEL) is ZnS:Mn with yellow-orange emission. Examples of the range of EL material include:
* Powdered zinc sulfide doped with copper (producing greenish light) or silver (producing bright blue light)
* Thin-film zinc sulfide doped with manganese (producing orange-red color)
* Naturally blue diamond, which includes a trace of boron that acts as a dopant.
* Semiconductors containing Group III and Group V elements, such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium nitride (GaN) (Light-emitting diodes).
* Certain organic semiconductors, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+(PF6−)2, where bpy is 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine
* Terbium oxide (yellow-green light)

==Practical implementations==
The most common electroluminescent (EL) devices are composed of either powder (primarily used in lighting applications) or thin films (for information displays.)

=== Light-emitting capacitor (LEC) ===

&quot;Light-emitting capacitor&quot;, or LEC, is a term used since at least 1961 to describe electroluminescent panels. General Electric has patents dating to 1938 on flat electroluminescent panels that are still made as night lights and backlights for instrument panel displays. Electroluminescent panels are a capacitor where the dielectric between the outside plates is a phosphor that gives off photons when the capacitor is charged. By making one of the contacts transparent, the large area exposed emits light.

Electroluminescent automotive instrument panel backlighting, with each gauge pointer also an individual light source, entered production on 1960 Chrysler and Imperial passenger cars, and was continued successfully on several Chrysler vehicles through 1967 and marketed as &quot;Panelescent Lighting&quot;.

=== Night lights ===
The Sylvania Lighting Division in Salem and Danvers, Massachusetts, produced and marketed an EL night light, under the trade name &quot;Panelescent&quot; at roughly the same time that the Chrysler instrument panels entered production. These lamps have proven extremely reliable, with some samples known to be still functional after nearly 50 years of continuous operation.

Later in the 1960s, Sylvania&#x27;s Electronic Systems Division in Needham, Massachusetts developed and manufactured several instruments for the Apollo Lunar Module and Command Module using electroluminescent display panels manufactured by the Electronic Tube Division of Sylvania at Emporium, Pennsylvania. Raytheon in Sudbury, Massachusetts manufactured the Apollo Guidance Computer, which used a Sylvania electroluminescent display panel as part of its display-keyboard interface (DSKY).

=== Display backlighting ===

Powder phosphor-based electroluminescent panels are frequently used as backlights for liquid crystal displays. They readily provide gentle, even illumination for the entire display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is common in the technological world.

EL backlights require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts). For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a boost converter circuit within the device. This converter often makes a faintly audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. Line-voltage-operated devices may be activated directly from the power line; some electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.

Thin-film phosphor electroluminescence was first commercialized during the 1980s by Sharp Corporation in Japan, Finlux (Oy Lohja Ab) in Finland, and Planar Systems in the US. In these devices, bright, long-life light emission is achieved in thin-film yellow-emitting manganese-doped zinc sulfide material. Displays using this technology were manufactured for medical and vehicle applications where ruggedness and wide viewing angles were crucial, and liquid crystal displays were not well developed. In 1992, Timex introduced its Indiglo EL display on some watches.

Recently, blue-, red-, and green-emitting thin film electroluminescent materials that offer the potential for long life and full-color electroluminescent displays have been developed.

The EL material must be enclosed between two electrodes and at least one electrode must be transparent to allow the escape of the produced light. Glass coated with indium tin oxide is commonly used as the front (transparent) electrode, while the back electrode is coated with reflective metal. Additionally, other transparent conducting materials, such as carbon nanotube coatings or PEDOT can be used as the front electrode.

The display applications are primarily passive (i.e., voltages are driven from the edge of the display cf. driven from a transistor on the display). Similar to LCD trends, there have also been Active Matrix EL (AMEL) displays demonstrated, where the circuitry is added to prolong voltages at each pixel. The solid-state nature of TFEL allows for a very rugged and high-resolution display fabricated even on silicon substrates. AMEL displays of 1280×1024 at over 1000 lines per inch (LPI) have been demonstrated by a consortium including Planar Systems.

==Thick-film dielectric electroluminescent technology==
Thick-film dielectric electroluminescent technology (TDEL) is a phosphor-based flat panel display technology developed by Canadian company iFire Technology Corp. TDEL is based on inorganic electroluminescent (IEL) technology that combines both thick-and thin-film processes. The TDEL structure is made with glass or other substrates, consisting of a thick-film dielectric layer and a thin-film phosphor layer sandwiched between two sets of electrodes to create a matrix of pixels. Inorganic phosphors within this matrix emit light in the presence of an alternating electric field.

===Color By Blue===
Color By Blue (CBB) was developed in 2003. The Color By Blue process achieves higher luminance and better performance than the previous triple pattern process, with increased contrast, grayscale rendition, and color uniformity across the panel. Color By Blue is based on the physics of photoluminescence. High luminance inorganic blue phosphor is used in combination with specialized color conversion materials, which absorb the blue light and re-emit red or green light, to generate the other colors.

==New applications==
Electroluminescent lighting is now used as an application for public safety identification involving alphanumeric characters on the roof of vehicles for clear visibility from an aerial perspective.

Electroluminescent lighting, especially electroluminescent wire (EL wire), has also made its way into clothing as many designers have brought this technology to the entertainment and nightlife industry. From 2006, t-shirts with an electroluminescent panel stylized as an audio equalizer, the T-Qualizer, saw a brief period of popularity.

Engineers have developed an electroluminescent &quot;skin&quot; that can stretch more than six times its original size while still emitting light. This hyper-elastic light-emitting capacitor (HLEC) can endure more than twice the strain of previously tested stretchable displays. It consists of layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwiching an insulating elastomer sheet. The elastomer changes luminance and capacitance when stretched, rolled, and otherwise deformed. In addition to its ability to emit light under a strain of greater than 480% of its original size, the group&#x27;s HLEC was shown to be capable of being integrated into a soft robotic system. Three six-layer HLEC panels were bound together to form a crawling soft robot, with the top four layers making up the light-up skin and the bottom two the pneumatic actuators. The discovery could lead to significant advances in health care, transportation, electronic communication and other areas.

<text>This is a list of electrical phenomena. Electrical phenomena are a somewhat arbitrary division of electromagnetic phenomena.

Some examples are:

*Atmospheric electricity
*Biefeld–Brown effect — Thought by the person who coined the name, Thomas Townsend Brown, to be an anti-gravity effect, it is generally attributed to electrohydrodynamics (EHD) or sometimes electro-fluid-dynamics, a counterpart to the well-known magneto-hydrodynamics.
*Bioelectrogenesis — The generation of electricity by living organisms.
*Capacitive coupling — Transfer of energy within an electrical network or between distant networks by means of displacement current.
*Contact electrification — The phenomenon of electrification by contact. When two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged (οne negative charge, one positive charge).
*Corona effect — Build-up of charges in a high-voltage conductor (common in AC transmission lines), which ionizes the air and produces visible light, usually purple.
*Dielectric polarization — Orientation of charges in certain insulators inside an external static electric field, such as when a charged object is brought close, which produces an electric field inside the insulator.
*Direct Current — (old: Galvanic Current) or &quot;continuous current&quot;; The continuous flow of electricity through a conductor such as a wire from high to low potential.
*Electromagnetic induction — Production of a voltage by a time-varying magnetic flux.
*Electroluminescence — The phenomenon wherein a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field.
*Electrostatic induction — Redistribution of charges in a conductor inside an external static electric field, such as when a charged object is brought close.
*Electrical conduction — The movement of electrically charged particles through transmission medium.
*Electric shock — Physiological reaction of a biological organism to the passage of electric current through its body.
*Ferranti effect — A rise in the amplitude of the AC voltage at the receiving end of a transmission line, compared with the sending-end voltage, due to the capacitance between the conductors, when the receiving end is open-circuited.
*Ferroelectric effect — The phenomenon whereby certain ionic crystals may exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment.
*Hall effect — Separation of charges in a current-carrying conductor inside an external magnetic field, which produces a voltage across the conductor.
*Inductance — The phenomenon whereby the property of a circuit by which energy is stored in the form of an electromagnetic field.
*Induction heating — Heat produced in a conductor when eddy currents pass through it.
*Joule heating — Heat produced in a conductor when charges move through it, such as in resistors and wires.
*Lightning — powerful natural electrostatic discharge produced during a thunderstorm. Lightning&#x27;s abrupt electric discharge is accompanied by the emission of light.
*Noise and electromagnetic interference — Unwanted and usually random disturbance in an electrical signal. A Faraday cage can be used to attenuate electromagnetic fields, even to avoid the discharge from a Tesla coil.
*Photoconductivity — The phenomenon in which a material becomes more conductive due to the absorption of electro-magnetic radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet light, or gamma radiation.
*Photoelectric effect — Emission of electrons from a surface (usually metallic) upon exposure to, and absorption of, electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light and ultraviolet radiation).
*Photovoltaic effect — Production of a voltage by light exposure.
*Piezoelectric effect — Ability of certain crystals to generate a voltage in response to applied mechanical stress.
*Plasma — Plasma occur when gas is heated to very high temperatures and it disassociates into positive and negative charges.
*Proximity effect — Redistribution of charge flow in a conductor carrying alternating current when there are other nearby current-carrying conductors.
*Pyroelectric effect — The potential created in certain materials when they are heated.
*Redox — (short for &quot;reduction-oxidation&quot; reaction) A chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. 
*Skin effect — Tendency of charges to distribute at the surface of a conductor, when an alternating current passes through it.
*Static electricity — Class of phenomena involving the imbalanced charge present on an object, typically referring to charge with voltages of sufficient magnitude to produce visible attraction (e.g., static cling), repulsion, and sparks.
*Sparks — Electrical breakdown of a medium that produces an ongoing plasma discharge, similar to the instant spark, resulting from a current flowing through normally nonconductive media such as air.
*Telluric currents — Extremely low frequency electric current that occurs naturally over large underground areas at or near the surface of the Earth. 
*Thermionic emission — the emission of electrons from a heated electrode, usually the cathode, the principle underlying most vacuum tubes.
*Thermoelectric effect — the Seebeck effect, the Peltier effect, and the Thomson effect.
*Thunderstorm — also electrical storm, form of weather characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere known as thunder.
*Triboelectric effect — Type of contact electrification in which objects become electrically charged after coming into contact and are then separated. A Van de Graaff generator is based on this principle.
*Whistlers — Very low frequency radio wave generated by lightning.

<text>A watch is a timepiece carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person&#x27;s activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands or leather straps. A pocket watch is carried in a pocket, often attached to a chain. A stopwatch is a watch that measures intervals of time.
During most of their history, beginning in the 16th century, watches were mechanical devices, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called &quot;mechanical watches&quot;. In the 1960s the electronic &quot;quartz watch&quot; was invented, powered by a battery and keeping time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s it took over most of the watch market, in what was called the quartz revolution (or the quartz crisis in Switzerland, whose renowned watch industry it decimated). In the 2010s, &quot;smartwatches&quot; emerged, small wrist-worn computers with touchscreens, with functions that go far beyond timekeeping.

Modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. Mechanical watches may have extra features (&quot;complications&quot;) such as moon-phase displays and different types of tourbillon. Quartz watches often include timers, chronographs, and alarm functions. Smartwatches and more complicated electronic watches may even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.

Most watches used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. But expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts. As of 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime for US$31.2 million.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first appeared in 15th-century Europe. The first timepieces to be worn, made in the 16th century beginning in the German cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg, were transitional in size between clocks and watches. Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1485–1542) is often credited as the inventor of the watch. However, other German clockmakers were creating miniature timepieces during this period, and there is no evidence Henlein was the first.

Watches were not widely worn in pockets until the 17th century. One account suggests that the word &quot;watch&quot; came from the Old English word &quot;woecce&quot; – which meant &quot;watchman&quot; – because town watchmen used the technology to keep track of their shifts at work. Another says that the term came from 17th-century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard &quot;watches&quot; (duty shifts).

=== Development ===
A rise in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. This innovation significantly improved the accuracy of watches, reducing errors from several hours a day to approximately 10 minutes per day, which led to the introduction of the minute hand on watch faces in Britian around 1680 and in France by 1700.

The increased accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of the movement, igniting a two-century wave of watchmaking innovation. The first thing to be improved was the escapement. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the cylinder escapement, invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George Graham in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing – such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert Hooke – allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.

A major cause of error in balance-wheel timepieces, caused by changes in elasticity of the balance spring from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic temperature-compensated balance wheel invented in 1765 by Pierre Le Roy and improved by Thomas Earnshaw (1749–1829). The lever escapement, the single most important technological breakthrough, though invented by Thomas Mudge in 1754 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.

The British predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the élite. The British Watch Company modernized clock manufacture with mass-production techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery in 1843. In the United States, Aaron Lufkin Dennison started a factory in 1851 in Massachusetts that used interchangeable parts, and by 1861 a successful enterprise operated, incorporated as the Waltham Watch Company.

=== Wristwatches ===

The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. In 1571, Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch, described as an &quot;armed watch&quot;, from Robert Dudley. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a &quot;bracelet watch&quot;) is one made in 1806, and given to Joséphine de Beauharnais. From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women – men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century. In 1810, the watch-maker Abraham-Louis Breguet made a wristwatch for the Queen of Naples. The first Swiss wristwatch was made in the year 1868 by the Swiss watch-maker Patek Philippe for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary.

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, having increasingly recognized the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war without potentially revealing plans to the enemy through signaling. The Garstin Company of London patented a &quot;Watch Wristlet&quot; design in 1893, but probably produced similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885. During the First Boer War of 1880–1881, the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin &amp; Webb began production of their successful &quot;campaign watch&quot; for soldiers during the campaign in the Sudan in 1898 and accelerated production for the Second Boer War of 1899–1902 a few years later. In continental Europe, Girard-Perregaux and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.

Early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Louis Cartier produced a wristwatch to allow his friend Alberto Santos-Dumont to check flight performance in his airship while keeping both hands on the controls as this proved difficult with a pocket watch. Cartier still markets a line of Santos-Dumont watches and sunglasses.
In 1905, Hans Wilsdorf moved to London, and set up his own business, Wilsdorf &amp; Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company became Rolex in 1915. Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.

The impact of the First World War of 1914–1918 dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man&#x27;s wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the war were specially designed for the rigors of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The UK War Office began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917. By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch (or wristlet), and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British &quot;Horological Journal&quot; wrote in 1917, that &quot;the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.&quot; By 1930, the wristwatch vastly exceeded the pocket watch in market share by a decisive ratio of 50:1.

==== Automatic watches ====
John Harwood invented the first successful self-winding system in 1923. In anticipation of Harwood&#x27;s patent for self-winding mechanisms expiry in 1930, Glycine founder Eugène Meylan started development on a self-winding system as a separate module that could be used with almost any 8.75 ligne (19.74 millimeter) watch movement. Glycine incorporated this module into its watches in October 1930, and began mass-producing automatic watches.

==== Electric watches ====
The Elgin National Watch Company and the Hamilton Watch Company pioneered the first electric watch. The first electric movements used a battery as a power source to oscillate the balance wheel. During the 1950s, Elgin developed the model 725, while Hamilton released two models: the first, the Hamilton 500, released on 3 January 1957, was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning, and the watches returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505, an improvement on the 500, proved more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel. Similar designs from many other watch companies followed. Another type of electric watch was developed by the Bulova company that used a tuning-fork resonator instead of a traditional balance wheel to increase timekeeping accuracy, moving from a typical 2.5–4 Hz with a traditional balance wheel to 360 Hz with the tuning-fork design.

====Quartz watches====
The commercial introduction of the quartz watch in 1969 in the form of the Seiko Astron 35SQ, and in 1970 in the form of the Omega Beta 21 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel, which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, these devices used a quartz-crystal resonator, which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. Most quartz-watch oscillators now operate at 32,768 Hz, though quartz movements have been designed with frequencies as high as 262 kHz. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.

==== Smart watches ====
The Timex Datalink wristwatch was introduced in 1994. The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to receive data from a PC. Since then, many companies have released their own iterations of a smartwatch, such as the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and Huawei Watch.

==== Hybrid watches ====
A hybrid smartwatch is a fusion between a regular mechanical watch and a smartwatch.

== Parts ==

The movement and case are the basic parts of a watch. A watch band or bracelet is added to form a wristwatch; alternatively, a watch chain is added to form a pocket watch.

The case is the outer covering of the watch.

The case back is the back portion of the watch&#x27;s case. Accessing the movement (such as during battery replacement) depends on the type of case back, which are generally categorized into four types:
* Snap-off case backs (press-on case backs): the watch back pulls straight off and presses straight on.
* Screw-down case backs (threaded case backs): the entire watch back must be rotated to unscrew from the case. Often it has 6 notches on the external part of the case back.
* Screw back cases: tiny screws hold the case back to the case
* Unibody: the only way into the case involves prying the crystal off the front of the watch.

The crystal, also called the window or watch glass, is the transparent part of the case that allows viewing the hands and the dial of the movement.
Modern wristwatches almost always use one of 4 materials:
* Acrylic glass (plexiglass, hesalite glass): the most impact-resistant (&quot;unbreakable&quot;), and therefore used in dive watches and most military watches. Acrylic glass is the lowest cost of these materials, so it is used in practically all low-cost watches.
* Mineral crystal: a tempered glass.
* Sapphire-coated mineral crystal
* Synthetic sapphire crystal: the most scratch-resistant; it is difficult to cut and polish, causing watch crystals made of sapphire to be the most expensive.

The bezel is the ring holding the crystal in place.

The lugs are small metal projections at both ends of the wristwatch case where the watch band attaches to the watch case.
The case and the lugs are often machined from one solid piece of stainless steel.

== Movement ==


The movement of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month, and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time.

=== Mechanical ===

Compared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day; are sensitive to position, temperature, and magnetism; are costly to produce; require regular maintenance and adjustments; and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, mechanical watches attract interest from consumers, particularly among watch collectors. Skeleton watches are designed to display the mechanism for aesthetic purposes.

A mechanical movement uses an escapement mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. The movement also uses a balance wheel, together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring), to control the gear system&#x27;s motion in a manner analogous to the pendulum of a pendulum clock. The tourbillon, an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, used to cancel out or reduce gravitational bias. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are expensive, and typically found in prestigious watches.

The pin-lever escapement (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, Georges Frederic Roskopf), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers, as well as by Timex, until it was replaced by quartz movements.

Introduced by Bulova in 1960, tuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement with a precise frequency (most often ) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. Tuning-fork watches were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed.

Traditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a mainspring as its power source that must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique pocket watches were wound by inserting a key into the back of the watch and turning it. While most modern watches are designed to run on a winding, requiring winding daily, some run for several days; a few have 192-hour mainsprings, requiring once-weekly winding.

==== Automatic watches ====


A &quot;self-winding&quot; or &quot;automatic&quot; watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer&#x27;s body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet, but the first &quot;self-winding&quot;, or &quot;automatic&quot;, wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named John Harwood in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer&#x27;s wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer&#x27;s wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.

In April 2013, the Swatch Group launched the &quot;sistem51&quot; wristwatch. It has a mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including 19 jewels and a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. Ten years after its introduction, it is still the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line, including adjustment of the balance wheel and the escapement for accuracy by laser. The low parts count and the fully automated assembly make it an inexpensive automatic Swiss watch.

=== Electronic ===
Electronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the piezoelectric effect. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an oscillator. It resonates at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.

In 1959 Seiko placed an order with Epson (a subsidiary company of Seiko and the &#x27;brain&#x27; behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.

The first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192 Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuchâtel in 1967. In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the Omega Electroquartz as well as Patek Philippe, Rolex Oysterquartz and Piaget.

The first quartz watch to enter production was the Seiko 35 SQ Astron, which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world&#x27;s most accurate wristwatches to date: the Omega Marine Chronometer. Since the technology having been developed by contributions from Japanese, American and Swiss, nobody could patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch, thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market. This ended – in less than a decade – almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child&#x27;s wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day – ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.

After a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the Swatch Group of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture watch batteries (Renata), oscillators (Oscilloquartz, now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed EM Microelectronic-Marin). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world&#x27;s largest watch company.

Seiko&#x27;s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the Seiko Spring Drive, first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.

In 2010, Miyota (Citizen Watch) of Japan introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for Bulova to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144 kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/− 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.
Radio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch that synchronizes (time transfers) its time with an external time source such as in atomic clocks, time signals from GPS navigation satellites, the German DCF77 signal in Europe, WWVB in the US, and others. Movements of this type may, among others, synchronize the time of day and the date, the leap-year status and the state of daylight saving time (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.

Electronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Watch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some solar-powered watches.

Some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko&#x27;s kinetic-powered quartz watches use the motion of the wearer&#x27;s arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny generator to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.

Solar powered watches are powered by light. A photovoltaic cell on the face (dial) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a rechargeable battery or capacitor. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen Eco-Drive). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura, and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.

A rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer&#x27;s arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the Citizen Eco-Drive Thermo).

== Display ==

=== Analog ===
Traditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. In quartz watches this second hand typically snaps to the next marker every second. In mechanical watches, the second hand may appear to glide continuously, though in fact it merely moves in smaller steps, typically one-fifth to one-tenth of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. With a &quot;duplex&quot; escapement, the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically -second; this happens every four beats (two periods, 1 second), with a &quot;double duplex&quot; escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the &quot;tri-synchro regulator&quot; of Spring Drive watches. All three hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with &quot;hands&quot; simulated by a liquid-crystal display.

Analog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.

Analog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer&#x27;s name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.

==== Tactile ====
Tissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, makes the Silen-T wristwatch with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates to help the user to tell time eyes-free. The bezel of the watch features raised bumps at each hour mark; after briefly touching the face of the watch, the wearer runs a finger around the bezel clockwise. When the finger reaches the bump indicating the hour, the watch vibrates continuously, and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute, the watch vibrates intermittently.

Eone Timepieces, a Washington D.C.–based company, launched its first tactile analog wristwatch, the &quot;Bradley&quot;, on 11 July 2013 on the &quot;Kickstarter&quot; website. The device is primarily designed for sight-impaired users, who can use the watch&#x27;s two ball bearings to determine the time, but it is also suitable for general use. The watch features raised marks at each hour and two moving, magnetically attached ball bearings. One ball bearing, on the edge of the watch, indicates the hour, while the other, on the face, indicates the minute.

=== Digital ===
A digital display shows the time as a number, e.g., 12:08 instead of a short hand pointing towards the number 12 and a long hand 8/60 of the way around the dial. The digits are usually shown as a seven-segment display.

The first digital pocket watches appeared in the late 19th century. In the 1920s, the first digital mechanical wristwatches appeared.

The first digital &quot;electronic&quot; watch, a Pulsar LED prototype in 1970, was developed jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess. John Bergey, the head of Hamilton&#x27;s Pulsar division, said that he was inspired to make a digital timepiece by the then-futuristic digital clock that Hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. On 4 April 1972, the Pulsar was finally ready, made in an 18-carat gold case and sold for $2,100. It had a red light-emitting diode (LED) display.

Digital LED watches were very expensive and out of reach to the common consumer until 1975, when Texas Instruments started to mass-produce LED watches inside a plastic case. These watches, which first retailed for only $20, reduced to $10 in 1976, saw Pulsar lose $6 million and the Pulsar brand sold to Seiko.

An early LED watch that was rather problematic was The Black Watch made and sold by British company Sinclair Radionics in 1975. This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.

Most watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and eliminating the need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button needed to be pressed to illuminate the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs and electroluminescent backlights.

The first LCD watch with a six-digit LCD was the 1973 Seiko 06LC, although various forms of early LCD watches with a four-digit display were marketed as early as 1972 including the 1972 Gruen Teletime LCD Watch, and the Cox Electronic Systems Quarza. The Quarza, introduced in 1972 had the first Field Effect LCD readable in direct sunlight and produced by the International Liquid Crystal Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio. In Switzerland, Ebauches Electronic SA presented a prototype eight-digit LCD wristwatch showing time and date at the MUBA Fair, Basel, in March 1973, using a twisted nematic LCD manufactured by Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, Switzerland, which became the supplier of LCDs to Casio for the &quot;CASIOTRON&quot; watch in 1974.

A problem with LCDs is that they use polarized light. If, for example, the user is wearing polarized sunglasses, the watch may be difficult to read because the plane of polarization of the display is roughly perpendicular to that of the glasses. If the light that illuminates the display is polarized, for example if it comes from a blue sky, the display may be difficult or impossible to read.

From the 1980s onward, digital watch technology vastly improved. In 1982, Seiko produced the Seiko TV Watch that had a television screen built-in, and Casio produced a digital watch with a thermometer (the TS-1000) as well as another that could translate 1,500 Japanese words into English. In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987, Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers (the DBA-800) and Citizen introduced one that would react to voice. In 1995, Timex released a watch that allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the Timex Datalink USB, feature dot matrix displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.

=== Illuminated ===

Many watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.

Mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. Radium was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous. Tritium was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive – it has to be made in a nuclear reactor – and it has a half-life of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (see Tritium illumination). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.

Watches that incorporate batteries often have electric illumination in their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.


In some early digital watches, LED displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.

In some types of watches, small incandescent lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination.

Other watches use electroluminescent material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.

== Speech synthesis ==
Talking watches are available, intended for the blind or visually impaired. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-deaf that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.

==Handedness==
Wristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer &quot;left-hand drive&quot;, aka &quot;destro&quot;, configured watches which move the crown to the left side making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.

A rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, chronographs. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.

Digital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.

==Functions==

Customarily, watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called &quot;complete calendar&quot; or &quot;triple date&quot; watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include alarms. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate striking mechanisms or repeater functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary timepieces. This feature is available on most digital watches.

A &quot;complicated watch&quot; has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a complication. Two popular complications are the &quot;chronograph&quot; complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a stopwatch, and the &quot;moonphase&quot; complication, which is a display of the lunar phase. Other more expensive complications include Tourbillon, Perpetual calendar, Minute repeater, and Equation of time. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see Calibre 89 from Patek Philippe for instance). Some watches aimed at Muslims can both indicate the direction of Mecca and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements. Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for UTC or GMT.

The similar-sounding terms &quot;chronograph&quot; and &quot;chronometer&quot; are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry-standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.

Electronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or activity tracking, address the general fitness market and have the potential for commercial success (Garmin Forerunner, Garmin Vivofit, Epson, announced model of Swatch Touch series).

Braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time. Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.

=== Fashion ===

Wristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as jewelry or as collectible works of art rather than just as timepieces. This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.

Traditionally, dress watches appropriate for informal (business), semi-formal, and formal attire are gold, thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, complicated, or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire. Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown or faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted sapphire (corundum).

Many fashions and department stores offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, &quot;costume&quot; watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss Swatch company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.

Trade in counterfeit watches, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated market per year.

=== Space ===
The zero-gravity environment and other extreme conditions encountered by astronauts in space require the use of specially tested watches.

The first-ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian &quot;Pobeda&quot; watch from the Petrodvorets Watch Factory. It was sent on a single orbit flight on the spaceship Korabl-Sputnik 4 on 9 March 1961. The watch had been attached without authorisation to the wrist of Chernuchka, a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as Yuri Gagarin, with exactly the same rocket and equipment, just a month before Gagarin&#x27;s flight.

On 12 April 1961, Gagarin wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of which actually means &quot;navigator&#x27;s&quot;) wristwatch during his historic first flight into space. The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the First Moscow Factory. Since 1964, the watches of the First Moscow Factory have been marked by the trademark &quot;&quot;, transliterated as &quot;POLJOT&quot;, which means &quot;flight&quot; in Russian and is a tribute to the many space trips its watches have accomplished. In the late 1970s, Poljot launched a new chrono movement, the 3133. With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the Swiss Valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s. Poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the arm of Valeriy Polyakov, a Poljot 3133 chronograph movement-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.

Through the 1960s, a large range of watches was tested for durability and precision under extreme temperature changes and vibrations. The Omega Speedmaster Professional was selected by NASA, the U.S. space agency, and it is mostly known thanks to astronaut Buzz Aldrin who wore it during the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. Heuer became the first Swiss watch in space thanks to a Heuer Stopwatch, worn by John Glenn in 1962 when he piloted the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; on the first crewed U.S. orbital mission. The Breitling Navitimer Cosmonaute was designed with a 24-hour analog dial to avoid confusion between AM and PM, which are meaningless in space. It was first worn in space by U.S. astronaut Scott Carpenter on 24 May 1962 in the &quot;Aurora 7&quot; Mercury capsule.

Since 1994 Fortis is the exclusive supplier for crewed space missions authorized by the Russian Federal Space Agency. China National Space Administration (CNSA) astronauts wear the Fiyta spacewatches. At BaselWorld, 2008, Seiko announced the creation of the first watch ever designed specifically for a space walk, Spring Drive Spacewalk. Timex Datalink is flight certified by NASA for space missions and is one of the watches qualified by NASA for space travel. The Casio G-Shock DW-5600C and 5600E, DW 6900, and DW 5900 are Flight-Qualified for NASA space travel.

Various Timex Datalink models were used both by cosmonauts and astronauts.

=== Scuba diving ===

Watch construction may be water-resistant. These watches are sometimes called diving watches when they are suitable for scuba diving or saturation diving. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued a standard for water-resistant watches which also prohibits the term &quot;waterproof&quot; to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted. In the United States, advertising a watch as waterproof has been illegal since 1968, per Federal Trade Commission regulations regarding the &quot;misrepresentation of protective features&quot;.

Water-resistance is achieved by the gaskets which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water-resistant.

None of the tests defined by ISO 2281 for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water-resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.

The standards for diving watches are regulated by the ISO 6425 international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water-resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water-resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating, ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver&#x27;s watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver&#x27;s watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional ISO 6425 requirements have to be met.

Watches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):

Some watches use bar instead of meters, which may then be multiplied by 10, and then subtract 10 to be approximately equal to the rating based on metres. Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in atmospheres (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.

=== Navigation ===

There is a traditional method by which an analog watch can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o&#x27;clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o&#x27;clock will indicate north. During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o&#x27;clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.

<text>Photoconductivity is an optical and electrical phenomenon in which a material becomes more electrically conductive due to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, or gamma radiation.

When light is absorbed by a material such as a semiconductor, the number of free electrons and holes increases, resulting in increased electrical conductivity. To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the band gap, or to excite the impurities within the band gap. When a bias voltage and a load resistor are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current through the circuit.

Classic examples of photoconductive materials include:
* photographic film: Kodachrome, Fujifilm, Agfachrome, Ilford, &quot;etc.&quot;, based on silver sulfide and silver bromide.
* the conductive polymer polyvinylcarbazole, used extensively in photocopying (xerography); 
* lead sulfide, used in infrared detection applications, such as the U.S. Sidewinder and Soviet (now Russian) Atoll heat-seeking missiles; 
* selenium, employed in early television and xerography.
Molecular photoconductors include organic, inorganic, and – more rarely – coordination compounds.

==Applications==

When a photoconductive material is connected as part of a circuit, it functions as a resistor whose resistance depends on the light intensity. In this context, the material is called a photoresistor (also called &quot;light-dependent resistor&quot; or &quot;photoconductor&quot;). The most common application of photoresistors is as photodetectors, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the &quot;only&quot; type of photodetector—other types include charge-coupled devices (CCDs), photodiodes and phototransistors—but they are among the most common. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, infrared detectors, nanophotonic systems and low-dimensional photo-sensors devices.

==Sensitization==
Sensitization is an important engineering procedure to amplify the response of photoconductive materials. The photoconductive gain is proportional to the lifetime of photo-excited carriers (either electrons or holes). Sensitization involves intentional impurity doping that saturates native recombination centers with a short characteristic lifetime, and replacing these centers with new recombination centers having a longer lifetime. This procedure, when done correctly, results in an increase in the photoconductive gain of several orders of magnitude and is used in the production of commercial photoconductive devices. The text by Albert Rose is the work of reference for sensitization.

==Negative photoconductivity==
Some materials exhibit deterioration in photoconductivity upon exposure to illumination. One prominent example is hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in which a metastable reduction in photoconductivity is observable (see Staebler–Wronski effect). Other materials that were reported to exhibit negative photoconductivity include ZnO nanowires, molybdenum disulfide, graphene, indium arsenide nanowires, decorated carbon nanotubes, and metal nanoparticles.

Under an applied AC voltage and upon UV illumination, ZnO nanowires exhibit a continuous transition from positive to negative photoconductivity as a function of the AC frequency. ZnO nanowires also display a frequency-driven metal-insulator transition at room temperature. The responsible mechanism for both transitions has been attributed to a competition between bulk conduction and surface conduction. The frequency-driven bulk-to-surface transition of conductivity is expected to be a generic character of semiconductor nanostructures with the large surface-to-volume ratio.

==Magnetic photoconductivity==
In 2016 it was demonstrated that in some photoconductive material a magnetic order can exist. One prominent example is CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3. In this material a light induced magnetization melting was also demonstrated thus could be used in magneto optical devices and data storage.

==Photoconductivity spectroscopy==

The characterization technique called photoconductivity spectroscopy (also known as photocurrent spectroscopy) is widely used in studying optoelectronic properties of semiconductors.
