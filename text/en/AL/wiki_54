<text>Explorer 1 was the first satellite launched by the United States in 1958 and was part of the U.S. participation in the International Geophysical Year (IGY). The mission followed the first two satellites, both launched by the Soviet Union during the previous year, Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2. This began a Space Race during the Cold War between the two nations.

Explorer 1 was launched on 1 February 1958 at 03:47:56 GMT (or 31 January 1958 at 22:47:56 Eastern Time) atop the first Juno I booster from LC-26A at the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Center of the Atlantic Missile Range (AMR), in Florida. It was the first spacecraft to detect the Van Allen radiation belt, returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months. It remained in orbit until 1970.

Explorer 1 was given Satellite Catalog Number 00004 and the Harvard designation 1958 Alpha 1, the forerunner to the modern International Designator.

== Background ==
The U.S. Earth satellite program began in 1954 as a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy proposal, called Project Orbiter, to put a scientific satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year. The proposal, using a military Redstone missile, was rejected in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration in favor of the Navy&#x27;s Project Vanguard, using a booster advertised as more civilian in nature. Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as the Explorer program to catch up with the Soviet Union.

Explorer 1 was designed and built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), while a Jupiter-C rocket was modified by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) to accommodate a satellite payload; the resulting rocket known as the Juno I. The Jupiter-C design used for the launch had already been flight-tested in nose cone reentry tests for the Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and was modified into Juno I. Working closely together, ABMA and JPL completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C and building Explorer 1 in 84 days. However, before work was completed, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. The U.S. Navy attempted to put the first U.S. satellite into orbit but failed with the launch of the Vanguard TV-3 on 6 December 1957.

== Spacecraft ==
Explorer 1 was designed and built by California Institute of Technology&#x27;s JPL under the direction of Dr. William Hayward Pickering. It was the second satellite to carry a mission payload (Sputnik 2 was the first).

The total mass of the satellite was , of which were instrumentation. In comparison, the mass of the first Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 was . The instrument section at the front end of the satellite and the empty scaled-down fourth-stage rocket casing orbited as a single unit, spinning around its long axis at 750 revolutions per minute.

Data from the scientific instruments was transmitted to the ground by two antennas. A 60 milliwatt transmitter fed a dipole antenna consisting of two fiberglasses slot antennas in the body of the satellite operating on 108.03 MHz, and four flexible whips forming a turnstile antenna were fed by a 10 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.00 MHz.

Because of the limited space available and the requirements for low weight, the payload instrumentation was designed and built with simplicity and high reliability in mind, using germanium and silicon transistors in its electronics. A total of 20 transistors were used in Explorer 1, plus additional ones in the Army&#x27;s micrometeorite amplifier. Electrical power was provided by mercury chemical batteries that made up approximately 40% of the payload weight.

The external skin of the instrument section was sandblasted stainless steel with white stripes. Several other color schemes had been tested, resulting in backup articles, models, and photographs showing different configurations, including alternate white and green striping and blue stripes alternating with copper. The final color scheme was determined by studies of shadow–sunlight intervals based on firing time, trajectory, orbit and inclination.

== Science payload ==
The Explorer 1 payload consisted of the Iowa Cosmic Ray Instrument without a tape data recorder which was not modified in time to make it onto the spacecraft. The real-time data received on the ground was therefore very sparse and puzzling showing normal counting rates and no counts at all. The later Explorer 3 mission, which included a tape data recorder in the payload, provided the additional data for confirmation of the earlier Explorer 1 data.

The scientific instrumentation of Explorer 1 was designed and built under the direction of Dr. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa containing:

* Anton 314 omnidirectional Geiger–Müller tube, designed by Dr. George H. Ludwig of Iowa&#x27;s Cosmic Ray Laboratory, to detect cosmic rays. It could detect protons with E&gt;30 MeV and electrons with E&gt;3 MeV. Most of the time the instrument was saturated;

* Five temperature sensors (one internal, three external and one on the nose cone);

* Acoustic detector (crystal transducer and solid-state amplifier) to detect micrometeorite (cosmic dust) impacts. It responded to micrometeorite impacts on the spacecraft skin in such a way that each impact would be a function of mass and velocity. Its effective area was 0.075 m2 and the average threshold sensitivity was 2.5 g cm/s;

* Wire grid detector, also to detect micrometeorite impacts. It consisted of 12 parallel connected cards mounted in a fiberglass supporting ring. Each card was wound with two layers of enameled nickel alloy wire with a diameter of 17 μm (21 μm with the enamel insulation included) in such way that a total area of was completely covered. If a micrometeorite of about 10 μm impacted, it would fracture the wire, destroy the electrical connection, and thus record the event.

== Flight ==
After a jet stream-related delay on 28 January 1958, at 03:47:56 GMT on 1 February 1958 the Juno I rocket was launched, putting Explorer 1 into orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of having a period of 114.80 minutes, and an inclination of 33.24°. Goldstone Tracking Station could not report after 90 minutes as planned whether the launch had succeeded because the orbit was larger than expected. At about 06:30 GMT, after confirming that Explorer 1 was indeed in orbit, a news conference was held in the Great Hall at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. to announce it to the world.

The original expected lifetime of the satellite before orbital decay was three years. Mercury batteries powered the high-power transmitter for 31 days and the low-power transmitter for 105 days. Explorer 1 stopped transmission of data on 23 May 1958, when its batteries died, but remained in orbit for more than 12 years. It reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean on 31 March 1970 after more than 58,400 orbits.

== Results ==
Explorer 1 changed rotation axis after launch. The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body ends up in the spin state that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the Eulerian theory of rigid body dynamics after nearly 200 years – to address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.

Sometimes the instrumentation reported the expected cosmic ray count (approximately 30 counts per second) but other times it would show a peculiar zero counts per second. The University of Iowa (under James Van Allen) observed that all of the zero counts per second reports were from an altitude of more than over South America, while passes at would show the expected level of cosmic rays. Later, after Explorer 3, it was concluded that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed (&quot;saturated&quot;) by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This belt of charged particles is now known as the Van Allen radiation belt. The discovery was considered to be one of the outstanding discoveries of the International Geophysical Year.

The acoustic micrometeorite detector detected 145 impacts of cosmic dust in 78,750 seconds. This calculates to an average impact rate of 8.0−3 impacts per second per square meter, or 29 impacts per hour per square meter, over the twelve-day period.

== Legacy ==
Explorer 1 was the first of the long-running Explorers program. Four follow-up satellites of the Explorer series were launched by the Juno I launch vehicle in 1958. Of these, Explorer 3 and 4 were successful, while Explorer 2 and 5 failed to reach orbit. The final flight of the Juno I booster, the satellite Beacon-1, also failed. The Juno I vehicle was replaced by the Juno II launch vehicle in 1959.

A follow-up to the first mission, Explorer-1 Prime Unit 2, was successfully launched aboard a Delta II launch vehicle in late October 2011. The Prime was built using modern satellite construction techniques. The orbiting satellite was a backup, because the initial Explorer-1 Prime, launched on 4 March 2011, did not reach orbit due to a launch vehicle failure.

An identically constructed flight backup of Explorer 1 is on display in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum, Milestones of Flight Gallery in Washington, D.C., LC-26A was deactivated in 1963 and was designated for use as a museum in 1964, the Air Force Space and Missile Museum. Here too, a full-scale Explorer 1 is on display, but this one is a mock-up.

<doc id="61540" wikidata="Q185073" url="?curid=61540" title="Nestorius">
<text>Nestorius of Constantinople (; ; ) was an early Christian prelate who served as Archbishop of Constantinople from 10 April 428 to 11 July 431. A Christian theologian from the Catechetical School of Antioch, several of his teachings in the fields of Christology and Mariology were seen as controversial and caused major disputes. 
In 431, he was condemned and deposed from his see by the Council of Ephesus, presided over by his archrival Cyril of Alexandria, but the counter-council led by John I of Antioch vindicated him and deposed Cyril in return. Nestorius refrained from attending both of these councils and instead sought retirement from the Byzantine Emperor. 

Nestorius himself used the title Theotokos and did not advocate for its ban. His teachings included cautious usage of the title Theotokos (&quot;God-Bearer&quot;), used for Mary, mother of Jesus, in order that Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures not be confused, as he believed Christ was born according to his humanity and not his divinity, which indicated his preference for the concept of the prosopic union of two natures (divine and human) of Christ, over the concept of a hypostatic union. That brought him into conflict with Cyril of Alexandria and other prominent miaphysite churchmen of the time, who accused him of heresy:

Nestorius sought to defend himself at the Council of Ephesus in 431, but instead found himself formally condemned for heresy by a majority of the bishops and was subsequently removed from his see. On his own request, he retired to his former monastery, in or near Antioch. In 435, Theodosius II sent him into exile in Upper Egypt, where he lived on until about 451, strenuously defending his views. His last major defender within the Roman Empire, Theodoret of Cyrrhus, finally agreed to anathematise him in 451 during the Council of Chalcedon. 

From then on, he had no defenders within the empire, but the Church of the East in the Persian Empire never accepted his condemnation. That led later western Christians to give the name &quot;Nestorian Church&quot; to the Church of the East where his teachings were deemed orthodox and in line with its own teachings. Nestorius is revered as among three &quot;Greek Teachers&quot; of the Church of the East (in addition to Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia). The East Syriac Eucharistic Service, which is known to be among the oldest in the world, incorporates prayers attributed to Nestorius himself. 

The discovery, translation and publication of his &quot;Bazaar of Heracleides&quot; at the beginning of the 20th century have led to a reassessment of his theology in Western scholarship. It is now generally agreed that his ideas were not far from those that eventually emerged as orthodox, but the orthodoxy of his formulation of the doctrine of Christ is still controversial.

== Life ==
Sources place the birth of Nestorius around 386 in the city of Germanicia in the Province of Syria, Roman Empire (now Kahramanmaraş in Turkey). A Syriac source mentioned that Nestorius was of Persian origin, while others have stated he was of Hellenised Antiochian or Syrian origin.

He received his clerical training as a pupil of Theodore of Mopsuestia in Antioch. He was living as a priest and monk in the monastery of Euprepius near the walls, and he gained a reputation for his sermons that led to his enthronement by Theodosius II, as Patriarch of Constantinople, following the 428 death of Sisinnius I of Constantinople.

== Nestorian controversy ==

Shortly after his arrival in Constantinople, Nestorius became involved in the disputes of two theological factions, which differed in their Christology. Nestorius tried to find a middle ground between those that emphasized the fact that in Christ, God had been born as a man and insisted on calling the Virgin Mary &quot;Theotokos&quot; (, &quot;God-bearer&quot;) and those that rejected that title because God, as an eternal being, could not have been born. He never divided Christ into two sons (Son of God and Son of Mary), he refused to attribute to the divine nature the human acts and sufferings of the man Jesus Christ. Nestorius suggested the title &quot;Christotokos&quot; (&quot;Χριστοτόκος&quot;, &quot;Christ-bearer&quot;), but he did not find acceptance on either side.

&quot;Nestorianism&quot; refers to the doctrine that there are two distinct hypostases in the Incarnate Christ, the one Divine and the other human. The teaching of all churches that accept the Council of Ephesus is that in the Incarnate Christ is a single hypostasis, God and man at once. That doctrine is known as the Hypostatic union.

Nestorius&#x27;s opponents charged him with detaching Christ&#x27;s divinity and humanity into two persons existing in one body, thereby denying the reality of the Incarnation. It is not clear whether Nestorius actually taught that.

Eusebius of Dorylaeum, a layman who later became the bishop of the neighbouring Dorylaeum, was the first to accuse Nestorius of heresy, but the most forceful opponent of Nestorius was Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria. This naturally caused great excitement at Constantinople, especially among the clergy, who were clearly not well disposed to Nestorius, the stranger from Antioch.

Cyril appealed to Pope Celestine I to make a decision, and Celestine I delegated to Cyril the job of excommunicating Nestorius if he did not change his teachings within 10 days.

Nestorius had arranged with the emperor in the summer of 430 for the assembling of a council. He now hastened it, and the summons had been issued to patriarchs and metropolitans on 19 November, before the pope&#x27;s sentence, delivered through Cyril of Alexandria, and was served on Nestorius.

Emperor Theodosius II convoked a general church council, at Ephesus, itself a special seat for the veneration of Mary, where the &quot;Theotokos&quot; formula was popular. The Emperor and his wife supported Nestorius, but Pope Celestine I supported Cyril.

Cyril of Alexandria took charge of the Council of Ephesus in 431, opening debate before the long-overdue contingent of Eastern bishops from Antioch arrived. The council deposed Nestorius and declared him a heretic.

In Nestorius&#x27; own words:
When the followers of Cyril of Alexandria saw the vehemence of the emperor... they roused up a disturbance and discord among the people with an outcry, as though the emperor were opposed to God; they rose up against the nobles and the chiefs who acquiesced not in what had been done by them and they were running hither and thither. And... they took with them those who had been separated and removed from the monasteries by reason of their lives and their strange manners and had for this reason been expelled, and all who were of heretical sects and were possessed with fanaticism and with hatred against me. And one passion was in them all, Jews and pagans and all the sects, and they were busying themselves that they should accept without examination the things which were done without examination against me; and at the same time all of them, even those that had participated with me at table and in prayer and in thought, were agreed... against me and vowing vows one with another against me... In nothing were they divided.

While the council was in progress, John I of Antioch and the eastern bishops arrived and were furious to hear that Nestorius had already been condemned. They convened their own synod, at which Cyril of Alexandria was deposed. Both sides then appealed to the emperor.

Initially, the imperial government ordered both Nestorius and Cyril of Alexandria to be deposed and exiled. Nestorius was made to return to his monastery at Antioch, and Maximianus of Constantinople was consecrated Archbishop of Constantinople in his place. Cyril was eventually allowed to return after bribing various courtiers.

== Later events ==
In the following months, 17 bishops who supported Nestorius&#x27;s doctrine were removed from their sees. Eventually, John I of Antioch was obliged to abandon Nestorius, in March 433. On 3 August 435, Theodosius II issued an imperial edict that exiled Nestorius from the monastery in Antioch in which he had been staying to a monastery in the Great Oasis of Hibis (al-Khargah), in Egypt, securely within the diocese of Cyril of Alexandria. The monastery suffered attacks by desert bandits, and Nestorius was injured in one such raid. Nestorius seems to have survived there until at least 450 (given the evidence of &quot;The Book of Heraclides&quot;). Nestorius died shortly after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, in Thebaid, Egypt.

== Writings ==
Very few of Nestorius&#x27; writings survive, many being destroyed by his opponents. There are several letters preserved in the records of the Council of Ephesus and fragments of a few others. About 30 sermons are extant, mostly in fragmentary form. The only complete treatise is the lengthy defence of his theological position, &quot;The Bazaar of Heraclides&quot;, written in exile at the Oasis, which survives in Syriac translation. It must have been written no earlier than 450, as he knows of the death of the Emperor Theodosius II (29 July 450). There is an English translation of this work, but it was criticised as inaccurate, as well as the older French translation. Further scholarly analyses have shown that several early interpolations have been made in the text, sometime in the second half of the 5th century.

In 1895, a 16th-century book manuscript containing a copy of a text written by Nestorius was discovered by American missionaries in the library of the Nestorian patriarch in the mountains at Qudshanis, Hakkari. This book had suffered damage during Muslim conquests but was substantially intact, and copies were taken secretly. The Syriac translation had the title of the &quot;Bazaar of Heracleides&quot;. The original 16th-century manuscript was destroyed in 1915 during the Turkish massacres of Assyrian Christians. Edition of this work is primarily to be attributed to the German scholar, Friedrich Loofs, of Halle University.

In the &quot;Bazaar&quot;, written about 450, Nestorius denies the heresy for which he was condemned and instead affirms of Christ &quot;the same one is twofold&quot; — an expression that some consider similar to the formulation of the Council of Chalcedon. Nestorius&#x27; earlier surviving writings, however, including his letter written in response to Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s charges against him, contain material that has been interpreted by some to imply that at that time he held that Christ had two persons. Others view this material as merely emphasising the distinction between how the pre-incarnate Logos is the Son of God and how the incarnate Emmanuel, including his physical body, is truly called the Son of God.

== Legacy ==
Though Nestorius had been condemned by the Imperial church, there was a faction loyal to him and his teachings. Following the Nestorian schism, many Nestorian Christians were forced to relocate to the communities in Persia, and the church was misnamed the &quot;Nestorian Church&quot; by its opponents. Nestorius is however not a major figure in this church.

In modern times, the Assyrian Church of the East, the descendant of the historical Church of the East, reveres Nestorius as a saint, but the modern church does not subscribe to the entirety of the Nestorian doctrine as it has traditionally been understood in the West, believing that the West misunderstood and misrepresented his theology, and rejects that Nestorius taught any heresy. Patriarch Dinkha IV repudiated the exonym &quot;Nestorian&quot; on the occasion of his accession in 1976.

In the Roman Empire, the doctrine of Monophysitism developed in reaction to Nestorianism. The new doctrine asserted that Christ had but one nature, his human nature being absorbed into his divinity. It was condemned at the Council of Chalcedon and it is claimed by the non-Chalcedonian churches that it was misattributed to them. Today, it is condemned as heresy in the modern Oriental Orthodox Churches.

<text>Juneteenth, officially Juneteenth National Independence Day, is a federal holiday in the United States. It is celebrated annually on June 19 to commemorate the ending of slavery in the United States. The holiday&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;June&quot; and &quot;nineteenth&quot;, as it was on June 19, 1865 when Major General Gordon Granger ordered the final enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas at the end of the American Civil War. In the Civil War period, slavery came to an end in various areas of the United States at different times. Many enslaved Southerners escaped, demanded wages, stopped work, or took up arms against the Confederacy of slave states. In January 1865, Congress finally proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for national abolition of slavery. By June 1865, almost all enslaved were freed by the victorious Union Army, or abolition laws in some of the remaining U.S. states. When the national abolition amendment was ratified in December, the remaining enslaved in Delaware and in Kentucky were freed.

Early celebrations date back to 1866, at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. They spread across the South among newly freed African American slaves and their descendants and became more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food festival. Participants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations to the rest of the country. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, these celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to achieve civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on African-American freedom and African-American arts. Beginning with Texas by proclamation in 1938, and by legislation in 1979, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has formally recognized the holiday in some way.

Juneteenth is also celebrated by the Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in 1852 and settled in Coahuila, Mexico.

The day was recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, when the 117th U.S. Congress enacted and President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law. Juneteenth became the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was adopted in 1983.
== Celebrations and traditions==

The holiday is considered the &quot;longest-running African-American holiday&quot; and has been called &quot;America&#x27;s second Independence Day.&quot; Juneteenth falls on June 19 and has often been celebrated on the third Saturday in June. Historian Mitch Kachun considers that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: &quot;to celebrate, to educate, and to agitate.&quot;

Early celebrations consisted of baseball, fishing, and rodeos. African Americans were often prohibited from using public facilities for their celebrations, so they were often held at churches or near water. Celebrations were characterized by elaborate large meals and people wearing their best clothing. It was common for formerly enslaved people and their descendants to make a pilgrimage to Galveston. As early festivals received news coverage, Janice Hume and Noah Arceneaux consider that they &quot;served to assimilate African-American memories within the dominant &#x27;American story.

Modern observance is primarily in local celebrations. In many places, Juneteenth has become a multicultural holiday. Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation which promised freedom, singing traditional songs such as &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; and &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, and reading of works by noted African-American writers, such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou. Celebrations include picnics, rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, historical reenactments, blues festivals, and Miss Juneteenth contests. Red food and drinks are traditional during the celebrations, including red velvet cake and strawberry soda, with red meant to represent resilience and joy.

Juneteenth celebrations often include lectures and exhibitions on African-American culture. The modern holiday places much emphasis on teaching about African-American heritage. Karen M. Thomas wrote in &quot;Emerge&quot; that &quot;community leaders have latched on to [Juneteenth] to help instill a sense of heritage and pride in black youth.&quot; Celebrations are commonly accompanied by voter registration efforts, the performing of plays, and retelling stories. The holiday is also a celebration of soul food and other food with African-American influences. In &quot;Tourism Review International&quot;, Anne Donovan and Karen DeBres write that &quot;Barbecue is the centerpiece of most Juneteenth celebrations.&quot; Major news networks host specials and marathons on national outlets featuring prominent Black voices.

The Black Seminoles of Nacimiento in Mexico hold a festival and reunion, known as el Día de los Negros on June 19. 
Many former British colonies celebrate Emancipation Day on August 1, commemorating the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. 
Since 2021, the United Nations has designated August 31 as the International Day for People of African Descent.

==History==

On September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced that the Emancipation Proclamation would go into effect on January 1, 1863, promising freedom to enslaved people in all of the rebellious parts of Southern states of the Confederacy including Texas. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied upon the advance of Union troops. Texas, as the most remote state of the former Confederacy, had seen an expansion of slavery because the presence of Union troops was low as the American Civil War ended; thus, the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation had been slow and inconsistent there prior to Granger&#x27;s order. In all June 19, 1865, was 900 days after the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, 71 days after Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union on April 9, 1865, and 24 days after the disbanding of the Confederate military department covering Texas on May 26, 1865.

===Early history===
==== The Civil War and celebrations of emancipation ====
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), emancipation came at different times in different parts of the Southern United States. Large celebrations of emancipation, often called Jubilees (recalling the biblical Jubilee, in which enslaved people were freed), took place on September 22, January 1, July 4, August 1, April 6, and November 1, among other dates. When emancipation finally came to Texas, on June 19, 1865, as the southern rebellion collapsed, celebration was widespread. While that date did not actually mark the unequivocal end of slavery, even in Texas, June 19 came to be a day of shared commemoration across the United Statescreated, preserved, and spread by ordinary African Americansof slavery&#x27;s wartime demise.

==== End of slavery in Texas ====
Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War on September 22, 1862, declaring that if the rebels did not end the fighting and rejoin the Union, all enslaved people in the Confederacy would be freed on the first day of the year. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all enslaved people in the Confederate States of America in rebellion and not in Union hands were freed.

Planters and other slaveholders from eastern states had migrated into Texas to escape the fighting, and many brought enslaved people with them, increasing by the thousands the enslaved population in the state at the end of the Civil War. Although most lived in rural areas, more than 1,000 resided in Galveston or Houston by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns. By 1865, there were an estimated 250,000 enslaved people in Texas.

Despite the surrender of Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, the western Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi did not formally surrender until June 2. On the morning of June 19, 1865, Union Major General Gordon Granger arrived on the island of Galveston to take command of the more than 2,000 federal troops recently landed in the department of Texas to enforce the emancipation of its enslaved population and oversee Reconstruction, nullifying all laws passed within Texas during the war by Confederate lawmakers. The order informed all Texans that, in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all enslaved people were free:

Longstanding urban legend places a historic reading of General Order No. 3 at Ashton Villa; but no historical evidence supports this claim. There is no evidence that Granger or any of his troops &quot;proclaimed&quot; the Ordinance by reading it aloud. All indications are that copies of the Ordinance were posted in public places, including the Negro Church on Broadway, since renamed Reedy Chapel A.M.E. Church.

On June 21, 2014, the Galveston Historical Foundation and Texas Historical Commission erected a Juneteenth plaque where the Osterman Building once stood signifying the location of Major General Granger&#x27;s Union Headquarters believed to be where he issued his general orders.

Although this event commemorates the end of slavery, emancipation for the remaining enslaved in two Union border states, Delaware and Kentucky, would not come until December 6, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified; furthermore, thousands of black slaves were not freed until after the Reconstruction Treaties of late 1866, when tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and others were forced to sign new treaties that required them to free their slaves.

The freedom of formerly enslaved people in Texas was given state law status in a series of Texas Supreme Court decisions between 1868 and 1874.

==== Early Juneteenth celebrations ====
Formerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced after General Order No. 3. One year later, on June 19, 1866, freedmen in Texas organized the first of what became annual commemorations of &quot;Jubilee Day.&quot; Early celebrations were used as political rallies to give voting instructions to newly freed African Americans. Other independence observances occurred on January 1 or 4.

In some cities, Black people were barred from using public parks because of state-sponsored segregation of facilities. Across parts of Texas, freed people pooled their funds to purchase land to hold their celebrations. The day was first celebrated in Austin in 1867 under the auspices of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, and it had been listed on a &quot;calendar of public events&quot; by 1872. That year, Black leaders in Texas raised $1,000 for the purchase of of land, today known as Houston&#x27;s Emancipation Park, to celebrate Juneteenth.

The observation was soon drawing thousands of attendees across Texas. In Limestone County, an estimated 30,000 Black people celebrated at Booker T. Washington Park, established in 1898 for Juneteenth celebrations. The Black community began using the word &quot;Juneteenth&quot; for Jubilee Day early in the 1890s. The word &quot;Juneteenth&quot; appeared in print in the &quot;Brenham Weekly Banner&quot;, a white newspaper from Brenham, Texas, as early as 1891. Mentions of Juneteenth celebrations outside of Texas appeared as early as 1909 in Shreveport, Louisiana.

====Decline of celebrations during the Jim Crow era====
In the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in Juneteenth celebrations. From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate states passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised Black people, excluding them from the political process. White-dominated state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing second-class status. Gladys L. Knight writes the decline in celebration was in part because &quot;upwardly mobile blacks ... were ashamed of their slave past and aspired to assimilate into mainstream culture. Younger generations of blacks, becoming further removed from slavery were occupied with school ... and other pursuits.&quot; Others who migrated to the Northern United States could not take time off or simply dropped the celebration.

The Great Depression forced many Black people off farms and into the cities to find work, where they had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. From 1936 to 1951, the Texas State Fair served as a destination for celebrating the holiday, contributing to its revival. In 1936, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people joined the holiday&#x27;s celebration in Dallas. In 1938, Governor of Texas James Allred issued a proclamation stating in part:

Seventy thousand people attended a &quot;Juneteenth Jamboree&quot; in 1951. From 1940 through 1970, in the second wave of the Great Migration, more than five million Black people left Texas, Louisiana and other parts of the South for the North and the West Coast. As historian Isabel Wilkerson writes, &quot;The people from Texas took Juneteenth Day to Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, and other places they went.&quot; In 1945, Juneteenth was introduced in San Francisco by a migrant from Texas, Wesley Johnson.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement focused the attention of African Americans on expanding freedom and integrating. As a result, observations of the holiday declined again, though it was still celebrated in Texas.

===Revival of celebrations===
====1960s–1980s====
Juneteenth soon saw a revival as Black people began tying their struggle to that of ending slavery. In Atlanta, some campaigners for equality wore Juneteenth buttons. During the 1968 Poor People&#x27;s Campaign to Washington, DC, called by Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference made June 19 the &quot;Solidarity Day of the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign.&quot; In the subsequent revival, large celebrations in Minneapolis and Milwaukee emerged, as well as across the Eastern United States.

In 1974, Houston began holding large-scale celebrations again, and Fort Worth, Texas, followed the next year. Around 30,000 people attended festivities at Sycamore Park in Fort Worth the following year. The 1978 Milwaukee celebration was described as drawing over 100,000 attendees. In 1979, the Texas Legislature made the occasion a state holiday. In the late 1980s, there were major celebrations of Juneteenth in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Georgia, and Washington, D.C.

====Prayer breakfast and commemorative celebrations====

In 1979, Democratic State Representative Al Edwards of Houston successfully sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a paid Texas state holiday. The same year, he hosted the inaugural Al Edwards prayer breakfast and commemorative celebration on the grounds of the 1859 home, Ashton Villa. As one of the few existing buildings from the Civil War era and popular in local myth and legend as the location of Major General Granger&#x27;s order, Edwards&#x27;s annual celebration includes a local historian dressed as the Union general reading General Order No. 3 from the second-story balcony of the home. The Emancipation Proclamation is also read and speeches are made. Representative Al Edwards died of natural causes April 29, 2020, at the age of 83, but the annual prayer breakfast and commemorative celebration continued at Ashton Villa, with the late legislator&#x27;s son Jason Edwards speaking in his father&#x27;s place.

==== Official statewide recognitions ====
In the late 1970s, when the Texas Legislature declared Juneteenth a &quot;holiday of significance ... particularly to the blacks of Texas,&quot; it became the first state to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday. The bill passed through the Texas Legislature in 1979 and was officially made a state holiday on January 1, 1980. Before 2000, three more U.S. states officially observed the day, and over the next two decades it was recognized as an official observance in all states, except South Dakota, until becoming a federal holiday.

==== Juneteenth in pop culture and the mass media ====
Since the 1980s and 1990s, the holiday has been more widely celebrated among African-American communities and has seen increasing mainstream attention in the US. In 1991, there was an exhibition by the Anacostia Community Museum (part of the Smithsonian Institution) called &quot;Juneteenth &#x27;91, Freedom Revisited.&quot; In 1994, a group of community leaders gathered at Christian Unity Baptist Church in New Orleans to work for greater national celebration of Juneteenth. Expatriates have celebrated it in cities abroad, such as Paris. Some US military bases in other countries sponsor celebrations, in addition to those of private groups. In 1999, Ralph Ellison&#x27;s novel &quot;Juneteenth&quot; was published, increasing recognition of the holiday. By 2006, at least 200 cities celebrated the day.

In 1997, activist Ben Haith created the Juneteenth flag, which was further refined by illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf. In 2000, the flag was first hoisted at the Roxbury Heritage State Park in Boston by Haith. The star at the center represents Texas and the extension of freedom for all African Americans throughout the whole nation. The burst around the star represents a nova and the red curve represents a horizon, standing for a new era for African Americans. The red, white, and blue colors represent the American flag, which shows that African Americans and their enslaved ancestors are Americans, and the national belief in liberty and justice for all citizens.

The holiday gained mainstream awareness outside African-American communities through depictions in media, such as episodes of TV series &quot;Atlanta&quot; (2016) and &quot;Black-ish&quot; (2017), the latter of which featured musical numbers about the holiday by Aloe Blacc, The Roots, and Fonzworth Bentley. In 2018, Apple added Juneteenth to its calendars in iOS under official U.S. holidays. Some private companies have adopted Juneteenth as a paid day off for employees, while others have officially marked the day in other ways, such as a moment of silence.

In 2020, several American corporations and educational institutions, including Twitter, the National Football League, Nike, began treating Juneteenth as a company holiday, providing a paid day off to their workers, and Google Calendar added Juneteenth to its U.S. Holidays calendar. Also in 2020, a number of major universities formally recognized Juneteenth, either as a &quot;day of reflection&quot; or as a university holiday with paid time off for faculty and staff.

The 2020 mother-daughter film on the holiday&#x27;s pageant culture, &quot;Miss Juneteenth&quot;, celebrates African-American women who are &quot;determined to stand on their own,&quot; while a resourceful mother is &quot;getting past a sexist tendency in her community to keep women in their place.&quot;

====Becoming a federal holiday====

In 1996, the first federal legislation to recognize &quot;Juneteenth Independence Day&quot; was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, H.J. Res. 195, sponsored by Barbara-Rose Collins (D-MI). In 1997, Congress recognized the day through Senate Joint Resolution 11 and House Joint Resolution 56. In 2013, the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 175, acknowledging Lula Briggs Galloway (late president of the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage), who &quot;successfully worked to bring national recognition to Juneteenth Independence Day&quot;, and the continued leadership of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation.

In the 2000s and 2010s, activists continued a long process to push Congress towards official recognition of Juneteenth. Organizations such as the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation sought a Congressional designation of Juneteenth as a national day of observance. By 2016, 45 states were recognizing the occasion. Activist Opal Lee, often referred to as the &quot;grandmother of Juneteenth&quot;, campaigned for decades to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, leading walks in many states to promote the idea. In 2016–17 at the age of 89, she led a symbolic walk from Fort Worth, Texas to Washington D.C. to advocate for the federal holiday. When it was officially made a federal holiday on June 17, 2021, she was standing beside President Joe Biden as he signed the bill.

Juneteenth became one of five date-specific federal holidays along with New Year&#x27;s Day (January 1), Independence Day (July 4), Veterans Day (November 11), and Christmas Day (December 25). Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a holiday in 1986. Juneteenth also falls within the statutory Honor America Days period, which lasts for 21 days from Flag Day (June 14) to Independence Day (July 4).

== Legal observance ==
===State and local holiday===
Texas was the first state to recognize the date by enacted law, in 1980. By 2002, eight states officially recognized Juneteenth and four years later 15 states recognized the holiday. By 2008, just over half of the states recognized Juneteenth in some way. By 2019, 47 states and the District of Columbia recognized Juneteenth, although as of 2020 only Texas had adopted the holiday as a paid holiday for state employees.

In June 2019, Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf recognized Juneteenth as a holiday in the state. In the yearlong aftermath of the murder of George Floyd that occurred on May 25, 2020, nine states designated Juneteenth a paid holiday, including New York, Washington, and Virginia. In 2020, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker issued a proclamation that the day would be marked as &quot;Juneteenth Independence Day.&quot; This followed the filing of bills by both the House and Senate to make Juneteenth a state holiday. Baker did not comment on these bills specifically but promised to grant the observance of Juneteenth greater importance. On June 16, 2021, Illinois adopted a law changing its ceremonial holiday to a paid state holiday.

Some cities and counties have also recognized Juneteenth through proclamation. In 2020, Juneteenth was formally recognized by New York City (as an annual official city holiday and public school holiday, starting in 2021). Cook County, Illinois, adopted an ordinance to make Juneteenth a paid county holiday. The City and County of Honolulu recognizes it as an &quot;annual day of honor and reflection&quot;, and Portland, Oregon (as a day of remembrance and action and a paid holiday for city employees).

North Dakota approved recognition of Juneteenth as a state-recognized annual holiday on April 13, 2021, with Hawaii becoming the 49th state to recognize the holiday on June 16, 2021. On June 16, 2020, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem proclaimed that the following June 19, 2020, was to be Juneteenth Day for that year only, spurning calls for it to be recognized annually, rather than just for 2020. In February 2022, South Dakota became the last state to recognize Juneteenth as an annual state holiday or observance. Its law provided for following the federal law even before it was official. On May 2, 2022, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed a bill changing the state&#x27;s ceremonial observance to a state holiday and it is now the 11th state holiday in Colorado.

As of 2024, 27 states and the District of Columbia have made Juneteenth an annualized paid holiday for state employees, with the remainder maintaining at least a ceremonial observance (New Mexico&#x27;s personnel board declared it a paid worker holiday, although it is not a statutory holiday in New Mexico). Additional states may observe it as a paid holiday for state workers but rely on a decision, often of the governor, in each year, instead of perpetual by statute, which may or may not occur again the next year. Local governments including counties and municipalities also may close their offices and pay their workers time-off. The table below only includes the state&#x27;s with perpetual, annual, paid holiday laws identified by the Congressional Research Service in 2023 or subsequent sources:

===Federal holiday===
Juneteenth is a federal holiday in the United States. For decades, activists and congress members (led by many African Americans) proposed legislation, advocated for, and built support for state and national observances. During his campaign for president in June 2020, Joe Biden publicly celebrated the holiday. President Donald Trump, during his 2020 campaign for reelection, added making the day a national holiday part of his &quot;Platinum Plan for Black America.&quot; Spurred on by Opal Lee, the racial justice movement and the Congressional Black Caucus, on June 15, 2021, the Senate unanimously passed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday. It passed through the House of Representatives by a 415–14 vote on June 16.

President Joe Biden signed the bill () on June 17, 2021, making Juneteenth the eleventh American federal holiday and the first to obtain legal observance as a federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was designated in 1983. According to the bill, federal government employees will now get to take the day off every year on June 19, or should the date fall on a Saturday or Sunday, they will get the Friday or Monday closest to the Saturday or Sunday on which the date falls.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs in federal agencies that has been interpreted by various agencies as eliminating in-agency observance planning for a number of cultural remembrance events, including Juneteenth, Black History Month, and several others. Nonetheless, for February 2025, Trump issued the traditional presidential proclamation calling on officials to commemorate Black History Month.

<text>Rafael Sabatini (29 April 1875 – 13 February 1950) was an Italian-born British writer of romance and adventure novels.

He is best known for his worldwide bestsellers: &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1915), &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1921), &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Captain Blood: His Odyssey&quot;) (1922), and &quot;Bellarion the Fortunate&quot; (1926). Several of his novels have been made into films, both silent and sound.

In all, Sabatini produced 34 novels, eight short story collections, six non-fiction books, numerous uncollected short stories, and several plays.

== Life as an author ==
After a brief stint in the business world, Sabatini went to work as a writer. He wrote short stories in the 1890s, and his first novel came out in 1902. It took Sabatini roughly a quarter of a century of hard work before he attained success in 1921 with &quot;Scaramouche&quot;. The novel, an historical romance set during the French Revolution, became an international bestseller. It was followed the next year by the equally successful &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. All of his earlier books were then rushed into reprints, the most popular of which was &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (originally published in 1915). 

Sabatini was a prolific writer, producing a new book approximately every year. With his high output and well-crafted stories he was able to maintain his popularity with the reading public through the decades that followed.

In the early 1940s illness forced Sabatini to slow his prolific writing. He only published three more books before his death in 1950: &quot;King in Prussia&quot; (also known as The Birth of Mischief, 1944), &quot;Turbulent Tales&quot; (a collection of shorts, 1946), and &quot;The Gamester&quot; (1949).

== Personal life ==
Rafael Sabatini was born in Jesi, Italy, to an English mother, Anna Trafford, and Italian father, Vincenzo Sabatini. His parents were opera singers who then became teachers.

At a young age Sabatini was exposed to many languages living with his grandfather in Britain. He attended school in Portugal, and as a teenager in Switzerland. By the time he was 17, when he returned to Britain to live permanently, he had become proficient in five languages. He quickly added a sixth language – English – to his linguistic collection. He consciously chose to write in his adopted language, because, he said, &quot;all the best stories are written in English&quot;.

In 1905, he married Ruth Goad Dixon, the daughter of a Liverpool merchant. They had a son, Sabatini&#x27;s only son, Rafael-Angelo (nicknamed Binkie). He was killed in a car crash on 1 April 1927. In 1931, Sabatini and his wife Ruth divorced. Later that year he moved from London to Clifford, Herefordshire, near Hay-on-Wye. 

In 1935, he married the sculptor Christine Dixon ( Wood), his former sister-in-law - she had been married previously to Ruth&#x27;s brother, Hugh Wainwright Dixon. They suffered further tragedy when Christine and Hugh&#x27;s son, Lancelot Steele Dixon, was killed aged 23 in a flying accident on the day he received his RAF wings, on 9 April 1940; he flew his aeroplane over his family&#x27;s house, but the plane went out of control and crashed in flames right before the observers&#x27; eyes.

Sabatini died in Switzerland 13 February 1950. He was buried in Adelboden, Switzerland. On his headstone his wife had written, &quot;He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad&quot;, the first line of &quot;Scaramouche&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
===Sound films===
Several of his novels were made into notable films in the sound era: 
* &quot;Scaramouche&quot; in 1952, 
* &quot;Captain Blood&quot; in 1935, and
* &quot;The Black Swan&quot; in 1942.

The 1940 film &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;, with Errol Flynn, is not an adaptation but a wholly new story which just used his novel’s title.

===Silent films===
His novel &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot; was made into a famous 1926 &quot;lost&quot; film of the same title, directed by King Vidor, starring John Gilbert, and long viewable only in a fragment excerpted in Vidor&#x27;s silent comedy &quot;Show People&quot; (1928). All but one of the reels of &quot;Bardelys&quot; were rediscovered in France in 2006, and a restoration (with production stills standing in for the missing reel) was completed in 2008.

A silent version of &quot;The Tavern Knight&quot; (1920) was made in England.

A silent version of &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1924), directed by David Smith and starring J. Warren Kerrigan, which was one of the last productions of the Vitagraph Company of America, survives in the Library of Congress, and two other silent adaptations of Sabatini novels which survive in other archives are Rex Ingram&#x27;s &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1923) starring Ramón Novarro at the George Eastman Museum, and Frank Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; starring Milton Sills at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

<text>The black swan (Cygnus atratus) is a large waterbird, a species of swan which breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia. Within Australia, the black swan is nomadic, with erratic migration patterns dependent on climatic conditions. It is a large bird with black plumage and a red bill. It is a monogamous breeder, with both partners sharing incubation and cygnet-rearing duties.

The black swan was introduced to various countries as an ornamental bird in the 1800s, but has managed to escape and form stable populations. Described scientifically by English naturalist John Latham in 1790, the black swan was formerly placed into a monotypic genus, &quot;Chenopis&quot;. Black swans can be found singly, or in loose companies numbering into the hundreds or even thousands. It is a popular bird in zoological gardens and bird collections, and escapees are sometimes seen outside their natural range.

This bird is a regional symbol of both Western Australia, where it is native, and the English town of Dawlish, where it is an introduced species.

==Description==
Black swans are black-feathered birds, with white flight feathers. The bill is bright red, with a pale bar and tip; and legs and feet are greyish-black. Cobs (males) are slightly larger than pens (females), with a longer and straighter bill. Cygnets (immature birds) are a greyish-brown with pale-edged feathers.

Mature black swans measure between in length and weigh . Their wing span is between . The neck is long (relatively the longest neck among the swans) and curved in an &quot;S&quot;-shape.

The black swan utters a musical and far reaching bugle-like sound, called either on the water or in flight, as well as a range of softer crooning notes. It can also whistle, especially when disturbed while breeding and nesting.

When swimming, black swans hold their necks arched or erect and often carry their feathers or wings raised in an aggressive display. In flight, a wedge of black swans will form as a line or a V, with the individual birds flying strongly with undulating long necks, making whistling sounds with their wings and baying, bugling or trumpeting calls.

The black swan is unlike any other Australian bird, although in poor light and at long range it may be confused with a magpie goose in flight. However, the black swan can be distinguished by its much longer neck and slower wing beat.

One captive population of black swans in Lakeland, Florida has produced a few individuals which are a light mottled grey colour instead of black. White black swans are also known to exist; these individuals, which are leucistic, are believed to occur rarely in the wild.

==Distribution==
The black swan is common in the wetlands of southwestern and eastern Australia and adjacent coastal islands. In the south west its range encompasses an area between North West Cape, Cape Leeuwin and Eucla; while in the east it covers a large region bounded by the Atherton Tableland, the Eyre Peninsula and Tasmania, with the Murray Darling Basin supporting very large populations of black swans. It is uncommon in central and northern Australia.

The black swan&#x27;s preferred habitat extends across fresh, brackish and salt water lakes, swamps and rivers with underwater and emergent vegetation for food and nesting materials. It also favors permanent wetlands, including ornamental lakes, but can also be found in flooded pastures and tidal mudflats, and occasionally on the open sea near islands or the shore.

The black swan was once thought to be sedentary, but is now known to be highly nomadic. There is no set migratory pattern, but rather opportunistic responses to either rainfall or drought. In high rainfall years, emigration occurs from the south west and south east into the interior, with a reverse migration from these heartlands in drier years. When rain does fall in the arid central regions, black swans will migrate to these areas to nest and raise their young. However, should dry conditions return before the young have been raised, the adult birds will abandon the nests and their eggs or cygnets and return to wetter areas.

The black swan, like many other water fowl, loses all its flight feathers at once when it moults after breeding and is unable to fly for about a month. During this time it will usually settle on large, open waters for safety.

The species has a large range, with figures between 1 and 10 million km2 given as the extent of occurrence. The current global population is estimated to be up to 500,000 individuals. No threat of extinction or significant decline in population has been identified with this numerous and widespread bird.

Black swans were first seen by Europeans in 1697, when Willem de Vlamingh&#x27;s expedition explored the Swan River, Western Australia.

===Introduced populations===
====New Zealand====

Before the arrival of the Māori in New Zealand, a related species of swan known as the New Zealand swan had developed there, but was apparently hunted to extinction. In 1864, the Australian black swan was introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental waterfowl and populations are now common on larger coastal or inland lakes, especially Rotorua Lakes, Lake Wairarapa, Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, and the Chatham Islands. Black swans have also naturally flown to New Zealand, leading scientists to consider them a native rather than exotic species, although the present population appears to be largely descended from deliberate introductions.

====United Kingdom====
The black swan is also very popular as an ornamental waterbird in western Europe, especially Britain, and escapees are commonly reported. As yet, the population in Britain is not considered to be self-sustaining and so the species is not afforded admission to the official British List, but the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have recorded a maximum of nine breeding pairs in the UK in 2001, with an estimate of 43 feral birds in 2003–2004.
A small population of black swans exists on the River Thames at Marlow, on the brook running through the small town of Dawlish in Devon, near the River Itchen, Hampshire, and the River Tees near Stockton on Tees. The Dawlish population is so well associated with the town that the bird has been the town&#x27;s emblem for forty years.

====Japan====
There are also wild populations in Japan, having originally been imported during 1950–1960.

====United States====

Black swans have been reported in Florida, but there is no evidence that they are breeding; persistent sightings may be due to continual releases or escapes. Orange County, California reported black swans in Lake Forest, Irvine and Newport Beach on October 5, 2020, and Santa Ana in December 2021 in the “Versailles on the Lake” apartment community. The &quot;Lake Forest Keys” community bought the original swans about eight to ten years ago and since then there have been many births and gaggles from the original couple&quot; according to a report in the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. Black swans formerly resided in the vicinity of Lake Junaluska, a large lake in Waynesville, North Carolina.

====Mainland China====
Black swans can also be found in mainland China. In 2018, one group of swans was introduced to the Shenzhen University campus on an artificial lake in Guangdong Province.

==Behaviour==
===Diet and feeding===
The black swan is almost exclusively herbivorous, and while there is some regional and seasonal variation, the diet is generally dominated by aquatic and marshland plants. In New South Wales the leaf of reedmace (genus &quot;Typha&quot;) is the most important food of birds in wetlands, followed by submerged algae and aquatic plants such as &quot;Vallisneria&quot;. In Queensland, aquatic plants such as &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, stoneworts, and algae are the dominant foods. The exact composition varies with water level; in flood situations where normal foods are out of reach black swans will feed on pasture plants on shore. The black swan feeds in a similar manner to other swans. When feeding in shallow water it will dip its head and neck under the water and it is able to keep its head flat against the bottom while keeping its body horizontal. In deeper water the swan up-ends to reach lower. Black swans are also able to filter feed at the water&#x27;s surface.

===Nesting and reproduction===
Like other swans, the black swan is largely monogamous, pairing for life (about 6% divorce rate). Recent studies have shown that around a third of all broods exhibit extra-pair paternity. An estimated one-quarter of all pairings are homosexual, mostly between males. They steal nests, or form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, driving away the female after she lays the eggs.

Generally, black swans in the Southern hemisphere nest in the wetter winter months (February to September), occasionally in large colonies. A black swan nest is essentially a large heap or mound of reeds, grasses and weeds between 1 and 1.5 metres (3– feet) in diameter and up to 1 metre high, in shallow water or on islands. A nest is reused every year, restored or rebuilt as needed. Both parents share the care of the nest. A typical clutch contains four to eight greenish-white eggs that are incubated for about 35–40 days. Incubation begins after the laying of the last egg, to synchronise the hatching of the chicks. Prior to the commencement of incubation the parent will sit over the eggs without actually warming them. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with the female incubating at night. The change over between incubation periods is marked by ritualised displays by both sexes. If eggs accidentally roll out of the nest both sexes will retrieve the egg using the neck (in other swan species only the female performs this feat). Like all swans, black swans will aggressively defend their nests with their wings and beaks. After hatching, the cygnets are tended by the parents for about nine months until fledging. Cygnets may ride on their parent&#x27;s back for longer trips into deeper water, but black swans undertake this behaviour less frequently than mute and black-necked swans.

==Relationship with humans==

===Conservation===
The black swan is protected in New South Wales, Australia under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974&quot; (s.5). The Black Swan is fully protected in all states and territories of Australia and must not be shot. It is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

===Australian culture===

The black swan was a literary or artistic image among Europeans even before their arrival in Australia. Cultural reference has been based on symbolic contrast and as a distinctive motif.

The black swan&#x27;s role in Australian heraldry and culture extends to the first founding of the colonies in the eighteenth century. It has often been equated with identity, the contrast to the white swan of the northern hemisphere indicating &#x27;Australianness&#x27;. The black swan is featured on the flag, and is both the state bird and state emblem of Western Australia; it also appears in the coat of arms and other iconography of the state&#x27;s institutions. The Black Swan was the sole postage stamp design of Western Australia from 1854 to 1902.

===Indigenous Australia===
The Noongar People of the South-West of Australia call the black swan &quot;Kooldjak&quot; along the West and South-West coast, &quot;Gooldjak&quot; in the South East and it is sometimes referred to as &quot;maali&quot; in language schools.

<text>The Jupiter-C was an American research and development vehicle developed from the Jupiter-A. Jupiter-C was used for three uncrewed sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957 to test re-entry nosecones that were later to be deployed on the more advanced PGM-19 Jupiter mobile missile. The recovered nosecone was displayed in the Oval Office as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s televised speech on November 7, 1957.

A member of the Redstone rocket family, Jupiter-C was designed by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), under the direction of Wernher von Braun. Three Jupiter-C flights were made. These were followed by satellite launches with the vehicle designated as Juno I (see Juno I below or the Juno I article). All were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

== Description ==
Each vehicle consisted of a modified Redstone ballistic missile with two solid-propellant upper stages. The tanks of the Redstone were lengthened by 8 ft (2.4 m) to provide additional propellant. The instrument compartment was also smaller and lighter than the Redstone&#x27;s. The second and third stages were clustered in a &quot;tub&quot; atop the vehicle.

The second stage was an outer ring of eleven scaled-down Sergeant rocket engines; the third stage was a cluster of three scaled-down Sergeant rockets grouped within. These were held in position by bulkheads and rings and surrounded by a cylindrical outer shell. The webbed base plate of the shell rested on a ball bearing shaft mounted on the first-stage instrument section. Two electric motors spun in the tub at a rate varying from 450 to 750 rpm to compensate for thrust imbalance when the clustered motors fired. The rate of spin was varied by a programmer so that it did not couple with the changing resonance frequency of the first stage during flight.

The upper-stage tub was visibly spun-up before launch. During first-stage flight, the vehicle was guided by a gyro-controlled autopilot controlling both air-vanes and jet vanes on the first stage by means of servos. Following a vertical launch from a simple steel table, the vehicle was programmed so that it was traveling at an angle of 40 degrees from the horizontal at burnout of the first stage, which occurred 157 seconds after launch.

At first-stage burnout, explosive bolts fired and springs separated the instrument section from the first-stage tankage. The instrument section and the spinning tub were slowly tipped to a horizontal position by means of four air jets located at the base of the instrument section. When the apex of the vertical flight occurred after a coasting flight of about 247 seconds, a radio signal from the ground ignited the eleven-rocket cluster of the second stage, separating the tub from the instrument section. The third stage then fired to raise the apogee. Through this system, designed by Wernher von Braun in 1956 for his proposed Project Orbiter, the Jupiter-C obviated the need for a guidance system in the upper stages.

===Juno I===

The Juno I was a satellite launch vehicle based on the Jupiter-C, but with the addition of a fourth stage, atop the &quot;tub&quot; of the third stage and the use of Hydyne as fuel. The Juno name derived from Von Braun wishing to make the satellite launch appear as peaceable as the Vanguard rocket, which was not a weapon, but was developed from a weather study rocket, the Viking. Since the Juno I was the same height as the Jupiter-C (21.2 meters), with the added fourth stage being hidden inside the shell, this vehicle which successfully launched the first orbital satellite of the United States is often incorrectly referred to as a Jupiter-C.

==Encrypted serial number==
The Jupiter-C was part of the IRBM project, and the sequence of manufacture of the rockets (which are not necessarily launched in order, and may be uprated as solutions to technical problems are worked out in tests) was considered a military secret. So the designation painted on the sides of the rocket was not a serial number in clear text, but employed a simple transformation cypher that the staff would be sure not to forget. The key was taken from the name of the design and test base: Huntsville, Alabama, giving HUNTSVILE, with duplicated letters dropped: H was used for 1, U for 2, ..., E for 9 and X for 0. For example, the Jupiter-C / Juno I modified to launch Explorer 1 had &quot;UE&quot; painted on the side, indicating it was S/N 29 (U→2, E→9).

<text>The Juno I was a four-stage American space launch vehicle, used to launch lightweight payloads into low Earth orbit. The launch vehicle was used between January 1958 to December 1959. The launch vehicle is a member of the Redstone launch vehicle family, and was derived from the Jupiter-C sounding rocket. It is commonly confused with the Juno II launch vehicle, which was derived from the PGM-19 Jupiter medium-range ballistic missile. In 1958, a Juno I launch vehicle was used to launch America&#x27;s first satellite, Explorer 1.

== History ==
Developed as a part of the Explorer Project, the original goal for the launch vehicle was to place an artificial satellite into orbit. Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957 (and the resulting &quot;Sputnik crisis&quot;) and the failure of the Vanguard 1 launch attempt, the program received funding to match the Soviet space achievements. The launch vehicle family name was suggested in November 1957 by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Director Dr. William Pickering, who proposed the name Juno, after the Roman goddess and queen of the gods, as well as for its position as the satellite-launching version of the Jupiter-C. The fourth stage for the Juno I launch vehicle was derived following the September 1956 test launch of a Jupiter-C for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which could have been the world&#x27;s first satellite launch, had a fourth stage been loaded and fueled. A fourth stage would have allowed the nose cone to overshoot the target and enter orbit.

The first launch of a Juno I launch vehicle was in early 1958, with the successful launch of Explorer 1 satellite on February 1, 1958, at 03:47:56 GMT, after the Soviet Union&#x27;s Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957. The launch had been scheduled for January 29, 1958, but was scrubbed twice. Explorer 1 was the first U.S. satellite, and it confirmed the existence of the Van Allen radiation belt. Following the first successful launch, five more Juno I launch attempts occurred with two successes and three failures. The final launch attempt was on October 23, 1958, from Cape Canaveral Launch Pad 5, which ended in failure.

== Launch vehicle ==

The Juno I consisted of a Jupiter-C first stage, based on the Redstone missile; with three additional solid fuel stages based on the Sergeant missile to provide the added impulse to achieve orbit. The fourth stage was mounted on top of the &quot;tub&quot; of the third stage, and fired after third-stage burnout to boost the payload and fourth stage to an orbital velocity of , with an acceleration of 25–51 g. The tub along with the fourth stage were set spinning while the launch vehicle was on the launch pad to provide gyroscopic force in lieu of a guidance system that would have required thrust vectoring, vernier thrusters, or a reaction control system. The booster guidance package (with the tub attached) separated from the first stage after burnout to provide attitude control until second stage ignition. This multi-stage system, designed by Wernher von Braun in 1956 for his proposed Project Orbiter, obviated the need for a guidance system in the upper stages. It was the simplest method for putting a payload into orbit but having no upper-stage guidance, the payload could not achieve a precise orbit. Both the four-stage Juno I and three-stage Jupiter-C launch vehicles were the same height (), with the added fourth-stage booster of the Juno I being enclosed inside the nose cone of the third stage.

== Launch history ==
Juno I was launched six times by ABMA in 1958, intending to place satellites in LEO.

Following the successful launch of Explorer 1 on February 1, 1958, the first U.S. satellite, Juno I made five more launches before being retired in favor of Juno II. Although Juno I&#x27;s launch of the Explorer 1 satellite was a huge success for the U.S. space program, only two of its remaining five flights were successful, Explorer 3 and Explorer 4, giving the Juno I vehicle a mission total success ratio of 50%. The Juno I vehicle was replaced by the Juno II in 1959.

The American public was happy and relieved that America had finally managed to launch a satellite after the launch failures in the Vanguard and Viking series. With the relative success of the Juno I program, von Braun developed the Juno II, using a PGM-19 Jupiter first stage, rather than a Redstone.

<doc id="61553" wikidata="Q10282035" url="?curid=61553" title="Tree fern">
<text>Tree ferns are arborescent (tree-like) ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level, making them trees. Many extant tree ferns are members of the order Cyatheales, to which belong the families Cyatheaceae (scaly tree ferns), Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae. It is estimated that Cyatheales originated in the early Jurassic, and is the third group of ferns known to have given rise to tree-like forms. The others are the extinct &quot;Tempskya&quot; of uncertain position, and Osmundales where the extinct Guaireaceae and some members of Osmundaceae also grew into trees. In addition there were the Psaroniaceae including &quot;Tietea&quot; in the Marattiales, which is the sister group to all the leptosporangiate ferns.

Other ferns which are also tree ferns, are &quot;Leptopteris&quot; and &quot;Todea&quot; in the family Osmundaceae, which can achieve short trunks under a metre tall. Fern species with short trunks in the genera &quot;Blechnum&quot;, &quot;Cystodium&quot; and &quot;Sadleria&quot; from the order Polypodiales, and smaller members of Cyatheales like &quot;Calochlaena&quot;, &quot;Cnemedaria&quot;, &quot;Culcita&quot; (mountains only tree fern), &quot;Lophosoria&quot; and &quot;Thyrsopteris&quot; are also considered tree ferns.

==Range==
Tree ferns are found growing in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, as well as cool to temperate rainforests in Australia, New Zealand and neighbouring regions (e.g. Lord Howe Island, etc.). Like all ferns, tree ferns reproduce by means of spores formed on the undersides of the fronds.

==Description==

The fronds of tree ferns are usually very large and multiple-pinnate. Their trunk is actually a vertical and modified rhizome, and woody tissue is absent. To add strength, there are deposits of lignin in the cell walls and the lower part of the stem is reinforced with thick, interlocking mats of tiny roots. If the crown of &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot; (the most common species in gardens) is damaged, it will inevitably die because that is where all the new growth occurs. But other clump-forming tree fern species, such as &quot;D. squarrosa&quot; and &quot;D. youngiae&quot;, can regenerate from basal offsets or from &quot;pups&quot; emerging along the surviving trunk length. Tree ferns often fall over in the wild, yet manage to re-root from this new prostrate position and begin new vertical growth.

==Uses==
Tree-ferns have been cultivated for their beauty alone; a few, however, were of some economic application, chiefly as sources of starch. These include the &quot;Sphaeropteris excelsa&quot; of Norfolk Island that was threatened with extinction for the sake of its sago-like pith, which was eaten by pigs. It is now widely cultivated as an ornamental tree, although there is only one small wild population on Norfolk Island. &quot;Sphaeropteris medullaris&quot; (mamaku, black tree fern) also furnished a kind of sago to people living in New Zealand, Queensland and the Pacific islands. A Javanese species of &quot;Dicksonia&quot; (&quot;D. chrysotricha&quot;) furnishes silky hairs, which were once imported as a styptic, and the long silky or wooly hairs, abundant on the stem and frond-leaves in the various species of &quot;Cibotium&quot; have not only been put to a similar use, but in the Hawaiian Islands furnished wool for stuffing mattresses and cushions, which was formerly an article of export.

==Species==
It is not certain the exact number of species of tree ferns there are, but it may be close to 600–700 species. Many species have become extinct in the last century as forest habitats have come under pressure from human intervention.
* &quot;Lophosoria&quot; (tropical America, 1 species)
* &quot;Metaxya&quot; (tropical America, 1 species)
* &quot;Sphaeropteris&quot; (tropical America, India, Southeast Asia to New Zealand, the Marquesas, and Pitcairn Island, about 120 species)
* &quot;Alsophila&quot; (pantropic area, about 230 species)
* &quot;Nephelea&quot; (tropical America, about 30 species)
* &quot;Trichipteris&quot; (tropical America, about 90 species)
* &quot;Cyathea&quot; (tropical America, Australasia, about 110 species)
* &quot;Cnemidaria&quot; (tropical America, about 40 species)
* &quot;Dicksonia&quot; (tropics and southern subtropics in Island Southeast Asia, Australasia, America, Hawaii, St. Helena, about 25 species)
* &quot;Cystodium&quot; (Island Southeast Asia, 1 species)
* &quot;Thyrsopteris&quot; (Juan Fernández Islands, 1 species)

<text>Anthony Tillmon Williams (December 12, 1945 – February 23, 1997) was an American jazz drummer.
Williams first gained fame as a member of Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Second Great Quintet&quot;, and later pioneered jazz fusion with Davis&#x27; group and his own combo, the Tony Williams Lifetime. In 1970, music critic Robert Christgau described him as &quot;probably the best drummer in the world.&quot; Williams was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Life and career==

Williams was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Boston, Massachusetts. He was of African, Portuguese, and Chinese descent. He studied with drummer Alan Dawson at the age of 11, and began playing professionally at the age of 13 with saxophonist Sam Rivers. Saxophonist Jackie McLean hired Williams when he was 16.

At 17, Williams joined Miles Davis in what was later dubbed Davis&#x27;s Second Great Quintet--with saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and bassist Ron Carter. Davis had been in something of a creative lull, and critics noted the young Tony Williams&#x27;s playing spurred the others on. Williams was a vital element of the group, called by Davis in his autobiography &quot;the center that the group&#x27;s sound revolved around.&quot; His playing helped redefine the role of the jazz rhythm section through the use of polyrhythms and metric modulation. Meanwhile, he recorded his first two albums as a leader for the Blue Note label, &quot;Life Time&quot; (1964) and &quot;Spring&quot; (1965). He also recorded as a sideman for the label including the classics &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; with Eric Dolphy and &quot;Point of Departure&quot; with Andrew Hill, both in 1964.

In 1969 Williams formed the Tony Williams Lifetime, with John McLaughlin on guitar and Larry Young on organ. Lifetime was a pioneering band of the fusion movement.

Their first album was &quot;Emergency!&quot;. For the Turn It Over album, the trio were joined by bass guitarist and vocalist Jack Bruce. After several more releases and touring, Lifetime disbanded. In 1975, Williams formed &quot;The New Tony Williams Lifetime&quot;, featuring bassist Tony Newton, keyboardist Alan Pasqua and guitarist Allan Holdsworth, who recorded two albums for Columbia Records, &quot;Believe It&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;.

In 1976, Williams reunited with his colleagues from the Miles Davis Quintet. (Davis himself was in the midst of a six-year hiatus and was &quot;replaced&quot; by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.) A record of their concert was later released as &quot;V.S.O.P&quot; (“Very Special One-time Performance”), the name under which the group toured and recorded for several years. 

In 1979, Williams, McLaughlin and bassist Jaco Pastorius united for a performance at the Havana Jazz Festival. This trio came to be known as the Trio of Doom, and a recording of their performance (along with some studio tracks recorded in New York shortly thereafter) was released in 2007. Williams and Pastorius also played together on &quot;Good Question&quot; from the 1978 Herbie Hancock album &quot;Sunlight&quot;. Williams appears with the group Fuse One on their 1980 album.

In 1985, he returned to Blue Note with the &quot;Foreign Intrigue&quot; album. Eventually Williams formed his own acoustic quintet with trumpeter Wallace Roney, saxophonist Bill Pierce, pianist Mulgrew Miller and bassist Ira Coleman. The quintet played Williams&#x27;s compositions almost exclusively, recording and touring extensively from 1986 to 1992, culminating in The Story of Neptune album.

Williams guested with the band Public Image Limited, fronted by John Lydon, on their release &quot;Album&quot; (1986). 

On February 20, 1997, Williams checked into Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, suffering from stomach pain. Three days later, while recuperating from gall bladder surgery, he died of a heart attack. He was 51 years old.

==Personal life==
Williams lived and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area until his death in 1997. One of his final recordings was &quot;The Last Wave&quot; by the trio known as Arcana, a release organized by Bill Laswell.

<text>The Archimedean spiral (also known as Archimedes&#x27; spiral, the arithmetic spiral) is a spiral named after the 3rd-century BC Greek mathematician Archimedes. The term &quot;Archimedean spiral&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the more general class of spirals of this type (see below), in contrast to &quot;Archimedes&#x27; spiral&quot; (the specific arithmetic spiral of Archimedes). It is the locus corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line that rotates with constant angular velocity. Equivalently, in polar coordinates it can be described by the equation
formula_1
with real number . Changing the parameter controls the distance between loops.

From the above equation, it can thus be stated: position of the particle from point of start is proportional to angle as time elapses.

Archimedes described such a spiral in his book &quot;On Spirals&quot;. Conon of Samos was a friend of his and Pappus states that this spiral was discovered by Conon.

== Derivation of general equation of spiral ==

A physical approach is used below to understand the notion of Archimedean spirals.

Suppose a point object moves in the Cartesian system with a constant velocity directed parallel to the -axis, with respect to the -plane. Let at time , the object was at an arbitrary point . If the plane rotates with a constant angular velocity about the -axis, then the velocity of the point with respect to -axis may be written as:
formula_2

As shown in the figure alongside, we have representing the modulus of the position vector of the particle at any time , with and as the velocity components along the x and y axes, respectively.

formula_3

The above equations can be integrated by applying integration by parts, leading to the following parametric equations:

formula_4

Squaring the two equations and then adding (and some small alterations) results in the Cartesian equation
formula_5
(using the fact that and ) or
formula_6

Its polar form is
formula_7

== Arc length and curvature ==

Given the parametrization in cartesian coordinates
formula_8
the arc length from to is
formula_9
or, equivalently:
formula_10
The total length from to is therefore
formula_11

The curvature is given by 
formula_12

==Characteristics==

The Archimedean spiral has the property that any ray from the origin intersects successive turnings of the spiral in points with a constant separation distance (equal to if is measured in radians), hence the name &quot;arithmetic spiral&quot;. In contrast to this, in a logarithmic spiral these distances, as well as the distances of the intersection points measured from the origin, form a geometric progression.

The Archimedean spiral has two arms, one for and one for . The two arms are smoothly connected at the origin. Only one arm is shown on the accompanying graph. Taking the mirror image of this arm across the -axis will yield the other arm.

For large a point moves with well-approximated uniform acceleration along the Archimedean spiral while the spiral corresponds to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity (see contribution from Mikhail Gaichenkov).

As the Archimedean spiral grows, its evolute asymptotically approaches a circle with radius .

==General Archimedean spiral==

Sometimes the term &quot;Archimedean spiral&quot; is used for the more general group of spirals
formula_13

The normal Archimedean spiral occurs when . Other spirals falling into this group include the hyperbolic spiral (), Fermat&#x27;s spiral (), and the lituus ().

==Applications==
One method of squaring the circle, due to Archimedes, makes use of an Archimedean spiral. Archimedes also showed how the spiral can be used to trisect an angle. Both approaches relax the traditional limitations on the use of straightedge and compass in ancient Greek geometric proofs.
The Archimedean spiral has a variety of real-world applications. Scroll compressors, used for compressing gases, have rotors that can be made from two interleaved Archimedean spirals, involutes of a circle of the same size that almost resemble Archimedean spirals, or hybrid curves.

Archimedean spirals can be found in spiral antenna, which can be operated over a wide range of frequencies.

The coils of watch balance springs and the grooves of very early gramophone records form Archimedean spirals, making the grooves evenly spaced (although variable track spacing was later introduced to maximize the amount of music that could be cut onto a record).

Asking for a patient to draw an Archimedean spiral is a way of quantifying human tremor; this information helps in diagnosing neurological diseases.

Archimedean spirals are also used in digital light processing (DLP) projection systems to minimize the &quot;rainbow effect&quot;, making it look as if multiple colors are displayed at the same time, when in reality red, green, and blue are being cycled extremely quickly. Additionally, Archimedean spirals are used in food microbiology to quantify bacterial concentration through a spiral platter.
They are also used to model the pattern that occurs in a roll of paper or tape of constant thickness wrapped around a cylinder.

Many dynamic spirals (such as the Parker spiral of the solar wind, or the pattern made by a Catherine&#x27;s wheel) are Archimedean. For instance, the star LL Pegasi shows an approximate Archimedean spiral in the dust clouds surrounding it, thought to be ejected matter from the star that has been shepherded into a spiral by another companion star as part of a double star system.

==Construction methods==

The Archimedean Spiral cannot be constructed precisely by traditional compass and straightedge methods, since the arithmetic spiral requires the radius of the curve to be incremented constantly as the angle at the origin is incremented. But an arithmetic spiral can be constructed approximately, to varying degrees of precision, by various manual drawing methods. One such method uses compass and straightedge; another method uses a modified string compass. 

The common traditional construction uses compass and straightedge to approximate the arithmetic spiral. First, a large circle is constructed and its circumference is subdivided by 12 diameters into 12 arcs (of 30 degrees each; see regular dodecagon). Next, the radius of this circle is itself subdivided into 12 unit segments (radial units), and a series of concentric circles is constructed, each with radius incremented by one radial unit. Starting with the horizontal diameter and the innermost concentric circle, the point is marked where its radius intersects its circumference; one then moves to the next concentric circle and to the next diameter (moving up to construct a counterclockwise spiral, or down for clockwise) to mark the next point. After all points have been marked, successive points are connected by a line approximating the arithmetic spiral (or by a smooth curve of some sort; see French Curve). Depending on the desired degree of precision, this method can be improved by increasing the size of the large outer circle, making more subdivisions of both its circumference and radius, increasing the number of concentric circles (see Polygonal Spiral). Approximating the Archimedean Spiral by this method is of course reminiscent of Archimedes’ famous method of approximating π by doubling the sides of successive polygons (see Polygon approximation of π).

Compass and straightedge construction of the Spiral of Theodorus is another simple method to approximate the Archimedean Spiral.

A mechanical method for constructing the arithmetic spiral uses a modified string compass, where the string wraps and winds (or unwraps/unwinds) about a fixed central pin (that does not pivot), thereby incrementing (or decrementing) the length of the radius (string) as the angle changes (the string winds around the fixed pin which does not pivot). Such a method is a simple way to create an arithmetic spiral, arising naturally from use of a string compass with winding pin (not the loose pivot of a common string compass). The string compass drawing tool has various modifications and designs, and this construction method is reminiscent of string-based methods for creating ellipses (with two fixed pins).

Yet another mechanical method is a variant of the previous string compass method, providing greater precision and more flexibility. Instead of the central pin and string of the string compass, this device uses a non-rotating shaft (column) with helical threads (screw; see Archimedes’ screw) to which are attached two slotted arms: one horizontal arm is affixed to (travels up) the screw threads of the vertical shaft at one end, and holds a drawing tool at the other end; another sloped arm is affixed at one end to the top of the screw shaft, and is joined by a pin loosely fitted in its slot to the slot of the horizontal arm. The two arms rotate together and work in consort to produce the arithmetic spiral: as the horizontal arm gradually climbs the screw, that arm’s slotted attachment to the sloped arm gradually shortens the drawing radius. The angle of the sloped arm remains constant throughout (traces a cone), and setting a different angle varies the pitch of the spiral. This device provides a high degree of precision, depending on the precision with which the device is machined (machining a precise helical screw thread is a related challenge). And of course the use of a screw shaft in this mechanism is reminiscent of Archimedes’ screw.

<text>In mathematics, a spiral is a curve which emanates from a point, moving further away as it revolves around the point. It is a subtype of whorled patterns, a broad group that also includes concentric objects.

==Two-dimensional==


A two-dimensional, or plane, spiral may be easily described using polar coordinates, where the radius formula_1 is a monotonic continuous function of angle formula_2:
* formula_3
The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case (the function not being strictly monotonic, but rather constant).

In &quot;formula_4-formula_5-coordinates&quot; the curve has the parametric representation:
* formula_6

=== Examples ===

Some of the most important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:

* The Archimedean spiral: formula_7
* The hyperbolic spiral: formula_8
* Fermat&#x27;s spiral: formula_9
* The lituus: formula_10
* The logarithmic spiral: formula_11 
* The Cornu spiral or &quot;clothoid&quot;
* The Fibonacci spiral and golden spiral
* The Spiral of Theodorus: an approximation of the Archimedean spiral composed of contiguous right triangles
* The involute of a circle

An &quot;Archimedean spiral&quot; is, for example, generated while coiling a carpet.

A &quot;hyperbolic spiral&quot; appears as image of a helix with a special central projection (see diagram). A hyperbolic spiral is some times called &quot;reciproke&quot; spiral, because it is the image of an Archimedean spiral with a circle-inversion (see below).

The name &quot;logarithmic spiral&quot; is due to the equation formula_12. Approximations of this are found in nature.

Spirals which do not fit into this scheme of the first 5 examples:

A &quot;Cornu spiral&quot; has two asymptotic points.&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;spiral of Theodorus&quot; is a polygon.&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;Fibonacci Spiral&quot; consists of a sequence of circle arcs.&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;involute of a circle&quot; looks like an Archimedean, but is not: see Involute#Examples.

=== Geometric properties ===
The following considerations are dealing with spirals, which can be described by a polar equation formula_13, especially for the cases formula_14 (Archimedean, hyperbolic, Fermat&#x27;s, lituus spirals) and the logarithmic spiral formula_11.

;Polar slope angle
The angle formula_16 between the spiral tangent and the corresponding polar circle (see diagram) is called &quot;angle of the polar slope&quot; and formula_17 the &quot;polar slope&quot;.

From vector calculus in polar coordinates one gets the formula
:formula_18

Hence the slope of the spiral formula_19 is
* formula_20

In case of an &quot;Archimedean spiral&quot; (formula_21) the polar slope is formula_22

In a &quot;logarithmic spiral&quot;, formula_23 is constant.

;Curvature
The curvature formula_24 of a curve with polar equation formula_13 is

:formula_26

For a spiral with formula_27 one gets
* formula_28

In case of formula_21 &quot;(Archimedean spiral)&quot;
formula_30.&lt;br&gt; 
Only for formula_31 the spiral has an &quot;inflection point&quot;.

The curvature of a &quot;logarithmic spiral&quot; formula_32 is formula_33

;Sector area
The area of a sector of a curve (see diagram) with polar equation formula_13 is
:formula_35

For a spiral with equation formula_36 one gets

* formula_37
:formula_38

The formula for a &quot;logarithmic spiral&quot; formula_32 is
formula_40

;Arc length
The length of an arc of a curve with polar equation formula_13 is
:formula_42

For the spiral formula_36 the length is

* formula_44
Not all these integrals can be solved by a suitable table. In case of a Fermat&#x27;s spiral, the integral can be expressed by elliptic integrals only.

The arc length of a &quot;logarithmic spiral&quot; formula_32 is formula_46

;Circle inversion
The inversion at the unit circle has in polar coordinates the simple description: formula_47.

* The image of a spiral formula_48 under the inversion at the unit circle is the spiral with polar equation formula_49. For example: The inverse of an Archimedean spiral is a hyperbolic spiral.
:A logarithmic spiral formula_32 is mapped onto the logarithmic spiral formula_51

=== Bounded spirals ===

The function formula_52 of a spiral is usually strictly monotonic, continuous
and unbounded. For the standard spirals formula_52 is either a power function or an exponential function. If one chooses for formula_52 a &quot;bounded&quot; function, the spiral is bounded, too. A suitable bounded function is the arctan function:

;Example 1
Setting formula_55 and the choice formula_56 gives a spiral, that starts at the origin (like an Archimedean spiral) and approaches the circle with radius formula_57 (diagram, left).
;Example 2
For formula_58 and formula_59 one gets a spiral, that approaches the origin (like a hyperbolic spiral) and approaches the circle with radius formula_60 (diagram, right).

== Three-dimensional ==
=== Helices ===

Two major definitions of &quot;spiral&quot; in the American Heritage Dictionary are:
# a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing or decreasing distance from the point.
# a three-dimensional curve that turns around an axis at a constant or continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix.

The first definition describes a planar curve, that extends in both of the perpendicular directions within its plane; the groove on one side of a gramophone record closely approximates a plane spiral (and it is by the finite width and depth of the groove, but &quot;not&quot; by the wider spacing between than within tracks, that it falls short of being a perfect example); note that successive loops &quot;differ&quot; in diameter. In another example, the &quot;center lines&quot; of the arms of a spiral galaxy trace logarithmic spirals.

The second definition includes two kinds of 3-dimensional relatives of spirals:
* A conical or volute spring (including the spring used to hold and make contact with the negative terminals of AA or AAA batteries in a battery box), and the vortex that is created when water is draining in a sink is often described as a spiral, or as a conical helix.
* Quite explicitly, definition 2 also includes a cylindrical coil spring and a strand of DNA, both of which are fairly helical, so that &quot;helix&quot; is a more &quot;useful&quot; description than &quot;spiral&quot; for each of them. In general, &quot;spiral&quot; is seldom applied if successive &quot;loops&quot; of a curve have the same diameter.

In the side picture, the black curve at the bottom is an Archimedean spiral, while the green curve is a helix. The curve shown in red is a conical spiral.

Two well-known spiral space curves are &quot;conical spirals&quot; and &quot;spherical spirals&quot;, defined below.
Another instance of space spirals is the &quot;toroidal spiral&quot;. A spiral wound around a helix, also known as &quot;double-twisted helix&quot;, represents objects such as coiled coil filaments.

=== Conical spirals ===
If in the formula_4-formula_5-plane a spiral with parametric representation 
:formula_63 
is given, then there can be added a third coordinate formula_64, such that the now space curve lies on the cone with equation formula_65:
* formula_66

Spirals based on this procedure are called conical spirals.

;Example
Starting with an &quot;archimedean spiral&quot; formula_67 one gets the conical spiral (see diagram)
:formula_68

=== Spherical spirals ===
Any cylindrical map projection can be used as the basis for a spherical spiral: draw a straight line on the map and find its inverse projection on the sphere, a kind of spherical curve.

One of the most basic families of spherical spirals is the Clelia curves, which project to straight lines on an equirectangular projection. These are curves for which longitude and colatitude are in a linear relationship, analogous to Archimedean spirals in the plane; under the azimuthal equidistant projection a Clelia curve projects to a planar Archimedean spiral.

If one represents a unit sphere by spherical coordinates

: formula_69

then setting the linear dependency formula_70 for the angle coordinates gives a parametric curve in terms of parameter ,

:formula_71

Another family of spherical spirals is the rhumb lines or loxodromes, that project to straight lines on the Mercator projection. These are the trajectories traced by a ship traveling with constant bearing. Any loxodrome (except for the meridians and parallels) spirals infinitely around either pole, closer and closer each time, unlike a Clelia curve which maintains uniform spacing in colatitude. Under stereographic projection, a loxodrome projects to a logarithmic spiral in the plane.

==In nature==
The study of spirals in nature has a long history. Christopher Wren observed that many shells form a logarithmic spiral; Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from &quot;Helix&quot; to &quot;Spirula&quot;; and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson&#x27;s &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis: the shape of the curve remains fixed, but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shells, such as &quot;Nautilus&quot; and ammonites, the generating curve revolves in a plane perpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planar discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern. Thompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.

A model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H. Vogel. This has the form
:formula_72
where &quot;n&quot; is the index number of the floret and &quot;c&quot; is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of Fermat&#x27;s spiral. The angle 137.5° is the golden angle which is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets.

Spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls. This is also the name given to spiral shaped fingerprints.

==As a symbol==
The Celtic triple-spiral is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol. It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric Newgrange monument in County Meath, Ireland. Newgrange was built around 3200 BCE, predating the Celts; triple spirals were carved at least 2,500 years before the Celts reached Ireland, but have long since become part of Celtic culture. The triskelion symbol, consisting of three interlocked spirals or three bent human legs, appears in many early cultures: examples include Mycenaean vessels, coinage from Lycia, staters of Pamphylia (at Aspendos, 370–333 BC) and Pisidia, as well as the heraldic emblem on warriors&#x27; shields depicted on Greek pottery.

Spirals occur commonly in pre-Columbian art in Latin and Central America. The more than 1,400 petroglyphs (rock engravings) in Las Plazuelas, Guanajuato Mexico, dating 750-1200 AD, predominantly depict spirals, dot figures and scale models. In Colombia, monkeys, frog and lizard-like figures depicted in petroglyphs or as gold offering-figures frequently include spirals, for example on the palms of hands. In Lower Central America, spirals along with circles, wavy lines, crosses and points are universal petroglyph characters. Spirals also appear among the Nazca Lines in the coastal desert of Peru, dating from 200 BC to 500 AD. The geoglyphs number in the thousands and depict animals, plants and geometric motifs, including spirals.

Spirals are also a symbol of hypnosis, stemming from the cliché of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (one example being Kaa in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to suggest that they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral is also found in structures as small as the double helix of DNA and as large as a galaxy. Due to this frequent natural occurrence, the spiral is the official symbol of the World Pantheist Movement.
The spiral is also a symbol of the dialectic process and of Dialectical monism.
The spiral is a frequent symbol for spiritual purification, both within Christianity and beyond (one thinks of the spiral as the neo-Platonist symbol for prayer and contemplation, circling around a subject and ascending at the same time, and as a Buddhist symbol for the gradual process on the Path to Enlightenment). [...] while a helix is repetitive, a spiral expands and thus epitomizes growth - conceptually &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.


==In art==
The spiral has inspired artists throughout the ages. Among the most famous of spiral-inspired art is Robert Smithson&#x27;s earthwork, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, at the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The spiral theme is also present in David Wood&#x27;s Spiral Resonance Field at the Balloon Museum in Albuquerque, as well as in the critically acclaimed Nine Inch Nails 1994 concept album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The Spiral is also a prominent theme in the anime &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, where it represents a philosophy and way of life. It also central in Mario Merz and Andy Goldsworthy&#x27;s work. The spiral is the central theme of the horror manga &quot;Uzumaki&quot; by Junji Ito, where a small coastal town is afflicted by a curse involving spirals.

<text>The House of Representatives is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Australia, the upper house being the Senate. Its composition and powers are set down in Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia.

The term of members of the House of Representatives is a maximum of three years from the date of the first sitting of the House, but on only one occasion since Federation has the maximum term been reached. The House is almost always dissolved earlier, usually alone but sometimes in a double dissolution alongside the Senate. Elections for members of the House of Representatives have always been held in conjunction with those for the Senate since the 1970s. A member of the House may be referred to as a &quot;member of parliament&quot; (&quot;MP&quot; or &quot;member&quot;), while a member of the Senate is usually referred to as a &quot;senator&quot;. Under the conventions of the Westminster system, the government of the day and the prime minister must achieve and maintain the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power.

The House of Representatives currently consists of 151 members, elected by and representing single member districts known as electoral divisions (commonly referred to as &quot;electorates&quot; or &quot;seats&quot;). The number of members is not fixed but can vary with boundary changes resulting from electoral redistributions, which are required on a regular basis. The most recent overall increase in the size of the House, which came into effect at the 1984 election, increased the number of members from 125 to 148. It reduced to 147 at the 1993 election, returned to 148 at the 1996 election, increased to 150 at the 2001 election, and stands at 151 as of the 2022 Australian federal election. The upcoming 2025 election will see 150 seats be elected.

The House of Representatives chamber is designed to seat up to 172 members, with provision for an ultimate total of 240 to be accommodated. 

Each division elects one member using full-preferential voting. This was put in place after the 1918 Swan by-election, which Labor unexpectedly won with the largest primary vote and the help of vote splitting in the conservative parties. The Nationalist government of the time changed the lower house voting system from first-past-the-post to full-preferential voting, effective from the 1919 general election.

==Origins and role==

The Constitution of Australia of 1900 established the House of Representatives in a newly federated Australia. The House is presided over by the speaker. Members of the House are elected from single member electorates (geographic districts, commonly referred to as &quot;seats&quot; but officially known as &quot;Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives&quot;).

One vote, one value legislation requires all electorates to have approximately the same number of voters with a maximum 10% variation, with most electorates holding 85,000 to 105,000 voters. However, the baseline quota for the number of voters in an electorate is determined by the number of voters in the state in which that electorate is found. Consequently, the electorates of the smallest states and territories have more variation in the number of voters in their electorates. Additionally, each state is guaranteed a minimum of five seats in the Constitution, which has the effect of granting Tasmania extra seats than they would otherwise be entitled to due to the their population. Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution. Full preferential voting is used in elections. A full allocation of preferences is required for a vote to be considered formal. This allows for a calculation of the two-party-preferred vote.

Under section 24 of the Constitution, each state is entitled to members based on a population quota determined from the &quot;latest statistics of the Commonwealth&quot;. These statistics arise from the census conducted under the auspices of section 51(xi). Until its repeal by the 1967 referendum, section 127 prohibited the inclusion of Aboriginal people in section 24 determinations as including the Indigenous peoples could alter the distribution of seats between the states to the benefit of states with larger Aboriginal populations. 

The total number of seats representing states in the House of Representatives must be &quot;as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators&quot;, according to section 24 of the Constitution. This requirement is known as the &quot;nexus provision&quot;. This requirement was included in the Constitution in order to maintain the power of the Senate relative to the House of Representative: both due to the belief by the drafters of the Constitution that a numerically weaker Senate would inherently lead to a lower &quot;influence, prestige, and dignity&quot; and to ensure the influence of the Senate in case of a joint sitting after a double dissolution. Another reason was to make it harder politically for the House of Representatives to be increased, thereby maintaining the smaller states over representation in the lower house due to their constitutional minimum of five seats.

The requirements for territory seats are set via legislation, which currently requires that the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have at least one member each. 

According to the Constitution, the powers of both Houses are nearly equal, with the consent of both Houses needed to pass legislation. The difference mostly relates to taxation legislation. In practice, by convention, the person who can control a majority of votes in the lower house is invited by the governor-general to form the government. In practice that means that the leader of the party (or coalition of parties) with a majority of members in the House becomes the prime minister, who then can nominate other elected members of the government party in both the House and the Senate to become ministers responsible for various portfolios and administer government departments. Bills appropriating money (supply bills) can only be introduced or amended in the lower house and thus only the party with a majority in the lower house can govern. In the current Australian party system, this ensures that virtually all contentious votes are along party lines, and the government party usually has a majority in those votes in the lower house.

The opposition party&#x27;s main role in the House is to present arguments against the government&#x27;s policies and legislation where appropriate and attempt to hold the government accountable as much as possible by asking questions of importance during question time and during debates on legislation. By contrast, the only period in recent times during which the government of the day has had a majority in the Senate was from July 2005 (when the senators elected at the 2004 election took their seats) to July 2008 (when the senators elected at the 2007 election took their seats). Hence, votes in the Senate are usually more meaningful. The House&#x27;s well-established committee system is not always as prominent as the Senate committee system because of the frequent lack of Senate majority.

In a reflection of the United Kingdom House of Commons, the predominant colour of the furnishings in the House of Representatives is green. However, the colour was tinted slightly in the new Parliament House (opened 1988) to suggest the colour of eucalyptus trees. Also, unlike the House of Commons, the seating arrangement of the crossbench is curved, similar to the curved seating arrangement of the United States House of Representatives. This suggests a more collaborative, and less oppositional, system than in the United Kingdom parliament (where all members of parliament are seated facing the opposite side).

Australian parliaments are notoriously rowdy, with MPs often trading colourful insults. As a result, the speaker often has to use the disciplinary powers granted to him or her under standing orders.

Since 2015, Australian Federal Police officers armed with assault rifles have been present in both chambers of the federal Parliament.

==Electoral system==

From the beginning of Federation until 1918, first-past-the-post voting was used in order to elect members of the House of Representatives but since the 1918 Swan by-election which Labor unexpectedly won with the largest primary vote due to vote splitting amongst the conservative parties, the Nationalist Party government, a predecessor of the modern-day Liberal Party of Australia, changed the lower house voting system to full preferential voting, as of the subsequent 1919 election. This system has remained in place ever since, allowing the Coalition parties to safely contest the same seats. Full-preference preferential voting re-elected the Hawke government at the 1990 election, the first time in federal history that Labor had obtained a net benefit from preferential voting.

From 1949 onwards, the vast majority of electorates, nearly 90%, are won by the candidate leading on first preferences, giving the same result as if the same votes had been counted using first-past-the-post voting. The highest proportion of seats (up to 2010) won by the candidate not leading on first preferences was the 1972 federal election, with 14 of 125 seats not won by the plurality candidate.

===Allocation process for the House of Representatives===
The main elements of the operation of preferential voting for single-member House of Representatives divisions are as follows:

*Voters are required to place the number &quot;1&quot; against their first choice of candidate, known as the &quot;first preference&quot; or &quot;primary vote&quot;.
*Voters are then required to place the numbers &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, etc., against all of the other candidates listed on the ballot paper, in order of preference. &quot;Every&quot; candidate must be numbered, otherwise the vote becomes &quot;informal&quot; (spoiled) and does not count.)
*Prior to counting, each ballot paper is examined to ensure that it is validly filled in (and not invalidated on other grounds).
*The number &quot;1&quot; or first preference votes are counted first. If no candidate secures an absolute majority (more than half) of first preference votes, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded from the count.
*The votes for the eliminated candidate (i.e. from the ballots that placed the eliminated candidate first) are re-allocated to the remaining candidates according to the number &quot;2&quot; or &quot;second preference&quot; votes.
*If no candidate has yet secured an absolute majority of the vote, then the next candidate with the fewest primary votes is eliminated. This preference allocation is repeated until there is a candidate with an absolute majority. Where a second (or subsequent) preference is expressed for a candidate who has already been eliminated, the voter&#x27;s third or subsequent preferences are used.

Following the full allocation of preferences, it is possible to derive a two-party-preferred figure, where the votes have been allocated between the two main candidates in the election. In Australia, this is usually between the candidates from the Coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party.

==Relationship with the government==

Under the Constitution, the governor-general has the power to appoint and dismiss the &quot;Queen&#x27;s [or King&#x27;s] Ministers of State&quot; who administer government departments. In practice, the governor-general chooses ministers in accordance with the traditions of the Westminster system that the government be drawn from the party or coalition of parties that has a majority in the House of Representatives, with the leader of the largest party becoming prime minister.

A sub-set of the most important ministers then meet in a council known as Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and are frequently held to discuss vital issues and make policy decisions. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia&#x27;s highest formal executive body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. A senior Cabinet member holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the governor-general. The Federal Executive Council is the Australian equivalent of the executive councils and privy councils in other Commonwealth realms such as the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

A minister must be a senator or member of the House of Representatives at the time of their appointment, or become one within three months of their appointment. This provision was included in the Constitution (section 64) to enable the inaugural ministry, led by Edmund Barton, to be appointed on 1 January 1901, even though the first federal elections were not scheduled to be held until 29 and 30 March.

After the 1949 election, Bill Spooner was appointed a minister in the Fourth Menzies ministry on 19 December, however his term as a Senator did not begin until 22 February 1950.

The provision was also used after the disappearance and presumed death of the Liberal prime minister Harold Holt in December 1967. The Liberal Party elected John Gorton, then a senator, as its new leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 10 January 1968 (following an interim ministry led by John McEwen). On 1 February, Gorton resigned from the Senate to stand for the 24 February by-election in Holt&#x27;s former House of Representatives electorate of Higgins due to the convention that the prime minister be a member of the lower house. For 22 days (2 to 23 February inclusive) he was prime minister while a member of neither house of parliament.

On a number of occasions when ministers have retired from their seats prior to an election, or stood but lost their own seats in the election, they have retained their ministerial offices until the next government is sworn in.

==Committees==
In addition to the work of the main chamber, the House of Representatives also has a large number of committees which deal with matters referred to them by the main House. They provide the opportunity for all MPs to ask questions of ministers and public officials as well as conduct inquiries, examine policy and legislation. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the government to consider.

The ability of the chambers of Parliament to establish committees is given in section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, &quot;The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.&quot;Parliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in contempt of parliament. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt. These include refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt. Other powers include, the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.

Proceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament, they are recorded by Hansard, except for private hearings, and also operate under parliamentary privilege. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, are protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.

Types of committees include:

Standing committees, which are established on a permanent basis and are responsible for scrutinising bills and topics referred to them by the chamber; examining the government&#x27;s budget and activities and for examining departmental annual reports and activities.

Select committees, which are temporary committees, established in order to deal with particular issues.

Domestic committees, which are responsible for administering aspects of the House&#x27;s own affairs. These include the Selection Committee that determines how the House will deal with particular pieces of legislation and private members business and the Privileges Committee that deals with matters of parliamentary privilege.

Legislative scrutiny committees, which examine legislation and regulations to determine their impact on individual rights and accountability.

Joint committees are also established to include both members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

==Federation Chamber==
The Federation Chamber is a second debating chamber that considers relatively uncontroversial matters referred by the House. The Federation Chamber cannot, however, initiate or make a final decision on any parliamentary business, although it can perform all tasks in between.
The Federation Chamber was created in 1994 as the Main Committee, to relieve some of the burden of the House: different matters can be processed in the House at large and in the Federation Chamber, as they sit simultaneously. It is designed to be less formal, with a quorum of only three members: the deputy speaker of the House, one government member, and one non-government member. Decisions must be unanimous: any divided decision sends the question back to the House at large.
The Federation Chamber was created through the House&#x27;s standing orders: it is thus a subordinate body of the House, and can only be in session while the House itself is in session. When a division vote in the House occurs, members in the Federation Chamber must return to the House to vote.

The Federation Chamber is housed in one of the House&#x27;s committee rooms; the room is customised for this purpose and is laid out to resemble the House chamber.

Due to the unique role of what was then called the Main Committee, proposals were made to rename the body to avoid confusion with other parliamentary committees, including &quot;Second Chamber&quot; and &quot;Federation Chamber&quot;. The House of Representatives later adopted the latter proposal.

The concept of a parallel body to expedite Parliamentary business, based on the Australian Federation Chamber, was mentioned in a 1998 British House of Commons report, which led to the creation of that body&#x27;s parallel chamber Westminster Hall.
==Current House of Representatives==
The current Parliament is the 47th Australian Parliament. The most recent federal election was held on 21 May 2022, with the 47th Parliament first sitting in July 2022.

The 2022 election saw the incumbent Liberal/National Coalition government defeated, with the opposition Albanese-led Labor Party gaining 77 seats in the 151 seat House of Representatives, for a two-seat majority government, while the Coalition lost 18 seats to finish with 58 seats, their worst result since 1946 (the first election after the formation of the current Liberal Party). 

On the crossbench, the Australian Greens gained three seats, upping their total from one to four, while the Centre Alliance and Katter&#x27;s Australian Party held their current standing of one seat each, and independents gained seven seats to bring their total to ten, six of these being teal independents.

On 23 December 2022, Andrew Gee MP quit the National Party to become an independent, citing his disappointment over the party&#x27;s opposition to the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament.

On 1 April 2023, Labor&#x27;s Mary Doyle was elected in a by-election for the division of Aston, replacing former Liberal cabinet minister Alan Tudge and increasing the Labor majority to three seats.

==Primary, two-party and seat results==
Prior to the 1909 merger of the two non-Labor parties, a three-party system existed in the chamber, with a two-party system in place since. 

The 1910 election was the first to elect a majority government, with the Australian Labor Party also winning the first Senate majority. 

A two-party-preferred vote (2PP) has been calculated since the 1919 change from first-past-the-post to preferential voting, and subsequent introduction of the Coalition. ALP = Australian Labor Party, L+NP = grouping of Liberal/National/LNP/CLP Coalition parties (and predecessors), Oth = other parties and independents.

<text>Christoph Hartknoch (1644–1687) was a Prussian historian and educator.

==Biography==
Hartknoch was born in Jablonken (Jabłonka) near Ortelsburg (Szczytno) in the Duchy of Prussia. In 1650 the family moved to Passenheim (Pasym) and there witnessed the brutality and horrors of the Tatar attacks, fighting for the Kingdom of Poland, in southern Prussia. His life was saved by his teacher, who shoved him out the window. Numerous villages in the region were destroyed, but Hartknoch made it to the ducal capital of Königsberg.

In Königsberg Hartknoch started studying theology at a Protestant institute. Soon after his parents died and he had to take on jobs. He became a private teacher in Kaunas and then a rector in the Protestant school in Vilnius. He soon returned to Königsberg where books and records interested him in history.

In 1679 Hartknoch published a book about Prussian history, &quot;Old and New Prussia&quot;, first in Latin and then in German, as well as a history of the church in Prussia. The works are accompanied by descriptions and illustrations of people, history, and culture, as well as copper etching illustrations of towns. He received ethnographical information from the priest Matthäus Prätorius.

Hartknoch&#x27;s work in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kaunas, and Vilnius awoke his interest in their history. He wrote a comprehensive work on the Commonwealth spanning 300 years, the first of its kind.

In 1677 the city of Toruń (Thorn) invited Hartknoch to become director at its gymnasium, where he worked for ten years. Wearied by poverty, Hartknoch died and was buried there in 1687 at the age of 43.

Hartknoch&#x27;s extensive scientific body of works contributed greatly to knowledge of Prussia, Pomerania, Samogitia, Courland, and Poland.

==Nicolaus Copernicus portrait==
In his book covering the history of Prussia, Hartknoch features an illustration of Nicolaus Copernicus. Hartknoch wrote: &quot;About the cities and castles. The famous mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus&quot;. The book was written later in Hartknoch&#x27;s life, when he was director at the .

<text>Ross John Anderson (15 September 1956 – 28 March 2024) was a British researcher, author, and industry consultant in security engineering. He was Professor of Security Engineering at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge where he was part of the University&#x27;s security group.

==Education ==
Anderson was educated at the High School of Glasgow. After leaving school he attended Glasgow University and studied Natural Philosophy. He did not complete his studies there and moved to Cambridge. In 1978, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and natural science from the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Trinity College, Cambridge, and subsequently received a qualification in computer engineering. Anderson worked in the avionics and banking industry before moving back to the University of Cambridge in 1992, to work on his doctorate under the supervision of Roger Needham and start his career as an academic researcher. He received his PhD in 1995.

==Research and career==

Anderson was appointed a lecturer at Cambridge in 1995. In addition to teaching at the University of Cambridge, he also taught at the University of Edinburgh.

Anderson&#x27;s research interests were in security, cryptology, dependability and technology policy. In cryptography, he designed with Eli Biham the BEAR, LION and Tiger cryptographic primitives, and co-wrote with Biham and Lars Knudsen the block cipher Serpent, one of the finalists in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. He also discovered weaknesses in the FISH cipher and designed the stream cipher Pike.

Anderson always campaigned for computer security to be studied in a wider social context. Many of his writings emphasised the human, social, and political dimension of security. On online voting, for example, he wrote &quot;When you move from voting in person to voting at home (whether by post, by phone or over the Internet) it vastly expands the scope for vote buying and coercion&quot;, making the point that it&#x27;s not just a question of whether the encryption can be cracked.

In 1998, Anderson founded the Foundation for Information Policy Research, a think tank and lobbying group on information-technology policy.

Anderson was also a founder of the UK-Crypto mailing list and the economics of security research domain.

Anderson was well-known among Cambridge academics as an outspoken defender of academic freedoms, intellectual property and other matters of university politics. He was engaged in the &quot;Campaign for Cambridge Freedoms&quot; and had been an elected member of Cambridge University Council since 2002. In January 2004, the student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; declared Anderson to be Cambridge University&#x27;s &quot;most powerful person&quot;.

In 2002, he became an outspoken critic of trusted computing proposals, in particular Microsoft&#x27;s Palladium operating system vision.

Anderson&#x27;s TCPA FAQ has been characterised by IBM TC researcher David R. Safford as &quot;full of technical errors&quot; and of &quot;presenting speculation as fact.&quot;

For years Anderson argued that by their nature large databases will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. He said that if a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use. This is sometimes known as &quot;Anderson&#x27;s Rule&quot;.

Anderson was the author of several editions of &quot;Security Engineering&quot;, which was initially published by Wiley in 2001. He was the founder and editor of &quot;Computer and Communications Security Reviews&quot;.

After the vast global surveillance disclosures leaked by Edward Snowden beginning in June 2013, Anderson suggested one way to begin stamping out the British state&#x27;s unaccountable involvement in this NSA spying scandal was to entirely end the domestic secret services. Anderson: &quot;Were I a legislator, I would simply abolish MI5&quot;. Anderson noted the only way this kind of systemic data collection was made possible was through the business models of private industry. The value of information-driven Web companies such as Facebook and Google is built around their ability to gather vast tracts of data. It was something the intelligence agencies would have struggled with alone.

Anderson was a critic of smart meters, writing that there are various privacy and energy security concerns.

===Awards and honours===
Anderson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2009. His nomination reads:

Anderson was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 2009. He was a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge and awarded the BCS Lovelace Medal in 2015. Anderson was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2023.

== Personal life and death ==
Anderson met his wife, Shireen, while he was working in Johannesburg and they were married in Cambridge in 1992. Shireen Anderson is the coordinator of the Christina Kelly Association, of Churchill College, Cambridge. They have one daughter, Bavani, and four grandchildren.

Anderson died unexpectedly at home with his family in Cambridge on 28 March 2024, at the age of 67.

== Security Engineering ==
By agreement with the publisher , the third edition of Ross Anderson&#x27;s book Security Engineering was made available for download at the Cambridge University archive in November 2024.

<doc id="61577" wikidata="Q106603432" url="?curid=61577" title="Electrical resistance and conductance">
<text>The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. Its reciprocal quantity is , measuring the ease with which an electric current passes. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with mechanical friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (), while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S) (formerly called the &#x27;mho&#x27; and then represented by ).

The resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of electrical insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance and low conductance, while objects made of electrical conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductance. This relationship is quantified by resistivity or conductivity. The nature of a material is not the only factor in resistance and conductance, however; it also depends on the size and shape of an object because these properties are extensive rather than intensive. For example, a wire&#x27;s resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects resist electrical current, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero.

The resistance of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage across it to current through it, while the conductance is the reciprocal:
formula_1

For a wide variety of materials and conditions, and are directly proportional to each other, and therefore and are constants (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called Ohm&#x27;s law, and materials that satisfy it are called &quot;ohmic&quot; materials.

In other cases, such as a transformer, diode or battery, and are not directly proportional. The ratio is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a &quot;chordal resistance&quot; or &quot;static resistance&quot;, since it corresponds to the inverse slope of a chord between the origin and an – curve. In other situations, the derivative formula_2 may be most useful; this is called the &quot;differential resistance&quot;.

==Introduction==

In the hydraulic analogy, current flowing through a wire (or resistor) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the voltage drop across the wire is like the pressure drop that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. 

The voltage drop (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the voltage itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: the pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)

The resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:
* geometry (shape), and
* material

Geometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.

Materials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, electrons can flow freely and easily through a copper wire, but cannot flow as easily through a steel wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an insulator like rubber, regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and electron configuration, and is quantified by a property called resistivity.

In addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see below.

==Conductors and resistors==
Substances in which electricity can flow are called conductors. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a resistor. Conductors are made of high-conductivity materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.

==Ohm&#x27;s law==

For many materials, the current through the material is proportional to the voltage applied across it:
formula_3
over a wide range of voltages and currents. Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called Ohm&#x27;s law, and materials which obey it are called &quot;ohmic&quot; materials. Examples of ohmic components are wires and resistors. The current–voltage graph of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive slope.

Other components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm&#x27;s law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them. These are called &quot;nonlinear&quot; or &quot;non-ohmic&quot;. Examples include diodes and fluorescent lamps.

== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==

The resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: what material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance and conductance of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as

formula_4

where formula_5 is the length of the conductor, measured in metres (m), is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in square metres (m2), (sigma) is the electrical conductivity measured in siemens per meter (S·m−1), and (rho) is the electrical resistivity (also called &quot;specific electrical resistance&quot;) of the material, measured in ohm-metres (Ω·m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are reciprocals: formula_6. Resistivity is a measure of the material&#x27;s ability to oppose electric current.

This formula is not exact, as it assumes the current density is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.

Another situation for which this formula is not exact is with alternating current (AC), because the skin effect inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the &quot;geometrical&quot; cross-section is different from the &quot;effective&quot; cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the proximity effect. At commercial power frequency, these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as busbars in an electrical substation, or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.

The resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of teflon is about 1030 times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of &quot;delocalized&quot; electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. Semiconductors lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: Electrical resistivity and conductivity. For the case of electrolyte solutions, see the article: Conductivity (electrolytic).

Resistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See below.

==Measurement==
An instrument for measuring resistance is called an ohmmeter. Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use four-terminal sensing.

==Typical values==


==Static and differential resistance==

Many electrical elements, such as diodes and batteries do satisfy Ohm&#x27;s law. These are called &quot;non-ohmic&quot; or &quot;non-linear&quot;, and their current–voltage curves are straight lines through the origin.

Resistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its operating point. There are two types of resistance:


==AC circuits==
===Impedance and admittance===


When an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their phases. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a capacitor or inductor, the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90° out of phase, see image below). Complex numbers are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:

formula_7

where:
* is time;
* and are the voltage and current as a function of time, respectively;
* and indicate the amplitude of the voltage and current, respectively;
* formula_8 is the angular frequency of the AC current;
* formula_9 is the displacement angle;
* and are the complex-valued voltage and current, respectively;
* and are the complex impedance and admittance, respectively;
* formula_10 indicates the real part of a complex number; and
* formula_11 is the imaginary unit.

The impedance and admittance may be expressed as complex numbers that can be broken into real and imaginary parts:
formula_12

where is resistance, is conductance, is reactance, and is susceptance. These lead to the complex number identities
formula_13
which are true in all cases, whereas formula_14 is only true in the special cases of either DC or reactance-free current.

The complex angle formula_15 is the phase difference between the voltage and current passing through a component with impedance . For capacitors and inductors, this angle is exactly -90° or +90°, respectively, and and are nonzero. Ideal resistors have an angle of 0°, since is zero (and hence also), and and reduce to and respectively. In general, AC systems are designed to keep the phase angle close to 0° as much as possible, since it reduces the reactive power, which does no useful work at a load. In a simple case with an inductive load (causing the phase to increase), a capacitor may be added for compensation at one frequency, since the capacitor&#x27;s phase shift is negative, bringing the total impedance phase closer to 0° again.

 is the reciprocal of (formula_16) for all circuits, just as formula_17 for DC circuits containing only resistors, or AC circuits for which either the reactance or susceptance happens to be zero ( or , respectively) (if one is zero, then for realistic systems both must be zero).

===Frequency dependence ===
A key feature of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent, a phenomenon known as the universal dielectric response. One reason, mentioned above is the skin effect (and the related proximity effect). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see Drude model, deep-level traps, resonant frequency, Kramers–Kronig relations, etc.)

==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==

Resistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called &quot;Joule heating&quot; (after James Prescott Joule), also called &quot;ohmic heating&quot; or &quot;resistive heating&quot;.

The dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of transmission losses in power lines. High voltage transmission helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.

On the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in electric stoves and other electric heaters (also called &quot;resistive heaters&quot;). As another example, incandescent lamps rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows &quot;white hot&quot; with thermal radiation (also called incandescence).

The formula for Joule heating is:
formula_18
where is the power (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, is the resistance, and is the current through the resistor.

== Dependence on other conditions ==

=== Temperature dependence ===

Near room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see Electrical resistivity and conductivity.

As a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a resistance thermometer or thermistor. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)

Resistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as thermometers: by measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): if a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor&#x27;s temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.

If the temperature does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used:
formula_19
where formula_20 is called the &quot;temperature coefficient of resistance&quot;, formula_21 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and formula_22 is the resistance at temperature formula_21. The parameter formula_20 is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, formula_20 is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that formula_20 was measured at with a suffix, such as formula_27, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.

The temperature coefficient formula_20 is typically to for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.

=== Strain dependence ===

Just as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on strain gauges for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.

=== Light illumination dependence ===

Some resistors, particularly those made from semiconductors, exhibit &quot;photoconductivity&quot;, meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called &quot;photoresistors&quot; (or &quot;light dependent resistors&quot;). These are a common type of light detector.

==Superconductivity==

Superconductors are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have and . This also means there is no joule heating, or in other words no dissipation of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near with liquid helium for most metallic superconductors like niobium–tin alloys, or cooling to temperatures near with liquid nitrogen for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic high temperature superconductors.
Nevertheless, there are many technological applications of superconductivity, including superconducting magnets.

<text>Electrical resistivity (also called volume resistivity or specific electrical resistance) is a fundamental specific property of a material that measures its electrical resistance or how strongly it resists electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter  (rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-metre (Ω⋅m). For example, if a solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is , then the resistivity of the material is .

Electrical conductivity (or specific conductance) is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity. It represents a material&#x27;s ability to conduct electric current. It is commonly signified by the Greek letter  (sigma), but  (kappa) (especially in electrical engineering) and  (gamma) are sometimes used. The SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per metre (S/m). Resistivity and conductivity are intensive properties of materials, giving the opposition of a standard cube of material to current. Electrical resistance and conductance are corresponding extensive properties that give the opposition of a specific object to electric current.

== Definition ==
===Ideal case===

In an ideal case, cross-section and physical composition of the examined material are uniform across the sample, and the electric field and current density are both parallel and constant everywhere. Many resistors and conductors do in fact have a uniform cross section with a uniform flow of electric current, and are made of a single material, so that this is a good model. (See the adjacent diagram.) When this is the case, the resistance of the conductor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, where the electrical resistivity  (Greek: rho) is the constant of proportionality. This is written as:

formula_1formula_2

where
The resistivity can be expressed using the SI unit ohm metre (Ω⋅m) — i.e. ohms multiplied by square metres (for the cross-sectional area) then divided by metres (for the length).

Both &quot;resistance&quot; and &quot;resistivity&quot; describe how difficult it is to make electrical current flow through a material, but unlike resistance, resistivity is an intrinsic property and does not depend on geometric properties of a material. This means that all pure copper (Cu) wires (which have not been subjected to distortion of their crystalline structure etc.), irrespective of their shape and size, have the same , but a long, thin copper wire has a much larger than a thick, short copper wire. Every material has its own characteristic resistivity. For example, rubber has a far larger resistivity than copper.

In a hydraulic analogy, passing current through a high-resistivity material is like pushing water through a pipe full of sand - while passing current through a low-resistivity material is like pushing water through an empty pipe. If the pipes are the same size and shape, the pipe full of sand has higher resistance to flow. Resistance, however, is not determined by the presence or absence of sand. It also depends on the length and width of the pipe: short or wide pipes have lower resistance than narrow or long pipes.
The above equation can be transposed to get Pouillet&#x27;s law (named after Claude Pouillet):

formula_3The resistance of a given element is proportional to the length, but inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. For example, if  = , formula_4 = (forming a cube with perfectly conductive contacts on opposite faces), then the resistance of this element in ohms is numerically equal to the resistivity of the material it is made of in Ω⋅m.

Conductivity, , is the inverse of resistivity:

formula_5

Conductivity has SI units of siemens per metre (S/m).

===General scalar quantities ===

If the geometry is more complicated, or if the resistivity varies from point to point within the material, the current and electric field will be functions of position. Then it is necessary to use a more general expression in which the resistivity at a particular point is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the density of the current it creates at that point:

formula_6

where

The current density is parallel to the electric field by necessity.

Conductivity is the inverse (reciprocal) of resistivity. Here, it is given by:

formula_7

For example, rubber is a material with large and small  — because even a very large electric field in rubber makes almost no current flow through it. On the other hand, copper is a material with small and large  — because even a small electric field pulls a lot of current through it.

This expression simplifies to the formula given above under &quot;ideal case&quot; when the resistivity is constant in the material and the geometry has a uniform cross-section. In this case, the electric field and current density are constant and parallel.

=== Tensor resistivity ===
When the resistivity of a material has a directional component, the most general definition of resistivity must be used. It starts from the tensor-vector form of Ohm&#x27;s law, which relates the electric field inside a material to the electric current flow. This equation is completely general, meaning it is valid in all cases, including those mentioned above. However, this definition is the most complicated, so it is only directly used in anisotropic cases, where the more simple definitions cannot be applied. If the material is not anisotropic, it is safe to ignore the tensor-vector definition, and use a simpler expression instead.

Here, anisotropic means that the material has different properties in different directions. For example, a crystal of graphite consists microscopically of a stack of sheets, and current flows very easily through each sheet, but much less easily from one sheet to the adjacent one. In such cases, the current does not flow in exactly the same direction as the electric field. Thus, the appropriate equations are generalized to the three-dimensional tensor form:

formula_8

where the conductivity and resistivity are rank-2 tensors, and electric field and current density are vectors. These tensors can be represented by 3×3 matrices, the vectors with 3×1 matrices, with matrix multiplication used on the right side of these equations. In matrix form, the resistivity relation is given by:

formula_9

where

Equivalently, resistivity can be given in the more compact Einstein notation:

formula_10

In either case, the resulting expression for each electric field component is:

formula_11

Since the choice of the coordinate system is free, the usual convention is to simplify the expression by choosing an -axis parallel to the current direction, so . This leaves:

formula_12

Conductivity is defined similarly:

formula_13

or

formula_14

both resulting in:

formula_15

Looking at the two expressions, formula_16 and formula_17 are the matrix inverse of each other. However, in the most general case, the individual matrix elements are not necessarily reciprocals of one another; for example, may not be equal to . This can be seen in the Hall effect, where formula_18 is nonzero. In the Hall effect, due to rotational invariance about the -axis, formula_19 and formula_20, so the relation between resistivity and conductivity simplifies to:

formula_21

If the electric field is parallel to the applied current, formula_18 and formula_23 are zero. When they are zero, one number, formula_24, is enough to describe the electrical resistivity. It is then written as simply formula_25, and this reduces to the simpler expression.

=== Relation between current density and electric current velocity ===
Electric current is the ordered movement of electric charges.

==Causes of conductivity==

===Band theory simplified===

According to elementary quantum mechanics, an electron in an atom or crystal can only have certain precise energy levels; energies between these levels are impossible. When a large number of such allowed levels have close-spaced energy values – i.e. have energies that differ only minutely – those close energy levels in combination are called an &quot;energy band&quot;. There can be many such energy bands in a material, depending on the atomic number of the constituent atoms and their distribution within the crystal.

The material&#x27;s electrons seek to minimize the total energy in the material by settling into low energy states; however, the Pauli exclusion principle means that only one can exist in each such state. So the electrons &quot;fill up&quot; the band structure starting from the bottom. The characteristic energy level up to which the electrons have filled is called the Fermi level. The position of the Fermi level with respect to the band structure is very important for electrical conduction: Only electrons in energy levels near or above the Fermi level are free to move within the broader material structure, since the electrons can easily jump among the partially occupied states in that region. In contrast, the low energy states are completely filled with a fixed limit on the number of electrons at all times, and the high energy states are empty of electrons at all times.

Electric current consists of a flow of electrons. In metals there are many electron energy levels near the Fermi level, so there are many electrons available to move. This is what causes the high electronic conductivity of metals.

An important part of band theory is that there may be forbidden bands of energy: energy intervals that contain no energy levels. In insulators and semiconductors, the number of electrons is just the right amount to fill a certain integer number of low energy bands, exactly to the boundary. In this case, the Fermi level falls within a band gap. Since there are no available states near the Fermi level, and the electrons are not freely movable, the electronic conductivity is very low.

===In metals===

A metal consists of a lattice of atoms, each with an outer shell of electrons that freely dissociate from their parent atoms and travel through the lattice. This is also known as a positive ionic lattice. This &#x27;sea&#x27; of dissociable electrons allows the metal to conduct electric current. When an electrical potential difference (a voltage) is applied across the metal, the resulting electric field causes electrons to drift towards the positive terminal. The actual drift velocity of electrons is typically small, on the order of magnitude of metres per hour. However, due to the sheer number of moving electrons, even a slow drift velocity results in a large current density. The mechanism is similar to transfer of momentum of balls in a Newton&#x27;s cradle but the rapid propagation of an electric energy along a wire is not due to the mechanical forces, but the propagation of an energy-carrying electromagnetic field guided by the wire.

Most metals have electrical resistance. In simpler models (non quantum mechanical models) this can be explained by replacing electrons and the crystal lattice by a wave-like structure. When the electron wave travels through the lattice, the waves interfere, which causes resistance. The more regular the lattice is, the less disturbance happens and thus the less resistance. The amount of resistance is thus mainly caused by two factors. First, it is caused by the temperature and thus amount of vibration of the crystal lattice. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, which act as irregularities in the lattice. Second, the purity of the metal is relevant as a mixture of different ions is also an irregularity. The small decrease in conductivity on melting of pure metals is due to the loss of long range crystalline order. The short range order remains and strong correlation between positions of ions results in coherence between waves diffracted by adjacent ions.

===In semiconductors and insulators===
In metals, the Fermi level lies in the conduction band (see Band Theory, above) giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in semiconductors the position of the Fermi level is within the band gap, about halfway between the conduction band minimum (the bottom of the first band of unfilled electron energy levels) and the valence band maximum (the top of the band below the conduction band, of filled electron energy levels). That applies for intrinsic (undoped) semiconductors. This means that at absolute zero temperature, there would be no free conduction electrons, and the resistance is infinite. However, the resistance decreases as the charge carrier density (i.e., without introducing further complications, the density of electrons) in the conduction band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, dopant atoms increase the majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction band or producing holes in the valence band. (A &quot;hole&quot; is a position where an electron is missing; such holes can behave in a similar way to electrons.) For both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing dopant density reduces resistance. Hence, highly doped semiconductors behave metallically. At very high temperatures, the contribution of thermally generated carriers dominates over the contribution from dopant atoms, and the resistance decreases exponentially with temperature.

===In ionic liquids/electrolytes===

In electrolytes, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes, but by full atomic species (ions) traveling, each carrying an electrical charge. The resistivity of ionic solutions (electrolytes) varies tremendously with concentration – while distilled water is almost an insulator, salt water is a reasonable electrical conductor. Conduction in ionic liquids is also controlled by the movement of ions, but here we are talking about molten salts rather than solvated ions. In biological membranes, currents are carried by ionic salts. Small holes in cell membranes, called ion channels, are selective to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.

The concentration of ions in a liquid (e.g., in an aqueous solution) depends on the degree of dissociation of the dissolved substance, characterized by a dissociation coefficient formula_26, which is the ratio of the concentration of ions formula_27 to the concentration of molecules of the dissolved substance formula_28:

formula_29

The specific electrical conductivity (formula_30) of a solution is equal to:

formula_31

where formula_32: module of the ion charge, formula_33 and formula_34: mobility of positively and negatively charged ions, formula_28: concentration of molecules of the dissolved substance, formula_26: the coefficient of dissociation.

===Superconductivity===
The electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In normal (that is, non-superconducting) conductors, such as copper or silver, this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near absolute zero, a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. In a normal conductor, the current is driven by a voltage gradient, whereas in a superconductor, there is no voltage gradient and the current is instead related to the phase gradient of the superconducting order parameter. A consequence of this is that an electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.

In a class of superconductors known as type II superconductors, including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of magnetic vortices in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen so that the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.

===Plasma===

Plasmas are very good conductors and electric potentials play an important role.

The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the &quot;plasma potential&quot;, or &quot;space potential&quot;. If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential generally lies considerably below the plasma potential, due to what is termed a Debye sheath. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of &quot;quasineutrality&quot;, which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (), but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that &quot;double layers&quot; are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net charge density. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the Boltzmann relation:
formula_37

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
formula_38

(∇ is the vector gradient operator; see nabla symbol and gradient for more information.)

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small. Otherwise, the repulsive electrostatic force dissipates it.

In astrophysical plasmas, Debye screening prevents electric fields from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.

Plasma is often called the &quot;fourth state of matter&quot; after solid, liquids and gases. It is distinct from these and other lower-energy states of matter. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

==Resistivity and conductivity of various materials== 

* A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity and a low resistivity.
* An insulator such as glass has low conductivity and a high resistivity.
* The conductivity of a semiconductor is generally intermediate, but varies widely under different conditions, such as exposure of the material to electric fields or specific frequencies of light, and, most important, with temperature and composition of the semiconductor material.

The degree of semiconductors doping makes a large difference in conductivity. To a point, more doping leads to higher conductivity. The conductivity of a water/aqueous solution is highly dependent on its concentration of dissolved salts, and other chemical species that ionize in the solution. Electrical conductivity of water samples is used as an indicator of how salt-free, ion-free, or impurity-free the sample is; the purer the water, the lower the conductivity (the higher the resistivity). Conductivity measurements in water are often reported as &quot;specific conductance&quot;, relative to the conductivity of pure water at . An EC meter is normally used to measure conductivity in a solution. A rough summary is as follows:

This table shows the resistivity (), conductivity and temperature coefficient of various materials at .

The effective temperature coefficient varies with temperature and purity level of the material. The 20 °C value is only an approximation when used at other temperatures. For example, the coefficient becomes lower at higher temperatures for copper, and the value 0.00427 is commonly specified at .

The extremely low resistivity (high conductivity) of silver is characteristic of metals. George Gamow tidily summed up the nature of the metals&#x27; dealings with electrons in his popular science book &quot;One, Two, Three...Infinity&quot; (1947):

More technically, the free electron model gives a basic description of electron flow in metals.

Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least worse insulator than oven-dry. In any case, a sufficiently high voltage – such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension power lines – can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood.

==Temperature dependence==

===Linear approximation===
The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used:
formula_39

where formula_26 is called the &quot;temperature coefficient of resistivity&quot;, formula_41 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and formula_42 is the resistivity at temperature formula_41. The parameter formula_26 is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, formula_26 is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that formula_26 was measured at with a suffix, such as formula_47, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference. When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the linear approximation is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.

===Metals===

In general, electrical resistivity of metals increases with temperature. Electron–phonon interactions can play a key role. At high temperatures, the resistance of a metal increases linearly with temperature. As the temperature of a metal is reduced, the temperature dependence of resistivity follows a power law function of temperature. Mathematically the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a metal can be approximated through the Bloch–Grüneisen formula:

formula_48

where formula_49 is the residual resistivity due to defect scattering, A is a constant that depends on the velocity of electrons at the Fermi surface, the Debye radius and the number density of electrons in the metal. formula_50 is the Debye temperature as obtained from resistivity measurements and matches very closely with the values of Debye temperature obtained from specific heat measurements. n is an integer that depends upon the nature of interaction:

*  = 5 implies that the resistance is due to scattering of electrons by phonons (as it is for simple metals)
*  = 3 implies that the resistance is due to s-d electron scattering (as is the case for transition metals)
*  = 2 implies that the resistance is due to electron–electron interaction.

The Bloch–Grüneisen formula is an approximation obtained assuming that the studied metal has spherical Fermi surface inscribed within the first Brillouin zone and a Debye phonon spectrum.

If more than one source of scattering is simultaneously present, Matthiessen&#x27;s rule (first formulated by Augustus Matthiessen in the 1860s) states that the total resistance can be approximated by adding up several different terms, each with the appropriate value of .

As the temperature of the metal is sufficiently reduced (so as to &#x27;freeze&#x27; all the phonons), the resistivity usually reaches a constant value, known as the residual resistivity. This value depends not only on the type of metal, but on its purity and thermal history. The value of the residual resistivity of a metal is decided by its impurity concentration. Some materials lose all electrical resistivity at sufficiently low temperatures, due to an effect known as superconductivity.

An investigation of the low-temperature resistivity of metals was the motivation to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes&#x27;s experiments that led in 1911 to discovery of superconductivity. For details see History of superconductivity.

==== Wiedemann–Franz law ====
The Wiedemann–Franz law states that for materials where heat and charge transport is dominated by electrons, the ratio of thermal to electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature:

formula_51

where formula_52 is the thermal conductivity, formula_53 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_54 is the electron charge, formula_55 is temperature, and formula_30 is the electric conductivity. The ratio on the rhs is called the Lorenz number.

===Semiconductors===
In general, intrinsic semiconductor resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. The electrons are bumped to the conduction energy band by thermal energy, where they flow freely, and in doing so leave behind holes in the valence band, which also flow freely. The electric resistance of a typical intrinsic (non doped) semiconductor decreases exponentially with temperature following an Arrhenius model:

formula_57

An even better approximation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a semiconductor is given by the Steinhart–Hart equation:

formula_58

where , and are the so-called Steinhart–Hart coefficients.

This equation is used to calibrate thermistors.

Extrinsic (doped) semiconductors have a far more complicated temperature profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors. After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers, the resistance starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers (much as in a metal). At higher temperatures, they behave like intrinsic semiconductors as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant compared to the thermally generated carriers.

In non-crystalline semiconductors, conduction can occur by charges quantum tunnelling from one localised site to another. This is known as variable range hopping and has the characteristic form of
formula_59

where = 2, 3, 4, depending on the dimensionality of the system.

=== Kondo insulators ===
Kondo insulators are materials where the resistivity follows the formula

: formula_60

where formula_61, formula_62, formula_63 and formula_64 are constant parameters, formula_42 the residual resistivity, formula_66 the Fermi liquid contribution, formula_67 a lattice vibrations term and formula_68 the Kondo effect.

==Complex resistivity and conductivity==
When analyzing the response of materials to alternating electric fields (dielectric spectroscopy), in applications such as electrical impedance tomography, it is convenient to replace resistivity with a complex quantity called impedivity (in analogy to electrical impedance). Impedivity is the sum of a real component, the resistivity, and an imaginary component, the reactivity (in analogy to reactance). The magnitude of impedivity is the square root of sum of squares of magnitudes of resistivity and reactivity.

Conversely, in such cases the conductivity must be expressed as a complex number (or even as a matrix of complex numbers, in the case of anisotropic materials) called the &quot;admittivity&quot;. Admittivity is the sum of a real component called the conductivity and an imaginary component called the susceptivity.

An alternative description of the response to alternating currents uses a real (but frequency-dependent) conductivity, along with a real permittivity. The larger the conductivity is, the more quickly the alternating-current signal is absorbed by the material (i.e., the more opaque the material is). For details, see Mathematical descriptions of opacity.

==Resistance versus resistivity in complicated geometries==
Even if the material&#x27;s resistivity is known, calculating the resistance of something made from it may, in some cases, be much more complicated than the formula formula_69 above. One example is spreading resistance profiling, where the material is inhomogeneous (different resistivity in different places), and the exact paths of current flow are not obvious.

In cases like this, the formulas
formula_70

must be replaced with
formula_71

where and are now vector fields. This equation, along with the continuity equation for and the Poisson&#x27;s equation for , form a set of partial differential equations. In special cases, an exact or approximate solution to these equations can be worked out by hand, but for very accurate answers in complex cases, computer methods like finite element analysis may be required.

==Resistivity-density product==
In some applications where the weight of an item is very important, the product of resistivity and density is more important than absolute low resistivity – it is often possible to make the conductor thicker to make up for a higher resistivity; and then a low-resistivity-density-product material (or equivalently a high conductivity-to-density ratio) is desirable. For example, for long-distance overhead power lines, aluminium is frequently used rather than copper (Cu) because it is lighter for the same conductance.

Silver, although it is the least resistive metal known, has a high density and performs similarly to copper by this measure, but is much more expensive. Calcium and the alkali metals have the best resistivity-density products, but are rarely used for conductors due to their high reactivity with water and oxygen (and lack of physical strength). Aluminium is far more stable. Toxicity excludes the choice of beryllium. (Pure beryllium is also brittle.) Thus, aluminium is usually the metal of choice when the weight or cost of a conductor is the driving consideration.

== History ==

=== John Walsh and the conductivity of a vacuum ===
In a 1774 letter to Dutch-born British scientist Jan Ingenhousz, Benjamin Franklin relates an experiment by another British scientist, John Walsh, that purportedly showed this astonishing fact: Although rarified air conducts electricity better than common air, a vacuum does not conduct electricity at all.

However, to this statement a note (based on modern knowledge) was added by the editors—at the American Philosophical Society and Yale University—of the webpage hosting the letter:

<text>The Taos art colony was an art colony founded in Taos, New Mexico, by artists attracted by the culture of the Taos Pueblo and northern New Mexico. The history of Hispanic craftsmanship in furniture, tin work, and other mediums also played a role in creating a multicultural tradition of art in the area.

The 1898 visit by Bert Geer Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein to Taos was an early step in the creation of the Taos art colony and the Taos Society of Artists. In addition to the society, Mabel Dodge Luhan was instrumental in promoting Taos to artists and writers within her circle.

In the early-20th century, modern artists infused the area with a new artistic energy, followed in the 1950s by abstract artists. Today Taos supports more than 80 galleries and three museums. There are a number of organizations that support and promote the work of artists on the Taos Pueblo and in the Taos area.

==History==

===Taos Pueblo===

Located in a tributary valley off the Rio Grande, Taos Pueblo is the most northern of the New Mexico pueblos. For nearly a millennium, the Taos Indians have lived there. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450 AD, with some later expansion. The Taos Pueblo is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 people in the Taos pueblo community. Some of them have modern homes near their fields and stay at their homes on the pueblo during cooler weather. There are about 150 people who live at the pueblo year-around. The Taos Pueblo was added as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 as one of the most significant historical cultural landmarks in the world; Other sites include the Taj Mahal, Great Pyramids and the Grand Canyon in the United States.

===Taos Pueblo artists===

Ancient artistic traditions have been manifested in native craft for generations; an important acknowledgement for understanding the inherent aesthetic allure of this area to the Anglo-American artists. Making paintings with oil and watercolor was a new form of art to the Taos Pueblo who traditionally painted objects such as hides or inside buildings, such as on the walls of a kiva, but one embraced by artists such as Albert Looking Elk, Albert Lujan, Juan Mirabal and Juanito Concha. They provided artwork that was realistic of the Native American lifestyle in contrast to the work of Anglo-Americans romantic depictions. Traditional design elements were formalized at the Santa Fe Indian School, defining authentic Native American art.

Juanita Suazo Dubray, a lifelong resident of Taos Pueblo, is a Native American potter. In 1980, at the age of 50, Dubray began making micaceous pottery, upholding the tradition of her mother and their ancestors. Dubray added an element of sculptural relief with icons of corn, turtles, lizards, and kiva steps in relief; Her original corn design her most recognized symbol. Lori &quot;Pop Wea&quot; Tanner (died 1966) was also a noted potter from Taos Pueblo.

Pop Chalee, also known as Merina Lujan and &quot;Blue Flower&quot; (1906–1993), was the daughter of a man from the Taos Pueblo; her mother was of Swiss descent. In the 1920s she attended the Santa Fe Indian School and in the 1930s Dorothy Dunn&#x27;s studio of the same school. Multi-talented, Chalee was a muralist and art instructor; she also worked in radio and the film industry.

===Hispanic artwork===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was very expensive to ship furniture to New Mexico. Hispanic carpenters built, with great artistry, cajas (storage chests), harineros (grain chests), trasteros (kitchen cupboards) and other furniture. The work was generally carved and painted brightly.

Tinwork was also made with materials brought from Mexico and sometimes along the Santa Fe Trail. A significant growth in tin work occurred, though, once the railroad opened. At first most of the tin work was in the form of religious, devotional items. By the turn of the 20th century, tinsmiths were creating sconces, lanterns and trinket boxes.

Commissioned by churches and individuals, artists created sacred images called Santos of Roman Catholicism. Patrociño Barela (1900–1964) made secular works that greatly influenced contemporary santeros. His work, shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with other artists of the Federal Art Project, was the first Mexican American artist to receive national recognition.

In addition to the Taos museums, the Martinez Hacienda, a fortress occupied by Padre Martinez&#x27;s family in the 19th century, provides examples of the integration of Spanish and Pueblo artistic movements in retablos (santos painted on flat pieces of wood), bultos (santos carved out of wood and sometimes painted), as well as tin work, jewelry, and basketry.

==Art colony==

===Taos Society of Artists===

Bert Geer Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein came to Taos, New Mexico as part of a tour of the western United States, but upon seeing Taos, decided to stay.

An article with drawings by Blumenschein about a ceremony at Taos Pueblo appeared in the April 30, 1898, issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

Within a few years other American and European-born artists joined them in Taos: Joseph Henry Sharp, W. Herbert Dunton, E. Irving Couse and Oscar E. Berninghaus. These six artists were the charter members of the Taos Society of Artists.

The Taos Society of Artists works heralded the beginning of the Taos art colony, a groundbreaking association of European trained painters that collected around the visually spectacular Taos Pueblo in the Southwestern United States. The founding members fostered the emergence of a major school of American painting. Unlike other &#x27;schools&#x27; or styles that emerged around the turn of the 19th century in the United States, the early Taos Colony artists were not united under a single manifesto or aesthetic &quot;modus&quot;, but equally lured by the stunning and, as yet, foreign environs.

===Mabel Dodge Luhan===
Many artists were drawn to Taos due to the presence of Mabel Dodge Luhan, a wealthy heiress from Buffalo, New York who had run a prominent art salon in Florence, Italy, and Manhattan, New York, before settling in Taos in 1917. After both divorced their spouses, Mabel Dodge married a Pueblo native, Antonio Lujan, and built a house. She spelled her married name &quot;Luhan&quot; as it was easier for her friends to pronounce.

While in the Southwest, Luhan carried on the tradition of the European salon in its newest of iterations. For decades, she invited artists, writers, and people from other disciplines to be inspired by Taos and each other. Among them were Ansel Adams, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Alfred Stieglitz, Nicolai Fechin, author D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Frieda von Richthofen. Artist Dorothy Brett came to Taos in 1924 with her friends D. H. Lawrence and Frieda von Richthofen and later permanently settled there.

Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe settled in New Mexico in the Mabel Dodge Luhan era, but mostly kept her distance, to Mabel&#x27;s annoyance.. She stayed in one of Mabel&#x27;s houses in Taos in the summer of 1929 with Rebecca Strand, Paul Strand&#x27;s wife, painting the country around Taos and getting to know the country. According to Calvin Tomkins, in a 1974 interview, &quot;She rather liked Mabel Dodge Luhan—was amused by her, even when Mabel was at her bullying worst. Mabel and Dorothy Brett, the painter, and Frieda Lawrence, who had settled near Taos after D. H. Lawrence died, in 1930, carried on a running three-cornered feud. They had all idolized Lawrence, and each considered herself in some way his true muse—a situation that reached lunatic heights during their protracted squabble over Lawrence’s ashes. To prevent Mabel from stealing and scattering the ashes (as she claimed Lawrence had wished), Frieda finally had them mixed with a ton of concrete and formed into a block.&quot; The block remains on the D. H. Lawrence Ranch above Taos.

===Andrew Dasburg===

Parisian born Andrew Dasburg (1887–1979) was one of the earliest friends of Luhan to come and stay in Taos. He first came to Taos in 1918, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1921, when he integrated the boxy traditional construction styles in New Mexico into his Cubist art. In Taos, Dasburg became a mentor to a group of artists known as &quot;Taos Moderns&quot;. A leader in the Cubism movement, his works are in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Denver Art Museum, among others.

===D. H. Lawrence===
Inspired by the area and artists, D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930) painted while in Taos, signing his work &quot;Lorenzo&quot;; Nine of his paintings are displayed at La Fonda Hotel on the Taos Plaza.

===Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe===
A friend of D. H. Lawrence, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe (1887–1986) began to spend summers with the Lawrences starting in 1930. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s inspiration led Lawrence to discover he had a talent for painting, too. She made iconic, colorful paintings of flowers and bones she collected during her walks through the desert. In 1940, she bought her first home in New Mexico. Her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, preferring to stay in New York, O&#x27;Keeffe spent much of the year with him. Upon his death in 1946, O&#x27;Keeffe moved permanently to her New Mexico home, in an area known as Ghost Ranch, and later built a home in Abiquiu, New Mexico.

===Nicolai Fechin===
Like Lawrence, Russian artist Nicolai Fechin (1881–1955) suffered from tuberculosis and found Taos helpful for managing his health. In 1927, Fechin moved to Taos with his wife and daughter. For a time they lived with Luhan, but soon purchased an adobe home that was renovated into a beautiful, unusual home with Russian wood carvings. The Taos Art Museum is located inside the Fechin House.

===Ansel Adams===
Ansel Easton Adams (1902–1984) was a photographer, best known for his black-and-white photographs of the American West. In 1930, Taos Pueblo, Adams&#x27;s second portfolio, was published. In New Mexico, he was introduced to notables from Alfred Stieglitz&#x27;s circle, including painter Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, artist John Marin, and photographer Paul Strand, all of whom created famous works during their stays in the Southwest.

===Other early 20th-century artists===
Cordelia Wilson, an artist from Georgetown, Colorado developed her skills as an artist motivated by latest trends in American realism led by Robert Henri. Her academic training emphasized development of an alla prima technique and painting out of doors, which inspired her to produce bold impasto works quickly. She started making road trips to New Mexico and became friends with painters in the Taos Society of Artists and the Santa Fe art colony. Her numerous expressive oil sketches and en plein air canvases of adobe dwellings and rugged landscapes caught the attention of art dealers.
Maynard Dixon (1875-1946), a California born artist who specialized in painting South Western landscapes, people and architecture, visited and resided several times in New Mexico and Taos, coming first in 1900 with the writer Charles Lummis and later in 1931 in Taos with his wife the photographer Dorothea Lange. He produced dozens of drawings and painting during these visits and stays, while declining to join the Taos Society of Artists to which he had been invited by Ernest Blumenschein.

Rebecca Salsbury James (1891–1968) was largely a self-taught artist, although, after coming to Taos she was influenced by friend, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. She is most known for her work with reverse oils on glass and also worked in oils, pastels and a Spanish folk art form, colcha embroidery.

Ouray Meyers, a Taos artist, is the son of Ralph Meyers who was an artist, writer, and trader who was good friends with members of the Taos Society of Artists, such as Joseph Henry Sharp and W. Herbert Dunton; He was also a friend of Leon Gaspard, Nicolai Fechin, Dorothy Brett, and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. As a boy, Ralph Meyers met the artists who often visited his parents’ home. Meyers developed his own unique style, influenced by the early Taos painters.

In 1923, Akseli Gallen-Kallela departed for the US to organize an exhibition at the Chicago Art Institute and retrieve his works, which had been lost there since the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. He successfully located most of them and showcased them in the exhibition. During his time in the country, he painted landscapes and portraits, and he also traveled around extensively. Homesick, he was joined by his wife and daughter in 1924. They spent some time in the artist colony in Taos, New Mexico, before continuing their travels and ultimately returning to Finland in the spring of 1926.

==Postwar modernism==
===Taos Moderns===
In the 1940s a group of artists, some of whom had studied contemporary European and American modernist art under the G.I. bill, came to Taos. Arriving from cities like New York and San Francisco that were centers for the forms of abstract painting that emerged after World War II, they transformed Taos into a hotbed of contemporary art. These artists became known as the &quot;Taos Moderns&quot; and included Thomas Benrimo, Emil Bisttram, Edward Corbett, Joseph Glasco, R.C. Ellis, Cliff Harmon, Janet Lippincott, Ward Lockwood, Louis Leon Ribak, Beatrice Mandelman, Agnes Martin, Robert Ray, Earl Stroh, and Clay Spohn. Other visiting artists include Richard Diebenkorn, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Clyfford Still, and Morris Graves. Andrew Dasburg already came to Taos and was a mentor to many of the new artists, and his own works also evolved towards a more abstract expressionist style.

Like earlier artists, they portrayed the colorful New Mexican landscape and cultural influences, such as the &quot;timelessness they perceived in Puebloan culture and the deep connection to the land they noted in the everyday life of both Native Americans and Hispanics influence experimentation and innovation in their own art.&quot; Rather than capturing realist images of people and the landscape, they sought to capture the true meaning of their subjects.

===Other postwar artists===

Other postwar artists such as R. C. Gorman and Bill Rane also made Taos their home.

R. C. Gorman (1931–2005) was an internationally renowned artist of the Navajo Nation, sometimes called the &quot;Picasso&quot; of the American Indian Arts. Even so, he was not accepted by the entire Taos art colony. Gorman opened &quot;The Navajo Gallery&quot; in 1968 on historic Ledoux Street, the first art gallery owned by a Native American in the United States. It contained a large body of his work and those of some local Taos artists. Gorman was a collector of art, such as works by European masters Picasso and Chagall, and local artists, such as Bill Rane, whose work Gorman identified as his favorite of the artist colony.

Bill Rane (1927 - 2005) was an artist and Taos gallery owner. His historic Taos gallery is maintained by his widow, Judith Rane. Bill Rane was born in Oregon, grew up in Idaho, and studied art and literature at San Francisco State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Rane lived and worked in the Bay Area of California until he moved to Taos, where he lived until his death in 2005.

==Organizations==

===Taos Art Association===
In the 1950s a group of Taos artists decided to form the Taos Art Association (TAA). They purchased the Manby estate and turned the mansion into art galleries and in the gardens an outdoor community theater. In 2000, the Taos Art Association (TAA) became the Taos Center for the Arts (TCA). It is the oldest non-profit arts organization in the state of New Mexico.

===Taos Artist Organization===
Taos Artist Organization is a group of 140+ artists living in Taos and working in a variety of creative media.

===Taos Gallery Association===
Taos has over 80 privately owned art galleries.

===Taos Pueblo artists===
Contemporary native artists of Taos Pueblo create handcrafted goods using methods passed down through generations of family artisans. Modern interpretation of traditional art is reflected in their sculpture, painting and jewelry. For centuries the Taos pueblo potters have been creating micaceous pottery; now, the pottery is made with a high polish. Also produced on the pueblo are tanned buckskin moccasins and drums.

==Museums==

===Harwood Museum of Art===

The Harwood Museum of Art in Taos has a permanent collection of over 1,700 works of art and 17,000 photographic images. The collection of works from the 19th century to the present reflect the multicultural heritages and influences of the Taos artistic community. The categories of works include: Hispanic, Taos Society of Artists, Taos Moderns, Contemporary, and Prints, Drawings and Photographs.

===Millicent Rogers Museum===

The Millicent Rogers Museum is a collection of items of southwestern Indian culture. Millicent Rogers was instrumental in the promotion of the Native American culture. The collections include weavings, kachinas, pottery, baskets, tin work, and contemporary art. In the early 1980s the museum held works of the Hispanic art movement, the first major cultural organization in New Mexico to do so. Millicent&#x27;s mother, Mary B. Rogers, was the benefactoress for much of the Pueblo Indian works.

Paintings by Pueblo artists Albert Looking Elk (Martinez), Albert Lujan, Juan Mirabal, Juanito Concha, and the works of other Pueblo artists are included in the Museum&#x27;s collection.

===Taos Art Museum===

The Taos Art Museum at Fechin House presides over a collection including paintings by full and associate members of the Taos Society of Artists, various Taos Moderns, Nicolai Fechin and assorted other Taos artists. It is housed in Fechin&#x27;s former home and studio. Exhibitions in Fechin&#x27;s studio feature contemporary artists working in Taos, while temporary exhibits in the historic home highlight artists from the region&#x27;s rich creative past.

<text>Ernest Leonard Blumenschein (May 26, 1874 – June 6, 1960) was an American artist and founding member of the Taos Society of Artists. He is noted for paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico and the American Southwest.

==Early life and education==
Ernest Blumenschein was born on May 26, 1874, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, near fellow German immigrant families. In 1877, his father accepted a position as director of the Dayton Philharmonic in Ohio, where Blumenschein grew up. When he finished high school, Blumenschein received a scholarship to study violin at the College of Music of Cincinnati.

While in Cincinnati, he also attended an illustration course from Fernand Lungren at the Cincinnati Art Academy, causing him to change his studies from music to art. He moved to New York City in 1892, studying at the Art Students League of New York. Attracted by the idea of studying art in Europe, he enrolled at the Académie Julian in Paris in 1894. There he met and became friends with Bert Phillips and the older and more experienced artist Joseph Henry Sharp, who told the two younger artists about his 1893 visit to Taos, New Mexico.

==Career==

Blumenschein returned to New York in 1896, to work as an illustrator in a studio shared with Bert Phillips. In early 1898, he took an assignment that required him to travel to Arizona and New Mexico. That Spring, he convinced Phillips to join him on a second journey to the American West. Their first stop was Denver, Colorado, where they bought art and camping supplies, a wagon, horses and a revolver. Thus equipped, they set out with the intention of reaching Mexico.

In northern New Mexico, the rough road caused a wagon wheel to break. Blumenschein brought the wheel to be repaired in nearby Taos, leaving Phillips alone with the wagon. When Blumenschein returned three days later with the repaired wheel, they continued to Taos, where they sold their horse and equipage, set up a studio and began to paint.

Blumenschein stayed in Taos for three months, returning to New York to resume his career as an illustrator of popular magazines and books (including two short stories by Jack London), while Phillips remained in Taos. Blumenschein returned twice to Paris to pursue further studies at Académie Julian: once in 1899 and again from 1902 to 1909. During the latter stay, he met and married artist Mary Shepard Greene.

The couple returned to New York in 1909, where they worked as an illustration team. Blumenschein also took a teaching position at his alma mater, the Art Students League of New York.

From 1910, he spent his summers in Taos. In 1915, he became a co-founder of the Taos Society of Artists, together with his friends Bert Phillips, Joseph Henry Sharp, and three other artists. He finally settled permanently in Taos in 1919. From 1920 to 1921 he served as president of the Society. In 1923, he refused to accept the position of secretary of the Society, giving his commitment to an office of &quot;The New Mexico Painters&quot;, another group he had helped form, as his reason for the refusal. The other members of the Society refused to accept his excuse, and after a heated argument, Blumenschein resigned from the Society.

The style of painting of the Taos painters was to decisively influence the perceptions that the wider world came to have of the American Southwest, specifically of the Pueblo and Navajo Indian peoples.

During World War I, Blumenschein led a national effort to produce range-finder paintings used to help train military gunners.

==Honors and awards==
In 1910, Blumenschein was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1927. In 1947 he was awarded an Honorary Master of Arts from University of New Mexico and the following year he was named Honorary Fellow in Fine Arts by the School of American Research.

==Collections==

Paintings by Blumenschein are held in the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, the Taos Art Museum and Fechin House, the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, and the El Paso Art Museum in El Paso, Texas.

<text>The King Baudouin Stadium ( ; ) is a sports ground in Brussels, Belgium. Located in the north-western district of the City of Brussels, it was built to embellish the Heysel/Heizel Plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition. It was inaugurated on 23 August 1930, with Crown Prince Leopold attending the opening ceremony. The stadium hosted 70,000 at the time. Its name honours King Baudouin, Leopold&#x27;s successor as King of the Belgians from 1951 to his death in 1993.

The stadium is located at 135/2, /, on the border of the Bruparck entertainment park (with the Atomium, Mini-Europe miniature park and Kinepolis cinema). It can be accessed from the metro stations Heysel/Heizel and Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn on line 6.

==History==

===Early history===
The first version of the King Baudouin Stadium was built in 1929–30 by the architect Joseph Van Neck, also chief architect of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition, in a classical modernist style. Its original name was the Jubilee Stadium (, ) because it was inaugurated as part of the centenary celebrations of the Belgian Revolution, with an unofficial Belgium–Netherlands football match.

In 1946, the stadium was stripped of the wood of its cycling track, and was renamed the Heysel Stadium (, ), after the neighbourhood in which it is located. In 1971, a tartan track was installed allowing the organisation of athletics competitions. Three years later, in 1974, a new lighting system was installed.

The Heysel Stadium hosted European Cup finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985 and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 69,000 in 1958.

===May 1985 disaster===

Despite its status as Belgium&#x27;s national stadium, the Heysel Stadium was not well maintained. The stadium&#x27;s poor condition manifested itself at the 1985 European Cup Final. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. Additionally, the only escape route led upward, and there were only three gates on each short side–nowhere near enough for the 22,000 people standing on the terraces on either side.

The stadium&#x27;s inadequacies had been well known for some time. When Arsenal played there in the early 1980s, its supporters ridiculed it as a &quot;dump.&quot; Indeed, the presidents of the two 1985 European finalists, Juventus and Liverpool, had concluded that Heysel was in no condition to host a European Final, especially one featuring two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe at the time. They urged UEFA to move the match to another ground, to no avail. It later emerged that UEFA had only spent half an hour inspecting the stadium.

The Heysel Stadium disaster resulted in the deaths of 39 Juventus spectators after they were attacked by Liverpool fans before the match. Since the disaster, Liverpool FC have maintained that their fans were not to blame. However, all detailed reports state that the Liverpool fans started the charge, incited the violence and were ultimately to blame for the deaths of 39 Juventus fans and local Belgian supporters. They are still yet to accept full responsibility. Despite the disaster, the stadium continued to be used for Belgium international games from 1986 to 1990 with only minimal improvements made following the disaster. This was in part because the government had already drawn up plans to remodel the stadium into a 35,000-seat facility. Finally, in 1990, UEFA forced the issue by barring Belgium from hosting a European Final until at least 2000. It also continued to host track and field events and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year.

===Modernisations===
In 1995, a decade after the disaster, the ground was rebuilt at a cost of BEF 1,500 million (around €37/$50 million in 1995), and at this time renamed the King Baudouin Stadium, after the Belgian monarch who had died two years previously. All that remains of the old stadium is a renovated gateway near the main entrance. The new structure combined the football ground with a running track and facilities for field events. It was re-opened on 23 August 1995 as the home of the Belgium national football team and is the largest stadium in Belgium; it can seat 50,093 spectators. The remodelled stadium hosted the 1996 European Cup Winners Cup final, as well as the opening game for Euro 2000.

On 26 May 2006, the Belgian Football Association decided not to use the King Baudouin Stadium anymore for the national team home matches and for the Cup final, because the gates of stand one were too narrow and the stadium was deemed unsafe. The next match of the national team was thus held at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. The City of Brussels complained that contrary to these claims the stadium was safe, and this complaint was upheld in court. On 6 October 2006, the Belgian Football Association met with representatives of the City of Brussels and they agreed to renew the contract and extend it to 30 June 2008.

In March 2019, the Belgian football association announced plans for a new redevelopment of the King Baudouin Stadium. The stadium would be rebuilt to a reduced capacity of 40,000 spectators and renamed to the Golden Generation Arena with a prospective completion date of 2022. That idea was quietly discarded. An architectural firm has never been appointed, an environmental study ordered or a client sought. From the politicians, who were said to be positive about the idea across party lines in the beginning, hardly anything is moving.

==Sporting events==

===Association football===
Major international football matches have taken place in the King Baudouin Stadium: the finals of the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup in 1958, 1966, 1974 and 1985, those of the Cup of Cups in 1964, 1976, 1980 and 1996, as well as that of the European Championships in 1972 between West Germany and the USSR (3–0).

The stadium hosted five matches of the UEFA Euro 2000, organised by Belgium and the Netherlands, including the inaugural match between Belgium and Sweden (2–1) on 10 June, and the semi-final between Portugal and France (1–2) on 28 June.

UEFA Euro 2000 matches:
On 18 February 2021, the Belgian women&#x27;s team played its first official match there. This was a friendly match against the Netherlands (1–6) played as part of the promotion of the triple bid to host the Women&#x27;s Football World Cup, the third country being Germany. This choice was explained by the work carried out at the Eneco Stadium (where the Red Flames usually play) during this period.

=== Cycling ===
The UCI Track Cycling World Championships were organized in the Heysel stadium in 1930 and 1935.

The stadium has also been used for road cycling. For instance, stage 2 of both the 1949 and the 1960 Tour de France finished in the Heysel stadion.

===Rugby union===
On 25 August 2007, Belgium played Argentina in rugby union as part of Argentina&#x27;s 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations. Argentina defeated Belgium 36–8.

The stadium was scheduled to witness a rugby union milestone on 19 December 2009, when the Parisian club Stade Français planned to take their Heineken Cup home match against Irish club Ulster to the stadium in a match that had sold more than 30,000 tickets. However, heavy snowfall in Brussels on the intended matchday forced the cancellation of what would have been the first Heineken Cup match held in Belgium; the fixture was instead played the following day in Paris.

The stadium had another shot at hosting a Heineken Cup match in 2012. On 20 October 2012, English club Saracens took their Heineken Cup pool match against Racing Métro to Brussels.

===Tennis===
On 8 July 2010, the stadium played host to the Best of Belgium gala which featured a tennis match originally scheduled to be between Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. Unfortunately Henin had to pull out and Serena Williams replaced her as the match was played in front of the largest crowd ever for a single match, beating the attendance set at the Battle of the Sexes.

==Concerts==
Every year, it hosts major sporting events such as the national football team&#x27;s matches, the Belgian Football Cup final, the prestigious Van Damme Memorial and more. It has also showcased concerts by some of the world&#x27;s greatest artists, including the Rolling Stones, U2, Madonna, Beyoncé, Céline Dion, Johnny Hallyday, Robbie Williams, Genesis, Bruce Springsteen, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Rammstein and many more.

==Heysel Stadium Silver Coin==
To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the stadium, the Belgian State released a commemorative coin: the 10 euro 75 years of Heysel Stadium commemorative coin. The obverse depicts an image of a footballer with the stadium in the background. The flags of Belgium and the Netherlands can be seen on top of the stadium as well as the year that the stadium was built.

<text>In computer security, an access-control list (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a system resource (object or facility). An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to resources, as well as what operations are allowed on given resources. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, 
* If a file object has an ACL that contains , this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and give Bob permission only to read it.
* If the RACF profile CONSOLE CLASS(TSOAUTH) has an ACL that contains , this would give ALICE permission to use the TSO CONSOLE command.

== Implementations ==
Many kinds of operating systems implement ACLs or have a historical implementation; the first implementation of ACLs was in the filesystem of Multics in 1965.

=== Filesystem ACLs ===
A filesystem ACL is a data structure (usually a table) containing entries that specify individual user or group rights to specific system objects such as programs, processes, or files. These entries are known as access-control entries (ACEs) in the Microsoft Windows NT, OpenVMS, and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Solaris. Each accessible object contains an identifier to its ACL. The privileges or permissions determine specific access rights, such as whether a user can read from, write to, or execute an object. In some implementations, an ACE can control whether or not a user, or group of users, may alter the ACL on an object.

One of the first operating systems to provide filesystem ACLs was Multics. PRIMOS featured ACLs at least as early as 1984.

In the 1990s the ACL and RBAC models were extensively tested and used to administer file permissions.

==== POSIX ACL ====
POSIX 1003.1e/1003.2c working group made an effort to standardize ACLs, resulting in what is now known as &quot;POSIX.1e ACL&quot; or simply &quot;POSIX ACL&quot;. The POSIX.1e/POSIX.2c drafts were withdrawn in 1997 due to participants losing interest for funding the project and turning to more powerful alternatives such as NFSv4 ACL. , no live sources of the draft could be found on the Internet, but it can still be found in the Internet Archive.

Most of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux since 2.5.46 or November 2002, FreeBSD, or Solaris) support POSIX.1e ACLs (not necessarily draft 17). ACLs are usually stored in the extended attributes of a file on these systems.

==== NFSv4 ACL ====
NFSv4 ACLs are much more powerful than POSIX draft ACLs. Unlike draft POSIX ACLs, NFSv4 ACLs are defined by an actually published standard, as part of the Network File System.

NFSv4 ACLs are supported by many Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Examples include AIX, FreeBSD, Mac OS X beginning with version 10.4 (&quot;Tiger&quot;), or Solaris with ZFS filesystem, support NFSv4 ACLs, which are part of the NFSv4 standard. There are two experimental implementations of NFSv4 ACLs for Linux: NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext3 filesystem and the more recent Richacls, which brings NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext4 filesystem. As with POSIX ACLs, NFSv4 ACLs are usually stored as extended attributes on Unix-like systems.

NFSv4 ACLs are organized nearly identically to the Windows NT ACLs used in NTFS. NFSv4.1 ACLs are a superset of both NT ACLs and POSIX draft ACLs. Samba supports saving the NT ACLs of SMB-shared files in many ways, one of which is as NFSv4-encoded ACLs.

=== Active Directory ACLs ===

Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory service implements an LDAP server that stores and disseminates configuration information about users and computers in a domain. Active Directory extends the LDAP specification by adding the same type of access-control list mechanism as Windows NT uses for the NTFS filesystem. Windows 2000 then extended the syntax for access-control entries such that they could not only grant or deny access to entire LDAP objects, but also to individual attributes within these objects.

=== Networking ACLs ===
On some types of proprietary computer hardware (in particular, routers and switches), an access-control list provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer 3, each with a list of hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure access-control lists based on network domain names, this is a questionable idea because individual TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently, the device enforcing the access-control list must separately resolve names to numeric addresses. This presents an additional attack surface for an attacker who is seeking to compromise security of the system which the access-control list is protecting. Both individual servers and routers can have network ACLs. Access-control lists can generally be configured to control both inbound and outbound traffic, and in this context they are similar to firewalls. Like firewalls, ACLs could be subject to security regulations and standards such as PCI DSS.

=== SQL implementations ===
ACL algorithms have been ported to SQL and to relational database systems. Many &quot;modern&quot; (2000s and 2010s) SQL-based systems, like enterprise resource planning and content management systems, have used ACL models in their administration modules.

== Comparing with RBAC ==
The main alternative to the ACL model is the role-based access-control (RBAC) model. A &quot;minimal RBAC model&quot;, &quot;RBACm&quot;, can be compared with an ACL mechanism, &quot;ACLg&quot;, where only groups are permitted as entries in the ACL. Barkley (1997) showed that &quot;RBACm&quot; and &quot;ACLg&quot; are equivalent.

In modern SQL implementations, ACLs also manage groups and inheritance in a hierarchy of groups. So &quot;modern ACLs&quot; can express all that RBAC express and are notably powerful (compared to &quot;old ACLs&quot;) in their ability to express access-control policy in terms of the way in which administrators view organizations.

For data interchange, and for &quot;high-level comparisons&quot;, ACL data can be translated to XACML.

<doc id="61592" wikidata="Q5373572" url="?curid=61592" title="Emmett Tyrrell">
<text>Robert Emmett Tyrrell Jr. (born December 14, 1943) is an American conservative magazine editor, book author and columnist. He is the founder and editor-in-chief of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; and writes with the byline &quot;R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.&quot;

==Background==
Tyrrell was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised Roman Catholic. In 1961, he graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois.

He attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he was on the swim team under coach James &quot;Doc&quot; Counsilman. While at Indiana University, he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi, living in a chapter house where Steve Tesich resided. He also has a master&#x27;s degree in American Diplomatic History.

==Career==
===Arkansas Project===
Tyrrell was one of those behind the Arkansas Project, financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, to use the &quot;Spectator&#x27; to damage Bill Clinton’s reputation. He detailed the project&#x27;s purposes and accomplishments in his 2007 book &quot;The Clinton Crack-Up: The Boy President&#x27;s Life after the White House&quot;.

===Forced sale===
In 2000, government investigations of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; caused Tyrrell to sell the magazine to venture capitalist George Gilder. In 2003, Gilder, having a series of financial and legal setbacks, resold the magazine back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the organization under which the magazine was originally started, for a dollar. The magazine was initially called &quot;The Alternative&quot;. The name of the owner was changed to the American Spectator Foundation. The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, DC, area. Later that year, former book publisher Alfred S. Regnery became the magazine&#x27;s publisher. By 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000.

===1984 media appearance===
A noted political commentator, Tyrrell appeared on a 1984 episode of &quot;Firing Line&quot; with William F. Buckley Jr., in which he debated with Christopher Hitchens the premise that the liberal movement was a failure, as asserted in Tyrrell&#x27;s book &quot;The Liberal Crack-up&quot;.

===Criticisms of homosexuality===
Tyrrell was quoted in a 1994 article by &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Dinitia Smith saying that homosexuals are bringing about &quot;an end to community,&quot; and &quot;AIDS is lethal, but they&#x27;re forever trying to magnify a sensible point out of proportion. Heterosexual cases are practically nonexistent. The latest studies show that only 2 to 3 percent of Americans are homosexuals. Kinsey was wrong in saying it was 10 percent. There are thousands of years of moral teaching suggesting homosexuality is wrong.&quot;

===Personal life===
In 1972, Tyrrell married first wife Judy Mathews, with whom he had three children; they divorced in 1988. In 1998, Tyrrell married Jeanne M. Hauch at Holy Rosary Church, Washington, D.C.

Tyrrell is a practicing Catholic. He obtained a canonical annulment of his first marriage before his present union.

He served on the Board of Selectors of the Jefferson Awards Foundation.

Tyrrell is the great-great-grandson of Patrick D. Tyrrell, an immigrant from Ireland and a detective in the United States Secret Service in the 1870s, involved in foiling the plot to steal the body of Abraham Lincoln in 1876.

==Awards==
*1975: Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under from the Jefferson Awards for Public Service 
*1978: Ten Outstanding Young Men in America award in History. He now serves on the Board of Selectors for Jefferson Awards.

==Works==
Tyrrell has written for &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;London Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. He was also a media fellow at the Hoover Institution.

<doc id="61593" wikidata="Q777087" url="?curid=61593" title="Echinococcosis">
<text>Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the &quot;Echinococcus&quot; type. The two main types of the disease are &quot;cystic echinococcosis&quot; and &quot;alveolar echinococcosis&quot;. Less common forms include &quot;polycystic echinococcosis&quot; and &quot;unicystic echinococcosis&quot;.

The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst&#x27;s location and size. &quot;Alveolar&quot; disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected, the patient may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, along with yellow-toned skin discoloration from developed jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and coughing.
The infection is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is ingested or by close contact with an infected animal. The eggs are released in the stool of meat-eating animals that are infected by the parasite. Commonly infected animals include dogs, foxes, and wolves. For these animals to become infected they must eat the organs of an animal that contains the cysts such as sheep or rodents. The type of disease that occurs in human patients depends on the type of &quot;Echinococcus&quot; causing the infection. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasound though computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. Blood tests looking for antibodies against the parasite may be helpful as may biopsy.
Prevention of cystic disease is by treating dogs that may carry the disease and vaccination of sheep. Treatment is often difficult. The cystic disease may be drained through the skin, followed by medication. Sometimes this type of disease is just watched. The &quot;alveolar&quot; form often requires surgical intervention, followed by medications. The medication used is albendazole, which may be needed for years. The &quot;alveolar&quot; disease may result in death.
The disease occurs in most areas of the world and currently affects about one million people. In some areas of South America, Africa, and Asia, up to 10% of certain populations are affected. In 2015, the cystic form caused about 1,200 deaths; down from 2,000 in 1990. The economic cost of the disease is estimated to be around US$3 billion a year. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and belongs to the group of diseases known as helminthiases (worm infections). It can affect other animals such as pigs, cows and horses.
Terminology used in this field is crucial since echinococcosis requires the involvement of specialists from nearly all disciplines. In 2020, an international effort of scientists, from 16 countries, led to a detailed consensus on terms to be used or rejected for the genetics, epidemiology, biology, immunology, and clinical aspects of echinococcosis.

==Signs and symptoms==


In the human manifestation of the disease, &quot;E. granulosus&quot;, &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;, &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; and &quot;E. vogeli&quot; is localized in the liver (in 75% of cases), the lungs (in 5–15% of cases), and other organs in the body such as the spleen, brain, heart, and kidneys (in 10–20% of cases). In people who are infected with &quot;E. granulosus&quot; and therefore have cystic echinococcosis, the disease develops as a slow-growing mass in the body. These slow-growing masses, often called cysts, are also found in people who are infected with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis.

The cysts found in those with cystic echinococcosis are usually filled with a clear fluid called hydatid fluid, are spherical, typically consist of one compartment, and are usually only found in one area of the body. While the cysts found in those with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are similar to those found in those with cystic echinococcosis, the alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis cysts usually have multiple compartments and have infiltrative as opposed to expansive growth.

Depending on the location of the cyst in the body, the person could be asymptomatic even though the cysts have grown to be very large or be symptomatic even if the cysts are tiny. If the person is symptomatic, the symptoms will depend largely on where the cysts are located. For instance, if the person has cysts in the lungs and is symptomatic, they will have a cough, shortness of breath, and/or pain in the chest.

On the other hand, if the person has cysts in the liver and is symptomatic, they will experience abdominal pain, abnormal abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly with an abdominal mass, jaundice, fever, and/or anaphylactic reaction. In addition, if the cysts were to rupture while in the body, whether during surgical extraction of the cysts or by trauma to the body, the person would most likely go into anaphylactic shock and have high fever, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling) of the lips and eyelids, dyspnea, stridor, and rhinorrhea.

Unlike intermediate hosts, definitive hosts are usually not hurt very much by the infection. Sometimes, a lack of certain vitamins and minerals can be caused in the host by the very high demand of the parasite.

The incubation period for all species of &quot;Echinococcus&quot; can be months to years or even decades. It largely depends on the location of the cyst in the body and how fast the cyst is growing.

==Cause==
Like many other parasite infections, the course of &quot;Echinococcus&quot; infection is complex. The worm has a life cycle that requires definitive hosts and intermediate hosts. Definitive hosts are normally carnivores such as dogs, while intermediate hosts are usually herbivores such as sheep and cattle. Humans function as accidental
hosts, because they are usually a dead end for the parasitic infection cycle, unless eaten by dogs or wolves after death.

===Hosts===

===Life cycle===
An adult worm resides in the small intestine of a definitive host. A single gravid proglottid releases eggs that are passed in the feces of the definitive host. The egg is then ingested by an intermediate host. The egg then hatches in the small intestine of the intermediate host and releases an oncosphere that penetrates the intestinal wall and moves through the circulatory system into different organs, in particular the liver and lungs. Once it has invaded these organs, the oncosphere develops into a cyst. The cyst then slowly enlarges, creating protoscolices (juvenile scolices), and daughter cysts within the cyst. The definitive host then becomes infected after ingesting the cyst-containing organs of the infected intermediate host. After ingestion, the protoscolices attach to the intestine. They then develop into adult worms and the cycle starts all over again.

===Eggs===
&quot;Echinococcus&quot; eggs contain an embryo that is called an oncosphere or hexcanth. The name of this embryo stems from the fact that these embryos have six hooklets. The eggs are passed through the feces of the definitive host and it is the ingestion of these eggs that leads to infection in the intermediate host.

===Larval/hydatid cyst stage===
From the embryo released from an egg develops a &quot;hydatid cyst&quot;, which grows to about 5–10 cm within the first year and can survive within organs for years. Cysts sometimes grow to be so large that by the end of several years or even decades, they can contain several liters of fluid. Once a cyst has reached a diameter of 1 cm, its wall differentiates into a thick outer, non-cellular membrane, which covers the thin germinal epithelium. From this epithelium, cells begin to grow within the cyst. These cells then become vacuolated and are known as brood capsules, which are the parts of the parasite from which protoscolices bud. Often, daughter cysts also form within cysts.

===Adult worm===
&quot;Echinococcus&quot; adult worms develop from protoscolices and are typically 6 mm or less in length and have a scolex, neck, and typically three proglottids, one of which is immature, another of which is mature and the third of which is gravid (or containing eggs). The scolex of the adult worm contains four suckers and a rostellum that has about 25–50 hooks.

===Morphological differences===
The major morphological difference among different species of &quot;Echinococcus&quot; is the length of the tapeworm. &quot;E. granulosus&quot; is approximately 2 to 7 mm while &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; is often smaller and is 4 mm or less. On the other hand, &quot;E. vogeli&quot; is found to be up to 5.6 mm long and &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; is found to be up to 2.9 mm long. In addition to the difference in length, there are also differences in the hydatid cysts of the different species. For instance, in &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;, the cysts have an ultra thin limiting membrane and the germinal epithelium may bud externally. Furthermore, &quot;E. granulosus&quot; cysts are unilocular and full of fluid while &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; cysts contain little fluid and are multilocular. For &quot;E. vogeli&quot;, its hydatid cysts are large and are polycystic since the germinal membrane of the hydatid cyst proliferates both inward, to create septa that divide the hydatid into sections, and outward, to create new cysts. Like &quot;E. granulosus&quot; cysts, &quot;E. vogeli&quot; cysts are filled with fluid.

===Transmission===
As one can see from the life cycles illustrated above, all disease-causing species of &quot;Echinococcus&quot; are transmitted to intermediate hosts via the ingestion of eggs and are transmitted to definitive hosts by eating infected, cyst-containing organs. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts that become infected by handling soil, dirt, or animal hair that contains eggs.

While there are no biological or mechanical vectors for the adult or larval form of any &quot;Echinococcus&quot; species, coprophagic flies, carrion birds and arthropods can act as mechanical vectors for the eggs.

===Aberrant cases===
There are a few aberrant cases in which carnivores play the role of the intermediate hosts. Examples are domestic cats with hydatid cysts of &quot;E. granulosus.&quot;

==Diagnosis==

===Classification===
The most common form found in humans is cystic echinococcosis (also known as unilocular echinococcosis), which is caused by &quot;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato&quot;. The second most common form is alveolar echinococcosis (also known as alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolar hydatid disease, alveolococcosis, multilocular echinococcosis, &quot;small fox tapeworm&quot;), which is caused by &quot;Echinococcus multilocularis&quot; and the third is polycystic echinococcosis (also known as human polycystic hydatid disease, neotropical echinococcosis), which is caused by &quot;Echinococcus vogeli&quot; and very rarely, &quot;Echinococcus oligarthrus&quot;. Alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are rarely diagnosed in humans and are not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis, but polycystic echinococcosis is relatively new on the medical scene and is often left out of conversations dealing with echinococcosis, and alveolar echinococcosis is a serious disease that has a significantly high fatality rate, and may have the potential to become an emerging disease in many countries.

A formal diagnosis of any type of echinococcosis requires a combination of tools that involve imaging techniques, histopathology, or nucleic acid detection and serology. For cystic echinococcosis diagnosis, imaging is the main method—while serology tests (such as indirect hemagglutination, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), immunoblots, or latex agglutination) that use antigens specific for &quot;E. granulosus&quot; verify the imaging results. The imaging technique of choice for cystic echinococcosis is ultrasonography, since it is not only able to visualize the cysts in the body&#x27;s organs, but it is also inexpensive, non-invasive and gives instant results. In addition to ultrasonography, both MRI and CT scans can and are often used although an MRI is often preferred to CT scans when diagnosing cystic echinococcosis since it gives better visualization of liquid areas within the tissue.

===Alveolar===
As with cystic echinococcosis, ultrasonography is the imaging technique of choice for alveolar echinococcosis and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans can detect the largest number of lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of alveolar echinococcosis. MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also important to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis than for cystic echinococcosis since they tend to be more reliable for alveolar echinococcosis since more antigens specific for &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; are available. In addition to imaging and serology, identification of &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; infection via PCR or a histological examination of a tissue biopsy from the person is another way to diagnose alveolar echinococcosis.

===Polycystic===
Similar to the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis and cystic echinococcosis, the diagnosis of polycystic echinococcosis uses imaging techniques, in particular ultrasonography and CT scans, to detect polycystic structures within the person&#x27;s body. However, imaging is not the preferred method of diagnosis since the method that is currently considered the standard is the isolation of protoscoleces during surgery or after the person&#x27;s death, and the identification of definitive features of &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; and &quot;E. vogeli&quot; in these isolated protoscoleces. This is the main way that PE is diagnosed, but some current studies show that PCR may identify &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; and &quot;E. vogeli&quot; in people&#x27;s tissues. The only drawback of using PCR to diagnose polycystic echinococcosis is that there aren&#x27;t many genetic sequences that can be used for PCR that are specific only &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; or &quot;E. vogeli&quot;.

==Prevention==
===Cystic echinococcosis===
Several different strategies are currently being used to prevent and control cystic echinococcosis (CE). Most of these various methods try to prevent and control CE by targeting the major risk factors for the disease and the way it is transmitted. For instance, health education programs focused on cystic echinococcosis and its agents, and improved water sanitation attempt to target poor education and poor drinking water sources, which are both risk factors for contracting echinococcosis. Furthermore, since humans often come into contact with &quot;Echinococcus&quot; eggs via touching contaminated soil, animal feces and animal hair, another prevention strategy is improved hygiene. In addition to targeting risk factors and transmission, control and prevention strategies of cystic echinococcosis also aim at intervening at certain points of the parasite&#x27;s life cycle, in particular, the infection of hosts (especially dogs) that reside with or near humans. For example, many countries endemic to echinococcosis have researched programs geared at de-worming dogs and vaccinating dogs and other livestock, such as sheep, that also act as hosts for &quot;E. granulosus&quot;.

Proper disposal of carcasses and offal after home slaughter is difficult in poor and remote communities and therefore dogs readily have access to offal from livestock, thus completing the parasite cycle of &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot; and putting communities at risk of cystic echinococcosis. Boiling livers and lungs that contain hydatid cysts for 30 minutes has been proposed as a simple, efficient, and energy- and time-saving way to kill the infectious larvae.

===Alveolar echinococcosis===
Several strategies are geared towards the prevention and control of alveolar echinococcosis—most of which are similar to those for cystic echinococcosis. For instance, health education programs, improved water sanitation, improved hygiene, and de-worming of hosts (particularly red foxes) are all effective in preventing and controlling the spread of alveolar echinococcosis. Unlike cystic echinococcosis, however, where there is a vaccine against &quot;E. granulosus&quot;, there is currently no canidae or livestock vaccine against &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;.

===Polycystic echinococcosis===
While several control and prevention strategies deal with cystic and alveolar echinococcosis, there are few methods to control and prevent polycystic echinococcosis. This is probably because polycystic echinococcosis is restricted to Central and South America and the way that humans become accidental hosts of &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; and &quot;E. vogeli&quot; is still not completely understood.

===Human vaccines===
Currently, there are no human vaccines against any form of echinococcosis. However, studies are being conducted that are looking at possible vaccine candidates for an effective human vaccine against echinococcosis.

==Treatment==
===Cystic===
A number of therapy options are presently available. Treatment with albendazole, whether combined or not with praziquantel, is useful for smaller, uncomplicated cysts (&lt; 5 cm). Only 30% of cysts disappear with medical treatment alone. Albendazole is preferred twice a day for 1–5 months. An alternative to albendazole is mebendazole for at least 3 to 6 months.

Surgery is indicated for bigger liver cysts (&gt; 10 cm), cysts at risk of rupture and/or complicated cysts. A laparoscopic approach provides excellent cure rates with minimal morbidity and mortality. The radical technique (total cystopericystectomy) is preferable because of its lower risk for postoperative abdominal infection, biliary fistula, and overall morbidity. Conservative techniques are appropriate in endemic areas where surgery is performed by nonspecialist surgeons.

PAIR (puncture-aspiration-injection-reaspiration) is an innovative technique representing an alternative to surgery. PAIR is a minimally invasive procedure that involves three steps: puncture and needle aspiration of the cyst, injection of a scolicidal solution for 20–30 min, and cyst-re-aspiration and final irrigation. People who undergo PAIR typically take albendazole or mebendazole from 7 days before the procedure until 28 days after the procedure. It is indicated for inoperable cases and/or patients who reject surgery, for recurrence after surgery, and lack of response to medical treatment. There have been several studies that suggest that PAIR with medical therapy is more effective than surgery in terms of disease recurrence, and morbidity and mortality.

There is currently research and studies looking at new treatments involving percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA) of the germinal layer in the cyst using a radiofrequency ablation device. This form of treatment is still relatively new and requires much more testing before being widely used.

===Alveolar===
For alveolar echinococcosis, surgical removal of cysts combined with chemotherapy (using albendazole and/or mebendazole) for up to two years after surgery is the only sure way to completely cure the disease. However, in inoperable cases, chemotherapy by itself can also be used. In treatment using just chemotherapy, one could use either mebendazole in three doses or albendazole in two doses. Since chemotherapy on its own is not guaranteed to be completely rid of the disease, people are often kept on the drugs for extended periods (i.e. more than 6 months, years). In addition to surgery and chemotherapy, liver transplants are being looked into as a form of treatment for alveolar echinococcosis although it is seen as incredibly risky since it often leads to echinococcosis re-infection in the person afterwards.

===Polycystic===
Since polycystic echinococcosis is constrained to such a particular area of the world and is not well described or found in many people, treatment of polycystic echinococcosis is less defined than that of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis. While surgical removal of cysts was the treatment of choice for the previous two types of echinococcosis, chemotherapy is the recommended treatment approach for polycystic echinococcosis. While albendazole is the preferred drug, mebendazole can also be used if the treatment is to be for an extended period. Only if chemotherapy fails or if the lesions are very small is surgery advised.

==Epidemiology==
=== Regions ===
Very few countries are considered to be completely free of &quot;E. granulosus&quot;. Areas of the world where there is a high rate of infection often coincide with rural, grazing areas where dogs can ingest organs from infected animals.

&quot;E. multilocularis&quot; mainly occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, including central Europe and the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. However, its distribution was not always like this. For instance, until the end of the 1980s, &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; endemic areas in Europe were known to exist only in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. But during the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a shift in the distribution of &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; as the infection rate of foxes escalated in certain parts of France and Germany.

As a result, several new endemic areas were found in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and surrounding countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Italy. There is also evidence showing that the Baltic Countries are endemic areas.

While alveolar echinococcosis is not extremely common, it is believed that in the coming years, it will be an emerging or re-emerging disease in certain countries as a result of &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;’ ability to spread.

Unlike the previous two species of &quot;Echinococcus&quot;, &quot;E. vogeli&quot; and &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; are limited to Central and South America. Furthermore, infections by &quot;E. vogeli&quot; and &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; (polycystic echinococcosis) are considered to be the rarest form of echinococcosis.

=== Deaths ===
As of 2010, it caused about 1,200 deaths, down from 2,000 in 1990.

==History==
Echinococcosis is a disease that has been recognized by humans for centuries. There has been mention of it in the Talmud. It was also recognized by ancient scholars such as Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen and Rhazes. The recommended treatments were based on herbs like &quot;thymus vulgaris&quot; and raw garlic. Although echinococcosis has been well known for the past two thousand years, it was not until the past couple of hundred years that real progress was made in determining and describing its parasitic origin. The first step towards figuring out the cause of echinococcosis occurred during the 17th century when Francesco Redi illustrated that the hydatid cysts of echinococcosis were of &quot;animal&quot; origin. Then, in 1766, Pierre Simon Pallas predicted that these hydatid cysts found in infected humans were larval stages of tapeworms.

A few decades afterward, in 1782, Goeze accurately described the cysts and the tapeworm heads, while in 1786 &quot;E. granulosus&quot; was accurately described by Batsch. Half a century later, during the 1850s, Karl von Siebold showed through a series of experiments that &quot;Echinococcus&quot; cysts do cause adult tapeworms in dogs. Shortly after this, in 1863, &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; was identified by Rudolf Leuckart. Then, during the early to mid-1900s, the more distinct features of &quot;E. granulosus&quot; and &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;, their life cycles, and how they cause disease were more fully described as more and more people began researching and performing experiments and studies. While &quot;E. granulosus&quot; and &quot;E. multilocularis&quot; were both linked to human echinococcosis before or shortly after the 20th century, it was not until the mid-1900s that &quot;E. oligarthrus&quot; and &quot;E. vogeli&quot; were identified as and shown as being causes of human echinococcosis.

Two calcified objects recovered from a 3rd- to 4th-century grave of an adolescent in Amiens (Northern France) were interpreted as probable hydatid cysts. A study of remains from two 8,000-year-old cemeteries in Siberia showed the presence of echinococcosis.

<text>Denethor II, son of Ecthelion II, is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He was the 26th ruling Steward of Gondor, dying by suicide in the besieged city of Minas Tirith during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

Denethor is depicted as embittered and despairing as the forces of Mordor close in on Gondor. Critics have noted the contrast between Denethor and both Théoden, the good king of Rohan, and Aragorn, the true king of Gondor. Others have likened Denethor to Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear, both rulers falling into dangerous despair.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Peter Jackson chose to depict Denethor, played by John Noble, as greedy and self-indulgent, quite unlike Tolkien&#x27;s powerful leader.

==Fictional biography==
In Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, Denethor is the first son and third child of Ecthelion II, a Steward of Gondor. He marries Finduilas, daughter of Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth. She gives birth to two sons, Boromir and Faramir, but dies when they are ten and five years old, respectively. Denethor never remarries, and becomes grimmer and more silent than before. He is a man of great will, foresight, and strength, but also overconfident. Gandalf describes him as &quot;proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power [than Théoden of Rohan], though he is not called a king.&quot; Gandalf further comments:

Unlike Saruman, Denethor is too strong to be corrupted directly by Sauron. He begins secretly using a &quot;palantír&quot; to probe Sauron&#x27;s strength, incorrectly insisting he can control it. The effort ages him quickly, and the impression of Sauron&#x27;s overwhelming force that he gains from the &quot;palantír&quot; depresses him greatly, as Sauron biases what Denethor sees. Boromir&#x27;s death depresses Denethor further. Nonetheless he continues to fight Sauron until the forces of Mordor arrive at the gates of Minas Tirith, at which point he loses all hope. In the published essay on the &quot;palantíri&quot;, Tolkien wrote:

As invasion becomes certain, Denethor orders the warning beacons of Gondor to be lit, and summons forces from Gondor&#x27;s provinces and from Rohan, while the people of Minas Tirith are sent away to safety. Denethor orders his son Faramir to take his men to defend the river crossing at Osgiliath and the great wall of the &quot;Rammas Echor&quot;. Faramir is wounded, apparently mortally; his body is carried back to the city.

Denethor, grief-struck by the apparent loss of his son, orders his servants to burn him alive on a funeral pyre prepared for himself and Faramir in Rath Dínen. He breaks the white rod of his office over his knee, casting the pieces into the flames. He lies down on the pyre and so dies, clasping the &quot;palantír&quot; in his hands. Faramir is saved from the flames by Gandalf.

== Analysis ==

=== Character flaws ===

Denethor&#x27;s madness and despair has been compared to that of Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear. Both men are first outraged when their children (Faramir and Cordelia, respectively) refuse to aid them, but then grieve upon their children&#x27;s death – which is only perceived in the case of Faramir. According to Michael D. C. Drout, both Denethor and Lear &quot;despair of God&#x27;s mercy&quot;, something extremely dangerous in a leader who has to defend his realm. Sauron drives Denethor to suicide by showing him in the Palantír the Black Fleet approaching Gondor, while concealing the fact that the ships are carrying Aragorn&#x27;s troops, coming to Gondor&#x27;s rescue. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that this forms part of a pattern around the use of the Palantír, that one should not try to see the future but should trust in one&#x27;s luck and make one&#x27;s own mind up, courageously facing one&#x27;s duty in each situation. The medievalist Elizabeth Solopova comments that unlike Aragorn, Denethor is incapable of displaying what Tolkien in &quot;&quot; called &quot;northern courage&quot;, namely, the spirit to carry on in the face of certain defeat and death. Alex Davis, in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that many critics have examined his fall and corrupted leadership, whereas Richard Purtill identifies Denethor&#x27;s pride and egoism, a man who considers Gondor his property.

=== Denethor vs Théoden ===

The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance contrasts Denethor both with another &quot;Germanic king&quot;, Théoden, and with the &quot;true king&quot; of Gondor, Aragorn. In Chance&#x27;s view, Theoden represents good, Denethor evil; she notes that their names are almost anagrams, and that where Theoden welcomes the Hobbit Merry Brandybuck into his service with loving friendship, Denethor accepts Merry&#x27;s friend Pippin Took with a harsh contract of fealty. Chance writes that Tolkien further sets both Theoden and Denethor against the &quot;Christian lord&quot; Aragorn. In her opinion, Denethor &quot;fails as a father, a master, a steward, and a rational man,&quot; giving in to despair, whereas Aragorn is brave in battle and gentle with his people, and has the Christlike attribute of healing.

Shippey makes the same comparison, extending it to numerous elements of the two Men&#x27;s stories, writing that Théoden lives by a theory of Northern courage, and dies through Denethor&#x27;s despair.

==Adaptations==

===Early versions===

Denethor was voiced by William Conrad in Rankin/Bass&#x27;s 1980 animated adaptation of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and by Peter Vaughan in BBC Radio&#x27;s 1981 serialization.

===Peter Jackson&#x27;s films===

Denethor is played by John Noble in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The film portrays Denethor far more negatively than the novel. Tolkien calls Denethor

Shippey commented that where Tolkien&#x27;s Denethor is a cold ruler doing his best for his country, Jackson&#x27;s is made to look greedy and self-indulgent; Shippey calls the scene where he gobbles a meal, while his son Faramir has been sent out in a hopeless fight, a &quot;blatant [use] of cinematic suggestion&quot;.

&quot;Christianity Today&quot; wrote that the films &quot;missed the moral and religious depths&quot; of the book, such as when they turned &quot;the awful subtlety and complexity of evil&quot; into something trivially obvious. It gave as an instance the caricaturing of the powerful Steward of Gondor, Denethor as &quot;a snarling and drooling oaf rather than a noble pessimist&quot;.

Daniel Timmons writes in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that Jackson characterizes Denethor and others in a way &quot;far from Tolkien&#x27;s text&quot;, but that the film version successfully &quot;dramatizes the insidious temptation to evil&quot;, and that through &quot;the falls of Saruman, Denethor, and Sauron, we see the bitter fruits of the lust for power and its corrupting influence.&quot;

<doc id="61599" wikidata="Q219504" url="?curid=61599" title="Boromir">
<text>Boromir is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. He appears in the first two volumes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot;), and is mentioned in the last volume, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. He was the heir of Denethor II (the 26th Steward of Gondor) and the elder brother of Faramir. In the course of the story Boromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring.

Boromir is portrayed as a noble character who believed passionately in the greatness of his kingdom and fought indomitably for it. His great stamina and physical strength, together with a forceful and commanding personality, made him a widely admired commander in Gondor&#x27;s army and the favourite of his father Denethor. As a member of the Fellowship, his desperation to save his country ultimately drove him to betray his companions and attempt to seize the Ring, but he was redeemed by his repentance and brave last stand.

Commentators have remarked on Boromir&#x27;s vainglory and desire for the Ring. They have compared him both to other proud Tolkien characters such as Fëanor and Túrin Turambar, and to medieval heroes like Roland, who also blew a horn in battle and was killed in the wilderness. His boat-funeral, too, has been likened to Scyld Scefing&#x27;s ship-burial in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Boromir appears in animated and live-action films of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and in radio and television versions.

== Appearances ==

Boromir is the son of Denethor II and Lady Finduilas of Dol Amroth. He has a younger brother Faramir. A year after Faramir was born their father became the ruling Steward of Gondor, and Boromir became heir apparent, inheriting the Horn of Gondor. When Boromir&#x27;s mother Finduilas dies, he is only 10.
Denethor always favours Boromir over Faramir; he loves Boromir &quot;too much, perhaps; the more so because they were unlike&quot;.

In response to prophetic dreams that come to Faramir and later to himself, Boromir claims the quest of riding to Rivendell. His journey lasts a hundred and eleven days, and he travels through &quot;roads forgotten&quot; to reach Rivendell, though, as he says, &quot;few knew where it lay&quot;. Boromir loses his horse while crossing the Greyflood and travels the rest of the way on foot.

=== &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; ===

In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Boromir arrives at Rivendell just as the Council of Elrond is commencing. There he tells of Gondor&#x27;s attempts to keep the power of Mordor at bay. He tries to persuade the council to let him take the One Ring to defend Gondor, but is told that it would corrupt and destroy its user, and alert Sauron to its presence. He accepts this for the moment. He agrees to accompany Aragorn to Gondor&#x27;s capital, Minas Tirith, and since their path lies with the Fellowship for the first part of the journey, he pledges to protect the Ring-bearer, Frodo.

Boromir accompanies the Fellowship south from Rivendell. Before departing, he sounds the Horn of Gondor, saying he &quot;would not go forth like a thief into the night&quot;. On the journey south, he questions the wisdom of their leader Gandalf. On the Fellowship&#x27;s attempt to pass over the Misty Mountains, he advises that firewood be collected before the attempt to climb Caradhras, saving them from freezing in a blizzard. In the retreat from Caradhras, Boromir proves his strength as he and Aragorn force a way through shoulder-high snowbanks back down the mountain.

The Fellowship then pass under the mountains through the caverns of Moria where Gandalf is killed, and Aragorn becomes their guide. At the borders of the Elven realm of Lothlórien, Boromir is unnerved by the thought of entering, pleading with Aragorn to find another way &quot;though it led through a hedge of swords&quot;; he cites stories of elvish witchcraft, and the &quot;strange paths&quot; they had already taken which had caused Gandalf&#x27;s death. Once in Lórien, Boromir is greatly disturbed by Galadriel&#x27;s testing of his mind, telling Aragorn &quot;not to be too sure of this lady and her purposes&quot;. On parting, Galadriel gives Boromir a golden belt and an Elven-cloak.

Boromir had always planned to go to Minas Tirith, and despite the consensus reached at Rivendell that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, he urges the Fellowship to accompany him to Minas Tirith before going on to Mordor. As Frodo ponders his course from Parth Galen, Boromir privately urges him to use the Ring in Gondor&#x27;s defence, rather than to &quot;throw it away&quot;. Finally, he succumbs to the temptation to take the Ring for himself, justifying this by his duty to his people and his belief in his own integrity.

After seeing that Frodo is unconvinced, Boromir half begs, half commands him to at least lend the Ring, and when Frodo still refuses, Boromir leaps to seize it. Frodo vanishes by putting on the Ring and flees, intending to continue the quest alone. Boromir, realizing his betrayal, immediately repents of his actions and weeps. Searching unsuccessfully for Frodo, he tells the Fellowship of Frodo&#x27;s disappearance, though not of his own misdeeds. The hobbits in a frenzy scatter to look for Frodo. Aragorn, suspecting Boromir&#x27;s part in Frodo&#x27;s flight, orders him to follow and protect Merry and Pippin. The Fellowship is attacked by a band of orcs.

=== &quot;The Two Towers&quot; ===

Fighting to defend Merry and Pippin, Boromir is mortally wounded by orc-arrows. In Pippin&#x27;s words:

Blasts from Boromir&#x27;s horn alert Aragorn, but he comes too late to prevent the hobbits&#x27; capture. As Boromir lies dying, he remorsefully confesses to attempting to take the Ring from Frodo. He urges Aragorn to save Minas Tirith, as he himself has failed. Aragorn reassures him that he has not failed, that indeed &quot;few have gained such a victory&quot;. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas place Boromir&#x27;s body in one of their Elven boats, with his sword, belt, cloak, broken horn, and the weapons of his slain foes about him. They set the boat adrift in the river toward the Falls of Rauros, singing the &quot;Lament of the Winds&quot; as his funeral song.

Three days later, Faramir, to his and their father&#x27;s great grief, see the boat bearing his dead brother floating down the River.

== Names and titles ==

Boromir is the son and heir apparent of Denethor, the ruling Steward of Gondor. Appendix A calls him &quot;Captain of the White Tower&quot;, while Faramir called him &quot;High Warden of the White Tower&quot; and &quot;our Captain-General&quot;.

&quot;Boromir&quot; was described by Tolkien as a name &quot;of mixed form&quot;; it combines Sindarin &quot;bor(on)-&quot; &#x27;steadfast&#x27; and Quenya &quot;míre&quot; &#x27;jewel&#x27;. But the Stewards of Gondor also often bore names &quot;remembered in the songs and histories of the First Age&quot;, regardless of meaning, and the name &quot;Boromir&quot; did appear during the First Age in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. The eleventh steward of Gondor, Denethor I, had as well a son called Boromir who was described as a great warrior. This might have been an inspiration for Denethor II to name his first son.

== Interpretation ==

=== Morality ===
Boromir&#x27;s desire for the Ring has been described as well-intentioned but uninformed by the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a belief that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. Boromir&#x27;s hubris makes him prey to the malign power of the Ring, and he seals his own doom when he attacks Frodo to seize it. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, in a manner similar to Virgil&#x27;s character Turnus. He speaks of using the Ring in the service of Gondor, but his talk of &quot;strength in a just cause&quot; indicates, writes the Tolkien critic Tom Shippey, only how matters would begin. He comments that Boromir never quite says &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;, though the thought makes his corrupted behaviour entirely believable.

In Christian terms, Boromir atones for his assault on Frodo by single-handedly but vainly defending Merry and Pippin from orcs, which illustrates the Catholic theme of the importance of good intention, especially at the point of death. This is clear from Gandalf&#x27;s statement: &quot;But he [Boromir] escaped in the end... It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir&#x27;s sake.&quot;

Boromir has been likened to other Tolkien characters such as Fëanor or Túrin Turambar who display vainglorious excess, a trait in leaders that Tolkien despised. The character of Boromir has been compared to the legendary medieval hero Roland. Both blow a horn in the distress of battle and both are eventually killed in the wilderness while defending their companions, although Roland is portrayed as blameless and heroic throughout. Further, Roland&#x27;s death gives the appearance of signalling the end of the ruling dynasty.

=== Boat-funeral ===
The ship-burials of the seafaring Numenoreans in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; have been compared to those of the Viking age as described in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;; Boromir is similarly given a boat-funeral. As with Scyld Scefing&#x27;s funeral ship in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, no-one knows where the boat goes to in the end, but for Tolkien the suggestion that it goes to a mysterious land in the uttermost West was fascinating, and he developed it at length in &quot;The Lost Road&quot;.&#x27;

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
In both Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film and in the subsequent BBC Radio serial, Boromir is played by Michael Graham Cox. 

Boromir is played by Carl-Kristian Rundman in the 1993 Finnish miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot;.
In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Boromir is played by Sean Bean. His line &quot;One does not simply walk into Mordor&quot; became famous enough for Bean to comment that the &quot;one does not simply&quot; meme (with variant endings) would &quot;probably be my unintended legacy&quot;. In a departure from the structure of Tolkien&#x27;s book, Boromir&#x27;s death is shown at the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), instead of being related at the beginning of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.

In &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), Boromir appears in the theatrical version only briefly during the beginning flashback sequence of Gandalf&#x27;s fight with the Balrog in Moria. The Extended Edition adds two additional flashbacks: first when Faramir remembers finding Boromir&#x27;s body and his cloven horn in the elven boat washed up on shore; and in longer flashback (the only scene of the film trilogy where Boromir and Faramir are seen speaking to each other), after Boromir&#x27;s victory in Osgiliath and before his departure for Rivendell. The two brothers are seen celebrating and laughing before their father interrupts, asking him to go to Rivendell to seek the One Ring. Here Boromir apparently knows that &quot;Isildur&#x27;s Bane&quot; is the One Ring, and he is chosen by his father, despite his reluctance to go, in response to a summons from Elrond.

In &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003), Boromir appears in the theatrical version during a brief flashback as Pippin remembers his heroic self-sacrifice. In the Extended Edition of the film, Boromir appears briefly when Denethor looks at Faramir and imagines for a moment that he sees Boromir walking towards him, smiling.

<doc id="61600" wikidata="Q571005" url="?curid=61600" title="Scriptio continua">
<text>&#x27; (Latin for &#x27;continuous script&#x27;), also known as &#x27; or , is a style of writing without spaces or other marks between the words or sentences. The form also lacks punctuation, diacritics, or distinguished letter case. 
In the West, the oldest Greek and Latin inscriptions used word dividers to separate words in sentences; however, Classical Greek and late Classical Latin both employed as the norm. The &quot;scriptio continua&quot; is also known as Latin skeleton script.

==History==
Although is evidenced in most Classic Greek and Classic Latin manuscripts, different writing styles are depicted in documents that date back even further. Classical Latin often used the interpunct, especially in monuments and inscriptions.

The earliest texts in Classical Greek that used the Greek alphabet, as opposed to Linear B, were formatted in a constant string of capital letters from right to left. Later, that evolved to boustrophedon, which included lines written in alternating directions. 

The Latin language and the related Italic languages first came to be written using alphabetic scripts adapted from the Etruscan alphabet (itself ultimately derived from the Greek alphabet). Initially, Latin texts commonly marked word divisions by points, but later on the Romans came to follow the Greek practice of .

Before and after the advent of the codex, Latin and Greek script was written on scrolls by slave scribes. The role of the scribes was to simply record everything they heard to create documentation. Because speech is continuous, there was no need to add spaces. Typically, the reader of the text was a trained performer, who would have already memorised the content and breaks of the script. During the reading performances, the scroll acted as a cue sheet and therefore did not require in-depth reading.

The lack of word parsing forced the reader to distinguish elements of the script without a visual aid, but it also presented the reader with more freedom to interpret the text. The reader had the liberty to insert pauses and dictate tone, which made the act of reading a significantly more subjective activity than it is today. However, the lack of spacing also led to some ambiguity because a minor discrepancy in word parsing could give the text a different meaning. For example, a phrase written in as may be interpreted as , meaning &#x27;a people gathered from Troy&#x27;, or , &#x27;a people gathered for exile&#x27;. Thus, readers had to be much more cognisant of the context to which the text referred.

==Decline==
Over time, the current system of rapid silent reading for information replaced the older, slower, and more dramatic performance-based reading, and word dividers and punctuation became more beneficial to text. Though paleographers disagree about the chronological decline of throughout the world, it is generally accepted that the addition of spaces first appeared in Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels from the seventh and eighth centuries. Subsequently, an increasing number of European texts adopted conventional spacing, and within the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all European texts were written with word separation.

When word separation became the standard system, it was seen as a simplification of Roman culture because it undermined the metric and rhythmic fluency generated through . In contrast, paleographers today identify the extinction of as a critical factor in augmenting the widespread absorption of knowledge in the pre-Modern Era. By saving the reader the taxing process of interpreting pauses and breaks, the inclusion of spaces enables the brain to comprehend written text more rapidly. Furthermore, the brain has a greater capacity to profoundly synthesize text and commit a greater portion of information to memory.

 is still in use in Thai script, other Southeast Asian abugidas: (Burmese, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese script), and in languages that use Chinese characters (Chinese and Japanese). However, modern vernacular Chinese differentiates itself from ancient through its use of punctuation, although this method of separation was borrowed from the West only in the 19th and 20th centuries. Before this, the only forms of punctuation found in Chinese writings were marks to denote quotes, proper nouns, and emphasis. Modern Tibetic languages also employ a form of ; while they punctuate syllables, they do not use spacing between units of meaning.

==Examples==
===Latin text===
Latin text in with typical capital letters, taken from Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De finibus bonorum et malorum&quot;:

Which in modern punctuation is:
*&quot;Nobody likes pain for its own sake, or looks for it and wants to have it, just because it is pain...&quot;
With ancient Latin punctuation is: 

=== Greek text ===
Greek text in with typical capital letters, taken from Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;:

Which in modern punctuation is:
* &quot;From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing, who hold the great and holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos,&quot;

=== Hebrew text ===
Hebrew text is well known for lacking punctuation for many centuries. Modern versions of the language gradually amended those features.

=== Runic text ===
The entire Swedish Rök runestone is written in , which poses problems for scholars attempting to translate it. One example is a phrase repeated several times, . Interpretations proposed include &#x27;let us say the memory to Yggr&#x27;, &#x27;let us say the folk-memory&#x27;, and &#x27;let us say to the group of young men&#x27;.

=== Modern Latin script ===
A form of has become common in internet e-mail addresses and domain names where, because the &quot;space&quot; character is invalid, the address for a website for &quot;Example Fake Website&quot; is written as codice_1 – without spaces between the separate words. However, the &quot;underscore&quot; or &quot;dash&quot; characters are often used as stand-ins for the &quot;space&quot; character when its use would be invalid and their use would not be.

As another example, so-called camel case—in which the first letter of each word is capitalized—has become part of the culture of many computer programming languages. In this context, names of variables and subroutines as well as other identifiers are rendered easier to read, as in codice_2. Camel case can also eliminate ambiguity: codice_3 might name a table of characters, whereas codice_4 could ask or answer the question, &quot;Can (something) be charted?&quot;

===Chinese language===
Chinese does not encounter the problem of incorporating spaces into text because, unlike most writing systems, Chinese characters represent morphemes and not phonemes. Chinese is therefore readable without spaces.

Western punctuation was first used in China in the 20th century as a result of interaction with Western culture.

However, sentences can still be ambiguous due to a lack of punctuation and/or word breaks. One Chinese joke concerns a contract between a landlord and a poor scholar, which was written without punctuation and thus was interpreted in two different ways:

=== Japanese script ===
Japanese implements extensive use of Chinese characters—called kanji in Japanese. However, due to the radical differences between the Chinese and Japanese languages, writing Japanese exclusively in kanji would make it extremely difficult to read. This can be seen in texts that predate the modern kana system, in which Japanese was written entirely in kanji and , the latter of which are written solely to indicate a word&#x27;s pronunciation as opposed to its meaning. For that reason, different syllabary systems called kana were developed to differentiate phonetic graphemes from ideographic ones.

Modern Japanese is typically written using three different types of graphemes, the first being kanji and the latter two being kana systems, the cursive hiragana and the angular katakana. While spaces are not normally used in writing, boundaries between words are often quickly perceived by Japanese speakers since kana are usually visually distinct from kanji. Japanese speakers also know that certain words, morphemes, and parts of speech are typically written using one of the three systems. Kanji is typically used for words of Japanese and Chinese origin as well as content words (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Hiragana is typically used for native Japanese words, as well as commonly known words, phrases, and grammatical particles, as well as inflections of content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Katakana is typically used for loanwords from languages other than Chinese, onomatopoeia, and emphasized words.

Like Chinese, Japanese lacked any sort of punctuation until interaction with Western civilizations became more common. Punctuation was adopted during the Meiji period.

=== Thai script ===
Modern Thai script, which was said to have been created by King Ram Khamhaeng in 1283, does not contain any spaces between words. Spaces indicate only the clear endings of clauses or sentences.

Below is a sample sentence of Thai written first without spaces between words (with Thai romanization in parentheses), second in Thai with spaces between words (also with Thai romanization in parentheses), and then finally translated into English.

For example, &quot;ในน้ำมีปลา ในนามีข้าว&quot; (pronounced &quot;nai nam mi phla nai na mi khao&quot;, meaning &quot;In the water there are fish; in the paddy fields there is rice.&quot;) can also be written as &quot;ใน น้ำ มี ปลา ใน นา มี ข้าว&quot;.

=== Javanese script ===
This example shows the first line of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Javanese script, and a case of the text being divided, as in some modern writing, by spaces and dash signs, which look different. 
*: 
*: 
* All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Because of the absence of space, in computer typography, the line-break have to be inserted manually, otherwise a long sentence will not break into new lines. Some computer input methods have put zero-width space instead for word break, which would then break the long sentences into multiple lanes, but the drawback of that method is it will not render the writing correctly.
* (&quot;incorrect&quot; words include the first two words, which in joined form would looks like )

=== Arabic script ===

Before typewriters, computers and smartphones changed the way of writing, Arabic was written continuously. That is easy because 22 letters in Arabic have final, medial and initial forms, which is comparable to initial, or capital, form for the Latin alphabet since the Renaissance. Six or seven letters in Arabic have only a final form (namely , , , , and , as well as ) and whenever they occur in a word they are followed by space that was originally as wide as the space between words, creating a clear visual break. There was also no hyphenation either. In the early Quranic manuscripts, all diacritics in the Arabic script were also omitted because pointing or other diacritics did not exist in the Arabic script until the early 2nd millennium, and this form is called &quot;rasm&quot;. Rasm is also written continuously without spacing. In all early manuscripts, words were finished on the next line or, in many Quranic manuscripts, even on the next page. The letter hamza is the only one of the only letter of the Arabic alphabet that lacks a final, initial or medial form, only its alone or isolated form, as it is an unlinked letter.

=== Punjabi (Gurmukhi) script ===
Before the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Gurbani and other Sikh scriptures were written in the traditional method of writing the Gurmukhi script known as &quot;larivār&quot; where there were no spacing between words in the texts (interpuncts in the form of a dot were used by some to differentiate between words, such as by Guru Arjan). This is opposed to the comparatively more recent method of writing in Gurmukhi known as &quot;pad ched&quot;, which breaks the words by inserting spacing between them.

===Numbers===
Before the invention of delimiters and other punctuation to set off groups of three digits in numbers above four digits, large numbers (e.g. numbers greater than 999) were written continuously. As of now, only numbers with fewer than four digits are written with no delimiter or other punctuation. This manner is somewhat similar how to separate a word in a sentence.

While numbers up to four digits are recommended for separating three digits, there are some of them are not. These include most Slavic languages, Spanish, Hungarian and Swiss German. These languages do not use a delimiter to separate numbers in four digits. English sometimes follows this practice.

<text>Gondor is a fictional kingdom in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s writings, described as the greatest realm of Men in the west of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. The third volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, is largely concerned with the events in Gondor during the War of the Ring and with the restoration of the realm afterward. The history of the kingdom is outlined in the appendices of the book.

Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from the downfallen island kingdom of Númenor. Along with Arnor in the north, Gondor, the South-kingdom, served as a last stronghold of the Men of the West. After an early period of growth, Gondor gradually declined as the Third Age progressed, being continually weakened by internal strife and conflict with the allies of the Dark Lord Sauron. By the time of the War of the Ring, the throne of Gondor is empty, though its principalities and fiefdoms still pay deference to the absent king by showing their loyalty to the Stewards of Gondor. The kingdom&#x27;s ascendancy is restored only with Sauron&#x27;s final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn as king.

Based upon early conceptions, the history and geography of Gondor were developed in stages as Tolkien extended his legendarium while writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Critics have noted the contrast between the cultured but lifeless Stewards of Gondor, and the simple but vigorous leaders of the Kingdom of Rohan, modelled on Tolkien&#x27;s favoured Anglo-Saxons. Scholars have noted parallels between Gondor and the Normans, Ancient Rome, the Vikings, the Goths, the Langobards, and the Byzantine Empire.

== Literature ==

=== In-fiction etymology ===

Tolkien intended the name &quot;Gondor&quot; to be Sindarin for &quot;Stone-land&quot;. This is echoed in the text of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by the name for Gondor among the Rohirrim, Stoningland. Tolkien&#x27;s early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours. This view is supported by the Drúedain terms for Gondorians and Minas Tirith—Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city. Tolkien denied that the name &quot;Gondor&quot; had been inspired by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of Gondar, stating that the root &quot;Ond&quot; went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning &quot;ond&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;) as one of only two words known of the pre-Celtic languages of Britain. Gondor is also called the South-kingdom or Southern Realm, and together with Arnor as the Númenórean Realms in Exile. Researchers Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull have proposed a Quenya translation of &quot;Gondor&quot;: &quot;Ondonórë&quot;.
The Men of Gondor are nicknamed &quot;Tarks&quot; (from Quenya &quot;tarkil&quot; &quot;High Man&quot;, Númenórean) by the orcs of Mordor.

=== Fictional geography ===

==== Country ====
 
Gondor&#x27;s geography is illustrated in the maps for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; made by Christopher Tolkien on the basis of his father&#x27;s sketches, and geographical accounts in &quot;The Rivers and Beacon-Hills of Gondor&quot;, &quot;Cirion and Eorl&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Gondor lies in the west of Middle-earth, on the northern shores of Anfalas and the Bay of Belfalas with the great port of Pelargir near the river Anduin&#x27;s delta in the fertile and populous region of Lebennin, stretching up to the White Mountains (Sindarin: &quot;Ered Nimrais&quot;, &quot;Mountains of White Horns&quot;). Near the mouths of Anduin was the island of Tolfalas.

To the north-west of Gondor lies Arnor; to the north, Gondor is bordered by Wilderland and Rohan; to the north-east, by Rhûn; to the east, across the great river Anduin and the province of Ithilien, by Mordor; to the south, by the deserts of northern Harad. To the west lies the Great Sea.

 The wide land to the west of Rohan was Enedwaith; in some of Tolkien&#x27;s writings it is part of Gondor, in others not.

The hot and dry region of South Gondor, or Harondor was by the time of the War of the Ring &quot;a debatable and desert land&quot;, contested by the men of Harad.
The region of Lamedon and the uplands of the prosperous Morthond, with the desolate Hill of Erech, lay to the south of the White Mountains, while the populous valleys of Lossarnach were just south of Minas Tirith. The city&#x27;s port was also a few miles south at Harlond, where the great river Anduin made its closest approach to Minas Tirith. Ringló Vale lay between Lamedon and Lebennin.
The region of Calenardhon lay to the north of the White Mountains; it was granted independence as the kingdom of Rohan. To the northeast, the river Anduin enters the hills of the Emyn Muil and passes the Sarn Gebir, dangerous straits, above a large river-lake, Nen Hithoel. Its entrance was once the northern border of Gondor, and is marked by the Gates of Argonath, an enormous pair of kingly statues, as a warning to trespassers. At the southern end of the lake are the hills of Amon Hen (the Hill of Seeing) and Amon Lhaw (the Hill of Hearing) on the west and east shores; below Amon Hen is the lawn of Parth Galen, where the Fellowship disembarked and was then broken, with the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the death of Boromir. Between the two hills is a rocky islet, Tol Brandir, which partly dams the river; just below it is an enormous waterfall, the Falls of Rauros, over which Boromir&#x27;s funeral-boat is sent. Further down the river are the hills of Emyn Arnen.

==== Capital, Minas Tirith ====



The capital of Gondor at the end of the Third Age, Minas Tirith (Sindarin: &quot;Tower of Guard&quot;), lay at the eastern end of the White Mountains, built around a shoulder of Mount Mindolluin. The city had seven walls: each held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next. The city was surrounded by the Pelennor, an area of farmlands ringed by a wall. Inside the seventh wall was the Citadel, topped by the White Tower. Behind the tower, reached from the sixth level, was a saddle leading to the necropolis of the Kings and Stewards, with a street of tombs, Rath Dínen.

Within the Court of the Fountain stood the White Tree, the symbol of Gondor. It was dry throughout the centuries that Gondor was ruled by the Stewards; Aragorn brought a sapling of the White Tree into the city on his return as King. John Garth writes that the White Tree has been likened to the Dry Tree of the 14th century &quot;Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;. The tale runs that the Dry Tree had been dry since the crucifixion of Christ, but that it would flower afresh when &quot;a prince of the west side of the world should sing a mass beneath it&quot;.

Tolkien&#x27;s map-notes for the illustrator Pauline Baynes indicate that the city had the latitude of Ravenna, an Italian city on the Adriatic Sea, though it lay &quot;900 miles east of Hobbiton more near Belgrade&quot;. The Warning beacons of Gondor were atop a line of foothills running back west from Minas Tirith towards Rohan.

==== Dol Amroth ====

Dol Amroth (Sindarin: &quot;the Hill of Amroth&quot;) was a fortress-city on a peninsula jutting westward into the Bay of Belfalas, on Gondor&#x27;s southern shore. It is also the name of the port city, one of the five great cities of Gondor, and the seat of the principality of the same name, founded by prince Galador. The whimsical poem &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; tells how the Man in the Moon fell one night into &quot;the windy Bay of Bel&quot;; his fall is marked by the tolling of a bell in the Seaward Tower (&quot;Tirith Aear&quot;) of Dol Amroth, and he recovers at an inn in the city.

Its ruler, the Prince of Dol Amroth, is subject to the sovereignty of Gondor. The principality&#x27;s boundaries are not explicitly defined, though the Prince ruled Belfalas as a fief, as well as an area to the east on the map labelled Dor-en-Ernil (&quot;The Land of the Prince&quot;). Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, was linked by marriage both to the Stewards of Gondor and to the Kings of Rohan. He was the brother of Lady Finduilas and uncle to her sons Boromir and Faramir; a kinsman of Théoden; and the father of Éomer&#x27;s wife Lothíriel. Imrahil played a major part in the defence of Minas Tirith; the soldiers whom Imrahil led to Minas Tirith formed the largest contingent from the hinterland to the defence of the city. They marched under a banner &quot;silver upon blue&quot;, bearing &quot;a white ship like a swan upon blue water&quot;.

Some like Finduilas are of Númenórean descent, and still speak the Elvish language. Tolkien wrote about the city&#x27;s protective sea-walls and described Belfalas as a &quot;great fief&quot;. Prince Imrahil&#x27;s castle is by the sea; Tolkien described him as &quot;of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes&quot;. Local tradition claimed that the line&#x27;s forefather, Imrazôr the Númenórean had married an Elf, though the line remained mortal.

=== Fictional history ===

==== Pre-Númenórean ====

The first people in the region were the Drúedain, a hunter-gatherer group of Men who arrive in the First Age. They were pushed aside by later settlers and came to live in the pine-woods of the Druadan Forest by the north-eastern White Mountains. 
The next people settled in the White Mountains, and became known as the Men of the Mountains. They built a subterranean complex at Dunharrow, later known as the Paths of the Dead, which extended through the mountain-range from north to south. They became subject to Sauron in the Dark Years. Fragments of pre-Númenórean languages survive in later ages in place-names such as &quot;Erech&quot;, &quot;Arnach&quot;, and &quot;Umbar&quot;.

====Númenórean kingdom====

The shorelands of Gondor were widely colonized by the Númenóreans from the middle of the Second Age, especially by Elf-friends loyal to Elendil. His sons Isildur and Anárion landed in Gondor after the drowning of Númenor, and co-founded the Kingdom of Gondor. Isildur brought with him a seedling of Nimloth (Sindarin: &quot;nim&quot;, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;loth&quot;, &quot;blossom&quot;) the Fair, the white tree from Númenor. This tree and its descendants came to be called the White Tree of Gondor, and appears on the kingdom&#x27;s coat of arms. Elendil, who founded the Kingdom of Arnor to the north, was held to be the High King of all the lands of the Dúnedain. Isildur established the city of Minas Ithil (Sindarin: &quot;Tower of the Moon&quot;) while Anárion established the city of Minas Anor (Sindarin: &quot;Tower of the Sun&quot;).

Sauron survived the destruction of Númenor and secretly returned to his realm of Mordor, soon launching a war against the Númenórean kingdoms. He captured Minas Ithil, but Isildur escaped by ship to Arnor; meanwhile, Anárion was able to defend Osgiliath. Elendil and the Elven-king Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together with Isildur and Anárion, they besieged and defeated Mordor. Sauron was overthrown; but the One Ring that Isildur took from him was not destroyed, and thus Sauron continued to exist.

Both Elendil and Anárion were killed in the war, so Isildur conferred rule of Gondor upon Anárion&#x27;s son Meneldil, retaining suzerainty over Gondor as High King of the Dúnedain. Isildur and his three elder sons were ambushed and killed by Orcs in the Gladden Fields. Isildur&#x27;s remaining son Valandil did not attempt to claim his father&#x27;s place as Gondor&#x27;s monarch; the kingdom was ruled solely by Meneldil and his descendants until their line died out.

==== Third Age, under the Stewards ====

During the early years of the Third Age, Gondor was victorious and wealthy, and kept a careful watch on Mordor, but the peace ended with Easterling invasions. Gondor established a powerful navy and captured the southern port of Umbar from the Black Númenóreans, becoming rich.

As time went by, Gondor neglected the watch on Mordor. A civil war gave Umbar the opportunity to declare independence. The kings of Harad grew stronger, leading to fighting in the south. With a Great Plague the population began a steep decline. The capital was moved from Osgiliath to the less affected Minas Anor, and evil creatures returned to the mountains bordering Mordor. There was war with the Wainriders, a confederation of Easterling tribes, and Gondor lost its line of kings. The Ringwraiths captured and occupied Minas Ithil which became Minas Morgul, &quot;the Tower of Black Sorcery&quot;. At this time Minas Anor was renamed to Minas Tirith, in constant watch of its now defiled twin city.

Without kings, Gondor was ruled by stewards for many generations, father to son; despite their exercise of power and hereditary status, they were never accepted as kings, nor did they sit on the high throne. After attacks by evil forces, the province of Ithilien and the city of Osgiliath were abandoned. In the War of the Ring, the forces of Gondor, led by Aragorn under the alias Thorongil, attacked Umbar and destroyed the Corsair fleet, allowing Denethor II to devote his attention to Mordor.

==== War of the Ring and restoration ====



Denethor sent his son Boromir to Rivendell for advice as war loomed. There, Boromir attended the Council of Elrond, saw the One Ring, and suggested it be used as a weapon to save Gondor. Elrond rebuked him, explaining the danger of such use, and instead, the hobbit Frodo was made ring-bearer, and a Fellowship, including Boromir, was sent on a quest to destroy the Ring. 
Growing in strength, Sauron attacked Osgiliath, forcing the defenders to leave, destroying the last bridge across the Anduin behind them. Minas Tirith then faced direct land attack from Mordor, combined with naval attack by the Corsairs of Umbar. The hobbits Frodo and Sam travelled through Ithilien, and were captured by Faramir, Boromir&#x27;s brother, who held them at the hidden cave of Henneth Annûn, but helped them to continue their quest. Aragorn summoned the Dead of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing men from the southern provinces of Gondor such as Dol Amroth to come to the aid of Minas Tirith.

During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Great Gate was breached by Sauron&#x27;s forces led by the Witch-king of Angmar. He spoke &quot;words of power&quot; as the battering ram named Grond attacked the Great Gate; it burst asunder as if &quot;stricken by some blasting spell&quot;, with &quot;a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground&quot;. The Witch-king rode through the Gate where Gandalf awaited him, but left shortly afterwards to meet the Riders of Rohan in battle. Gondor, with the support of Rohirrim as cavalry, repelled the invasion by Mordor. Following the death of Denethor and the incapacity of Faramir, Prince Imrahil became the effective lord of Gondor.

When Imrahil declined to send the entirety of Gondor&#x27;s army against Mordor, Aragorn led a smaller army to the Black Gate of Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo&#x27;s quest. Sauron encircled the army at the Battle of the Morannon, but the hobbits succeeded, defeating Sauron and bringing the war and the Third Age to an end. The Great Gate was rebuilt with &quot;mithril&quot; and steel by Gimli and Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain. Aragorn&#x27;s coronation was held on the Gateway, where he was pronounced King Elessar of both Gondor and Arnor, the sister kingdom in the north.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Writing ===

Tolkien&#x27;s original thoughts about the later ages of Middle-earth are outlined in his first, mid-1930s, sketches for the legend of Númenor; these already contain a semblance of Gondor. The appendices to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were brought to a finished state in 1953–54, but a decade later, during preparations for the release of the Second Edition, Tolkien elaborated the events that had led to Gondor&#x27;s civil war, introducing the regency of Rómendacil II. The final development of the history and geography of Gondor took place around 1970, in the last years of Tolkien&#x27;s life, when he invented justifications for the place-names and wrote full narratives for the stories of Isildur&#x27;s death and of the battles with the Wainriders and the Balchoth (published in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;).

=== In-universe ===

Tolkien describes an early population of elves in the Dol Amroth region, writing many accounts of its early history. In one version, a haven and a small settlement were founded in the First Age by seafaring Sindar from the west havens of Beleriand who fled in three small ships when the power of Morgoth overwhelmed the Eldar; the Sindar were joined later by Silvan Elves who came down Anduin seeking the sea. Another account states that the haven was established in the Second Age by Sindarin Elves from Lindon, who learned the craft of shipbuilding at the Grey Havens and then settled at the mouth of the Morthond. Other accounts say that Silvan Elves accompanied Galadriel from Lothlórien to this region after the defeat of Sauron at Eriador in the middle of the Second Age, or that Amroth ruled among the Nandorin Elves here in the Second Age. Elves continued to live there well into the Third Age, until the last ship departed from Edhellond for the Undying Lands. Amroth, King of Lothlórien from the beginning of the Third Age, left his realm behind in search of his beloved Nimrodel, a Nandorin who had fled from the horror unleashed by the Dwarves in Moria. He waited for her at Edhellond, for their final voyage together into the West. But Nimrodel, who loved Middle-earth as much as she did Amroth, failed to join him. When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her, and drowned in the bay. Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf and one of the companions of Nimrodel, is said to have become the foremother of the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth.

According to an alternate account about the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth cited in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, they were descendants of a family of the Faithful from Númenor who had ruled over the land of Belfalas since the Second Age, before Númenor was destroyed. This family of Númenóreans were akin to the Lords of Andúnië, and thus related to Elendil and descended from the House of Elros. After the Downfall of Númenor, they were created the &quot;Prince of Belfalas&quot; by Elendil. &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; provides an account of &quot;Adrahil of Dol Amroth&quot; who fought under King Ondoher of Gondor against the Wainriders.

The critic Tom Shippey compares Tolkien&#x27;s characterisation of Gondor with that of Rohan. He notes that men from the two countries meet or behave in contrasting ways several times in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: when Éomer and his Riders of Rohan twice meet Aragorn&#x27;s party in the Mark, and when Faramir and his men imprison Frodo and Sam at Henneth Annun in Ithilien. Shippey notes that while Éomer is &quot;compulsively truculent&quot;, Faramir is courteous, urbane, civilised: the people of Gondor are self-assured, and their culture is higher than that of Rohan. The same is seen, Shippey argues, in the comparison between the mead hall of Meduseld in Rohan, and the great hall of Minas Tirith in Gondor. Meduseld is simple, but brought to life by tapestries, a colourful stone floor, and the vivid picture of the rider, his bright hair streaming in the wind, blowing his horn. The Steward Denethor&#x27;s hall is large and solemn, but dead, colourless, in cold stone. Rohan is, Shippey suggests, the &quot;bit that Tolkien knew best&quot;, Anglo-Saxon, full of vigour; Gondor is &quot;a kind of Rome&quot;, over-subtle, selfish, calculating.

The critic Jane Chance Nitzsche contrasts the &quot;good and bad Germanic lords Théoden and Denethor&quot;, noting that their names are almost anagrams. She writes that both men receive the allegiance of a hobbit, but very differently: Denethor, Steward of Gondor, undervalues Pippin because he is small, and binds him with a formal oath, whereas Théoden, King of Rohan, treats Merry with love, which the hobbit responds to.

In his analysis of the historical lore of Númenor, Michael N. Stanton said close affinities are demonstrated between Elves and the descendants of Men of the West, not only in terms of blood heritage but also in &quot;moral probity and nobility of demeanor&quot;, which gradually weakened over time due to &quot;time, forgetfulness, and, in no small part, the machinations of Sauron&quot;. The cultural ties between the Men of Gondor and Elves are reflected in the names of certain characters: for instance, Finduilas of Dol Amroth (the wife of Denethor and the sister of Prince Imrahil) shares her name with an Elf princess of the First Age.

Leslie A. Donovan, in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, compares the siege of Gondor with the alliance of Elves and Men in their fight against Morgoth and other co-operative ventures in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, making the point that none of these would have succeeded without collaboration; further that one such success comes from another shared effort, as when the Rohirrim were only able to come to the aid of Gondor because of the joint efforts of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn; and that they in turn collaborated with the oathbreakers from the Paths of the Dead.

== Influences ==

Sandra Ballif Straubhaar, a scholar of Germanic studies, notes in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that readers have debated the real-world prototypes of Gondor. She writes that like the Normans, their founders the Númenóreans arrived &quot;from across the sea&quot;, and that Prince Imrahil&#x27;s armour with a &quot;burnished vambrace&quot; recalls late-medieval plate armour. Against this theory, she notes Tolkien&#x27;s direction of readers to Egypt and Byzantium. Recalling that Tolkien located Minas Tirith at the latitude of Florence, she states that &quot;the most striking similarities&quot; are with ancient Rome. She identifies several parallels: Aeneas, from Troy, and Elendil, from Númenor, both survive the destruction of their home countries; the brothers Romulus and Remus found Rome, while the brothers Isildur and Anárion found the Númenórean kingdoms in Middle-earth; and both Gondor and Rome experienced centuries of &quot;decadence and decline&quot;.

Dimitra Fimi, a scholar of fantasy and children&#x27;s literature, draws a parallel between the seafaring Númenóreans and the Vikings of the Norse world, noting that in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;, Tolkien describes their ship-burials, matching those in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. She notes that Boromir is given a boat-funeral in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. Fimi further compares the helmet and crown of Gondor with the romanticised &quot;headgear of the Valkyries&quot;, despite Tolkien&#x27;s denial of a connection with Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, noting the &quot;likeness of the wings of a sea-bird&quot; in his description of Aragorn&#x27;s coronation, and his drawing of the crown in an unused dust jacket design.

The classical scholar Miryam Librán-Moreno writes that Tolkien drew heavily on the general history of the Goths, Langobards and the Byzantine Empire, and their mutual struggle. Historical names from these peoples were used in drafts or the final concept of the internal history of Gondor, such as Vidumavi, wife of king Valacar (in Gothic). The Byzantine Empire and Gondor were both, in Librán-Moreno&#x27;s view, only echoes of older states (the Roman Empire and the unified kingdom of Elendil), yet each proved to be stronger than their sister-kingdoms (the Western Roman Empire and Arnor, respectively). Both realms were threatened by powerful eastern and southern enemies: the Byzantines by the Persians and the Muslim armies of the Arabs and the Turks, as well as the Langobards and Goths; Gondor by the Easterlings, the Haradrim, and the hordes of Sauron. Both realms were in decline at the time of a final, all-out siege from the East; however, Minas Tirith survived the siege whereas Constantinople did not. In a 1951 letter, Tolkien himself wrote about &quot;the Byzantine City of Minas Tirith.&quot;

Tolkien visited the Malvern Hills with C. S. Lewis, and recorded excerpts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Malvern in 1952, at George Sayer&#x27;s home. Sayer wrote that Tolkien relived the book as they walked, comparing the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===

Gondor, as it appeared in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, has been compared to the Byzantine Empire. The production team noted this in DVD commentary, explaining their decision to include Byzantine domes into Minas Tirith&#x27;s architecture and to have civilians wear Byzantine-styled clothing. However, the appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited tidal island and abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, France. In the films, the towers of the city, designed by the artist Alan Lee, are equipped with trebuchets. The film critic Roger Ebert called the films&#x27; interpretation of Minas Tirith a &quot;spectacular achievement&quot;, and compared it to the Emerald City from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He praised the filmmakers&#x27; ability to blend digital and real sets.

=== Games ===

The setting of Minas Tirith has appeared in video game adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, such as the 2003 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; where it is directly modelled on Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation.

Several locations in Gondor were featured in the 1982 role-playing game &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; game and its expansions.

<text>Tradescantia () is a genus of 85 species of herbaceous perennial wildflowers in the family Commelinaceae, native to the Americas from southern Canada to northern Argentina, including the West Indies. Members of the genus are known by many common names, including inchplant, wandering jew, spiderwort, dayflower and trad.

&quot;Tradescantia&quot; grow , and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and open fields. They were introduced into Europe as ornamental plants in the 17th century and are now grown in many parts of the world. Some species have become naturalized in regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and on some oceanic islands.

The genus&#x27;s many species are of interest to cytogenetics because of evolutionary changes in the structure and number of their chromosomes. They have also been used as bioindicators for the detection of environmental mutagens. Some species have become pests to cultivated crops and considered invasive.

==Description==
&quot;Tradescantia&quot; are herbaceous perennials and include both climbing and trailing species, reaching in height. The stems are usually succulent or semi-succulent, and the leaves are sometimes semi-succulent. The leaves are long, thin and blade-like to lanceolate, from . The flowers can be white, pink, purple or blue, with three petals and six yellow anthers (or rarely, four petals and eight anthers). The sap is mucilaginous and clear. 

A number of species have flowers that last for only a day, opening in the morning and closing by the evening.

==Etymology==
The scientific name of the genus chosen by Carl Linnaeus honours the English naturalists and explorers John Tradescant the Elder (c. 1570s – 1638) and John Tradescant the Younger (1608–1662), who introduced many new plants to English gardens. Tradescant the Younger visited the new colony of Virginia in 1637 (and possibly twice more in later years). From there, the type species, &quot;Tradescantia virginiana&quot;, was brought to England in 1629.

Plants of the genus are called by many common names, varying by region and country. The name &quot;inchplant&quot; is thought to describe the plant&#x27;s fast growth, or the fact that leaves are an inch apart on the stem. &quot;Spiderwort&quot; refers to the sap which dries into web-like threads when a stem is cut. The name &quot;dayflower&quot;, shared with other members of the Commelinaceae family, refers to the flowers which open and close within a single day.

The controversial name &quot;wandering Jew&quot; originates from the Christian myth of the Wandering Jew, condemned to wander the earth for taunting Jesus on the way to his crucifixion. In recent years there have been efforts to stop using this and other potentially offensive common names, in favour of alternatives such as &quot;wandering dude&quot; or &quot;wandering willie&quot;.

In Spanish, &quot;Tradescantia&quot; plants are sometimes referred to as &quot;flor de Santa Lucía&quot; (Saint Lucy&#x27;s flower), in reference to the Saint&#x27;s reputation as the patron saint of sight, and the use of the juice of the plant as eye drops to relieve congestion.

==Taxonomy==
===Subdivisions and species===


The number of species and infrageneric taxa has changed throughout history. The first major classification proposed by Hunt (1980) included 60 species divided into eight sections, with one section divided into a further four series. Hunt&#x27;s 1986 revision united several small genera with &quot;Tradescantia&quot; as sections, resulting in a total of twelve sections comprising 68 species, and this infrageneric classification was accepted for several decades.

A recent study by Pellegrini (2017) proposed a new classification based on recent morphological research, dividing the genus into five subgenera. As of December 2023, The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew recognises 86 species.

===Unclassified===
* &quot;Tradescantia petiolaris&quot; 

===Formerly placed here===
* &quot;Tradescantia&quot; × &quot;andersoniana&quot; The name was published with no description, so is not a valid botanical name; the taxon is now treated as a cultivar group.
*&quot;Callisia navicularis&quot; (as &quot;T. navicularis&quot; )
*&quot;Callisia warszewicziana&quot; (as &quot;T. warszewicziana&quot; )
*&quot;Gibasis geniculata&quot; (as &quot;T. geniculata&quot; )
*&quot;Gibasis karwinskyana&quot; (as &quot;T. karwinskyana&quot; )
*&quot;Gibasis pellucida&quot; (as &quot;T. pellucida&quot; )
*&quot;Siderasis fuscata&quot; (as &quot;T. fuscata&quot; )
*&quot;Tinantia anomala&quot; (as &quot;T. anomala&quot; )
*&quot;Tripogandra diuretica&quot; (as &quot;T. diuretica&quot; )
* &quot;Elasis hirsuta&quot; (as &quot;T. hirsuta&quot;)

==Distribution and habitat==
The first species described, the Virginia spiderwort, &quot;T. virginiana&quot;, is native to the eastern United States from Maine to Alabama, and Canada in southern Ontario. Virginia spiderwort was introduced to Europe in 1629, where it is cultivated as a garden flower.

The natural range of the genus as a whole spans nearly the entire length and width of mainland North America, from Canada through Mexico and Central America, and thrives in a great diversity of temperate and tropical habitats. It is frequently found in thinly wooded deciduous forests, plains, prairies, and healthy fields, often alongside other native wildflowers.

==Conservation==
The western spiderwort &quot;T. occidentalis&quot; is listed as an endangered species in Canada, where the northernmost populations of the species are found at a few sites in southern Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta; it is more common further south in the United States to Texas and Arizona.

==Cultivation==

Spiderworts are popular in Europe and North America as ornamental plants. Temperate species are grown as hardy garden perennials, while tropical species such as &quot;T. zebrina&quot; and &quot;T. spathacea&quot; are used as house plants. Their popularity and easy spreading nature has led to some species being considered serious weeds in certain places (see below).

Most cold-hardy garden plants belong to the Andersoniana Group (often referred to with the invalid name &quot;Tradescantia&quot; × &quot;andersoniana&quot;). This is a group of interspecific hybrids developed from &quot;Tradescantia virginiana&quot;, &quot;T. ohiensis&quot;, and &quot;T. subaspera&quot;, which have overlapping ranges within continental North America. These plants are clump-forming herbaceous perennials, with individual cultivars mainly differing in flower colour. 

A wide range of tender tropical species are cultivated as houseplants or outdoor annuals in temperate locations, including &quot;Tradescantia zebrina&quot;, &quot;T. fluminensis&quot;, &quot;T. spathacea&quot;, &quot;T. sillamontana&quot;, and &quot;T. pallida&quot;. They are typically grown for their foliage, and many have colourful variegated patterns of silver, purple, green, pink, and gold. 

===Cultivars===

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &quot;T.&quot; (Andersoniana Group) &#x27;Concord Grape&#x27;
* &quot;T. cerinthoides&quot; &#x27;Nanouk&#x27;
* &quot;T. cerinthoides&quot; &#x27;Variegata&#x27;
* &quot;T. fluminensis&quot; &#x27;Aurea&#x27;
* &quot;T. fluminensis&quot; &#x27;Quicksilver&#x27;
* &quot;T. pallida&quot; &#x27;Purpurea&#x27;
* &quot;T. spathacea&quot; &#x27;Rainbow&#x27;
* &quot;T. zebrina&quot; &#x27;Purpusii&#x27;
* &quot;T. zebrina&quot; &#x27;Quadricolor&#x27;

The International Society for Horticultural Science appointed Tradescantia Hub as an International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA) for &quot;Tradescantia&quot; in 2022. As an ICR authority, the Hub is responsible for recording and maintaining a checklist of the correct names for all cultivars in the genus.

==Weeds==
Due to its ready propagation from stem fragments and its domination of the ground layer in many forest environments, &quot;T. fluminensis&quot; has become a major environmental weed in Australia, New Zealand and the southern United States. Other species considered invasive weeds in certain places include &quot;T. pallida&quot;, &quot;T. spathacea&quot;, and &quot;T. zebrina&quot;.

==Toxicity==
Some members of the genus &quot;Tradescantia&quot; may cause allergic reactions in pets (especially cats and dogs) characterised by red, itchy skin. Notable culprits include &quot;T. albiflora&quot; (scurvy weed), &quot;T. spathacea&quot; (Moses in the cradle), and &quot;T. pallida&quot; (purple heart).

==Uses==
Native Americans used &quot;T. virginiana&quot; to treat a number of conditions, including stomachache. It was also used as a food source. The cells of the stamen hairs of some &quot;Tradescantia&quot; are colored blue, but when exposed to sources of ionizing radiation such as gamma rays or pollutants like sulphur dioxide from industries, the cells mutate and change color to pink; they are one of the few tissues known to serve as an effective bioassay for ambient radiation levels.

<doc id="61610" wikidata="Q9012745" url="?curid=61610" title="Burden of proof (law)">
<text>In a legal dispute, one party has the burden of proof to show that they are correct, while the other party has no such burden and is presumed to be correct. The burden of proof requires a party to produce evidence to establish the truth of facts needed to satisfy all the required legal elements of the dispute. 

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim &quot;semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit&quot;, a translation of which is: &quot;the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.&quot; In civil suits, for example, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof that the defendant&#x27;s action or inaction caused injury to the plaintiff, and the defendant bears the burden of proving an affirmative defense. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor for criminal cases, and the defendant is presumed innocent. If the claimant fails to discharge the burden of proof to prove their case, the claim will be dismissed.

== Definition ==
A &quot;burden of proof&quot; is a party&#x27;s duty to prove a disputed assertion or charge, and includes the burden of production (providing enough evidence on an issue so that the trier-of-fact decides it rather than in a peremptory ruling like a directed verdict) and the burden of persuasion (standard of proof such as preponderance of the evidence).

A &quot;burden of persuasion&quot; or &quot;risk of non-persuasion&quot; is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding. Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the presumption of innocence in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for affirmative defenses in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.

The burden of persuasion should not be confused with the evidential burden, or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence) which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.

There is no burden of proof with regard to motive or animus in criminal cases in the United States. The intent surrounding an offense is nevertheless crucial to the elements of the offense in a first-degree-murder conviction. This brings up the ethical dilemma of whether or not a death sentence should be imposed when the defendant&#x27;s motives or intentions are the contingent factors in sentencing. However, in some cases such as defamation suits with a public figure as the defamed party, the public figure must prove actual malice.

== Standard of proof in the United States ==
Burden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any affirmative facts in defense. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.

=== Legal standards for burden of proof ===
==== Some evidence ====
Per &quot;Superintendent v. Hill&quot; (1985), in order to take away a prisoner&#x27;s good conduct time for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have &quot;some evidence&quot;, i.e., &quot;a modicum of evidence&quot;; however, the sentencing judge is under no obligation to adhere to good/work time constraints, nor are they required to credit time served.

==== Reasonable indications ====
&quot;Reasonable indication (also known as reasonable suspicion) is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere &#x27;hunch&#x27; is insufficient.&quot;

The reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.

==== Reasonable suspicion ====

Reasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a &quot;brief&quot; investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. This stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often probable cause) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, , the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or &quot;hunch&quot; is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.

An investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what they perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about their business. If the investigation confirms the officer&#x27;s initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete, and may give rise to the level of probable cause.

==== Reasonable to believe ====
In &quot;Arizona v. Gant&quot; (2009), the United States Supreme Court arguably defined a new standard, that of &quot;reasonable to believe&quot;. This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled &quot;New York v. Belton&quot; (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect&#x27;s arrest only where it is &quot;reasonable to believe&quot; that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.

There is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of the &quot;Terry&quot; stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.

==== Probable cause ====

Probable cause is a higher standard of proof than reasonable suspicion, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is unreasonable. It is also used by grand juries to determine whether to issue an indictment. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement remedy.

In the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Sokolow&quot;, , determined that probable cause requires &quot;a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found&quot;. The primary issue was whether Drug Enforcement Administration agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts have traditionally interpreted the idea of &quot;a fair probability&quot; as meaning whether a fair-minded evaluator would have reason to find it more likely than not that a fact (or ultimate fact) is true, which is quantified as a 51% certainty standard (using whole numbers as the increment of measurement). Some courts and scholars have suggested probable cause could, in some circumstances, allow for a fact to be established as true to a standard of less than 51%, but as of August 2019, the United States Supreme Court has never ruled that the quantification of probable cause is anything less than 51%. Probable cause can be contrasted with &quot;reasonable articulable suspicion&quot; which requires a police officer to have an unquantified amount of certainty the courts say is well below 51% before briefly detaining a suspect (without consent) to pat them down and attempt to question them. The &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard, used by criminal juries in the United States to determine guilt for a crime, also contrasts with probable cause which courts hold requires an unquantified level of proof well above that of probable cause&#x27;s 51%. Though it is beyond the scope of this topic, when courts review whether 51% probable cause certainty was a reasonable judgment, the legal inquiry is different for police officers in the field than it would be for grand jurors. In &quot;Franks v. Delaware&quot; (1978), the U.S. Supreme Court held that probable cause requires that there not be &quot;reckless disregard for the truth&quot; of the facts asserted.

Examples of a police officer&#x27;s truth-certainty standards in the field and their practical consequences are offered below:
* : a knowing and voluntary consent-based encounter between police officer and another person
* : an involuntary stop initiated by the officer to briefly detain, attempt to question, and pat down outer clothing of a person of interest to police.
* : arrest and/or grand jury indictment of that person.

==== Some credible evidence ====
Some credible evidence is one of the least demanding standards of proof. This proof standard is often used in administrative law settings and in some states to initiate Child Protective Services (CPS) proceedings. This proof standard is used where short-term intervention is needed urgently, such as when a child is arguably in immediate danger from a parent or guardian. The &quot;some credible evidence&quot; standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of &quot;probable cause&quot; used in &quot;ex parte&quot; threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see &quot;Valmonte v. Bane,&quot; 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the &quot;some credible evidence&quot; standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.

==== Preponderance of the evidence ====
Preponderance of the evidence (American English), also known as balance of probabilities (British English), is the standard required in civil cases, including family court determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act, and in child custody determinations between parties having equal legal rights respecting a child. It is also the standard of proof by which the defendant must prove affirmative defenses or mitigating circumstances in civil or criminal court in the United States. In civil courts, aggravating circumstances also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as in criminal court).

The standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. Lord Denning, in &quot;Miller v. Minister of Pensions&quot;, described it simply as &quot;more probable than not&quot;. Another high-level way of interpreting that is that the plaintiff&#x27;s case (evidence) be 51% likely. A more precise statement is that &quot;the weight [of the evidence, including in calculating such a percentage] is determined not by the amount of evidence, but by its quality.&quot; The author goes on to affirm that preponderance is &quot;merely enough to tip the scales&quot; towards one party; however, that tilt need only be so slight as the weight of a &quot;feather.&quot; Until 1970, it was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States. Compared to the criminal standard of &quot;proof beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; the preponderance of the evidence standard is &quot;a somewhat easier standard to meet.&quot;

Preponderance of the evidence is also the standard of proof used in United States administrative law. In at least one case, there is a statutory definition of the standard.

While there is no federal definition, such as by definition of the courts or by statute applicable to all cases, The Merit Systems Protection Board&#x27;s has codified their definition at 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2). MSPB defines the standard as &quot;The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue.&quot; One author highlights the phrase &quot;more likely to be true than untrue&quot; as the critical component of the definition.

From 2013 to 2020, the Department of Education required schools to use a preponderance of evidence standard in evaluating sexual assault claims.

==== Clear and convincing evidence ====
Clear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot;, but less than &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in civil and certain criminal procedure in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relief from capital punishment must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence. New York State uses this standard when a court must determine whether to involuntarily hospitalize a mentally ill patient or to issue an Assisted Outpatient Treatment Order. This standard was also codified by the United States Supreme Court in all mental health civil commitment cases.

This standard is used in many types of equity cases, including paternity, persons in need of supervision, child custody, the probate of both wills and living wills, petitions to remove a person from life support (&quot;right to die&quot; cases), mental hygiene and involuntary hospitalizations, and many similar cases.

Clear and convincing evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida&#x27;s stand-your-ground law. Once raised by the defense, the state must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, showing that the statutory prerequisites have not been met, and then request that the court deny a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from clear and convincing evidence whether to grant immunity. This is a lower burden than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial, but higher than the &quot;probable cause&quot; threshold generally required for indictment.

Clear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions (i.e. preponderance of the evidence), which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.

This standard is also known as &quot;clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence&quot;; &quot;clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence&quot;, and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists. For example, this is the standard or quantum of evidence use to probate a last will and testament.

==== Beyond reasonable doubt ====
This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in juvenile delinquency proceedings, criminal proceedings, and when considering aggravating circumstances in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one&#x27;s own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution&#x27;s evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant&#x27;s guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant&#x27;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.

The term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused&#x27;s guilt, but only that no &quot;reasonable&quot; doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, &quot;i.e.&quot;, when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution&#x27;s burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.

The main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant&#x27;s liberty or even in their death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.

Another noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is LPS conservatorship.

== Standard of proof in the United Kingdom ==
In the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England and Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.

The criminal standard was formerly described as &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. That standard remains , and the words commonly used , though the Judicial Studies Board guidance is that juries might be assisted by being told that to convict they must be persuaded &quot;so that you are sure&quot;.

The civil standard is &#x27;the balance of probabilities&#x27;, often referred to in judgments as &quot;more likely than not&quot;.

The civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to drunk in charge that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence).

Prior to the decision of the House of Lords in &quot;Re B (A Child)&quot; [2008] UKHL 35 there had been some confusion – even at the Court of Appeal – as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the &#x27;heightened standard&#x27;. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges about making decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. Baroness Hale said:

The task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognize that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains &#x27;the balance of probabilities&#x27;.

== Standard of proof in Australia ==
In Australia, two standards of proof are applied at common law: the criminal standard and the civil standard. It is possible for other standards of proof to be applied where required by law.

=== Criminal standard ===
The criminal standard in Australia is, &#x27;beyond reasonable doubt&#x27;. An offence against a Commonwealth law, with a term of imprisonment in excess of 12 months is an &#x27;indictable offence&#x27;; and is constitutionally required to be tried before jury of 12 people. Offences that do not carry a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months are called &#x27;Summary Offences&#x27;. Some offences (with a term of imprisonment &lt;10 years) may be heard by a court of summary jurisdiction, &quot;a.k.a.&quot; Magistrates Court with the consent of all parties; however the court may not impose a sentence greater than 12 months. Juries are required to make findings of guilt &#x27;beyond reasonable doubt&#x27; for criminal matters. 

The Australian constitution does not expressly provide that criminal trials must be &#x27;fair&#x27;, nor does it set out the elements of a fair trial, but it may by implication protect other attributes. The High Court has moved toward, but not yet, entrenched procedural fairness as a constitutional right. If it did so, this would have the potential to constitutionalise the &#x27;beyond reasonable doubt&#x27; standard in criminal proceedings.

State offences are not subject to the constitution&#x27;s section 80 requirement for a jury. However, the case of &quot;Kirk&quot; constrains the way that State courts may operate during criminal trials per the &quot;Kable Doctrine.&quot;

=== Civil standard ===
In Australia, the civil standard is termed the &#x27;balance of probabilities&#x27;. In Australia, the &#x27;balance of probabilities&#x27; involves considerations that the evidence required to establish a fact at the civil standard will vary with the seriousness of what is being alleged. Although it has been noted a similar approach is taken in Canada. In the United Kingdom the evidential requirements of the civil standard of proof don&#x27;t vary with the seriousness of an allegation.

The case law that establishes this is &quot;Briginshaw v Briginshaw&quot;, which is the fifth most cited decision of Australia&#x27;s High Court. The case has since been incorporated into the uniform evidence law. The &quot;Briginshaw&quot; principle was articulated by Dixon in that case in these terms:
...it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters &quot;reasonable satisfaction&quot; should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. Everyone must feel that, when, for instance, the issue is on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory conclusion may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any sound and prudent judgment if the question was whether some act had been done involving grave moral delinquency

The &quot;Briginshaw&quot; principle is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &quot;Briginshaw&quot; standard of proof, in &quot;Qantas Airways Limited v. Gama&quot; Justices French and Jacobson stated the &quot;Briginshaw test does not create any third standard of proof between the civil and the criminal.&quot;

In the High Court case of &quot;G v. H&quot; Justices Deane, Dawson and Gaudron stated &quot;Not every case involves issues of importance and gravity in the &quot;Briginshaw v. Briginshaw&quot; sense. The need to proceed with caution is clear if, for example, there is an allegation of fraud or an allegation of criminal or moral wrongdoing..&quot;.

An example of the &quot;Briginshaw&quot; principle applied in practice is the case of Ben Roberts-Smith where, due to the gravity of the allegations, Fairfax Media was required to rely on stronger proof than in the context of a normal allegation to win their case. In the end, despite the high burden of proof required, Fairfax won the trial, with Besanko ruling that it was proven he &quot;broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement and is therefore a criminal&quot;.

Melbourne Law School professor Jeremy Gans, has noted that for particularly serious allegations, such as sexual assault, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to see how the &quot;Briginshaw&quot; principle is much different to beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. The decision has also been noted for affecting the ability of litigants to seek redress in anti-discrimination lawsuits, due to the seriousness of such allegations.

== Other standards for presenting cases or defenses ==

=== Air of reality ===

The &quot;air of reality&quot; is a standard of proof used in Canada to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an &quot;air of reality&quot;. Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a &quot;prima facie&quot; case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an affirmative defense, such as the insanity defense. This is similar to the concept of summary judgment in the United States, though not identical.

=== Evidentiary standards of proof ===
Depending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest. For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).

== Examples ==

=== Criminal law ===
Criminal cases usually place the burden of proof on the prosecutor (expressed in the Latin brocard ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat, &quot;the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies&quot;). This principle is known as the presumption of innocence, and is summed up with &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;, but is not upheld in all legal systems or jurisdictions. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.
The presumption of innocence means three things:
* With respect to the critical facts of a case the defendant has no burden of proof whatsoever.
* The state must prove the critical facts of the case to the appropriate level of certainty.
* The jury is not to draw any inferences adverse to the defendant from the fact that they have been charged with a crime and are present in court facing the charges against them.

For example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.
* Burden of proof: P
** Burden of production: P has to show some evidence that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then it is up to the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).
*** e.g. witness, forensic evidence, autopsy report
*** Failure to meet the burden: the issue will be decided as a matter of law. In this case, D is presumed innocent
** Burden of persuasion: if at the close of evidence, the jury cannot decide if P has established with relevant level of certainty that D had committed murder, the jury must find D not guilty of the crime of murder
*** Measure of proof: P has to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, but not necessarily prove every single fact beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980, s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some &quot;exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification&quot; in their defence in a summary trial, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle can raise the defense that there was no likelihood of their driving while drunk. The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that they were not likely to drive.

In 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The House of Lords held that:
* A mere evidential burden did not contravene art. 6(2);
* A legal / persuasive burden did not necessarily contravene art. 6(2) so long as confined within reasonable limits, considering the questions:
** &quot;What must the prosecution prove to transfer burden to the defendant?&quot;
** &quot;Is the defendant required to prove something difficult or easily within his access?&quot;
** &quot;What threat to society is the provision designed to combat?&quot;

In some cases, there is a reverse onus on the accused. A typical example is that of a hit-and-run charge prosecuted under the Canadian Criminal Code. The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offense.

=== Civil law ===
In civil law cases, such as a dispute over a contract or a claim about an accidental injury, the burden of proof usually requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff&#x27;s entitlement to the relief sought. This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover.

This rule is not absolute in civil lawsuits; unlike with criminal offenses, laws may establish a different burden of proof, or the burden in an individual case may be reversed as a matter of fairness. For example, if a bank or government agency has a legal duty to keep certain records, and a lawsuit alleges that the proper records were not kept, then the plaintiff may not be required to prove a negative; instead, the respondent could be required to prove to the court that the records were kept.

=== Civil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court ===
In &quot;Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1&quot;, the United States Supreme Court stated: &quot;There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, &#x27;is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations&#x27;.&quot; For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In &quot;Keyes&quot;, the Supreme Court held that if &quot;school authorities have been found to have practiced purposeful segregation in part of a school system&quot;, the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.

In &quot;Director, Office of Workers&#x27; Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries&quot;, the Supreme Court explained that &quot;burden of proof&quot; is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens: the &quot;burden of persuasion&quot;, and the &quot;burden of production&quot;.

The Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in &quot;Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast&quot;. The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will &quot;begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims&quot;. In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, &quot;McCormick on Evidence&quot; § 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:

At the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized &quot;The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff&#x27;s claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. ... Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. ... [Nonetheless,] [a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.&quot;

<text>Bacău ( , , ; ; ) is the main city in Bacău County, Romania. With a population of 136,087 (as of 2021 census), Bacău is the 14th largest city in Romania. The city is situated in the historical region of Moldavia, at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and on the Bistrița River (which meets the Siret River about to the south of Bacău). The Ghimeș Pass links Bacău to the region of Transylvania.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name, which features in Old Church Slavonic documents as &quot;Bako&quot;, &quot;Bakova&quot; or &quot;Bakovia&quot;, comes most probably from a personal name of Hungarian origin. Men bearing the name Bakó or Bako are documented in medieval Transylvania and in 15th-century Bulgaria, but according to Victor Spinei the name itself is of Turkicmost probably of Cuman or Pechenegorigin. Nicolae Iorga believes that the city&#x27;s name is of Hungarian origin (as Adjud and Sascut). Another theory suggests that the town&#x27;s name has a Slavic origin, pointing to the Proto-Slavic word &quot;byk&quot;, meaning &quot;ox&quot; or &quot;bull&quot;, the region being very suitable for raising cattle; the term, rendered into Romanian alphabet as &quot;bâc&quot;, was probably the origin of &quot;Bâcău&quot;. In German it is known as &quot;Bakau&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Bákó&quot; and in Turkish as &quot;Baka&quot;.

== History ==
Similarly to most urban centers in Moldavia, Bacău emerged on a ford that allowed water passage. There is archaeological evidence of human settlement in the centre of Bacău (near Curtea Domnească) dating from the 6th and the 7th centuries; these settlements were placed over older settlements from the 4th and the 5th centuries. A number of vessels found here are ornamented with crosses, hinting that the inhabitants were Christians. Pechenegs and Cumans controlled the Bistrița valley during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries. Colonists played a significant role in the development of the town. Archaeological finds, some surface or semi-buried dwellings from the second half of the 15th century, suggest that Hungarians started to settle in the region after 1345–1347 when the territory was under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. They mainly occupied the flat banks of the river Bistrița. Discoveries of a type of 14th-century grey ceramic that has also been found in Northern Europe also suggests the presence of German colonists from the north. Originally the town focused around the Roman Catholic community that settled near a regular local market frequented by the population of the region on the lower reaches of the river.

The town was first mentioned in 1408 when Prince Alexander the Good of Moldavia (1400–1432) listed the customs points in the principality in his privilege for Polish merchants. The customs house in the town is mentioned in Old Church Slavonic as &quot;krainee mîto&quot; (&quot;the customs house by the edge&quot;) in the document which may indicate that it was the last customs stop before Moldavia&#x27;s border with Wallachia. 
An undated document reveals that the &quot;șoltuz&quot; in Bacău, that is the head of the town elected by its inhabitants, had the right to sentence felons to death, at least for robberies, which hints to an extended privilege, similar to the ones that royal towns in the Kingdom of Hungary enjoyed. Thus this right may have been granted to the community when the territory was under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. The seal of Bacău was oval which is exceptional in Moldavia where the seals of other towns were round.

Alexander the Good donated the wax collected as part of the tax payable by the town to the nearby Eastern Orthodox Bistrița Monastery. It was most probably his first wife named Margaret who founded the Franciscan Church of the Holy Virgin in Bacău. But the main Catholic church in the town was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. A letter written by John of Rya, the Catholic bishop of Baia refers to Bacău as a &quot;civitas&quot; which implies the existence of a Catholic bishopric in the town at that time. The letter also reveals that Hussite immigrants who had undergone persecutions in Bohemia, Moravia, or Hungary were settled in the town and granted privileges by Alexander the Good.

The monastery of Bistrița was also granted the income from the customs house of Bacău in 1439. In 1435 Stephen II of Moldavia (1433–1435, 1436–1447) requested the town&#x27;s judges not to hinder the merchants of Brașov, an important center of the Transylvanian Saxons in their movement.
From the 15th century &quot;ungureni&quot;, that is Romanians from Transylvania began to populate the area north of the marketplace where they would erect an Orthodox church after 1500. A small residence of the princes of Moldova was built in the town in the first half of the 15th century. It was rebuilt and extended under Stephen III the Great of Moldavia (1457–1504) who also erected an Orthodox church within it. But the rulers soon began to donate the neighboring villages that had thereto supplied their local household to monasteries or noblemen. Thus the local princely residence was abandoned after 1500.

The town was invaded and destroyed more than one time in the 15th and 16th centuries. For example, in 1467 King Matthias I of Hungary during his expedition against Stephen the Great set fire to all towns, among them Bacău in his path. The customs records of Brașov shows that few merchants from Bacău crossed the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania after 1500, and their merchandise had no particularly high value which suggests that the town was declining in this period.

The Catholic bishop of Argeș whose see in Wallachia had been destroyed by the Tatars moved to Bacău in 1597. From the early 17th century the bishops of Bacău were Polish priests who did not reside in the town, but in the Kingdom of Poland. They only travelled time to time to their see in order to collect the tithes.

According to Archbishop Marco Bandini&#x27;s report of the canonical visitation of 1646, the &quot;șoltuz&quot; in Bacău was elected among Hungarians one year, and another, among Romanians. The names of most of 12 inhabitants of the town recorded in 1655 also indicate that Hungarians still formed their majority group. In 1670 Archbishop Petrus Parcevic, the apostolic vicar of Moldavia concluded an agreement with the head of the Franciscan Province of Transylvania on the return of the Bacău monastery to them in order to ensure the spiritual welfare of the local Hungarian community. But the Polish bishop protested against the agreement and the Holy See also refused to ratify it.

Due to the frequent invasions by foreign armies and plundering by the Tatars in the 17th century, many of its Catholic inhabitants abandoned Bacău and took refuge in Transylvania. But in 1851 the Catholic congregation in the town still spoke, sang, and prayed in Hungarian.

The first paper mill in Moldavia was established in the town in 1851. The town was declared a municipality in 1968.

==Climate==
Bacău has a type of continental climate that falls short of permanent winter snow cover due days averaging above freezing. Winters are also quite dry in the area. Summers are quite rainy due to convection and temperatures are often hot due to its inland location. Due to its mid-latitude location surrounded by a vast landmass, Bacău has a large temperature amplitude by European standards. Since 1980, a record heat of and a record cold of have been measured, which is a net difference of .

==Politics==
The local authority in the city is split between the Mayor and the Local Council. Between 1950 and 1968 the city was governed by the Sfatul popular (People&#x27;s Council). It replaced the local Provisional Committee (), which functioned from 1948 to 1950, based on the Law of the People&#x27;s Councils, no. 17/1949.

==Demographics==
As of 2021 census data, Bacău has a population of 136,087, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.

At the 2011 census, Bacău had a population of 144,307, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census. The ethnic makeup was as follows:

* Romanians: 97.93%
* Roma: 0.92%
* Hungarians: 0.09%
* Jews: 0.03%
* Other: 0.34%

The Bacău metropolitan area, a project for the creation of an administrative unit to integrate Bacău with the nearby communes, would have a population of some 190,000.

== Transportation ==

The city is about North of Bucharest. It is served by George Enescu International Airport, located at , which provides direct links with the Romanian capital, Bucharest, and with several cities in Europe. Bacău air traffic control centre is one of Europe&#x27;s busiest, as it handles transiting flights between the Middle and Near East and South Asia to Europe and across the Atlantic.

The Bacău railway station (&quot;Gara Bacău&quot;) is one of the busiest in Romania; it has access to the Romanian railway main trunk number 500. Thus the city is connected to the main Romanian cities; the railway station is an important transit stop for international trains from Ukraine, Russia, and Bulgaria.

The city has access to the DN2 road (E85) that links it to the Romanian capital, Bucharest (to the South) and the cities of Suceava and Iași (to the North). The European route E574 is an important access road to Transylvania and the city of Brașov. The city is also located at the intersection of several national roads of secondary importance, and will be served in the future by the A7 motorway running from the border with Ukraine at Siret to Ploiești (junction with A3). As of 2020, this motorway intersects with the Bacău bypass (&quot;Centura Bacău&quot;).

== Culture ==
Bacău has a public university and several colleges. Two major Romanian poets, George Bacovia and Vasile Alecsandri were born here. The &quot;Mihail Jora&quot; Athenaeum and a Philharmonic Orchestra are located here, as well as the &quot;G. Bacovia&quot; Dramatic Theater and a Puppet Theater. Around Christmas every year, a Festival of Moldavian Winter Traditions takes place, reuniting folk artists from all the surrounding regions. The exhibition &quot;Saloanele Moldovei&quot; and the International Painting Camp at Tescani, near Bacău, reunite important plastic artists from Romania and from abroad.
The local History Museum, part of the Museum Complex &quot;Iulian Antonescu&quot; has an important collection of antique objects from ancient Dacia. The city also has an astronomical observatory, The Victor Anestin Astronomical Observatory.

==Jewish community==

The 1772-1774 Census registered 5 Jewish families, the 1820 Census registered 108 families. The 1852 Census registered 504 Jewish inhabitants. The 1930 Census registered 9424 Jewish inhabitants. The first mentions about Jewish inhabitants are from the beginning of the 18th century. The Register of Chevra Kadisha begins with the year 1774. The first leader of the Community is mentioned in 1794. The community was officially recognized in 1857.

Before World War I, the number of Jews was almost equal to that of Romanians in Bacău. According to the 1930 census, after some of the village population was in town, Bacău had 19,421 who have declared are Romanian, 9,424 declared Jews, 822 Hungarians and 406 German.

The first synagogue would be built in Bacău in 1820. In 1841 Jews who observe the Chabad Hasidic movement built another Sinagoga. In 1864 there were 14 functioning synagogues in Bacău. Among the most notable being Synagogue Burah Volf, Furriers Synagogue, Synagogue Alter Ionas and tanners. &quot;In 1880, in Bacău we had 21 synagogues and prayer houses. In 1916 we were active following synagogues Froim Aizic, Alter Leib, Itzik Leib Brill, Lipscani, the Tailors Young, coachmen, Shoemakers Synagogue, Cerealista, masonry, Rabbi Israel Synagogue, &quot;Brotherhood of Zion&quot; Snap Synagogue Saima Cofler itself and Der Mariesches SIL.

<text>NeXT Computer (also called the NeXT Computer System) is a workstation computer that was developed, marketed, and sold by NeXT Inc. It was introduced in October 1988 as the company&#x27;s first and flagship product, at a price of , aimed at the higher-education market. It was designed around the Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 floating-point coprocessor, with a clock speed of . Its NeXTSTEP operating system is based on the Mach microkernel and BSD-derived Unix, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end. According to the Science Museum Group, &quot;The enclosure consists of a 1-foot () die-cast magnesium cube-shaped black case, which led to the machine being informally referred to as &#x27;The Cube&#x27;.&quot;

The NeXT Computer was renamed NeXTcube in a later upgrade. The NeXTstation, a more affordable version of the NeXTcube, was released in 1990.

==Launch==

The NeXT Computer was launched in October 1988 at a lavish invitation-only event, &quot;NeXT Introduction – the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education&quot; at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The next day, selected educators and software developers were invited to attend—for a $100 registration fee—the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at an event called &quot;The NeXT Day&quot; at the San Francisco Hilton. It gave those interested in developing NeXT software an insight into the system&#x27;s software architecture and object-oriented programming. Steve Jobs was the luncheon&#x27;s speaker.

==Reception==

In 1989, &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine listed the NeXT Computer among the &quot;Excellence&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it showed &quot;what can be done when a personal computer is designed as a system, and not a collection of hardware elements&quot;. Citing as &quot;truly innovative&quot; the optical drive, DSP and object-oriented programming environment, it concluded that &quot;the NeXT Computer is worth every penny of its $6,500 market price&quot;. The workstation was not a significant commercial success, failing to reach the high-volume sales of the Apple II, Commodore 64, Mac, or IBM PC compatibles. This was mainly blamed on the computer&#x27;s substantial price, and the fact that there was not a great demand for the system outside of the higher-education market. Next Computers were mainly sold to universities, financial institutions, and government agencies.

==Legacy==
A NeXT Computer and its object-oriented development tools and libraries were used by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN to develop the world&#x27;s first web server (CERN httpd) and web browser (WorldWideWeb).

The NeXT platform was used by Jesse Tayler at Paget Press to develop the first electronic app store, called the Electronic AppWrapper, in the early 1990s. Issue #3 was first demonstrated to Steve Jobs at NeXTWorld Expo 1993.

Pioneering PC games &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Quake&quot; (with respective level editors) were developed by id Software on NeXT machines. &quot;Doom&quot; engine games such as &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Strife&quot; were also developed on NeXT hardware using id&#x27;s tools.

NeXT technology provisioned the first online food delivery system called CyberSlice, using GIS based geolocation, on which Steve Jobs performed the first online order of pizza with tomato and basil. CyberSlice was curated into the Inventions of the 20th Century, Computer Science at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="61618" wikidata="Q44501" url="?curid=61618" title="Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople">
<text>Bartholomew (; born 29 February 1940) is the current Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople since 2 November 1991. In accordance with his title, he is regarded as the &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals) in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and as a spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide.

Bartholomew was born as Dimitrios Arhondonis (, &quot;Dimítrios Archontónis&quot;), in the village of Agios Theodoros (officially called Zeytinliköy) on the island of Imbros (later renamed Gökçeada by the Turkish government). After his graduation, he held a position at the Patriarchal Theological Seminary of Halki, where he was ordained a priest. Later, he served as Metropolis of Philadelphia and Chalcedon and he became a member of the Holy Synod as well as other committees, prior to his enthronement as Patriarch.

Bartholomew&#x27;s tenure has been characterized by intra-Orthodox cooperation, intra-Christian and inter-religious dialogue, such as formal visits to Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, and Muslim leaders previously visited by a patriarch. He has exchanged numerous invitations with church and state dignitaries. His efforts to promote religious freedom and human rights, his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among the world&#x27;s religions, as well as his efforts to promote ecology and the protection of the environment, have been widely noted, and these endeavors have earned him the title &quot;The Green Patriarch&quot;. Among his many international positions, he currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute. In 2018, the Moscow Patriarchate broke communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a result of disputes over his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

== Early life and background ==
Dimitrios Arhondonis was born in the village of Agioi Theodoroi on the island of Imbros (now Gökçeada, Turkey), son of Christos and Meropi Archodónis (née Skarlatos), both of Greek descent. He was the fourth and last child and as a boy helped his father in his coffee shop that also doubled as a barber&#x27;s.

He began his studies at Imbro and went on to attend the Zografeion Lyceum high school in Istanbul, then entered the Theological School of Halki on the island of that name (Turkish: Heybeliada), in the Sea of Marmara. There he gained a doctorate in theology. On 13 August 1961, he was ordained deacon and in the years 1961–1963 completed military service in the Turkish army with the rank of sublieutenant. Following this, from 1963 to 1968, with a study bourse from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, he gained diplomas in postgraduate specialization at the Oriental Institute of the Gregorian University in Rome, the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey (Switzerland) and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Subsequently, he gained a doctorate from Rome&#x27;s Gregorian University with a thesis regarding the codification of the canons and canonical decrees in the Orthodox Church, perfecting also in these years his knowledge of Latin, Italian, French, English, and German.

=== Ordinations and ecclesiastical appointments ===
* 13 August 1961: Diaconate – receiving the ecclesiastical name Bartholomew
* 19 October 1969: Priesthood
* 25 December 1973: Episcopacy – Metropolis of Philadelphia (Asia Minor)
* 14 January 1990: Enthronement as metropolitan of Chalcedon
* 22 October 1991: Elected archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and ecumenical patriarch
* 2 November 1991: Enthronement in the Patriarchal Cathedral in the Phanar

== Patriarchate ==

As Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew has been particularly active internationally. One of his first focuses has been on rebuilding the once persecuted Eastern Orthodox churches of the former Eastern Bloc following the fall of Communism there in 1990. As part of this effort, he has worked to strengthen ties among the various national churches and patriarchates of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He has also continued the reconciliation dialogue with the Catholic Church started by his predecessors and initiated dialogue with other faiths, including other Christian Churches, Muslims, and Jews.

=== Environmentalism ===
He has also gained a reputation as a prominent environmentalist, putting the support of the Ecumenical Patriarchate behind various international environmental causes. This has earned him the nicknames of &quot;the Green Patriarch&quot; and &quot;the Green Pope&quot;, and in 2002 he was honored with the Sophie Prize for his contribution to environmentalism. He has also been honoured with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award which may be bestowed by the Legislative Branch of the United States government.

=== Turkey ===
In an interview published on 19 November 2006 in the daily newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, Bartholomew addressed the issues of religious freedom and the then upcoming papal trip of Pope Benedict XVI to Turkey. He also referred to the closing of the Halki seminary by saying: &quot;As Turkish citizens, we pay taxes. We serve in the military. We vote. As citizens we do everything. We want the same rights. But it does not happen... If Muslims want to study theology, there are 24 theology faculties. Where are we going to study?&quot; He also addressed the issue of his ecumenical title and it not being accepted by the Turkish government: &quot;We&#x27;ve had this title since the 6th century... The word ecumenical has no political content. [...] This title is the only thing that I insist on. I will never renounce this title&quot;.

=== Ecumenical dialogue ===
During his trip to Turkey in November 2006, Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Istanbul on the invitation of Bartholomew. The pope participated in the feast day services of St. Andrew the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. This was the third official visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate by a pope (the first being by Paul VI in 1967, and the second by John Paul II in 1979). He attended the papal inauguration of Pope Francis on 19 March 2013, paving the way for better Catholic–Orthodox relations. It was the first time that the spiritual head of Eastern Orthodox Christians had attended a papal inauguration since the Great Schism in 1054. After, he invited Pope Francis to travel with him to the Holy Land in 2014 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the embrace between Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople and Pope Paul VI. Pope Francis was also invited to the Patriarchate for the feast day of Saint Andrew (30 November).

It was after more than two decades as Ecumenical Patriarch, that Bartholomew was the target of an assassination plot which was planned to take place on 29 May 2013. One suspect was arrested and there is an ongoing search for two others.

=== Support of refugees, reunification and peace ===
On 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Pope Francis and Archbishop Hieronymus II, the Moria Refugee Camp in the island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. In December 2018, he visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone (KDZ) and prayed for permanent peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula.

=== Autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine ===

In October 2018 the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate agreed to grant autocephaly (self-governing) to the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and to revoke the legal binding of the letter of 1686 which led to the Russian Orthodox Church establishing jurisdiction over the all of Rus&#x27;s Church (including those located within borders of current Ukraine) and to lift the excommunications which affected clergy and faithful of two then unrecognized Orthodox churches in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP). In response to revoking a legal binding letter, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was cutting ties of communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which marked the beginning of the 2018 Moscow–Constantinople schism.

On 5 January 2019, Bartholomew granted autocephaly to the newly founded Orthodox Church of Ukraine by Canonical act.

=== Possession of Vatican Saint Peter Bone Fragments ===
On 2 July 2019, it was announced that Pope Francis had given Bartholomew possession of nine bone fragments believed to belong to Saint Peter and which were publicly displayed by Pope Francis in November 2013 during a Vatican &quot;Year of Faith&quot; Mass. Bartholomew, who also gained possession of the bronze reliquary in which they are displayed, described the Pope&#x27;s gesture as &quot;brave and bold&quot;.

=== Macedonian Orthodox Church ===
In 2022, the Ecumenical Patriarchate accepted the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Archdiocese of Ohrid into communion, recognised North Macedonia as a canonical jurisdiction.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Bartholomew has criticised both the Russian state and the Russian church for the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a crime of aggression and saying that it has caused enormous suffering both to the Ukrainian and the Russian people. In Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew&#x27;s opinion he says &quot;This is the theology that the sister Church of Russia began to teach, trying to justify an unjust, unholy, unprovoked, diabolical war against a sovereign and independent country – Ukraine&quot;.

<doc id="61619" wikidata="Q1135839" url="?curid=61619" title="Ghostscript">
<text>Ghostscript is a suite of software based on an interpreter for Adobe Systems&#x27; PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) page description languages. Its main purposes are the rasterization or rendering of such page description language files, for the display or printing of document pages, and the conversion between PostScript and PDF files.

== Features ==
Ghostscript can be used as a raster image processor (RIP) for raster computer printers—for instance, as an input filter of line printer daemon—or as the RIP engine behind PostScript and PDF viewers. It can also be used as a file format converter, such as PostScript to PDF converter. The codice_1 conversion program comes with the Ghostscript distribution.

Ghostscript can also serve as the back-end for PDF to raster image (png, tiff, jpeg, etc.) converter; this is often combined with a PostScript printer driver in &quot;virtual printer&quot; PDF creators. As it takes the form of a language interpreter, Ghostscript can also be used as a general purpose programming environment.

Ghostscript has been ported to many operating systems, including Unix-like systems, classic Mac OS, OpenVMS, Microsoft Windows, Plan 9, MS-DOS, FreeDOS, OS/2, ArcaOS, Atari TOS, RISC OS and AmigaOS.

== History ==
Ghostscript was originally written by L. Peter Deutsch for the GNU Project, and released under the GNU General Public License in 1988. At the time of the initial release there was a similar commercial software product named GoScript from LaserGo. Later, Deutsch formed &quot;Aladdin Enterprises&quot; to dual-license Ghostscript also under a proprietary license with an own development fork: &quot;Aladdin Ghostscript&quot; under the Aladdin Free Public License (which, despite the name, is not a free software license, as it forbids commercial distribution) and &quot;GNU Ghostscript&quot; distributed with the &quot;GNU General Public License&quot;. With version 8.54 in 2006, both development branches were merged again, and dual-licensed releases were still provided.

Ghostscript is currently owned by Artifex Software and maintained by Artifex Software employees and the worldwide user community. According to Artifex, as of version 9.03, the commercial version of Ghostscript can no longer be freely distributed for commercial purposes without purchasing a license, though the (A)GPL variant allows commercial distribution provided all code using it is released under the (A)GPL.

In February 2013, with version 9.07, Ghostscript changed its license from GPLv3 to GNU AGPL. which raised license compatibility questions, for example by Debian.

Starting with release 9.55.0 Ghostscript has two built-in PDF interpreters. Until spring 2022, up to Ghostscript version 9.56.1, the default PDF interpreters implementation itself was coded in PostScript. The new default PDF interpreter has been rewritten in C entirely, and is faster and more secure than its predecessor, while its interface and graphics library have not changed. Scripting the new C written PDF interpreter from PostScript is still possible.

== Free fonts ==
There are several sets of free fonts supplied for Ghostscript, intended to be metrically compatible with common fonts attached with the PostScript standard. These include:
* A collection of 35 font styles from 10 typeface families contributed by German foundry URW++ in 1996 under the GPL and AFPL, which is therefore commonly called the URW Base 35 fonts or URW Core 35 fonts. The collection is similar to the 35 fonts defined by Adobe in PostScript Level 2: Bookman L (Bookman), Century Schoolbook L (New Century Schoolbook), Chancery L (Zapf Chancery), Dingbats (Zapf Dingbats), Gothic L (Avant Garde), Nimbus Mono L (Courier), Nimbus Roman No9 L (Times), Nimbus Sans L (Helvetica), Palladio L (Palatino), Standard Symbols L (Symbol), in Type1, TrueType, and OpenType formats.
*The GhostPDL package (including Ghostscript as well as companion implementations of HP PCL and Microsoft XPS) includes additional fonts under the AFPL which bars commercial use. It includes URW++ versions of Garamond (Garamond No. 8), Optima (URW Classico), Arial (A030), Antique Olive, and Univers (U001), Clarendon, Coronet, Letter Gothic, as well as URW Mauritius and a modified form of Albertus known as A028. Combined with the base set, they represent a little more than half of the standard PostScript 3 font complement.
* A miscellaneous set including Cyrillic, kana, and fonts derived from the free Hershey fonts, with improvements by Thomas Wolff (such as adding accented characters).

The Ghostscript fonts were developed in the PostScript Type 1 format but have been converted into the TrueType format. As a result, a user can install and use the Ghostscript fonts via most modern software. Furthermore, the Ghostscript fonts are used as parts of various open source applications, e.g., the Linux version of GIMP depends on Graphviz which in turn depends on the Ghostscript fonts. Finally, multiple open source font projects used glyphs from the Ghostscript fonts, e.g., the Latin characters of GNU FreeFont are based on Nimbus Mono L, Nimbus Roman No9 L, and Nimbus Sans L. The TeX Gyre fonts are also based on 8 out of the 10 original Ghostscript typeface families. The Garamond font has additionally been improved upon.

<text>Houston Street ( ) is a major east–west thoroughfare in Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. It runs the full width of the island of Manhattan, from FDR Drive along the East River in the east to the West Side Highway along the Hudson River in the west. The street is divided into west and east sections by Broadway.

Houston Street generally serves as the boundary between neighborhoods on the East Side of Manhattan—Alphabet City, the East Village, NoHo, Greenwich Village, and the West Village to the north; and the Lower East Side, most of the Bowery, Nolita, and SoHo to the south. The numeric street-naming grid in Manhattan, created as part of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, begins immediately north of Houston Street with 1st Street at Avenue A.

The street&#x27;s name is pronounced &quot; (), in contrast to the city of Houston, Texas, whose name is pronounced &quot; (). The street was named for William Houstoun, whose surname was pronounced &quot;&quot;, while the city was named for Sam Houston.

==Description==
At its east end, Houston Street meets FDR Drive in an interchange at East River Park. West of FDR Drive, it intersects with Avenue D. Further west, other streets, including First Avenue, the Bowery, Lafayette Street and Broadway, intersect Houston Street. The Broadway intersection is the division point between East Houston Street and West Houston Street. Sixth Avenue intersects Houston Street at a curve in the road in Greenwich Village. East of Sixth Avenue, Houston street is bidirectional and separated by a median; west of Sixth, the street is narrower and unidirectional westbound. West Houston Street terminates at an intersection with West Street near Pier 40 on the Hudson River.

==History==
Houston Street is named for William Houstoun, who was a delegate from the state of Georgia to the Continental Congress from 1784 through 1786 and to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The street was christened by Nicholas Bayard (b. 1736), whose daughter, Mary, was married to Houstoun in 1788. The couple met while Houstoun, a member of an ancient and aristocratic Scottish family, was serving in the Congress. Bayard cut the street through a tract he owned in the vicinity of Canal Street in which he lived, and the city later extended it to include North Street, the northern border of New York&#x27;s east side at the beginning of the 19th century.

The current spelling of the name is a corruption: the street appears as &quot;Houstoun&quot; in the city&#x27;s Common Council minutes for 1808 and the official map drawn in 1811 to establish the street grid that is still current. In those years, the Texas hero Sam Houston, for whom the street is sometimes incorrectly said to have been named, was an unknown teenager in Tennessee. Also mistaken is the explanation that the name derives from the Dutch words &quot;huis&quot; for &quot;house&quot; and &quot;tuin&quot; for &quot;garden.&quot; The narrow, westernmost stretch of the current Houston Street, from Sixth Avenue to the West Side Highway, was known as &quot;Hammersley Street&quot; (also spelled &quot;Hamersly Street&quot;) until the middle 19th century, and was inside Greenwich Village. It later came to be regarded as the Village&#x27;s southern boundary.

In 1891, Nikola Tesla established his laboratory on Houston Street. Much of Tesla&#x27;s research was lost in an 1895 fire.

The street, originally narrow, was markedly widened from Sixth Avenue to Essex Street in the early 1930s during construction of the Independent Subway System&#x27;s Sixth Avenue Line. The street widening involved demolition of buildings on both sides of the street, resulting in numerous small, empty lots. Although some of these lots have been redeveloped, many of them are now used by vendors, and some have been turned into playgrounds and, more recently, community gardens.

Lower Manhattan&#x27;s SoHo district takes its name from an acronym for &quot;South of Houston&quot;, as the street serves as SoHo&#x27;s northern boundary; another, narrower neighborhood north of Houston Street is correspondingly called NoHo.

In 1971, Houston Street became the southernmost street in Manhattan to extend between both the Hudson and East Rivers, when the World Trade Center was constructed and deprived Fulton Street of that title. With the reconstruction of the World Trade Center, Fulton Street was extended past Church Street to West Street, but is closed off to vehicular traffic west of Church Street.

A reconstruction project rebuilt parts of the street between 2005 and 2018.

==Transportation==
, Houston Street is served by the New York City Bus route from Columbia to Washington Streets westbound, and from 6th Avenue to the FDR Drive eastbound. The bus route itself had replaced an earlier streetcar line, which is now the between Avenues A and C. Additional service is provided by the eastbound east of Avenue D and the downtown from Second Avenue to Allen Street. The does not make any stops on Houston Street.

A portion of the New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Sixth Avenue Line runs under Houston Street, between Sixth Avenue to just before Avenue A; there are stations at Second Avenue () and Broadway – Lafayette Street (). Additionally, there is a station at Seventh Avenue, for the Houston Street (). The Bleecker Street station () has station entrances on the north side of Houston Street, due to its connection with the Broadway – Lafayette Street station as part of a larger station complex.

Exit 5 on the FDR Drive is on Houston Street. The street also connects directly with the West Side Highway; however, by then, Houston Street is westbound-only.

<doc id="61622" wikidata="Q18192578" url="?curid=61622" title="List of architectural styles">
<text>An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as , method of construction, building materials, and regional character. Most architecture can be classified as a chronology of styles which change over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of architectural history. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through colonialism, either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, classicism has been revived many times and found new life as neoclassicism. Each time it is revived, it is different.

Vernacular architecture works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.

==Chronology of styles==
===Prehistoric===
Early civilizations developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.

===Early Modern Period and European Colonialism===

1425–1660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God. The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.

In the Eastern Bloc the Communists rejected the Western Bloc&#x27;s &#x27;decadent&#x27; ways, and modernism developed in a markedly more bureaucratic, sombre, and monumental fashion.

<text>Halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous-tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size or in spacing, thus generating a gradient-like effect. &quot;Halftone&quot; can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.

Where continuous-tone imagery contains an infinite range of colors or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (pulse-width modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation) or both. This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: when the halftone dots are small, the human eye interprets the patterned areas as if they were smooth tones. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of continuous tones. For details, see film grain.

Just as color photography evolved with the addition of filters and film layers, color printing is made possible by repeating the halftone process for each subtractive color – most commonly using what is called the &quot;CMYK color model&quot;. The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create another optical effect: full-color imagery. Since the location of the individual dots cannot be determined exactly, the dots partially overlap leading to a combination of additive and subtractive color mixing called &quot;autotypical color mixing&quot;.

==History==
While there were earlier mechanical printing processes that could imitate the tone and subtle details of a photograph, most notably the Woodburytype, expense and practicality prohibited their being used in mass commercial printing that used relief printing. 

Previously most newspaper pictures were woodcuts or wood-engravings made from hand-carved blocks of wood that, while they were often copied from photographs, resembled hand drawn sketches. Commercial printers wanted a practical way to realistically reproduce photographs onto the printed page, but most common mechanical printing processes can only print areas of ink or leave blank areas on the paper and not a photographic range of tones; only black (or coloured) ink, or nothing. The half-tone process overcame these limitations and became the staple of the book, newspaper and other periodical industry.

William Fox Talbot is credited with the idea of halftone printing. In an 1852 patent he suggested using &quot;photographic screens or veils&quot; in connection with a photographic intaglio process.

Several different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades. One of the first attempts was by William Leggo with his leggotype while working for the &quot;Canadian Illustrated News&quot;. The first printed halftone photograph was an image of Prince Arthur published on October 30, 1869. The &quot;New York Daily Graphic&quot; would later publish &quot;the first reproduction of a photograph with a full tonal range in a newspaper&quot; on March 4, 1880 (entitled &quot;A Scene in Shantytown&quot;) with a crude halftone screen.

The first truly successful commercial method was patented by Frederic Ives of Philadelphia in 1881. Although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes, he did not make use of a screen. In 1882, the German patented a halftone process in Germany which he named . His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve any commercial success with relief halftones.

Shortly afterwards, Ives, this time in collaboration with Louis and Max Levy, improved the process further with the invention and commercial production of quality cross-lined screens.

The relief halftone process proved almost immediately to be a success. The use of halftone blocks in popular journals became regular during the early 1890s.

The development of halftone printing methods for lithography appears to have followed a largely independent path. In the 1860s, A. Hoen &amp; Co. focused on methods allowing artists to manipulate the tones of hand-worked printing stones. By the 1880s, Hoen was working on halftone methods that could be used in conjunction with either hand-worked or photolithographic stones.

==Halftone photographic screening==
Prior to digitised images, special photographic techniques were developed to break grayscale images down into discrete points. The earliest of these was &quot;screening&quot; where a coarse-woven fabric screen was suspended before the camera plate to be exposed, breaking the incoming light into a pattern of dots via a combination of interruption and diffraction effects. The photographic plate could then be developed using photo-etching techniques to create a printing plate.

Other techniques used a &quot;screen&quot; consisting of parallel bars (a Ronchi ruling), which was then combined with a second exposure with the same screen oriented at another angle. Another method was to expose through a screen-plate with crossing lines etched into the surface. Later, either photographic contact screens were used, or sometimes no screen at all, exposing directly on a lithographic (extremely high contrast) film with a pre-exposed halftone pattern.

==Traditional halftoning==

===Resolution of halftone screens===

The resolution of a halftone screen is measured in lines per inch (lpi). This is the number of lines of dots in one inch, measured parallel with the screen&#x27;s angle. Known as the screen ruling, the resolution of a screen is written either with the suffix lpi or a hash mark; for example, &quot;150 lpi&quot; or &quot;150#&quot;.

The higher the pixel resolution of a source file, the greater the detail that can be reproduced. However, such increase also requires a corresponding increase in screen ruling or the output will suffer from posterization. Therefore, file resolution is matched to the output resolution. The dots cannot easily be seen by the naked eye, but can be discerned through a microscope or a magnifying glass.

===Multiple screens and color halftoning===

When different screens are combined, a number of distracting visual effects can occur, including the edges being overly emphasized, as well as a moiré pattern. This problem can be reduced by rotating the screens in relation to each other. This &quot;screen angle&quot; is another common measurement used in printing, measured in degrees clockwise from a line running to the left (9 o&#x27;clock is zero degrees). These angles are optimized to avoid patterns and reduce overlap, which can cause colors to look dimmer.

Halftoning is also commonly used for printing color pictures. The general idea is the same, by varying the density of the four secondary printing colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (abbreviation CMYK), any particular shade can be reproduced.

In this case there is an additional problem that can occur. In the simple case, one could create a halftone using the same techniques used for printing shades of grey, but in this case the different printing colors have to remain physically close to each other to fool the eye into thinking they are a single color. To do this the industry has standardized on a set of known angles, which result in the dots forming into small circles or rosettes.

===Dot shapes===
Though round dots are the most commonly used, many dot types are available, each having its own characteristics. They can be used simultaneously to avoid the moiré effect. Generally, the preferred dot shape is also dependent on the printing method or the printing plate.

*Round dots: most common, suitable for light images, especially for skin tones. They meet at a tonal value of 70%.
*Elliptical dots: appropriate for images with many objects. Elliptical dots meet at the tonal values 40% (pointed ends) and 60% (long side), so there is a risk of a pattern.
*Square dots: best for detailed images, not recommended for skin tones. The corners meet at a tonal value of 50%. The transition between the square dots can sometimes be visible to the human eye.

==Digital halftoning==
Digital halftoning has been replacing photographic halftoning since the 1970s when &quot;electronic dot generators&quot; were developed for the film recorder units linked to color drum scanners made by companies such as Crosfield Electronics, Hell, and Linotype-Paul.

In the 1980s, halftoning became available in the new generation of imagesetter film and paper recorders that had been developed from earlier &quot;laser typesetters&quot;. Unlike pure scanners or pure typesetters, imagesetters could generate all the elements in a page including type, photographs, and other graphic objects. Early examples were the widely used Linotype Linotronic 300 and 100 introduced in 1984, which were also the first to offer PostScript RIPs in 1985.

Early laser printers from the late 1970s onward could also generate halftones but their original 300 dpi resolution limited the screen ruling to about 65 lpi. This was improved as higher resolutions of 600 dpi and above, and dithering techniques, were introduced.

All halftoning uses a high-frequency/low-frequency dichotomy. In photographic halftoning, the low-frequency attribute is a local area of the output image designated a halftone cell. Each equal-sized cell relates to a corresponding area (size and location) of the continuous-tone input image. Within each cell, the high-frequency attribute is a centered variable-sized halftone dot composed of ink or toner. The ratio of the inked area to the non-inked area of the output cell corresponds to the luminance or graylevel of the input cell. From a suitable distance, the human eye averages both the high-frequency apparent gray level approximated by the ratio within the cell and the low-frequency apparent changes in gray level between adjacent equally spaced cells and centered dots.

Digital halftoning uses a raster image or bitmap within which each monochrome picture element or pixel may be on or off, ink or no ink. Consequently, to emulate the photographic halftone cell, the digital halftone cell must contain groups of monochrome pixels within the same-sized cell area. The fixed location and size of these monochrome pixels compromises the high-frequency/low-frequency dichotomy of the photographic halftone method. Clustered multi-pixel dots cannot &quot;grow&quot; incrementally but in jumps of one whole pixel. In addition, the placement of that pixel is slightly off-center. To minimize this compromise, the digital halftone monochrome pixels must be quite small, numbering from 600 to 2,540, or more, pixels per inch. However, digital image processing has also enabled more sophisticated dithering algorithms to decide which pixels to turn black or white, some of which yield better results than digital halftoning. Digital halftoning based on some modern image processing tools such as nonlinear diffusion and stochastic flipping has also been proposed recently.

===Modulation===
The most common method of creating screens, amplitude modulation, produces a regular grid of dots that vary in size. The other method of creating screens, frequency modulation, is used in a process also known as stochastic screening. Both modulation methods are named by analogy with the use of the terms in telecommunications.

==Inverse halftoning==
Inverse halftoning or descreening is the process of reconstructing high-quality continuous-tone images from the halftone version. Inverse halftoning is an ill-posed problem because different source images can produce the same halftone image. Consequently, one halftone image has multiple plausible reconstructions. Additionally, information like tones and details are discarded during halftoning and thus irrecoverably lost. Due to the variety of different halftone patterns, it is not always obvious which algorithm to use for the best quality.

There are many situations where reconstruction is desired. For artists, it is a challenging task to edit halftone images. Even simple modifications like altering the brightness usually work by changing the color tones. In halftone images, this additionally requires preservation of the regular pattern. The same applies to more complex tools like retouching. Many other image processing techniques are designed to operate on continuous-tone images. For example, image compression algorithms are more efficient for those images. Another reason is the visual aspect since halftoning degrades the quality of an image. Sudden tone changes of the original image are removed due to the limited tone variations in halftoned images. It can also introduce distortions and visual effects like moiré patterns. Especially when printed on newspaper, the halftone pattern becomes more visible due to the paper properties. By scanning and reprinting these images moiré patterns are emphasized. Thus, reconstructing them before reprinting is important to provide a reasonable quality.

===Spatial and frequency filtering===

The main steps of the procedure are the removal of halftone patterns and reconstruction of tone changes. In the end, it may be necessary to recover details to improve image quality. There are many halftoning algorithms which can be mostly classified into the categories ordered dithering, error diffusion, and optimization-based methods. It is important to choose a proper descreening strategy since they generate different patterns and most of the inverse halftoning algorithms are designed for a particular type of pattern. Time is another selection criteria because many algorithms are iterative and therefore rather slow.

The most straightforward way to remove the halftone patterns is the application of a low-pass filter either in spatial or frequency domain. A simple example is a Gaussian filter. It discards the high-frequency information which blurs the image and simultaneously reduces the halftone pattern. This is similar to the blurring effect of our eyes when viewing a halftone image. In any case, it is important to pick a proper bandwidth. A too-limited bandwidth blurs edges out, while a high bandwidth produces a noisy image because it does not remove the pattern completely. Due to this trade-off, it is not able to reconstruct reasonable edge information.

Further improvements can be achieved with edge enhancement. Decomposing the halftone image into its wavelet representation allows to pick information from different frequency bands. Edges are usually consisting of highpass energy. By using the extracted highpass information, it is possible to treat areas around edges differently to emphasize them while keeping lowpass information among smooth regions.

===Optimization-based filtering===

Another possibility for inverse halftoning is the usage of machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks. These learning-based approaches can find the descreening technique that gets as close as possible to the perfect one. The idea is to use different strategies depending on the actual halftone image. Even for different content within the same image, the strategy should be varied. Convolutional neural networks are well-suited for tasks like object detection which allows a category based descreening. Additionally, they can do edge detection to enhance the details around edge areas. The results can be further improved by generative adversarial networks. This type of network can artificially generate content and recover lost details. However, these methods are limited by the quality and completeness of the used training data. Unseen halftoning patterns which were not represented in the training data are rather hard to remove. Additionally, the learning process can take some time. By contrast, computing the inverse halftoning image is fast compared to other iterative methods because it requires only a single computational step.

===Lookup table===
Unlike other approaches, the lookup table method does not involve any filtering. It works by computing a distribution of the neighborhood for every pixel in the halftone image. The lookup table provides a continuous-tone value for a given pixel and its distribution. The corresponding lookup table is obtained before using histograms of halftone images and their corresponding originals. The histograms provide the distribution before and after halftoning and make it possible to approximate the continuous-tone value for a specific distribution in the halftone image. For this approach, the halftoning strategy has to be known in advance for choosing a proper lookup table. Additionally, the table needs to be recomputed for every new halftoning pattern. Generating the descreened image is fast compared to iterative methods because it requires a lookup per pixel.

<doc id="61626" wikidata="Q353633" url="?curid=61626" title="Gersonides">
<text>Levi ben Gershon (1288 – 20 April 1344), better known by his Graecized name as Gersonides, or by his Latinized name Magister Leo Hebraeus, or in Hebrew by the abbreviation of first letters as RaLBaG, was a medieval French Jewish philosopher, Talmudist, mathematician, physician and astronomer/astrologer. He was born at Bagnols in Languedoc, France. According to Abraham Zacuto and others, he was the son of Gerson ben Solomon Catalan.

==Biography==
As in the case of the other medieval Jewish philosophers, little is known of his life. His family had been distinguished for piety and exegetical skill in Talmud, but though he was known in the Jewish community by commentaries on certain books of the Bible, he never seems to have accepted any rabbinical post. It has been suggested that the uniqueness of his opinions may have put obstacles in the way of his advancement to a higher position or office. He is known to have been at Avignon and Orange during his life, and is believed to have died in 1344, though Zacuto asserts that he died at Perpignan in 1370.

Gersonides is known for his unorthodox views and rigid Aristotelianism, which eventually led him to rationalize many of the miracles in the Bible. His commentary on the Bible was sharply criticized by the most prominent scholars, such as Abarbanel, Chisdai Crescas, and Rivash, the latter accusing him of heresy and almost banning his works.

==Philosophical and religious works==

Part of his writings consist of commentaries on the portions of Aristotle then known, or rather of commentaries on the commentaries of Averroes. Some of these are printed in the early Latin editions of Aristotle&#x27;s works. His most important treatise, that by which he has a place in the history of philosophy, is entitled &quot;Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem&quot;, (&quot;The Wars of the Lord&quot;), and occupied twelve years in composition (1317–1329). A portion of it, containing an elaborate survey of astronomy as known to the Arabs, was translated into Latin in 1342 at the request of Pope Clement VI.

&quot;The Wars of the Lord&quot; is modeled after the plan of the great work of Jewish philosophy, the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; of Maimonides. It may be regarded as a criticism of some elements of Maimonides&#x27; syncretism of Aristotelianism and rabbinic Jewish thought. Ralbag&#x27;s treatise strictly adhered to Aristotelian thought. The &quot;Wars of the Lord&quot; review:

:1. the doctrine of the soul, in which Gersonides defends the theory of impersonal reason as mediating between God and man, and explains the formation of the higher reason (or acquired intellect, as it was called) in humanity—his view being thoroughly realist and resembling that of Avicebron;
:2. prophecy;
:3. and 4. God&#x27;s knowledge of facts and providence, in which is advanced the theory that God does not decide individual facts. While there is general providence for all, special providence only extends to those whose reason has been enlightened;
:5. celestial substances, treating of the strange spiritual hierarchy which the Jewish philosophers of the middle ages accepted from the Neoplatonists and the pseudo-Dionysius, and also giving, along with astronomical details, much of astrological theory; and
:6. creation and miracles, in respect to which Gersonides deviates widely from the position of Maimonides.

Gersonides was also the author of commentaries on the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, I &amp; II Samuel, I &amp; II Kings, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles. He makes reference to a commentary on Isaiah, but it is not extant.

===Views on God and omniscience===
In contrast to the theology held by other Jewish thinkers, Jewish theologian Louis Jacobs argues, Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. &quot;Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God&#x27;s foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, holds that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.&quot;

Another neoclassical Jewish proponent of self-limited omniscience was Abraham ibn Daud. &quot;Whereas the earlier Jewish philosophers extended the omniscience of God to include the free acts of man, and had argued that human freedom of decision was not affected by God&#x27;s foreknowledge of its results, Ibn Daud, evidently following Alexander of Aphrodisias, excludes human action from divine foreknowledge. God, he holds, limited his omniscience even as He limited His omnipotence in regard to human acts&quot;.

:The view that God does not have foreknowledge of moral decisions which was advanced by ibn Daud and Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom) is not quite as isolated as Rabbi Bleich indicates, and it enjoys the support of two highly respected Acharonim, Rabbi Yeshayahu Horowitz (&quot;Shelah haKadosh&quot;) and Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar (&quot;Or haHayim haKadosh&quot;). The former takes the views that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but this does not impair His perfection. The latter considers that God could know the future if He wished, but deliberately refrains from using this ability in order to avoid the conflict with free will.

Rabbi Yeshayahu Horowitz explained the apparent paradox of his position by citing the old question, &quot;Can God create a rock so heavy that He cannot pick it up?&quot; He said that we cannot accept free choice as a creation of God&#x27;s, and simultaneously question its logical compatibility with omnipotence.

See further discussion in &quot;Free will in Jewish thought&quot;.

===Views of the afterlife===
Gersonides posits that people&#x27;s souls are composed of two parts: a material, or human, intellect; and an acquired, or agent, intellect. The material intellect is inherent in every person, and gives people the capacity to understand and learn. This material intellect is mortal, and dies with the body. However, he also posits that the soul also has an acquired intellect. This survives death, and can contain the accumulated knowledge that the person acquired during his lifetime. For Gersonides, Seymour Feldman points out, Man is immortal insofar as he attains the intellectual perfection that is open to him. This means that man becomes immortal only if and to the extent that he acquires knowledge of what he can in principle know, e.g. mathematics and the natural sciences. This knowledge survives his bodily death and constitutes his immortality.

===Talmudic works===
Gersonides was the author of the following Talmudic and halakhic works: 
*&quot;Shaarei Tsedek&quot; (published at Leghorn, 1800): a commentary on the thirteen halachic rules of Rabbi Yishmael;
*&quot;Mechokek Safun&quot;, an interpretation of the aggadic material in the fifth chapter of Tractate &quot;Bava Basra&quot;;
*A commentary to tractate &quot;Berachos&quot;;
*two responsa.
Only the first work is extant.

==Works in mathematics and astronomy/astrology==
Gersonides was the first to make a number of major mathematical and scientific advances, though since he wrote only in Hebrew and few of his writings were translated to other languages, his influence on non-Jewish thought was limited.

Gersonides wrote &quot;Maaseh Hoshev&quot; in 1321 dealing with arithmetical operations including extraction of square and cube roots, various algebraic identities, certain sums including sums of consecutive integers, squares, and cubes, binomial coefficients, and simple combinatorial identities. The work is notable for its early use of proof by mathematical induction, and pioneering work in combinatorics. The title Maaseh Hoshev literally means the Work of the thinker, but it is also a pun on a biblical phrase meaning &quot;clever work&quot;. Maaseh Hoshev is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Sefer Hamispar (The Book of Number), which is an earlier and less sophisticated work by Rabbi Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra (1090–1167). In 1342, Gersonides wrote &quot;On Sines, Chords and Arcs&quot;, which examined trigonometry, in particular proving the sine law for plane triangles and giving five-figure sine tables.

One year later, at the request of the bishop of Meaux, he wrote &quot;The Harmony of Numbers&quot; in which he considers a problem of Philippe de Vitry involving so-called &quot;harmonic numbers&quot;, which have the form 2&quot;m&quot;·3&quot;n&quot;. The problem was to characterize all pairs of harmonic numbers differing by 1. Gersonides proved that there are only four such pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) and (8,9).

He is also credited to have invented the Jacob&#x27;s staff, an instrument to measure the angular distance between celestial objects. It is described as consisting 

Gersonides observed a solar eclipse on March 3, 1337. After he had observed this event he proposed a new theory of the sun which he proceeded to test by further observations. Another eclipse observed by Gersonides was the eclipse of the Moon on 3 October 1335. He described a geometrical model for the motion of the Moon and made other astronomical observations of the Moon, Sun and planets using a camera obscura. Some of his beliefs were well wide of the truth, such as his belief that the Milky Way was on the sphere of the fixed stars and shines by the reflected light of the Sun. 

Gersonides was also the earliest known mathematician to have used the technique of mathematical induction in a systematic and self-conscious fashion and anticipated Galileo&#x27;s error theory.

The lunar crater Rabbi Levi is named after him.

Gersonides believed that astrology was real, and developed a naturalistic, non-supernatural explanation of how it works. Julius Guttman explained that for Gersonides, astrology was:

===Estimation of stellar distances and refutation of Ptolemy&#x27;s model===
Gersonides appears to be the only astronomer before modern times to have surmised that the fixed stars are much further away than the planets. Whereas all other astronomers put the fixed stars on a rotating sphere just beyond the outer planets, Gersonides estimated the distance to the fixed stars to be no less than 159,651,513,380,944 earth radii, or about 100,000 lightyears in modern units.

Using data he collected from his own observations, Gersonides refuted Ptolemy&#x27;s model in what the notable physicist Yuval Ne&#x27;eman has considered as &quot;one of the most important insights in the history of science, generally missed in telling the story of the transition from epicyclic corrections to the geocentric model to Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric model&quot;. Ne&#x27;eman argued that after Gersonides reviewed Ptolemy&#x27;s model with its epicycles he realized that it could be checked, by measuring the changes in the apparent brightnesses of Mars and looking for cyclical changes along the conjectured epicycles. These thus ceased being dogma, they were a theory that had to be experimentally verified, &quot;à la Popper&quot;. Gersonides developed tools for these measurements, essentially pinholes and the camera obscura.

The results of his observations did not fit Ptolemy&#x27;s model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve on it. That challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus and Kepler three centuries later, but Gersonides was the first to falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Gersonides also showed that Ptolemy&#x27;s model for the lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon&#x27;s position, fails completely in predicting the apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the findings influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides&#x27; writings were translated and available.

==In modern fiction==
Gersonides is an important character in the novel &quot;The Dream of Scipio&quot; by Iain Pears, where he is depicted as the mentor of the protagonist Olivier de Noyen, a non-Jewish poet and intellectual. A (fictional) encounter between Gersonides and Pope Clement VI at Avignon during the Black Death is a major element in the book&#x27;s plot.
