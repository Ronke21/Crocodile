<text>Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (; ; anglicized as Roentgen; 27 March 184510 February 1923) was a German physicist who produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range known as X-rays. As a result of this discovery, he became the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.

==Biographical history==
===Education===
He was born to Friedrich Conrad Röntgen, a German merchant and cloth manufacturer, and Charlotte Constanze Frowein. When he was aged three, his family moved to the Netherlands, where his mother&#x27;s family lived. Röntgen attended high school at Utrecht Technical School in Utrecht, Netherlands. He followed courses at the Technical School for almost two years. In 1865, he was unfairly expelled from high school when one of his teachers intercepted a caricature of one of the teachers, which was drawn by someone else.

Without a high school diploma, Röntgen could only attend university in the Netherlands as a visitor. In 1865, he tried to attend Utrecht University without having the necessary credentials required for a regular student. Upon hearing that he could enter the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zürich (today known as the ETH Zurich), he passed the entrance examination and began his studies there as a student of mechanical engineering. In 1869, he graduated with a PhD from the University of Zurich; once there, he became a favourite student of Professor August Kundt, whom he followed to the newly founded German &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität&quot; in Strasbourg. 

===Career===
In 1874, Röntgen became a lecturer at the University of Strasbourg. In 1875, he became a professor at the Academy of Agriculture at Hohenheim, Württemberg. He returned to Strasbourg as a professor of physics in 1876, and in 1879, he was appointed to the chair of physics at the University of Giessen. In 1888, he obtained the physics chair at the University of Würzburg, and in 1900 at the University of Munich, by special request of the Bavarian government.

Röntgen had family in Iowa in the United States and planned to emigrate. He accepted an appointment at Columbia University in New York City and bought transatlantic tickets, before the outbreak of World War I changed his plans. He remained in Munich for the rest of his career.

===Discovery of X-rays ===
During 1895, at his laboratory in the Würzburg Physical Institute of the University of Würzburg, Röntgen was investigating the external effects of passing an electrical discharge through various types of vacuum tube equipment—apparatuses from Heinrich Hertz, Johann Hittorf, William Crookes, Nikola Tesla and Philipp von Lenard In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard&#x27;s tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. Röntgen knew that the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet he observed that the invisible cathode rays caused a fluorescent effect on a small cardboard screen painted with barium platinocyanide when it was placed close to the aluminium window. It occurred to Röntgen that the Crookes–Hittorf tube, which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect.

In the late afternoon of 8 November 1895, Röntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering similar to the one he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes–Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a Ruhmkorff coil to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, Röntgen darkened the room to test the opacity of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare for the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that Röntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench a few feet away from the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next.

Based on the formation of regular shadows, Röntgen termed the phenomenon &quot;rays&quot;. As 8 November was a Friday, he took advantage of the weekend to repeat his experiments and made his first notes. In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed &quot;X-rays&quot;, using the mathematical designation (&quot;X&quot;) for something unknown. The new rays came to bear his name in many languages as &quot;Röntgen rays&quot; (and the associated X-ray radiograms as &quot;Röntgenograms&quot;).

At one point, while he was investigating the ability of various materials to stop the rays, Röntgen brought a small piece of lead into position while a discharge was occurring. Röntgen thus saw the first radiographic image: his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium platinocyanide screen. 

About six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture—a radiograph—using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha&#x27;s hand. When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed &quot;I have seen my death!&quot; He later took a better picture of his friend Albert von Kölliker&#x27;s hand at a public lecture.

Röntgen&#x27;s original paper, &quot;On A New Kind of Rays&quot; (&quot;Ueber eine neue Art von Strahlen&quot;), was published on 28 December 1895. On 5 January 1896, an Austrian newspaper reported Röntgen&#x27;s discovery of a new type of radiation. Röntgen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Würzburg after his discovery. He also received the Rumford Medal of the British Royal Society in 1896, jointly with Philipp Lenard, who had already shown that a portion of the cathode rays could pass through a thin film of a metal such as aluminium. Röntgen published a total of three papers on X-rays between 1895 and 1897. Today, Röntgen is considered the father of diagnostic radiology, the medical speciality which uses imaging to diagnose disease.

===Personal life===

Röntgen was married to Anna Bertha Ludwig for 47 years until her death in 1919 at the age of 80. In 1866, they met in Zürich at Anna&#x27;s father&#x27;s café, Zum Grünen Glas. They became engaged in 1869 and wed in Apeldoorn, Netherlands on 7 July 1872; the delay was due to Anna being six years Wilhelm&#x27;s senior and his father not approving of her age or humble background. Their marriage began with financial difficulties as family support from Röntgen had ceased. 
They raised one child, Josephine Bertha Ludwig, whom they adopted as a six-year-old after her father, Anna&#x27;s only brother, died in 1887. 
For ethical reasons, Röntgen did not seek patents for his discoveries, holding the view that they should be publicly available without charge. After receiving his Nobel prize money, Röntgen donated the 50,000 Swedish krona to research at the University of Würzburg. Although he accepted the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine, he rejected an offer of lower nobility, or Niederer Adelstitel, denying the preposition von (meaning &quot;of&quot;) as a nobiliary particle (i.e., von Röntgen). With the inflation following World War I, Röntgen fell into bankruptcy, spending his final years at his country home at Weilheim, near Munich. Röntgen died on 10 February 1923 from carcinoma of the intestine, also known as colorectal cancer. In keeping with his will, his personal and scientific correspondence, with few exceptions, were destroyed upon his death. He was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church.

==Awards and honors==
*1896: Rumford Medal of the Royal Society
*1896: Matteucci Medal of the Accademia nazionale delle scienze
*1897: Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute
*1900: Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science of Columbia University
*1901: Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of X-rays

In 1901, Röntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics. The award was officially &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him&quot;. Shy in public speaking, he declined to give a Nobel lecture. Röntgen donated the 50,000 Swedish krona reward from his Nobel Prize to research at his university, the University of Würzburg. Like Marie and Pierre Curie, Röntgen refused to take out patents related to his discovery of X-rays, as he wanted society as a whole to benefit from practical applications of the phenomenon. Röntgen was also awarded Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1900.

In November 2004, IUPAC named element number 111 roentgenium (Rg) in his honor. IUPAP adopted the name in November 2011.

He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1897. In 1907, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Legacy==
A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

Today, in Remscheid-Lennep, 40 kilometres east of Röntgen&#x27;s birthplace in Düsseldorf, is the Deutsches Röntgen-Museum.
&lt;br&gt;
In Würzburg, where he discovered X-rays, a non-profit organization maintains his laboratory and provides guided tours to the Röntgen Memorial Site.

World Radiography Day:
World Radiography Day is an annual event promoting the role of medical imaging in modern healthcare. It is celebrated on 8 November each year, coinciding with the anniversary of the Röntgen&#x27;s discovery. It was first introduced in 2012 as a joint initiative between the European Society of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, and the American College of Radiology.

As of 2023, 55 stamps from 40 countries have been issued commemorating Röntgen as the discoverer of X-rays.

Röntgen Peak in Antarctica is named after Wilhelm Röntgen.

Minor planet 6401 Roentgen is named after him.

<doc id="61328" wikidata="Q213336" url="?curid=61328" title="Hippopotamidae">
<text>Hippopotamidae is a family of stout, naked-skinned, and semiaquatic artiodactyl mammals, possessing three-chambered stomachs and walking on four toes on each foot. While they resemble pigs physiologically, their closest living relatives are the cetaceans. They are sometimes referred to as hippopotamids.

There are two living species of hippopotamid in two genera; the pygmy hippo, &quot;Choeropsis liberiensis&quot; of the forests of west Africa, and the common hippo, &quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;. The term &quot;hippopotamus&quot; can also be applied to hippopotamids in general, although it is most frequently used for the common hippo and its respective genus.

== Characteristics ==
Hippopotamids are large mammals, with short, stumpy legs, and barrel-shaped bodies. They have large heads, with broad mouths, and nostrils placed at the top of their snouts. Like pigs, they have four toes, but unlike pigs, all of the toes are used in walking. Hippopotamids are unguligrade, although, unlike most other such animals, they have no hooves, instead using a pad of tough connective tissue on each foot. Their stomachs have three chambers, but they are not true ruminants.

The living species are smooth-skinned and lack both sebaceous glands and sweat glands. The outer epidermis is relatively thin, so hippos dehydrate rapidly in dry environments.

Both the incisors and canines are large and tusk-like, although the canine tusks are by far the larger. The tusks grow throughout life. The postcanine teeth are large and complex, suited for chewing the plant matter that comprises their diets. The number of incisors varies even within the same species, but the general dental formula is given in the table below: 

== Evolution ==
The hippopotamids are descended from the anthracotheres, a family of semiaquatic and terrestrial artiodactyls that appeared in the late Eocene, and are thought to have resembled small- or narrow-headed hippos. The hippos split off from the anthracotheres some time during the Miocene. The oldest records of Hippopotamidae are from Afro-Arabia and date to the late Miocene, approximately 7.4 million years ago, expanding into Eurasia around 6 million years ago. After the appearance of the hippopotamids, the remaining anthracotheres went into a decline brought about by a combination of climatic change and competition with their descendants, until the last genus, &quot;Merycopotamus&quot;, died out in the early Pliocene of India.

There were once many species of hippopotamid, but only two survive today: &quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;, and &quot;Choeropsis liberiensis&quot;. They are the last survivors of two major evolutionary lineages, the hippos proper and the pygmy hippos, respectively; these lineages could arguably be considered subfamilies, but their relationship to each other – apart from being fairly distant relatives – is not well resolved.

The enigmatic Miocene &quot;Kenyapotamus&quot; is insufficiently known to be assigned a place in the hippo phylogeny with any degree of certainty. In addition, the genus &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, which is now largely restricted to South Asia and Southeast Asia, formerly included many fossil hippopotamuses that are now thought to be unrelated.

=== Taxonomy ===
Hippopotamidae&#x27;s placement within Artiodactyla can be represented in the following cladogram:

=== Analogous structures ===
The lower canine teeth of hippopotamids are similar in function and structure to the tusks of elephants. While hippopotamids and elephants are only very distantly related within the Mammalia, the lower canine teeth of both groups are long and have a slight curve, and species of both families use this structure when fighting.

<text>NYC Midsummer or Swedish Midsummer is a Swedish midsummer celebration organized since 1996 in one of New York City&#x27;s parks on the Friday afternoon close to the June solstice, or St John&#x27;s Day. For several years now, Battery Park City in lower Manhattan has hosted this event. A sizable portion of the Swedish expatriate community in NYC shows up to celebrate Midsummer the Swedish way. The event in Battery Park City is co-hosted by the Swedish consulate and Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority.

Midsummer is one of the year&#x27;s great family holidays in the Scandinavian countries, since long before Christianization. Even though the church has linked it to the day of St John the Baptist, it is primarily celebrated outside of church. A midsummer pole decorated with leaves and flowers is erected and children and families dance around it. A Swedish smörgåsbord of herring, new potatoes, and other dishes is served.

There are many other smaller celebrations around town, New Jersey and boroughs outside Manhattan. For example, there is the annual Sweden Day celebration held at Manhem Club in Throgs Neck. Previously, Swedish-American tourism official Birger Nordholm hosted several Midsummer festivities in and around the area.

<doc id="61334" wikidata="Q22110899" url="?curid=61334" title="Pygmy hippopotamus">
<text>The pygmy hippopotamus or pygmy hippo (Choeropsis liberiensis) is a small hippopotamid which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia, with small populations in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ivory Coast. It has been extirpated from Nigeria.

The pygmy hippo is reclusive and nocturnal. It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being its much larger relative, the common hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) or Nile hippopotamus. The pygmy hippopotamus displays many terrestrial adaptations, but like the common hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. Behaviors such as mating and giving birth may occur in water or on land. The pygmy hippo is herbivorous, feeding on ferns, broad-leaved plants, grasses, and fruits it finds in the forests.

A rare nocturnal forest creature, the pygmy hippopotamus is a difficult animal to study in the wild.
Pygmy hippos were unknown outside West Africa until the 19th century. Introduced to zoos in the early 20th century, they breed well in captivity and the vast majority of research is derived from zoo specimens. The survival of the species in captivity is more assured than in the wild; in a 2015 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated that fewer than 2,500 pygmy hippos remain in the wild.

Pygmy hippos are primarily threatened by loss of habitat, as forests are logged and converted to farm land, and are also vulnerable to poaching, hunting for bushmeat, natural predators, and war. Pygmy hippos are among the species illegally hunted for food in Liberia.

== Taxonomy and origins ==
Nomenclature of the pygmy hippopotamus reflects that of the hippopotamus; the plural form is pygmy hippopotamuses or pygmy hippopotami. A male pygmy hippopotamus is known as a &quot;bull&quot;, a female as a &quot;cow&quot;, and a baby as a &quot;calf&quot;. A group of hippopotami is known as a &quot;herd&quot; or a &quot;bloat&quot;.

The pygmy hippopotamus is a member of the family Hippopotamidae where it is classified as a member of the genus &quot;Choeropsis&quot; (&quot;resembling a hog&quot;). Members of Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes the sub-family Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotami and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea or Hippopotamoidea.

The taxonomy of the genus of the pygmy hippopotamus has changed as understanding of the animal has developed. Samuel G. Morton initially classified the animal as &quot;Hippopotamus minor&quot;, but later determined it was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, and labeled it &quot;Choeropsis&quot;. In 1977, Shirley C. Coryndon proposed that the pygmy hippopotamus was closely related to &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, a genus that consisted of prehistoric hippos mostly native to Asia.

This assertion was widely accepted, until Boisserie asserted in 2005 that the pygmy hippopotamus was not a member of &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, after a thorough examination of the phylogeny of Hippopotamidae. He suggested instead that the pygmy hippopotamus was a distinct genus, and returned the animal to &quot;Choeropsis&quot;. ITIS verifies &quot;Hexaprotodon liberiensis&quot; as the valid scientific name. All agree that the modern pygmy hippopotamus, be it &quot;H. liberiensis&quot; or &quot;C. liberiensis&quot;, is the only extant member of its genus. The American Society of Mammalogists moved it back to &quot;Choeropsis&quot; in 2021, a move supported by the IUCN.

=== Nigerian subspecies ===
A distinct subspecies of pygmy hippopotamus existed in Nigeria until at least the 20th century, though the validity of this has been questioned. The existence of the subspecies, makes &quot;Choeropsis liberiensis liberiensis&quot; (or &quot;Hexaprotodon liberiensis liberiensis&quot; under the old classification) the full trinomial nomenclature for the Liberian pygmy hippopotamus. The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus was never studied in the wild and never captured. All research and all zoo specimens are the Liberian subspecies. The Nigerian subspecies is classified as &quot;C. liberiensis heslopi&quot;.

The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus ranged in the Niger River Delta, especially near Port Harcourt, but no reliable reports exist after the collection of the museum specimens secured by Ian Heslop, a British colonial officer, in the early 1940s. It is probably extinct. The subspecies is separated by over and the Dahomey Gap, a region of savanna that divides the forest regions of West Africa. The subspecies is named after Heslop, who shot three members of it in 1935 and 1943. He estimated that perhaps no more than 30 pygmy hippos remained in the region.

Heslop sent four pygmy hippopotamus skulls he collected to the British Museum of Natural History in London. These specimens were not subjected to taxonomic evaluation, however, until 1969 when classified the skulls as belonging to a separate subspecies based on consistent variations in the proportions of the skulls. The Nigerian pygmy hippos were seen or shot in Rivers State, Imo State and Bayelsa State, Nigeria. While some local humans are aware that the species once existed, its history in the region is poorly documented.

=== Evolution ===
The evolution of the pygmy hippopotamus is most often studied in the context of its larger cousin. Both species were long believed to be most closely related to the family Suidae (pigs and hogs) or Tayassuidae (peccaries), but research within the last 10 years has determined that pygmy hippos and hippos are most closely related to cetaceans (whales and dolphins). Hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around .

This hypothesized ancestor likely split into two branches about six million years later. One branch would evolve into cetaceans, the other branch became the anthracotheres, a large family of four-legged beasts, whose earliest member, from the Late Eocene, would have resembled narrow hippopotami with comparatively small and thin heads.

Hippopotamids are deeply nested within the family Anthracotheriidae. The oldest known hippopotamid is the genus &quot;Kenyapotamus&quot;, which lived in Africa from . &quot;Kenyapotamus&quot; is known only through fragmentary fossils, but was similar in size to &quot;C. liberiensis&quot;. The Hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in Africa, and while at one point the species spread across Asia and Europe, no hippopotami have ever been discovered in the Americas. Starting the &quot;Archaeopotamus&quot;, likely ancestors to the genus &quot;Hippopotamus&quot; and &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, lived in Africa and the Middle East.

While the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the lineages of the two modern genera, &quot;Hippopotamus&quot; and &quot;Choeropsis&quot;, may have diverged as far back as . The ancestral form of the pygmy hippopotamus may be the genus &quot;Saotherium&quot;. &quot;Saotherium&quot; and &quot;Choeropsis&quot; are significantly more basal than &quot;Hippopotamus&quot; and &quot;Hexaprotodon&quot;, and thus more closely resemble the ancestral species of hippos.

=== Extinct pygmy and dwarf hippos ===
Several species of small hippopotamids have also become extinct in the Mediterranean in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Though these species are sometimes known as &quot;pygmy hippopotami&quot; they are not believed to be closely related to &quot;C. liberiensis&quot;. These include the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus creutzburgi&quot;), the Sicilian hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus pentlandi&quot;), the Maltese hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus melitensis&quot;) and the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus minor&quot;).

These species, though comparable in size to the pygmy hippopotamus, are considered dwarf hippopotamuses, rather than pygmies. They are likely descended from a full-sized species of European hippopotamus, and reached their small size through the evolutionary process of insular dwarfism which is common on islands; the ancestors of pygmy hippopotami were also small and thus there was never a dwarfing process. There were also several species of pygmy hippo on the island of Madagascar (see Malagasy hippopotamus).

== Description ==
Pygmy hippos share the same general form as a hippopotamus. They have a skeleton, with four stubby legs and four toes on each foot, supporting a portly frame. Yet, the pygmy is only half as tall as the hippopotamus and weighs less than 1/4 as much as its larger cousin. Adult pygmy hippos stand about high at the shoulder, are in length and weigh . Their lifespan in captivity ranges from 30 to 55 years, though it is unlikely that they live this long in the wild.

The skin is greenish-black or brown, shading to a creamy gray on the lower body. Their skin is very similar to the common hippo&#x27;s, with a thin epidermis over a dermis that is several centimeters thick. Pygmy hippos have the same unusual secretion as common hippos, that gives a pinkish tinge to their bodies, and is sometimes described as &quot;blood sweat&quot; though the secretion is neither sweat nor blood. This substance, hipposudoric acid, is believed to have antiseptic and sunscreening properties. The skin of hippos dries out quickly and cracks, which is why both species spend so much time in water.

The skeleton of &quot;C. liberiensis&quot; is more than that of the common hippopotamus, meaning their bones are proportionally thinner. The common hippo&#x27;s spine is parallel with the ground; the pygmy hippo&#x27;s back slopes forward, a likely adaptation to pass more easily through dense forest vegetation. Proportionally, the pygmy hippo&#x27;s legs and neck are longer and its head smaller.
The orbits and nostrils of a pygmy hippo are much less pronounced, an adaptation from spending less time in deep water (where pronounced orbits and nostrils help the common hippo breathe and see). The feet of pygmy hippos are narrower, but the toes are more spread out and have less webbing, to assist in walking on the forest floor.

Despite adaptations to a more terrestrial life than the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are still more aquatic than all other terrestrial even-toed ungulates. The ears and nostrils of pygmy hippos have strong muscular valves to aid submerging underwater, and the skin physiology is dependent on the availability of water.

== Behavior ==

The behavior of the pygmy hippo differs from the common hippo in many ways. Much of its behavior is more similar to that of a tapir, though this is an effect of convergent evolution. While the common hippopotamus is gregarious, pygmy hippos live either alone or in small groups, typically a mated pair or a mother and calf. Pygmy hippos tend to ignore each other rather than fight when they meet. Field studies have estimated that male pygmy hippos range over , while the range of a female is .Pygmy hippos spend most of the day hidden in rivers. They will rest in the same spot for several days in a row, before moving to a new spot. At least some pygmy hippos make use of dens or burrows that form in river banks. It is unknown if the pygmy hippos help create these dens, or how common it is to use them. Though a pygmy hippo has never been observed burrowing, other artiodactyls, such as warthogs, are burrowers.

=== Diet ===
Like the common hippopotamus, the pygmy hippo emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food.
Pygmy hippos are herbivorous. They do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo&#x27;s diet consists of herbs, ferns, broad-leaved plants, herbaceous shoots, forbs, sedges and fruits that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality than that of the common hippopotamus.

=== Reproduction ===

A study of breeding behavior in the wild has never been conducted; the artificial conditions of captivity may cause the observed behavior of pygmy hippos in zoos to differ from natural conditions. Sexual maturity for the pygmy hippopotamus occurs between three and five years of age. The youngest reported age for giving birth is a pygmy hippo in the Zoo Basel, Switzerland which bore a calf at three years and three months. The oestrus cycle of a female pygmy hippo lasts an average of 35.5 days, with the oestrus itself lasting between 24 and 48 hours.

Pygmy hippos consort for mating, but the duration of the relationship is unknown. In zoos they breed as monogamous pairs. Copulation can take place on land or in the water, and a pair will mate one to four times during an oestrus period. In captivity, pygmy hippos have been conceived and born in all months of the year. The gestation period ranges from 190 to 210 days, and usually a single young is born, though twins are known to occur.The common hippopotamus gives birth and mates only in the water, but pygmy hippos mate and give birth on both land and water. Young pygmy hippos can swim almost immediately. At birth, pygmy hippos weigh 4.5–6.2 kg (9.9–13.7 lb) with males weighing about 0.25 kg (0.55 lb) more than females. Pygmy hippos are fully weaned between six and eight months of age; before weaning they do not accompany their mother when she leaves the water to forage, but instead hide in the water by themselves. The mother returns to the hiding spot about three times a day and calls out for the calf to suckle. Suckling occurs with the mother lying on her side.

=== Temperament ===
Although not considered dangerous to humans and generally docile, pygmy hippos can be highly aggressive at times. Although there have been no human deaths associated with pygmy hippos, there have been several attacks - while most of these were provoked by human behaviour, several have had no apparent cause.

== Conservation ==

The greatest threat to the remaining pygmy hippopotamus population in the wild is loss of habitat. The forests in which pygmy hippos live have been subject to logging, settling and conversion to agriculture, with little efforts made to make logging sustainable. As forests shrink, the populations become more fragmented, leading to less genetic diversity in the potential mating pool.

Pygmy hippos are among the species illegally hunted for food in Liberia. Their meat is said to be of excellent quality, like that of a wild boar; unlike those of the common hippo, the pygmy hippo&#x27;s teeth have no value. The effects of West Africa&#x27;s civil strife on the pygmy hippopotamus are unknown, but unlikely to be positive. The pygmy hippopotamus can be killed by leopards, pythons and crocodiles. How often this occurs is unknown.

&quot;C. liberiensis&quot; was identified as one of the top 10 &quot;focal species&quot; in 2007 by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) project. Some populations inhabit protected areas, such as the Gola Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone.

Basel Zoo in Switzerland holds the international studbook and coordinates the entire captive pygmy hippo population that freely breeds in zoos around the world. Between 1970 and 1991 the population of pygmy hippos born in captivity more than doubled. The survival of the species in zoos is more certain than the survival of the species in the wild. In captivity, the pygmy hippo lives from 42 to 55 years, longer than in the wild. Since 1919, only 41 percent of pygmy hippos born in zoos have been male.

== History and folklore ==

While the common hippopotamus has been known to Europeans since classical antiquity, the pygmy hippopotamus was unknown outside its range in West Africa until the 19th century. Due to their nocturnal, forested existence, they were poorly known within their range as well. In Liberia the animal was traditionally known as a &quot;water cow&quot;.

Early field reports of the animal misidentified it as a wild hog. Several skulls of the species were sent to the American natural scientist Samuel G. Morton, during his residency in Monrovia, Liberia. Morton first described the species in 1843. The first complete specimens were collected as part of a comprehensive investigation of Liberian fauna in the 1870s and 1880s by Dr. Johann Büttikofer. The specimens were taken to the Natural History Museum in Leiden, The Netherlands.

The first pygmy hippo was brought to Europe in 1873 after being captured in Sierra Leone by a member of the British Colonial Service but died shortly after arrival. Pygmy hippos were successfully established in European zoos in 1911. They were first shipped to Germany and then to the Bronx Zoo in New York City where they also thrived.

In 1927, Harvey Firestone of Firestone Tires presented Billy the pygmy hippo to U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. Coolidge donated Billy to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. According to the zoo, Billy is a common ancestor to most pygmy hippos in U.S. zoos today.

Moo Deng is a pygmy hippo living in Khao Kheow Open Zoo, in Thailand, who gained notability in September 2024 as a popular Internet meme after images of her went viral online. Because of the popularity of the hippo, whose name translates to &quot;bouncy pork&quot;, the zoo saw a boosted attendance. It has been reported that some visitors to the zoo threw water and other objects at the baby hippo to get her to react.

Several folktales have been collected about the pygmy hippopotamus. One tale says that pygmy hippos carry a shining diamond in their mouths to help travel through thick forests at night; by day the pygmy hippo has a secret hiding place for the diamond, but if a hunter catches a pygmy hippo at night the diamond can be taken. Villagers sometimes believed that baby pygmy hippos do not nurse but rather lick secretions off the skin of the mother.

<doc id="61338" wikidata="Q32043" url="?curid=61338" title="Addition">
<text>Addition (usually signified by the plus symbol, +) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the other three being subtraction, multiplication, and division. The addition of two whole numbers results in the total amount or &quot;sum&quot; of those values combined. The example in the adjacent image shows two columns of three apples and two apples each, totaling at five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression (that is, &quot;3 &quot;plus&quot; 2 is equal to 5&quot;).

Besides counting items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to concrete objects, using abstractions called numbers instead, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of mathematics. In algebra, another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects such as vectors, matrices, subspaces and subgroups.

Addition has several important properties. It is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter. Repeated addition of is the same as counting (see &quot;Successor function&quot;). Addition of does not change a number. Addition also obeys rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.

Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks to do. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months, and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.
== Notation and terminology ==

Addition is written using the plus sign &quot;+&quot; between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals sign. For example,
: formula_1 (&quot;one plus two equals three&quot;)
: formula_2 (see &quot;associativity&quot; below)
: formula_3 (see &quot;multiplication&quot; below)
There are also situations where addition is &quot;understood&quot;, even though no symbol appears:
* A whole number followed immediately by a fraction indicates the sum of the two, called a &quot;mixed number&quot;. For example,formula_4 This notation can cause confusion, since in most other contexts, juxtaposition denotes multiplication instead.

The sum of a series of related numbers can be expressed through capital sigma notation, which compactly denotes iteration. For example,
: formula_5

=== Terms ===
The numbers or the objects to be added in general addition are collectively referred to as the terms, the addends or the summands; this terminology carries over to the summation of multiple terms.
This is to be distinguished from &quot;factors&quot;, which are multiplied.
Some authors call the first addend the &quot;augend&quot;. In fact, during the Renaissance, many authors did not consider the first addend an &quot;addend&quot; at all. Today, due to the commutative property of addition, &quot;augend&quot; is rarely used, and both terms are generally called addends.

All of the above terminology derives from Latin. &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are English words derived from the Latin verb &quot;addere&quot;, which is in turn a compound of &quot;ad&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;dare&quot; &quot;to give&quot;, from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;to give&quot;; thus to &quot;add&quot; is to &quot;give to&quot;. Using the gerundive suffix &quot;-nd&quot; results in &quot;addend&quot;, &quot;thing to be added&quot;. Likewise from &quot;augere&quot; &quot;to increase&quot;, one gets &quot;augend&quot;, &quot;thing to be increased&quot;.
&quot;Sum&quot; and &quot;summand&quot; derive from the Latin noun &quot;summa&quot; &quot;the highest, the top&quot; and associated verb &quot;summare&quot;. This is appropriate not only because the sum of two positive numbers is greater than either, but because it was common for the ancient Greeks and Romans to add upward, contrary to the modern practice of adding downward, so that a sum was literally at the top of the addends.
&quot;Addere&quot; and &quot;summare&quot; date back at least to Boethius, if not to earlier Roman writers such as Vitruvius and Frontinus; Boethius also used several other terms for the addition operation. The later Middle English terms &quot;adden&quot; and &quot;adding&quot; were popularized by Chaucer.

The plus sign &quot;+&quot; (Unicode:U+002B; ASCII: codice_1) is an abbreviation of the Latin word &quot;et&quot;, meaning &quot;and&quot;. It appears in mathematical works dating back to at least 1489.

== Interpretations ==
Addition is used to model many physical processes. Even for the simple case of adding natural numbers, there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations.

=== Combining sets ===

Possibly the most basic interpretation of addition lies in combining sets:
* When two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection, the number of objects in the single collection is the sum of the numbers of objects in the original collections.

This interpretation is easy to visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics (for the rigorous definition it inspires, see below). However, it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.

One possible fix is to consider collections of objects that can be easily divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than solely combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.

=== Extending a length ===
A second interpretation of addition comes from extending an initial length by a given length:
* When an original length is extended by a given amount, the final length is the sum of the original length and the length of the extension.

The sum &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; can be interpreted as a binary operation that combines &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, in an algebraic sense, or it can be interpreted as the addition of &quot;b&quot; more units to &quot;a&quot;. Under the latter interpretation, the parts of a sum play asymmetric roles, and the operation is viewed as applying the unary operation +&quot;b&quot; to &quot;a&quot;. Instead of calling both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; addends, it is more appropriate to call &quot;a&quot; the augend in this case, since &quot;a&quot; plays a passive role. The unary view is also useful when discussing subtraction, because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

== Properties ==
=== Commutativity ===

Addition is commutative, meaning that one can change the order of the terms in a sum, but still get the same result. Symbolically, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two numbers, then
:&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot; + &quot;a&quot;.
The fact that addition is commutative is known as the &quot;commutative law of addition&quot; or &quot;commutative property of addition&quot;. Some other binary operations are commutative, such as multiplication, but many others, such as subtraction and division, are not.

=== Associativity ===

Addition is associative, which means that when three or more numbers are added together, the order of operations does not change the result.

As an example, should the expression &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; be defined to mean (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) + &quot;c&quot; or &quot;a&quot; + (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;)? Given that addition is associative, the choice of definition is irrelevant. For any three numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;, it is true that . For example, .

When addition is used together with other operations, the order of operations becomes important. In the standard order of operations, addition is a lower priority than exponentiation, nth roots, multiplication and division, but is given equal priority to subtraction.

=== Identity element ===

Adding zero to any number, does not change the number; this means that zero is the identity element for addition, and is also known as the additive identity. In symbols, for every , one has
This law was first identified in Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Brahmasphutasiddhanta&quot; in 628 AD, although he wrote it as three separate laws, depending on whether &quot;a&quot; is negative, positive, or zero itself, and he used words rather than algebraic symbols. Later Indian mathematicians refined the concept; around the year 830, Mahavira wrote, &quot;zero becomes the same as what is added to it&quot;, corresponding to the unary statement . In the 12th century, Bhaskara wrote, &quot;In the addition of cipher, or subtraction of it, the quantity, positive or negative, remains the same&quot;, corresponding to the unary statement .

=== Successor ===
Within the context of integers, addition of one also plays a special role: for any integer &quot;a&quot;, the integer is the least integer greater than &quot;a&quot;, also known as the successor of &quot;a&quot;. For instance, 3 is the successor of 2 and 7 is the successor of 6. Because of this succession, the value of can also be seen as the &quot;b&quot;th successor of &quot;a&quot;, making addition iterated succession. For example, is 8, because 8 is the successor of 7, which is the successor of 6, making 8 the 2nd successor of 6.

=== Units ===
To numerically add physical quantities with units, they must be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50 milliliters to 150 milliliters gives 200 milliliters. However, if a measure of 5 feet is extended by 2 inches, the sum is 62 inches, since 60 inches is synonymous with 5 feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.

== Performing addition ==
=== Innate ability ===
Studies on mathematical development starting around the 1980s have exploited the phenomenon of habituation: infants look longer at situations that are unexpected. A seminal experiment by Karen Wynn in 1992 involving Mickey Mouse dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five-month-old infants &quot;expect&quot; to be 2, and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that is either 1 or 3. This finding has since been affirmed by a variety of laboratories using different methodologies. Another 1992 experiment with older toddlers, between 18 and 35 months, exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve ping-pong balls from a box; the youngest responded well for small numbers, while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5.

Even some nonhuman animals show a limited ability to add, particularly primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn&#x27;s 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught the meanings of the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.

=== Childhood learning ===
Typically, children first master counting. When given a problem that requires that two items and three items be combined, young children model the situation with physical objects, often fingers or a drawing, and then count the total. As they gain experience, they learn or discover the strategy of &quot;counting-on&quot;: asked to find two plus three, children count three past two, saying &quot;three, four, &quot;five&quot;&quot; (usually ticking off fingers), and arriving at five. This strategy seems almost universal; children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers. Most discover it independently. With additional experience, children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number, in this case, starting with three and counting &quot;four, &quot;five&quot;.&quot; Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts (&quot;number bonds&quot;), either through experience or rote memorization. Once some facts are committed to memory, children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones. For example, a child asked to add six and seven may know that and then reason that is one more, or 13. Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently.

Different nations introduce whole numbers and arithmetic at different ages, with many countries teaching addition in pre-school. However, throughout the world, addition is taught by the end of the first year of elementary school.

==== Table ====
Children are often presented with the addition table of pairs of numbers from 0 to 9 to memorize.

=== Decimal system ===
The prerequisite to addition in the decimal system is the fluent recall or derivation of the 100 single-digit &quot;addition facts&quot;. One could memorize all the facts by rote, but pattern-based strategies are more enlightening and, for most people, more efficient:
* &quot;Commutative property&quot;: Mentioned above, using the pattern &quot;a + b = b + a&quot; reduces the number of &quot;addition facts&quot; from 100 to 55.
* &quot;One or two more&quot;: Adding 1 or 2 is a basic task, and it can be accomplished through counting on or, ultimately, intuition.
* &quot;Zero&quot;: Since zero is the additive identity, adding zero is trivial. Nonetheless, in the teaching of arithmetic, some students are introduced to addition as a process that always increases the addends; word problems may help rationalize the &quot;exception&quot; of zero.
* &quot;Doubles&quot;: Adding a number to itself is related to counting by two and to multiplication. Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts, and students find them relatively easy to grasp.
* &quot;Near-doubles&quot;: Sums such as 6 + 7 = 13 can be quickly derived from the doubles fact by adding one more, or from but subtracting one.
* &quot;Five and ten&quot;: Sums of the form 5 + and 10 + are usually memorized early and can be used for deriving other facts. For example, can be derived from by adding one more.
* &quot;Making ten&quot;: An advanced strategy uses 10 as an intermediate for sums involving 8 or 9; for example, .
As students grow older, they commit more facts to memory, and learn to derive other facts rapidly and fluently. Many students never commit all the facts to memory, but can still find any basic fact quickly.

==== Carry ====

The standard algorithm for adding multidigit numbers is to align the addends vertically and add the columns, starting from the ones column on the right. If a column exceeds nine, the extra digit is &quot;carried&quot; into the next column. For example, in the addition 

 ¹
 27
 + 59
 86

7 + 9 = 16, and the digit 1 is the carry. An alternate strategy starts adding from the most significant digit on the left; this route makes carrying a little clumsier, but it is faster at getting a rough estimate of the sum. There are many alternative methods.

Since the end of the 20th century, some US programs, including TERC, decided to remove the traditional transfer method from their curriculum. This decision was criticized, which is why some states and counties did not support this experiment.

==== Decimal fractions ====
Decimal fractions can be added by a simple modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal to make it the same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.

As an example, 45.1 + 4.34 can be solved as follows:
 4 5 . 1 0
 + 0 4 . 3 4
 4 9 . 4 4

==== Scientific notation ====

In scientific notation, numbers are written in the form formula_6, where formula_7 is the significand and formula_8 is the exponential part. Addition requires two numbers in scientific notation to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the two significands can simply be added.

For example:
: formula_9

=== Non-decimal ===

Addition in other bases is very similar to decimal addition. As an example, one can consider addition in binary. Adding two single-digit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:
: 0 + 0 → 0
: 0 + 1 → 1
: 1 + 0 → 1
: 1 + 1 → 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 × 21))
Adding two &quot;1&quot; digits produces a digit &quot;0&quot;, while 1 must be added to the next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:
: 5 + 5 → 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 × 101))
: 7 + 9 → 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 × 101))

This is known as &quot;carrying&quot;. When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to &quot;carry&quot; the excess amount divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:
 0 1 1 0 1
 + 1 0 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36

In this example, two numerals are being added together: 011012 (1310) and 101112 (2310). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, . The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: . This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 1001002 (3610).

=== Computers ===

Analog computers work directly with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms depend on the form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton&#x27;s second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.

Addition is also fundamental to the operation of digital computers, where the efficiency of addition, in particular the carry mechanism, is an important limitation to overall performance.
The abacus, also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere; it dates back to at least 2700–2300 BC, when it was used in Sumer.

Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator in 1642; it was the first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17th century and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal&#x27;s calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal&#x27;s calculator&#x27;s complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.
Adders execute integer addition in electronic digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; one does not perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.

In practice, computational addition may be achieved via XOR and AND bitwise logical operations in conjunction with bitshift operations as shown in the pseudocode below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding &quot;a number to a number&quot;, both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend. In a high-level programming language, evaluating does not change either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;; if the goal is to replace &quot;a&quot; with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement . Some languages such as C or C++ allow this to be abbreviated as .
// Iterative algorithm
int add(int x, int y) {
 int carry = 0;
 while (y != 0) { 
 carry = AND(x, y); // Logical AND
 x = XOR(x, y); // Logical XOR
 y = carry « 1; // left bitshift carry by one
 return x; 

// Recursive algorithm
int add(int x, int y) {
 return x if (y == 0) else add(XOR(x, y), AND(x, y) « 1);


On a computer, if the result of an addition is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which are less likely to be used in validation tests. The Year 2000 problem was a series of bugs where overflow errors occurred due to use of a 2-digit format for years.

== Addition of numbers ==
To prove the usual properties of addition, one must first define addition for the context in question. Addition is first defined on the natural numbers. In set theory, addition is then extended to progressively larger sets that include the natural numbers: the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers. (In mathematics education, positive fractions are added before negative numbers are even considered; this is also the historical route.)

=== Natural numbers ===

There are two popular ways to define the sum of two natural numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. If one defines natural numbers to be the cardinalities of finite sets, (the cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set), then it is appropriate to define their sum as follows:
* Let N(&quot;S&quot;) be the cardinality of a set &quot;S&quot;. Take two disjoint sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, with and . Then is defined as formula_10.
Here, is the union of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. An alternate version of this definition allows &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to possibly overlap and then takes their disjoint union, a mechanism that allows common elements to be separated out and therefore counted twice.

The other popular definition is recursive:
* Let &quot;n&quot;+ be the successor of &quot;n&quot;, that is the number following &quot;n&quot; in the natural numbers, so , . Define . Define the general sum recursively by . Hence .
Again, there are minor variations upon this definition in the literature. Taken literally, the above definition is an application of the recursion theorem on the partially ordered set N2. On the other hand, some sources prefer to use a restricted recursion theorem that applies only to the set of natural numbers. One then considers &quot;a&quot; to be temporarily &quot;fixed&quot;, applies recursion on &quot;b&quot; to define a function &quot;&quot;a&quot; +&quot;, and pastes these unary operations for all &quot;a&quot; together to form the full binary operation.

This recursive formulation of addition was developed by Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades. He proved the associative and commutative properties, among others, through mathematical induction.

=== Integers ===

The simplest conception of an integer is that it consists of an absolute value (which is a natural number) and a sign (generally either positive or negative). The integer zero is a special third case, being neither positive nor negative. The corresponding definition of addition must proceed by cases:
* For an integer &quot;n&quot;, let |&quot;n&quot;| be its absolute value. Let &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be integers. If either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; is zero, treat it as an identity. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both positive, define . If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both negative, define . If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have different signs, define to be the difference between |&quot;a&quot;| and |&quot;b&quot;|, with the sign of the term whose absolute value is larger. As an example, ; because −6 and 4 have different signs, their absolute values are subtracted, and since the absolute value of the negative term is larger, the answer is negative.

Although this definition can be useful for concrete problems, the number of cases to consider complicates proofs unnecessarily. So the following method is commonly used for defining integers. It is based on the remark that every integer is the difference of two natural integers and that two such differences, and are equal if and only if .
So, one can define formally the integers as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers under the equivalence relation
: if and only if .
The equivalence class of contains either if , or otherwise. If is a natural number, one can denote the equivalence class of , and by the equivalence class of . This allows identifying the natural number with the equivalence class .

Addition of ordered pairs is done component-wise:
: formula_11
A straightforward computation shows that the equivalence class of the result depends only on the equivalences classes of the summands, and thus that this defines an addition of equivalence classes, that is integers. Another straightforward computation shows that this addition is the same as the above case definition.

This way of defining integers as equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers, can be used to embed into a group any commutative semigroup with cancellation property. Here, the semigroup is formed by the natural numbers and the group is the additive group of integers. The rational numbers are constructed similarly, by taking as semigroup the nonzero integers with multiplication.

This construction has been also generalized under the name of Grothendieck group to the case of any commutative semigroup. Without the cancellation property the semigroup homomorphism from the semigroup into the group may be non-injective. Originally, the &quot;Grothendieck group&quot; was, more specifically, the result of this construction applied to the equivalences classes under isomorphisms of the objects of an abelian category, with the direct sum as semigroup operation.

=== Rational numbers (fractions) ===
Addition of rational numbers can be computed using the least common denominator, but a conceptually simpler definition involves only integer addition and multiplication:
* Define formula_12

As an example, the sum formula_13.

Addition of fractions is much simpler when the denominators are the same; in this case, one can simply add the numerators while leaving the denominator the same: formula_14, so formula_15.

The commutativity and associativity of rational addition is an easy consequence of the laws of integer arithmetic. For a more rigorous and general discussion, see &quot;field of fractions&quot;.

=== Real numbers ===

A common construction of the set of real numbers is the Dedekind completion of the set of rational numbers. A real number is defined to be a Dedekind cut of rationals: a non-empty set of rationals that is closed downward and has no greatest element. The sum of real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is defined element by element:
* Define formula_16
This definition was first published, in a slightly modified form, by Richard Dedekind in 1872.
The commutativity and associativity of real addition are immediate; defining the real number 0 to be the set of negative rationals, it is easily seen to be the additive identity. Probably the trickiest part of this construction pertaining to addition is the definition of additive inverses.
Unfortunately, dealing with multiplication of Dedekind cuts is a time-consuming case-by-case process similar to the addition of signed integers. Another approach is the metric completion of the rational numbers. A real number is essentially defined to be the limit of a Cauchy sequence of rationals, lim &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Addition is defined term by term:
* Define formula_17
This definition was first published by Georg Cantor, also in 1872, although his formalism was slightly different.
One must prove that this operation is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all the properties of real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.

=== Complex numbers ===

Complex numbers are added by adding the real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is to say:
:formula_18
Using the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point &quot;X&quot; obtained by building a parallelogram three of whose vertices are &quot;O&quot;, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;X&quot; is the point such that the triangles with vertices &quot;O&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;X&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, are congruent.

== Generalizations ==
There are many binary operations that can be viewed as generalizations of the addition operation on the real numbers. The field of abstract algebra is centrally concerned with such generalized operations, and they also appear in set theory and category theory.

=== Abstract algebra ===
==== Vectors ====

In linear algebra, a vector space is an algebraic structure that allows for adding any two vectors and for scaling vectors. A familiar vector space is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers; the ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) is interpreted as a vector from the origin in the Euclidean plane to the point (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) in the plane. The sum of two vectors is obtained by adding their individual coordinates:
:formula_19
This addition operation is central to classical mechanics, in which velocities, accelerations and forces are all represented by vectors.

==== Matrices ====

Matrix addition is defined for two matrices of the same dimensions. The sum of two &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; (pronounced &quot;m by n&quot;) matrices A and B, denoted by , is again an matrix computed by adding corresponding elements:
: formula_20

For example:
: formula_21

==== Modular arithmetic ====

In modular arithmetic, the set of available numbers is restricted to a finite subset of the integers, and addition &quot;wraps around&quot; when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. For example, the set of integers modulo 12 has twelve elements; it inherits an addition operation from the integers that is central to musical set theory. The set of integers modulo 2 has just two elements; the addition operation it inherits is known in Boolean logic as the &quot;exclusive or&quot; function. A similar &quot;wrap around&quot; operation arises in geometry, where the sum of two angle measures is often taken to be their sum as real numbers modulo 2π. This amounts to an addition operation on the circle, which in turn generalizes to addition operations on many-dimensional tori.

==== General theory ====
The general theory of abstract algebra allows an &quot;addition&quot; operation to be any associative and commutative operation on a set. Basic algebraic structures with such an addition operation include commutative monoids and abelian groups.

=== Set theory and category theory ===
A far-reaching generalization of addition of natural numbers is the addition of ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation closely related to the disjoint union operation.

In category theory, disjoint union is seen as a particular case of the coproduct operation, and general coproducts are perhaps the most abstract of all the generalizations of addition. Some coproducts, such as direct sum and wedge sum, are named to evoke their connection with addition.

== Related operations ==
Addition, along with subtraction, multiplication and division, is considered one of the basic operations and is used in elementary arithmetic.

=== Arithmetic ===
Subtraction can be thought of as a kind of addition—that is, the addition of an additive inverse. Subtraction is itself a sort of inverse to addition, in that adding and subtracting are inverse functions.

Given a set with an addition operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; the set of natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group can be described as a set that is closed under subtraction.

Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. If a single term appears in a sum &quot;n&quot; times, then the sum is the product of &quot;n&quot; and . If &quot;n&quot; is not a natural number, the product may still make sense; for example, multiplication by yields the additive inverse of a number.
In the real and complex numbers, addition and multiplication can be interchanged by the exponential function:
: formula_22
This identity allows multiplication to be carried out by consulting a table of logarithms and computing addition by hand; it also enables multiplication on a slide rule. The formula is still a good first-order approximation in the broad context of Lie groups, where it relates multiplication of infinitesimal group elements with addition of vectors in the associated Lie algebra.

There are even more generalizations of multiplication than addition. In general, multiplication operations always distribute over addition; this requirement is formalized in the definition of a ring. In some contexts, such as the integers, distributivity over addition and the existence of a multiplicative identity is enough to uniquely determine the multiplication operation. The distributive property also provides information about addition; by expanding the product in both ways, one concludes that addition is forced to be commutative. For this reason, ring addition is commutative in general.

Division is an arithmetic operation remotely related to addition. Since , division is right distributive over addition: . However, division is not left distributive over addition; is not the same as .

=== Ordering ===

The maximum operation &quot;max (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)&quot; is a binary operation similar to addition. In fact, if two nonnegative numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are of different orders of magnitude, then their sum is approximately equal to their maximum. This approximation is extremely useful in the applications of mathematics, for example in truncating Taylor series. However, it presents a perpetual difficulty in numerical analysis, essentially since &quot;max&quot; is not invertible. If &quot;b&quot; is much greater than &quot;a&quot;, then a straightforward calculation of can accumulate an unacceptable round-off error, perhaps even returning zero. See also &quot;Loss of significance&quot;.

The approximation becomes exact in a kind of infinite limit; if either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; is an infinite cardinal number, their cardinal sum is exactly equal to the greater of the two. Accordingly, there is no subtraction operation for infinite cardinals.

Maximization is commutative and associative, like addition. Furthermore, since addition preserves the ordering of real numbers, addition distributes over &quot;max&quot; in the same way that multiplication distributes over addition:
: formula_23
For these reasons, in tropical geometry one replaces multiplication with addition and addition with maximization. In this context, addition is called &quot;tropical multiplication&quot;, maximization is called &quot;tropical addition&quot;, and the tropical &quot;additive identity&quot; is negative infinity. Some authors prefer to replace addition with minimization; then the additive identity is positive infinity.

Tying these observations together, tropical addition is approximately related to regular addition through the logarithm:
: formula_24
which becomes more accurate as the base of the logarithm increases. The approximation can be made exact by extracting a constant &quot;h&quot;, named by analogy with the Planck constant from quantum mechanics, and taking the &quot;classical limit&quot; as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero:
: formula_25
In this sense, the maximum operation is a &quot;dequantized&quot; version of addition.

=== Other ways to add ===
Incrementation, also known as the successor operation, is the addition of to a number.

Summation describes the addition of arbitrarily many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes the idea of the sum of a single number, which is itself, and the empty sum, which is zero. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series.

Counting a finite set is equivalent to summing 1 over the set.

Integration is a kind of &quot;summation&quot; over a continuum, or more precisely and generally, over a differentiable manifold. Integration over a zero-dimensional manifold reduces to summation.

Linear combinations combine multiplication and summation; they are sums in which each term has a multiplier, usually a real or complex number. Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.

Convolution is used to add two independent random variables defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution is useful as a kind of domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition is a kind of range-side addition.

<text>Balderdash is a board game variant of a classic parlour game known as Fictionary or the Dictionary Game. It was created by Laura Robinson and Paul Toyne of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The game was first released in 1984 by the Canada Games Company. A US edition appeared that year from TSR, Inc., copyrighted to Gameworks Creations, Inc. and licensed from Canada Games. Subsequent editions have appeared from a variety of companies including The Games Gang, Hasbro and Mattel. The game has sold over 15 million copies worldwide to date. It is aimed at fans of word games, such as &quot;Scrabble&quot;.

==Origin==
&quot;Balderdash&quot; is based on an earlier game, &quot;Fictionary&quot;, of essentially similar gameplay, varying in that obscure words are found in an unabridged dictionary instead of the definitions and meanings provided on cards. They are then read out to the unsuspecting individual.

The board game version was created by Laura Robinson and Paul Toyne of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Gameplay==
The game presents rare and unusual words, and players secretly submit definitions for them, hoping that other players will believe their definition is the real one. It is therefore advantageous to have an excellent vocabulary and the ability to deceive.

The game begins by all players rolling a die, with the high roll chosen to be the first &quot;dasher&quot;. The dasher draws a &quot;definition card&quot; from the supplied box, and rolls the dice to decide which of the words listed there is to be used. Then the dasher writes the definition of the word (as supplied on the card) on a piece of paper. All other players then write down a definition, which may be an honest attempt to supply the correct definition, or, if they do not know or for tactical reasons decide not to, a fictitious definition for the word designed to sound convincing.

The players hand their definitions to the dasher. Players submitting the correct definition are immediately awarded three points, and, if there is more than one, the round is abandoned (though the points are retained). The definitions, including the real definition, are then read out in random order. Players record which answer they believe is correct. Players are awarded two points if they guess the correct definition. Players are awarded one point for each other player who incorrectly chooses the fake definition they wrote. The dasher is awarded three points if no one guesses the correct definition. Players move their tokens around the game board one square for each point awarded. The role of dasher then passes to another player. The winner is the individual whose token reaches the end square first.

===Variants===
There are many different variations of ways to break ties (when two or more players hit the end at the same time). One way to resolve a tie is to say all of the players that crossed the finish line won. Another way is to have a sudden death, tie-breaker round where whoever gets more points on the tiebreaker round wins.

In 1993, &quot;Beyond Balderdash&quot; was released. In addition to more up-to-date words, &quot;Beyond Balderdash&quot; offers obscure acronyms, dates, names, and movie titles, for which the players have to provide full names, major events, major accomplishments, and plot summaries, respectively. The die is used for choosing which category will be chosen from the card. In later editions, the &quot;Major Events&quot; category was switched out for obscure state laws, such as &quot;After midnight in Denver, Colorado, it is illegal to...&quot;, with players completing the law.

An informal variation of the game consists of the players exclusively submitting hilarious and outrageous definitions. No points are awarded, and the winner is determined by who garnered the most laughs throughout the course of the game.

==Popular culture==

A clue referencing &quot;Balderdash&quot; appeared on Jeopardy! on September 16, 2024, though it referred to the game as &quot;by Mattel&quot;. (No player answered the clue correctly.)

==Television version==

A television game show based on the game aired on Pax TV in 2004 with comedian Elayne Boosler as host.

<doc id="61344" wikidata="Q33741" url="?curid=61344" title="Lightning">
<text>Lightning is a natural phenomenon consisting of electrostatic discharges occurring through the atmosphere between two electrically charged regions. One or both regions are within the atmosphere, with the second region sometimes occurring on the ground. Following the lightning, the regions become partially or wholly electrically neutralized. 

Lightning involves a near-instantaneous release of energy on a scale averaging between 200 megajoules and 7 gigajoules. The air around the lightning flash rapidly heats to temperatures of approximately 30,000°C. There is an emission of electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, some visible as a bright flash. Lightning also causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as heated gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. 

The most common occurrence of a lightning event is known as a thunderstorm, though they can also commonly occur in other types of energetic weather systems, such as volcanic eruptions. Lightning influences the global atmospheric electrical circuit and atmospheric chemistry and is a natural ignition source of wildfires. Lightning is considered an Essential Climate Variable by the World Meteorological Organisation, and its scientific study is called &quot;fulminology&quot;.

== Forms ==
Three primary forms of lightning are distinguished by where they occur:
* (IC) or — Within a single thundercloud
* (CC) or — Between two clouds
* (CG) — Between a cloud and the ground, in which case it is referred to as a lightning strike.

Many other observational variants are recognized, including: volcanic lightning, which can occur during volcanic eruptions; &quot;heat lightning&quot;, which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; dry lightning, which can cause forest fires; and ball lightning, which is rarely observed scientifically.

The most direct effects of lightning on humans occur as a result of cloud-to-ground lightning, even though intra-cloud and cloud-to-cloud are more common. Intra-cloud and cloud-to-cloud lightning indirectly affect humans through their influence on atmospheric chemistry.

There are variations of each type, such as &quot;positive&quot; versus &quot;negative&quot; CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured.

=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===
 (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.

CG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning. It is easier to study scientifically because it terminates on a physical object, namely the ground, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property, since it terminates on the ground or &quot;strikes&quot;.

The overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders, and subsequent return strokes. The conductivity of the electrical ground, be it soil, fresh water, or salt water, may affect the lightning discharge rate and thus visible characteristics.

====Positive and negative lightning====
Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is either positive or negative, as defined by the direction of the conventional electric current between cloud and ground. Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred (electrons flow) downwards to ground along the lightning channel (conventionally speaking they flow from the ground up to the cloud). The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel, while also a positive charge is transferred downward to the ground (conventionally speaking this would be the opposite).

Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.

There are a number of mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of positive lightning. These are mainly based on movement or intensification of charge centres in the cloud. Such changes in cloud charging may come about as a result of variations in vertical wind shear or precipitation, or dissipation of the storm. Positive flashes may also result from certain behaviour of in-cloud discharges, e.g. breaking off or branching from existing flashes.

Positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts. An average bolt of negative lightning creates an electric current of 30,000 amperes (30 kA), transferring a total 15 C (coulombs) of electric charge and 1 gigajoule of energy. Large bolts of positive lightning can create up to 120 kA and transfer 350 C. The average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400 kA and charges of several hundred coulombs. Furthermore, positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents, a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes.

As a result of their greater power, positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous than negative strikes. Positive lightning produces both higher peak currents and longer continuing currents, making them capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited. The long distances positive lightning can propagate through clear air explains why they are known as &quot;bolts from the blue&quot;, giving no warning to observers.

Positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of sprites several tens of kilometers above ground level. Positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms, as with thundersnow, during intense tornadoes and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm. Huge quantities of extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) radio waves are also generated.

Contrary to popular belief, positive lightning flashes do &quot;not&quot; necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm. This belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar and originate from their respective charge region. Despite the popular misconception that flashes originating from the anvil are positive, due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region, observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes. They begin as IC flashes within the cloud, the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away.

=== Cloud to cloud (CC) and intra-cloud (IC) ===
Lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground. When it occurs between two separate clouds, it is known as (CC) or lightning; when it occurs between areas of differing electric potential within a single cloud, it is known as (IC) lightning. IC lightning is the most frequently occurring type.

IC lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called &quot;sheet lightning&quot;. In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.

Another term used for cloud–cloud or cloud–cloud–ground lightning is &quot;Anvil Crawler&quot;, due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.

== Formation ==
The processes involved in lightning formation fall into the following categories:
# Large-scale atmospheric phenomena in which charge separation can occur (e.g. storm)
# Microscopic and macroscopic processes that result in charge separation
# Establishment of an electric field
# Discharge through a lightning channel

=== Atmospheric phenomena in which lightning occurs ===
Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses, resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere. The disturbances result in storms, and when those storms also result in lightning and thunder, they are called a thunderstorm.

Lightning can also occur during dust storms, forest fires, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, and even in the cold of winter, where the lightning is known as thundersnow. Hurricanes typically generate some lightning, mainly in the rainbands as much as from the center.

Intense forest fires, such as those seen in the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, can create their own weather systems that can produce lightning (also called Fire Lightning) and other weather phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC / Ceranic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Intense heat from a fire causes air to rapidly rise within the smoke plume, causing the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds. Cooler air is drawn in by this turbulent, rising air, helping to cool the plume. The rising plume is further cooled by the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitude, allowing the moisture in it to condense into cloud. Pyrocumulonimbus clouds form in an unstable atmosphere. These weather systems can produce dry lightning, fire tornadoes, intense winds, and dirty hail.

As well as the thermodynamic and dynamic conditions of the atmosphere, aerosol (e.g. dust or smoke) composition is thought to influence the frequency of lightning flashes in a storm. A specific example of this is that relatively high lightning frequency is seen along ship tracks.

Airplane contrails have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree. The water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow. Rocket exhaust plumes provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the Apollo 12 rocket shortly after takeoff.

Thermonuclear explosions, by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere, have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud. In addition, intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through Compton scattering. The intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates.

Some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind, enter the atmosphere and electrify the air, which may create pathways for lightning channels.

=== Charge separation ===
==== Charge separation in thunderstorms ====

The details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm charge separation, also known as electrification. Electrification can be by the triboelectric effect leading to electron or ion transfer between colliding bodies. 

The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from ; see Figure 1. In that area, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.

The differences in the movement of the cloud particles cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged; see Figure 2. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm. Typically, the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged. The above process of charge separation as a result of cloud particle collisions is normally referred to as the &quot;non-inductive&quot; charging mechanism.

The upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from the thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures. The positive-negative-positive charge regions commonly occur in mature thunderstorms, and referred to as the &quot; tripolar&quot; charge structure. 

There are also other charging processes that may play a role in thunderstorms, but are generally thought to be less important. An &quot;inductive&quot; charging mechanism has been studied, and would arise from the polarisation of cloud droplets in the presence of the &quot;fair-weather&quot; electric field. It has also been stated that uncharged, colliding water-drops can become charged because of charge transfer between them (as aqueous ions) in an electric field as would exist in a thunderstorm.

The induced separation of charge in pure liquid water has been known since the 1840s as has the electrification of pure liquid water by the triboelectric effect. William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) demonstrated that charge separation in water occurs in the usual electric fields at the Earth&#x27;s surface and developed a continuous electric field measuring device using that knowledge. The physical separation of charge into different regions using liquid water was demonstrated by Kelvin with the Kelvin water dropper. The most likely charge-carrying species were considered to be the aqueous hydrogen ion and the aqueous hydroxide ion. An electron is not stable in liquid water concerning a hydroxide ion plus dissolved hydrogen for the time scales involved in thunderstorms. The electrical charging of solid water ice has also been considered. The charged species were again considered to be the hydrogen ion and the hydroxide ion.

=== Establishing an electric field ===

In order for an electrostatic discharge to occur, two preconditions are necessary: first, a sufficiently high potential difference between two regions of space must exist, and second, a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges. The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity. Meanwhile, a thunderstorm can provide the charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud.

When the local electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of damp air (about 3 MV/m), electrical discharge results in a &quot;strike&quot;, often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path. Mechanisms that cause the charges to build up to lightning are still a matter of scientific investigation. A 2016 study confirmed dielectric breakdown is involved. Lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture-filled air through electric fields. Ice or water particles then accumulate charge as in a Van de Graaff generator.

As a thundercloud moves over the surface of the Earth, an equal electric charge, but of opposite polarity, is induced on the Earth&#x27;s surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.

The oppositely charged regions create an electric field within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud – the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.

=== Electrical discharge as flashes and strikes ===

The charge carrier in lightning is mainly electrons in a plasma. The process of going from charge as ions (positive hydrogen ion and negative hydroxide ion) associated with liquid water or solid water to charge as electrons associated with lightning must involve some form of electro-chemistry, that is, the oxidation and/or the reduction of chemical species.

The best-studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG) lightning. Although more common, intra-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no &quot;physical&quot; points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability of lightning striking the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult even in areas of high CG frequency.

==== Lightning leaders ====

In a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of ionized air, called a &quot;leader&quot;, is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern. In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called &quot;stepping&quot;. The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.

It is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.

The positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader &quot;pools&quot; ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it gets closer to the Earth&#x27;s surface.

About 90% of ionic channel lengths between &quot;pools&quot; are approximately in length. The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of milliseconds) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The electric current needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of amperes, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.

Initiation of the lightning leader is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself. Many hypotheses have been proposed. One hypothesis postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by cosmic rays and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called runaway breakdown. As these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules, they initiate leader formation. Another hypothesis involves locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals. Percolation theory, especially for the case of biased percolation, describes random connectivity phenomena, which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes. A streamer avalanche model has recently been favored by observational data taken by LOFAR during storms.

==== Upward streamers ====

When a stepped leader approaches the ground, the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the electric field. The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward streamer, can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.

As negatively charged leaders approach, increasing the localized electric field strength, grounded objects already experiencing corona discharge will exceed a threshold and form upward streamers.

==== Attachment ====
Once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader, a process referred to as attachment, a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur. Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress.

==== Discharge – Return stroke ====

Once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel. Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at up to one third of the speed of light. This is the &quot;return stroke&quot; and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.

A large electric charge flows along the plasma channel, from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths in groups of people or of other animals than the strike itself. Electricity takes every path available to it.
Such step potentials will often cause current to flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.

The electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as &quot;negative CG&quot; lightning. In some cases, a ground-to-cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000 km/s (one-third of the speed of light). A typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting plasma channel through the air in excess of tall, from within the cloud to the ground&#x27;s surface.

The massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly superheats the completed leader channel, forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel. The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed , causing it to radiate with a brilliant, blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder.

==== Discharge – Re-strike ====
High-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.

Each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable &quot;strobe light&quot; effect.

To understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader&#x27;s connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called &quot;recoil leaders&quot;, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a &quot;dart leader&quot; travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes.

Each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.

Since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.

==== Discharge – Transient currents during flash ====
The electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1–10 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50–200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing (alternating) currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the skin effect, unlike direct currents, which &quot;flow-through&quot; the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle surface area in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total cross-sectional area.

The rapidly changing currents also create electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. The surge current is inversely related to the surge impedance: the higher in impedance, the lower the current. This is the surge that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate electronics, electrical appliances, or electric motors. Devices known as surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash&#x27;s transient irregular current, and, through alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached earthing ground, thereby protecting the equipment from damage.

== Distribution, frequency and properties ==


Global monitoring indicates that lightning on Earth occurs at an average frequency of approximately 44 (± 5) times per second, equating to nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year. Median duration is 0.52 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 60 to 70 microseconds. Occurrences are distributed unevenly across the planet with about 70% being over land in the tropics where atmospheric convection is the greatest.

Many factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world. These factors include ground elevation, latitude, prevailing wind currents, relative humidity, and proximity to warm and cold bodies of water.

Lightning is usually produced by cumulonimbus clouds, which have bases that are typically above the ground and tops up to in height.

In general, CG lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. The proportions of intra-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-ground lightning may also vary by season at latitude. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60° North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.


The place on Earth where lightning occurs most often is over Lake Maracaibo, wherein the Catatumbo lightning phenomenon produces 250 bolts of lightning a day. This activity occurs on average, 297 days a year. The second most lightning density is near the village of Kifuka in the mountains of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the elevation is around . On average, this region receives . Other lightning hotspots include Singapore and Lightning Alley in Central Florida.

According to the World Meteorological Organization, on April 29, 2020, a bolt 768 km (477.2 mi) long was observed in the southern U.S.—sixty km (37 mi) longer than the previous distance record (southern Brazil, October 31, 2018). A single flash in Uruguay and northern Argentina on June 18, 2020, lasted for 17.1 seconds—0.37 seconds longer than the previous record (March 4, 2019, also in northern Argentina).

Researchers at the University of Florida found that the final one-dimensional speeds of 10 flashes observed were between 1.0 and 1.4 m/s, with an average of 4.4 m/s.

== Effects ==
A lightning strike can unleash a variety of effects, some temporary, including very brief emission of light, sound and electromagnetic radiation, and some long-lasting, such as death, damage, and atmospheric and environmental changes.

=== Injury, damage and destruction ===

The immense amount of energy transferred in a lightning strike can have potentially devastating effect in a multitude of areas.

==== To nature ====
Objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. Consequently:
* The heat created by lightning currents travelling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that rips off bark or even bursts the trunk.
* Similarly water in a fractured rock may be rapidly heated such that it splits further apart.
* A struck tree may catch fire, or a forest fire may be started. See also &quot;fire lightning&quot; below.
* As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt, forming tubular structures called fulgurites.

==== To man-made structures and their contents ====
Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unimpeded paths to the ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to the ground, a lightning protection system, usually incorporating at least one lightning rod, can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Surge protection devices (SPDs) can additionally or alternatively be used to help protect electrical installations from lightning induced electrical surges that risk damaging or destroying electrical equipment or starting a fire. Electrical fires obviously threaten not only structures but all assets, personal possessions, and living beings (people, pets and livestock) within. What, if any, protection system a building or structure requires is determined through a risk assessment. Threats to structures come not only from direct strikes to the structure itself, but also from direct or indirect strikes to connected electrically conductive services (electrical power lines; communication lines; water/gas pipes), or even to the surrounding area from which a surge may reach a service connection as it spreads out into the ground.

==== To aircraft ====
Aircraft are highly susceptible to being struck due to their metallic fuselages, but lightning strikes are generally not dangerous to them. Due to the conductive properties of aluminium alloy, the fuselage acts as a Faraday cage. Present day aircraft are built to be safe from a lightning strike and passengers will generally not even know that it has happened. However, there have been suspicions that lightning strikes can ignite fuel vapor and cause explosion, and nearby lightning can momentarily blind the pilot and cause permanent errors in magnetic compasses.

==== To living beings ====
Although 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive, humans and other animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage.

=== Noise (Thunder) ===
Because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration, kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning&#x27;s path, the sound origin&#x27;s varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by acoustic echoing from terrain, and by the usually multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard as a rolling, gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times.

Lightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over whereas the thunder travels about . Anecdotally, there are many examples of people describing a &#x27;storm directly overhead&#x27; or &#x27;all-around&#x27; and yet &#x27;no thunder&#x27;. Since thunderclouds can be up to high, lightning occurring high up in the cloud may appear close but is actually too far away to produce noticeable thunder.

==== The distance approximation trick ====
Light travels at about , while sound only travels through air at about . An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately away; thus a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about ; while a flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of roughly . Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of ozone (O3).

=== Electromagnetic radiation and interference ===
Electromagnetic waves are emitted in a variety of wavelengths, most obviously that of visible light – the big bright flash! This emitted radiation results partly from black-body radiation due to the temperature increase caused by electrical resistance of the air, and partly for other reasons that are still actively research.

====Radio frequency radiation====
Lightning discharges generate radio-frequency electromagnetic waves which can be received thousands of kilometers from their source. The discharge by itself is relatively simple short-lived dipole source that creates a single electromagnetic pulse with a duration of about 1 ms and a wide spectral density. 
In the absence in the nearby environment of materials with magnetic or electrical interaction properties, at a large distances in a far field zone, the electromagnetic wave will be proportional to the second derivation of the discharge current. This is what happens with high-altitude discharges or discharges over areas of a dry land.

In other cases, the surrounding environment will change the shape of the source signal by absorbing some of its spectrum and converting it into a heat or re-transmitting it back as modified electromagnetic waves.

==== High-energy radiation ====

The production of X-rays by a bolt of lightning was predicted as early as 1925 by C.T.R. Wilson, but no evidence was found until 2001/2002, when researchers at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology detected X-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud. In the same year, University of Florida and Florida Tech researchers used an array of electric field and X-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in North Florida to confirm that natural lightning makes X-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders. The cause of the X-ray emissions is still a matter for research, as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the X-rays observed.

A number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy gamma ray emissions, the so-called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). These observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning, especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of antimatter produced in lightning. Recent research has shown that secondary species, produced by these TGFs, such as electrons, positrons, neutrons or protons, can gain energies of up to several tens of MeV.

=== Environmental changes ===
More permanent or longer-lasting environmental changes include the following.

==== Atmospheric chemistry ====
The very high temperatures generated by lightning lead to significant local increases in ozone and oxides of nitrogen. Each lightning flash in temperate and sub-tropical areas produces 7 kg of on average. In the troposphere the effect of lightning can increase by 90% and ozone by 30%.

==== Ground fertilisation ====
Lightning serves an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.

==== Induced permanent magnetism ====
The movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less resistive path. One theory suggests that lodestones, natural magnets encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.

Lightning-induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground, and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge.

=== Magnetic hallucinations ===

Research at the University of Innsbruck has calculated that magnetic fields generated by plasma may induce hallucinations in subjects located within of a severe lightning storm, like what happened in Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

== Extraterrestrial ==
Lightning has been observed within the atmospheres of planets other than Earth, such as Jupiter, Saturn, and probably Uranus and Neptune. Lightning on Jupiter is far more energetic than on Earth, despite seeming to be generated via the same mechanism. Recently, a new type of lightning was detected on Jupiter, thought to originate from &quot;mushballs&quot; including ammonia. On Saturn lightning, initially referred to as &quot;Saturn Electrostatic Discharge&quot;, was discovered by the Voyager 1 mission.

Lightning on Venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study. During the Soviet Venera and U.S. Pioneer missions of the 1970s and 1980s, signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected. The short Cassini–Huygens mission fly-by of Venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning, but radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft &quot;Venus Express&quot; (which began orbiting Venus in April 2006) may originate from lightning on Venus.

== Detection and monitoring ==

The earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunderstorm was the lightning bell. Benjamin Franklin installed one such device in his house. The detector was based on an electrostatic device called the &#x27;electric chimes&#x27; invented by Andrew Gordon in 1742.

Lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including radio-frequency pulses. The times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge with a precision on the order of metres. The United States federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors, allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental U.S.

In addition, Blitzortung (a private global detection system that consists of over 500 detection stations owned and operated by hobbyists/volunteers) provides near real-time lightning maps at .

The Earth-ionosphere waveguide traps electromagnetic VLF- and ELF waves. Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide. The waveguide is dispersive, which means that their group velocity depends on frequency. The difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Together with direction-finding methods, this allows locating lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000 km from their origin. Moreover, the eigenfrequencies of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide, the Schumann resonances
at about 7.5 Hz, are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity.

In addition to ground-based lightning detection, several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution. These include the Optical Transient Detector (OTD), aboard the OrbView-1 satellite launched on April 3, 1995, and the subsequent Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard TRMM launched on November 28, 1997.

Starting in 2016, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite–R Series (GOES-R) weather satellites outfitted with Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instruments which are near-infrared optical transient detectors that can detect the momentary changes in an optical scene, indicating the presence of lightning. The lightning detection data can be converted into a real-time map of lightning activity across the Western Hemisphere; this mapping technique has been implemented by the United States National Weather Service.

In 2022 EUMETSAT plan to launch the Lightning Imager (MTG-I LI) on board Meteosat Third Generation. This will complement NOAA&#x27;s GLM. MTG-I LI will cover Europe and Africa and will include products on events, groups and flashes.

=== Artificial triggering ===
* Rocket-triggered 
*: Lightning can be &quot;triggered&quot; by launching specially designed rockets trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms. The wire unwinds as the rocket ascends, creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders. If a leader attaches, the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur. The wire is vaporized by the return current flow, creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place. This method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner. The International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, Florida typically uses rocket triggered lightning in their research studies.
* Laser-triggered
*: Since the 1970s, researchers have attempted to trigger lightning strikes by means of infrared or ultraviolet lasers, which create a channel of ionized gas through which the lightning would be conducted to ground. Such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads, electric power facilities, and other sensitive targets.
*: In New Mexico, U.S., scientists tested a new terawatt laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as &quot;filaments&quot;. Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand. Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels.

== Impact of climate change and air pollution ==
It is difficult to accurately predict changes in lightning due to climate change because it is challenging to simulate cloud physics variables that predict lightning (such as convection and cloud ice) in climate models.

A large share of the world&#x27;s lightning occurs over Africa. While there are regional variations in how climate change affects lightning across the continent, one study predicts a small increase in the total amount of lightning across the continent with warming. More specifically, the total number of lightning days per year is predicted to decrease, while more cloud ice and stronger convection leads to more lightning strikes occurring on days when lightning does occur.

Lightning is much less common near the North and South Poles than in other regions. However, climate models increasingly agree that lightning in the Arctic has increased due to climate change. and will continue to increase in future. The ratio of Arctic summertime lightning strikes has increased from 2010 to 2020 compared to the total lightning strikes in the world, indicating that the region is becoming more influenced by lightning.

Lightning activity is increased by particulate emissions (a form of air pollution). However, this only occurs up to a point (aerosol optical depth = 0.3). Once this threshold is crossed, lightning is then suppressed by further increases in particulates.

When lightning occurs, it generates rapid heating and cooling that causes gases that cause nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere to break apart. This process leads to the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which can subsequently result in the production of ozone, a greenhouse gas when occurring in the troposphere. However, lightning NOx also leads to increased amounts of hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO₂) radicals. These reactive molecules initiate chemical reactions that break down greenhouse gases like methane, effectively cleaning the atmosphere.

=== Lightning and climate change feedbacks ===
As lightning is influenced by climate change, there is a corresponding change to the lightning’s influence on climate. These changes can lead to further climate change, thus creating a climate change feedback.

Lightning leads to the production of tropospheric ozone and destruction of methane, both greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Therefore, the net impact of lightning on climate depends on the balance between this warming and cooling effect of the gases&#x27; effects on atmospheric chemistry. Predictions of this feedback can vary, resulting in either no change (net zero feedback), or a warming effect (positive feedback), depending on the method used to predict lightning.

Lightning is the major natural cause of wildfire, estimated to cause 10% of forest fires worldwide. Wildfire can contribute to climate change. Because wildfires emit greenhouse gases, and also affect vegetation cover (which affects how much sunlight is reflected), a lightning wildfire feedback is possible. Multiple studies suggest there could be an increase in Boreal and Arctic lightning-ignited fires in response to climate change. There is evidence that arctic lightning wildfire feedback may also influence vegetation and permafrost cover. The impact of lightning on fires in the tropics remains uncertain.

== In culture ==

The first known photograph of lightning is from 1847, by Thomas Martin Easterly. The first surviving photograph is from 1882, by William Nicholson Jennings.

=== Religion and mythology ===

In many cultures, lightning has been viewed as a sign or part of a deity or a deity in and of itself. These include the Greek god Zeus, the Aztec god Tlaloc, the Mayan God K, Slavic mythology&#x27;s Perun, the Baltic Pērkons/Perkūnas, Thor in Norse mythology, Ukko in Finnish mythology, the Hindu god Indra, the Yoruba god Sango, Illapa in Inca mythology and the Shinto god Raijin. The ancient Etruscans produced guides to divining the future based on the omens supposedly displayed by thunder or lightning. Such use of thunder and lightning in divination is also known as ceraunoscopy, a kind of aeromancy. In the traditional religion of the African Bantu tribes, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. Scriptures in Judaism, Islam and Christianity also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning.

=== In popular culture ===
Although sometimes used figuratively, the idea that lightning never strikes the same place twice is a common myth. In fact, lightning can, and often does, strike the same place more than once. Lightning in a thunderstorm is more likely to strike objects and spots that are more prominent or conductive. For instance, lightning strikes the Empire State Building in New York City on average 23 times per year.

In French and Italian, the expression for &quot;Love at first sight&quot; is &quot;coup de foudre&quot; and &quot;colpo di fulmine&quot;, respectively, which literally translated means &quot;lightning strike&quot;.

=== Political and military culture ===

The bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt. This symbol usually represents power and speed.

Some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power, such as the People&#x27;s Action Party in Singapore, the British Union of Fascists during the 1930s, and the National States&#x27; Rights Party in the United States during the 1950s. The Schutzstaffel, the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, used the Sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning. The German word Blitzkrieg, which means &quot;lightning war&quot;, was a major offensive strategy of the German army during World War II.

The lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units. A lightning bolt is also the NATO symbol for a signal asset.

<doc id="61345" wikidata="Q459194" url="?curid=61345" title="Documentary hypothesis">
<text>The documentary hypothesis (DH) is one of the models used by biblical scholars to explain the origins and composition of the Torah (or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). A version of the documentary hypothesis, frequently identified with the German scholar Julius Wellhausen, was almost universally accepted for most of the 20th century. It posited that the Pentateuch is a compilation of four originally independent documents: the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and Priestly sources, frequently referred to by their initials. The first of these, J, was dated to the Solomonic period (c. 950 BCE). E was dated somewhat later, in the 9th century BCE, and D was dated just before the reign of King Josiah, in the 7th or 8th century BCE. Finally, P was generally dated to the time of Ezra in the 5th century BCE. The sources would have been joined at various points in time by a series of editors or &quot;redactors&quot;.

The consensus around the classical documentary hypothesis has now collapsed. This was triggered in large part by the influential publications of John Van Seters, Hans Heinrich Schmid, and Rolf Rendtorff in the mid-1970s, who argued that J was to be dated no earlier than the time of the Babylonian captivity (597–539 BCE), and rejected the existence of a substantial E source. They also called into question the nature and extent of the three other sources. Van Seters, Schmid, and Rendtorff shared many of the same criticisms of the documentary hypothesis, but were not in complete agreement about what paradigm ought to replace it. As a result, there has been a revival of interest in &quot;fragmentary&quot; and &quot;supplementary&quot; models, frequently in combination with each other and with a documentary model, making it difficult to classify contemporary theories as strictly one or another. Modern scholars also have given up the classical Wellhausian dating of the sources, and generally see the completed Torah as a product of the time of the Persian Achaemenid Empire (probably 450–350 BCE), although some would place its production as late as the Hellenistic period (333–164 BCE), after the conquests of Alexander the Great.

== History of the documentary hypothesis ==

The Torah (or Pentateuch) is collectively the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. According to tradition, they were dictated by God to Moses, but when modern critical scholarship began to be applied to the Bible, it was discovered that the Pentateuch was not the unified text one would expect from a single author. As a result, the Mosaic authorship of the Torah had been largely rejected by leading scholars by the 17th century, with many modern scholars viewing it as a product of a long evolutionary process.

In the mid-18th century, some scholars started a critical study of doublets (parallel accounts of the same incidents), inconsistencies, and changes in style and vocabulary in the Torah. In 1780, Johann Eichhorn, building on the work of the French doctor and exegete Jean Astruc&#x27;s &quot;Conjectures&quot; and others, formulated the &quot;older documentary hypothesis&quot;: the idea that Genesis was composed by combining two identifiable sources, the Jehovist (&quot;J&quot;; also called the Yahwist) and the Elohist (&quot;E&quot;). These sources were subsequently found to run through the first four books of the Torah, and the number was later expanded to three when Wilhelm de Wette identified the Deuteronomist as an additional source found only in Deuteronomy (&quot;D&quot;). Later still the Elohist was split into Elohist and Priestly (&quot;P&quot;) sources, increasing the number to four.

These documentary approaches were in competition with two other models, the fragmentary and the supplementary. The fragmentary hypothesis argued that fragments of varying lengths, rather than continuous documents, lay behind the Torah; this approach accounted for the Torah&#x27;s diversity but could not account for its structural consistency, particularly regarding chronology. The supplementary hypothesis was better able to explain this unity: it maintained that the Torah was made up of a central core document, the Elohist, supplemented by fragments taken from many sources. The supplementary approach was dominant by the early 1860s, but it was challenged by an important book published by Hermann Hupfeld in 1853, who argued that the Pentateuch was made up of four documentary sources, the Priestly, Yahwist, and Elohist intertwined in Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers, and the stand-alone source of Deuteronomy. At around the same period, Karl Heinrich Graf argued that the Yahwist and Elohist were the earliest sources and the Priestly source the latest, while Wilhelm Vatke linked the four to an evolutionary framework: the Yahwist and Elohist to a time of primitive nature and fertility cults, the Deuteronomist to the ethical religion of the Hebrew prophets, and the Priestly source to a form of religion dominated by ritual, sacrifice and law.

=== Wellhausen and the new documentary hypothesis ===

In 1878, Julius Wellhausen published &quot;Geschichte Israels, Bd 1&quot; (&#x27;History of Israel, Vol 1&#x27;). The second edition was printed as &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; (&quot;Prolegomena to the History of Israel&quot;) in 1883, and the work is better known under that name. (The second volume, a synthetic history titled &quot;Israelitische und jüdische Geschichte&quot; [&#x27;Israelite and Jewish History&#x27;], did not appear until 1894 and remains untranslated.) Crucially, this historical portrait was based upon two earlier works of his technical analysis: &quot;Die Composition des Hexateuchs&quot; (&#x27;The Composition of the Hexateuch&#x27;) of 1876–77, and sections on the &quot;historical books&quot; (Judges–Kings) in his 1878 edition of Friedrich Bleek&#x27;s &quot;Einleitung in das Alte Testament&quot; (&#x27;Introduction to the Old Testament&#x27;).

Wellhausen&#x27;s documentary hypothesis owed little to Wellhausen himself but was mainly the work of Hupfeld, Eduard Eugène Reuss, Graf, and others, who in turn had built on earlier scholarship. He accepted Hupfeld&#x27;s four sources and, in agreement with Graf, placed the Priestly work last. J was the earliest document, a product of the 10th century BCE and the court of Solomon; E was from the 9th century BCE in the northern Kingdom of Israel, and had been combined by a redactor (editor) with J to form a document JE; D, the third source, was a product of the 7th century BCE, by 620 BCE, during the reign of King Josiah; P (what Wellhausen first named &quot;Q&quot;) was a product of the priest-and-temple dominated world of the 6th century BCE; and the final redaction, when P was combined with JED to produce the Torah as we now know it.

Wellhausen&#x27;s explanation of the formation of the Torah was also an explanation of the religious history of Israel. The Yahwist and Elohist described a primitive, spontaneous, and personal world, in keeping with the earliest stage of Israel&#x27;s history; in Deuteronomy, he saw the influence of the prophets and the development of an ethical outlook, which he felt represented the pinnacle of Jewish religion; and the Priestly source reflected the rigid, ritualistic world of the priest-dominated, post-exilic period. His work, notable for its detailed and wide-ranging scholarship and close argument, entrenched the &quot;new documentary hypothesis&quot; as the dominant explanation of Pentateuchal origins from the late 19th to the late 20th centuries.

== Critical reassessment ==

In the mid to late 20th century, new criticism of the documentary hypothesis formed. Three major publications of the 1970s caused scholars to reevaluate the assumptions of the documentary hypothesis: &quot;Abraham in History and Tradition&quot; by John Van Seters, &quot;Der sogenannte Jahwist&quot; (&quot;The So-Called Yahwist&quot;) by Hans Heinrich Schmid, and &quot;Das überlieferungsgeschichtliche Problem des Pentateuch&quot; (&quot;The Tradition-Historical Problem of the Pentateuch&quot;) by Rolf Rendtorff. These three authors shared many of the same criticisms of the documentary hypothesis, but were not in agreement about what paradigm ought to replace it.

Van Seters and Schmid both forcefully argued that the Yahwist source could not be dated to the Solomonic period (c. 950 BCE) as posited by the documentary hypothesis. They instead dated J to the period of the Babylonian captivity (597–539 BCE), or the late monarchic period at the earliest. Van Seters also sharply criticized the idea of a substantial Elohist source, arguing that E extends at most to two short passages in Genesis.

Some scholars, following Rendtorff, have come to espouse a fragmentary hypothesis, in which the Pentateuch is seen as a compilation of short, independent narratives, which were gradually brought together into larger units in two editorial phases: the Deuteronomic and the Priestly phases. By contrast, scholars such as John Van Seters advocate a supplementary hypothesis, which posits that the Torah is the result of two major additions—Yahwist and Priestly—to an existing corpus of work.

Some scholars use these newer hypotheses in combination with each other and with a documentary model, making it difficult to classify contemporary theories as strictly one or another. The majority of scholars today continue to recognise Deuteronomy as a source, with its origin in the law-code produced at the court of Josiah as described by De Wette, subsequently given a frame during the exile (the speeches and descriptions at the front and back of the code) to identify it as the words of Moses. Most scholars also agree that some form of Priestly source existed, although its extent, especially its end-point, is uncertain. The remainder is called collectively non-Priestly, a grouping which includes both pre-Priestly and post-Priestly material.

The general trend in recent scholarship is to recognize the final form of the Torah as a literary and ideological unity, based on earlier sources, likely completed during the Persian period (539–333 BCE). A minority of scholars would place its final compilation somewhat later, however, in the Hellenistic period (333–164 BCE).

A revised neo-documentary hypothesis still has adherents, especially in North America and Israel. This distinguishes sources by means of plot and continuity rather than stylistic and linguistic concerns, and does not tie them to stages in the evolution of Israel&#x27;s religious history. Its resurrection of an E source is probably the element most often criticised by other scholars, as it is rarely distinguishable from the classical J source and European scholars have largely rejected it as fragmentary or non-existent.

== The Torah and the history of Israel&#x27;s religion ==

Wellhausen used the sources of the Torah as evidence of changes in the history of Israelite religion as it moved (in his opinion) from free, simple and natural to fixed, formal and institutional. Modern scholars of Israel&#x27;s religion have become much more circumspect in how they use the Old Testament, not least because many have concluded that the Hebrew Bible is not a reliable witness to the religion of ancient Israel and Judah, representing instead the beliefs of only a small segment of the ancient Israelite community centered in Jerusalem and devoted to the exclusive worship of the god Yahweh.

<text>In mathematics, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative. The study of commutative rings is called commutative algebra. Complementarily, noncommutative algebra is the study of ring properties that are not specific to commutative rings. This distinction results from the high number of fundamental properties of commutative rings that do not extend to noncommutative rings.


== Definition and first examples ==

=== Definition ===

A &quot;ring&quot; is a set formula_1 equipped with two binary operations, i.e. operations combining any two elements of the ring to a third. They are called &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;multiplication&quot; and commonly denoted by &quot;formula_2&quot; and &quot;formula_3&quot;; e.g. formula_4 and formula_5. To form a ring these two operations have to satisfy a number of properties: the ring has to be an abelian group under addition as well as a monoid under multiplication, where multiplication distributes over addition; i.e., formula_6. The identity elements for addition and multiplication are denoted formula_7 and formula_8, respectively.

If the multiplication is commutative, i.e.
formula_9
then the ring formula_1 is called &quot;commutative&quot;. In the remainder of this article, all rings will be commutative, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

=== First examples ===
An important example, and in some sense crucial, is the ring of integers formula_11 with the two operations of addition and multiplication. As the multiplication of integers is a commutative operation, this is a commutative ring. It is usually denoted formula_11 as an abbreviation of the German word &quot;Zahlen&quot; (numbers).

A field is a commutative ring where formula_13 and every non-zero element formula_14 is invertible; i.e., has a multiplicative inverse formula_15 such that formula_16. Therefore, by definition, any field is a commutative ring. The rational, real and complex numbers form fields.

If formula_1 is a given commutative ring, then the set of all polynomials in the variable formula_18 whose coefficients are in formula_1 forms the polynomial ring, denoted formula_20. The same holds true for several variables.

If formula_21 is some topological space, for example a subset of some formula_22, real- or complex-valued continuous functions on formula_21 form a commutative ring. The same is true for differentiable or holomorphic functions, when the two concepts are defined, such as for formula_21 a complex manifold.

== Divisibility ==
In contrast to fields, where every nonzero element is multiplicatively invertible, the concept of divisibility for rings is richer. An element formula_14 of ring formula_1 is called a unit if it possesses a multiplicative inverse. Another particular type of element is the zero divisors, i.e. an element formula_14 such that there exists a non-zero element formula_15 of the ring such that formula_29. If formula_1 possesses no non-zero zero divisors, it is called an integral domain (or domain). An element formula_14 satisfying formula_32 for some positive integer formula_33 is called nilpotent.

=== Localizations ===

The &quot;localization&quot; of a ring is a process in which some elements are rendered invertible, i.e. multiplicative inverses are added to the ring. Concretely, if formula_34 is a multiplicatively closed subset of formula_1 (i.e. whenever formula_36 then so is formula_37) then the &quot;localization&quot; of formula_1 at formula_34, or &quot;ring of fractions&quot; with denominators in formula_34, usually denoted formula_41 consists of symbols

subject to certain rules that mimic the cancellation familiar from rational numbers. Indeed, in this language formula_42 is the localization of formula_11 at all nonzero integers. This construction works for any integral domain formula_1 instead of formula_11. The localization formula_46 is a field, called the quotient field of formula_1.

== Ideals and modules ==
Many of the following notions also exist for not necessarily commutative rings, but the definitions and properties are usually more complicated. For example, all ideals in a commutative ring are automatically two-sided, which simplifies the situation considerably.

=== Modules ===

For a ring formula_1, an formula_1-&quot;module&quot; formula_50 is like what a vector space is to a field. That is, elements in a module can be added; they can be multiplied by elements of formula_1 subject to the same axioms as for a vector space.

The study of modules is significantly more involved than the one of vector spaces, since there are modules that do not have any basis, that is, do not contain a spanning set whose elements are linearly independents. A module that has a basis is called a free module, and a submodule of a free module needs not to be free.

A module of finite type is a module that has a finite spanning set. Modules of finite type play a fundamental role in the theory of commutative rings, similar to the role of the finite-dimensional vector spaces in linear algebra. In particular, Noetherian rings (see also &quot;&quot;, below) can be defined as the rings such that every submodule of a module of finite type is also of finite type.

=== Ideals ===

&quot;Ideals&quot; of a ring formula_1 are the submodules of formula_1, i.e., the modules contained in formula_1. In more detail, an ideal formula_55 is a non-empty subset of formula_1 such that for all formula_57 in formula_1, formula_59 and formula_60 in formula_55, both formula_62 and formula_63 are in formula_55. For various applications, understanding the ideals of a ring is of particular importance, but often one proceeds by studying modules in general.

Any ring has two ideals, namely the zero ideal formula_65 and formula_1, the whole ring. These two ideals are the only ones precisely if formula_1 is a field. Given any subset formula_68 of formula_1 (where formula_70 is some index set), the ideal &quot;generated by&quot; formula_71 is the smallest ideal that contains formula_71. Equivalently, it is given by finite linear combinations
formula_73

==== Principal ideal domains ====
If formula_71 consists of a single element formula_57, the ideal generated by formula_71 consists of the multiples of formula_57, i.e., the elements of the form formula_78 for arbitrary elements formula_79. Such an ideal is called a principal ideal. If every ideal is a principal ideal, formula_1 is called a principal ideal ring; two important cases are formula_11 and formula_82, the polynomial ring over a field formula_83. These two are in addition domains, so they are called principal ideal domains.

Unlike for general rings, for a principal ideal domain, the properties of individual elements are strongly tied to the properties of the ring as a whole. For example, any principal ideal domain formula_1 is a unique factorization domain (UFD) which means that any element is a product of irreducible elements, in a (up to reordering of factors) unique way. Here, an element formula_14 in a domain is called irreducible if the only way of expressing it as a product
formula_86
is by either formula_15 or formula_88 being a unit. An example, important in field theory, are irreducible polynomials, i.e., irreducible elements in formula_82, for a field formula_83. The fact that formula_11 is a UFD can be stated more elementarily by saying that any natural number can be uniquely decomposed as product of powers of prime numbers. It is also known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

An element formula_14 is a prime element if whenever formula_14 divides a product formula_94, formula_14 divides formula_15 or formula_88. In a domain, being prime implies being irreducible. The converse is true in a unique factorization domain, but false in general.

==== Factor ring ====
The definition of ideals is such that &quot;dividing&quot; formula_55 &quot;out&quot; gives another ring, the &quot;factor ring&quot; formula_99: it is the set of cosets of formula_55 together with the operations
formula_101 and formula_102.
For example, the ring formula_103 (also denoted formula_104), where formula_33 is an integer, is the ring of integers modulo formula_33. It is the basis of modular arithmetic.

An ideal is &quot;proper&quot; if it is strictly smaller than the whole ring. An ideal that is not strictly contained in any proper ideal is called maximal. An ideal formula_107 is maximal if and only if formula_108 is a field. Except for the zero ring, any ring (with identity) possesses at least one maximal ideal; this follows from Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

=== Noetherian rings ===

A ring is called &quot;Noetherian&quot; (in honor of Emmy Noether, who developed this concept) if every ascending chain of ideals
formula_109
becomes stationary, i.e. becomes constant beyond some index formula_33. Equivalently, any ideal is generated by finitely many elements, or, yet equivalent, submodules of finitely generated modules are finitely generated.

Being Noetherian is a highly important finiteness condition, and the condition is preserved under many operations that occur frequently in geometry. For example, if formula_1 is Noetherian, then so is the polynomial ring formula_112 (by Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem), any localization formula_41, and also any factor ring formula_99.

Any non-Noetherian ring formula_1 is the union of its Noetherian subrings. This fact, known as Noetherian approximation, allows the extension of certain theorems to non-Noetherian rings.

=== Artinian rings ===
A ring is called Artinian (after Emil Artin), if every descending chain of ideals
formula_116
becomes stationary eventually. Despite the two conditions appearing symmetric, Noetherian rings are much more general than Artinian rings. For example, formula_11 is Noetherian, since every ideal can be generated by one element, but is not Artinian, as the chain
formula_118
shows. In fact, by the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem, every Artinian ring is Noetherian. More precisely, Artinian rings can be characterized as the Noetherian rings whose Krull dimension is zero.

== Spectrum of a commutative ring ==

=== Prime ideals ===

As was mentioned above, formula_11 is a unique factorization domain. This is not true for more general rings, as algebraists realized in the 19th century. For example, in
formula_120
there are two genuinely distinct ways of writing 6 as a product:
formula_121
Prime ideals, as opposed to prime elements, provide a way to circumvent this problem. A prime ideal is a proper (i.e., strictly contained in formula_1) ideal formula_123 such that, whenever the product formula_124 of any two ring elements formula_14 and formula_15 is in formula_127 at least one of the two elements is already in formula_128 (The opposite conclusion holds for any ideal, by definition.) Thus, if a prime ideal is principal, it is equivalently generated by a prime element. However, in rings such as formula_129 prime ideals need not be principal. This limits the usage of prime elements in ring theory. A cornerstone of algebraic number theory is, however, the fact that in any Dedekind ring (which includes formula_130 and more generally the ring of integers in a number field) any ideal (such as the one generated by 6) decomposes uniquely as a product of prime ideals.

Any maximal ideal is a prime ideal or, more briefly, is prime. Moreover, an ideal formula_131 is prime if and only if the factor ring formula_132 is an integral domain. Proving that an ideal is prime, or equivalently that a ring has no zero-divisors can be very difficult. Yet another way of expressing the same is to say that the complement formula_133 is multiplicatively closed. The localisation formula_134 is important enough to have its own notation: formula_135. This ring has only one maximal ideal, namely formula_136. Such rings are called local.

=== Spectrum ===
The &quot;spectrum of a ring&quot; formula_137, denoted by formula_138, is the set of all prime ideals of formula_137. It is equipped with a topology, the Zariski topology, which reflects the algebraic properties of formula_137: a basis of open subsets is given by
formula_141 where formula_142 is any ring element.
Interpreting formula_142 as a function that takes the value &quot;f&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; (i.e., the image of &quot;f&quot; in the residue field &quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot;), this subset is the locus where &quot;f&quot; is non-zero. The spectrum also makes precise the intuition that localisation and factor rings are complementary: the natural maps and correspond, after endowing the spectra of the rings in question with their Zariski topology, to complementary open and closed immersions respectively. Even for basic rings, such as illustrated for at the right, the Zariski topology is quite different from the one on the set of real numbers.

The spectrum contains the set of maximal ideals, which is occasionally denoted mSpec (&quot;R&quot;). For an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, mSpec (k[&quot;T&quot;1, ..., &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;] / (&quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;m&quot;)) is in bijection with the set

Thus, maximal ideals reflect the geometric properties of solution sets of polynomials, which is an initial motivation for the study of commutative rings. However, the consideration of non-maximal ideals as part of the geometric properties of a ring is useful for several reasons. For example, the minimal prime ideals (i.e., the ones not strictly containing smaller ones) correspond to the irreducible components of Spec &quot;R&quot;. For a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot;, Spec &quot;R&quot; has only finitely many irreducible components. This is a geometric restatement of primary decomposition, according to which any ideal can be decomposed as a product of finitely many primary ideals. This fact is the ultimate generalization of the decomposition into prime ideals in Dedekind rings.

=== Affine schemes ===
The notion of a spectrum is the common basis of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry proceeds by endowing Spec &quot;R&quot; with a sheaf formula_144 (an entity that collects functions defined locally, i.e. on varying open subsets). The datum of the space and the sheaf is called an affine scheme. Given an affine scheme, the underlying ring &quot;R&quot; can be recovered as the global sections of formula_144. Moreover, this one-to-one correspondence between rings and affine schemes is also compatible with ring homomorphisms: any &quot;f&quot; : &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot; gives rise to a continuous map in the opposite direction

The resulting equivalence of the two said categories aptly reflects algebraic properties of rings in a geometrical manner.

Similar to the fact that manifolds are locally given by open subsets of R&quot;n&quot;, affine schemes are local models for schemes, which are the object of study in algebraic geometry. Therefore, several notions concerning commutative rings stem from geometric intuition.

=== Dimension ===

The &quot;Krull dimension&quot; (or dimension) dim &quot;R&quot; of a ring &quot;R&quot; measures the &quot;size&quot; of a ring by, roughly speaking, counting independent elements in &quot;R&quot;. The dimension of algebras over a field &quot;k&quot; can be axiomatized by four properties:
* The dimension is a local property: .
* The dimension is independent of nilpotent elements: if is nilpotent then .
* The dimension remains constant under a finite extension: if &quot;S&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-algebra which is finitely generated as an &quot;R&quot;-module, then dim &quot;S&quot; = dim &quot;R&quot;.
* The dimension is calibrated by dim . This axiom is motivated by regarding the polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; variables as an algebraic analogue of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space.

The dimension is defined, for any ring &quot;R&quot;, as the supremum of lengths &quot;n&quot; of chains of prime ideals

For example, a field is zero-dimensional, since the only prime ideal is the zero ideal. The integers are one-dimensional, since chains are of the form (0) ⊊ (&quot;p&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; is a prime number. For non-Noetherian rings, and also non-local rings, the dimension may be infinite, but Noetherian local rings have finite dimension. Among the four axioms above, the first two are elementary consequences of the definition, whereas the remaining two hinge on important facts in commutative algebra, the going-up theorem and Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem.

== Ring homomorphisms ==

A &quot;ring homomorphism&quot; or, more colloquially, simply a &quot;map&quot;, is a map such that

These conditions ensure . Similarly as for other algebraic structures, a ring homomorphism is thus a map that is compatible with the structure of the algebraic objects in question. In such a situation &quot;S&quot; is also called an &quot;R&quot;-algebra, by understanding that &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; may be multiplied by some &quot;r&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, by setting
The &quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;image&quot; of &quot;f&quot; are defined by and . The kernel is an ideal of &quot;R&quot;, and the image is a subring of &quot;S&quot;.

A ring homomorphism is called an isomorphism if it is bijective. An example of a ring isomorphism, known as the Chinese remainder theorem, is
formula_146
where is a product of pairwise distinct prime numbers.

Commutative rings, together with ring homomorphisms, form a category. The ring Z is the initial object in this category, which means that for any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique ring homomorphism Z → &quot;R&quot;. By means of this map, an integer &quot;n&quot; can be regarded as an element of &quot;R&quot;. For example, the binomial formula
formula_147
which is valid for any two elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in any commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is understood in this sense by interpreting the binomial coefficients as elements of &quot;R&quot; using this map.
Given two &quot;R&quot;-algebras &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, their tensor product

is again a commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebra. In some cases, the tensor product can serve to find a &quot;T&quot;-algebra which relates to &quot;Z&quot; as &quot;S&quot; relates to &quot;R&quot;. For example,
=== Finite generation ===
An &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;S&quot; is called finitely generated (as an algebra) if there are finitely many elements &quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; such that any element of &quot;s&quot; is expressible as a polynomial in the &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;S&quot; is isomorphic to
A much stronger condition is that &quot;S&quot; is finitely generated as an &quot;R&quot;-module, which means that any &quot;s&quot; can be expressed as a &quot;R&quot;-linear combination of some finite set &quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

== Local rings ==
A ring is called local if it has only a single maximal ideal, denoted by &quot;m&quot;. For any (not necessarily local) ring &quot;R&quot;, the localization

at a prime ideal &quot;p&quot; is local. This localization reflects the geometric properties of Spec &quot;R&quot; &quot;around &quot;p&quot;&quot;. Several notions and problems in commutative algebra can be reduced to the case when &quot;R&quot; is local, making local rings a particularly deeply studied class of rings. The residue field of &quot;R&quot; is defined as

Any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; yields a &quot;k&quot;-vector space given by . Nakayama&#x27;s lemma shows this passage is preserving important information: a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; is zero if and only if is zero.

=== Regular local rings ===

The &quot;k&quot;-vector space &quot;m&quot;/&quot;m&quot;2 is an algebraic incarnation of the cotangent space. Informally, the elements of &quot;m&quot; can be thought of as functions which vanish at the point &quot;p&quot;, whereas &quot;m&quot;2 contains the ones which vanish with order at least 2. For any Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot;, the inequality

holds true, reflecting the idea that the cotangent (or equivalently the tangent) space has at least the dimension of the space Spec &quot;R&quot;. If equality holds true in this estimate, &quot;R&quot; is called a regular local ring. A Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if the ring (which is the ring of functions on the tangent cone)
formula_148
is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over &quot;k&quot;. Broadly speaking, regular local rings are somewhat similar to polynomial rings. Regular local rings are UFD&#x27;s.

Discrete valuation rings are equipped with a function which assign an integer to any element &quot;r&quot;. This number, called the valuation of &quot;r&quot; can be informally thought of as a zero or pole order of &quot;r&quot;. Discrete valuation rings are precisely the one-dimensional regular local rings. For example, the ring of germs of holomorphic functions on a Riemann surface is a discrete valuation ring.

=== Complete intersections ===

By Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem, a foundational result in the dimension theory of rings, the dimension of

is at least &quot;r&quot; − &quot;n&quot;. A ring &quot;R&quot; is called a complete intersection ring if it can be presented in a way that attains this minimal bound. This notion is also mostly studied for local rings. Any regular local ring is a complete intersection ring, but not conversely.

A ring &quot;R&quot; is a &quot;set-theoretic&quot; complete intersection if the reduced ring associated to &quot;R&quot;, i.e., the one obtained by dividing out all nilpotent elements, is a complete intersection. As of 2017, it is in general unknown, whether curves in three-dimensional space are set-theoretic complete intersections.

=== Cohen–Macaulay rings ===
The depth of a local ring &quot;R&quot; is the number of elements in some (or, as can be shown, any) maximal regular sequence, i.e., a sequence &quot;a&quot;1, ..., 
&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ∈ &quot;m&quot; such that all &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are non-zero divisors in

For any local Noetherian ring, the inequality

holds. A local ring in which equality takes place is called a Cohen–Macaulay ring. Local complete intersection rings, and a fortiori, regular local rings are Cohen–Macaulay, but not conversely. Cohen–Macaulay combine desirable properties of regular rings (such as the property of being universally catenary rings, which means that the (co)dimension of primes is well-behaved), but are also more robust under taking quotients than regular local rings.

== Constructing commutative rings ==
There are several ways to construct new rings out of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain properties of the ring so as to make it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions is called normal. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily regular. Rendering a ring normal is known as &quot;normalization&quot;.

=== Completions ===
If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal in a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the powers of &quot;I&quot; form topological neighborhoods of &quot;0&quot; which allow &quot;R&quot; to be viewed as a topological ring. This topology is called the &quot;I&quot;-adic topology. &quot;R&quot; can then be completed with respect to this topology. Formally, the &quot;I&quot;-adic completion is the inverse limit of the rings &quot;R&quot;/&quot;In&quot;. For example, if &quot;k&quot; is a field, &quot;k&quot;&quot;X&quot;, the formal power series ring in one variable over &quot;k&quot;, is the &quot;I&quot;-adic completion of &quot;k&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] where &quot;I&quot; is the principal ideal generated by &quot;X&quot;. This ring serves as an algebraic analogue of the disk. Analogously, the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers is the completion of Z with respect to the principal ideal (&quot;p&quot;). Any ring that is isomorphic to its own completion, is called complete.

Complete local rings satisfy Hensel&#x27;s lemma, which roughly speaking allows extending solutions (of various problems) over the residue field &quot;k&quot; to &quot;R&quot;.

== Homological notions ==
Several deeper aspects of commutative rings have been studied using methods from homological algebra. lists some open questions in this area of active research.

=== Projective modules and Ext functors ===
Projective modules can be defined to be the direct summands of free modules. If &quot;R&quot; is local, any finitely generated projective module is actually free, which gives content to an analogy between projective modules and vector bundles. The Quillen–Suslin theorem asserts that any finitely generated projective module over &quot;k&quot;[&quot;T&quot;1, ..., &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;] (&quot;k&quot; a field) is free, but in general these two concepts differ. 
A local Noetherian ring is regular if and only if its global dimension is finite, say &quot;n&quot;, which means that any finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module has a resolution by projective modules of length at most &quot;n&quot;.

The proof of this and other related statements relies on the usage of homological methods, such as the
Ext functor. This functor is the derived functor of the functor

The latter functor is exact if &quot;M&quot; is projective, but not otherwise: for a surjective map of &quot;R&quot;-modules, a map need not extend to a map . The higher Ext functors measure the non-exactness of the Hom-functor. The importance of this standard construction in homological algebra stems can be seen from the fact that a local Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot; with residue field &quot;k&quot; is regular if and only if

vanishes for all large enough &quot;n&quot;. Moreover, the dimensions of these Ext-groups, known as Betti numbers, grow polynomially in &quot;n&quot; if and only if &quot;R&quot; is a local complete intersection ring. A key argument in such considerations is the Koszul complex, which provides an explicit free resolution of the residue field &quot;k&quot; of a local ring &quot;R&quot; in terms of a regular sequence.

=== Flatness ===
The tensor product is another non-exact functor relevant in the context of commutative rings: for a general &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, the functor

is only right exact. If it is exact, &quot;M&quot; is called flat. If &quot;R&quot; is local, any finitely presented flat module is free of finite rank, thus projective. Despite being defined in terms of homological algebra, flatness has profound geometric implications. For example, if an &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;S&quot; is flat, the dimensions of the fibers

(for prime ideals &quot;p&quot; in &quot;R&quot;) have the &quot;expected&quot; dimension, namely .

== Properties ==
By Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem, every finite division ring is commutative, and therefore a finite field. Another condition ensuring commutativity of a ring, due to Jacobson, is the following: for every element &quot;r&quot; of &quot;R&quot; there exists an integer such that . If, for every &quot;r&quot;, the ring is called Boolean ring. More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.

== Generalizations ==

=== Graded-commutative rings ===

A graded ring is called graded-commutative if, for all homogeneous elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;,

If the &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot; are connected by differentials ∂ such that an abstract form of the product rule holds, i.e.,

&quot;R&quot; is called a commutative differential graded algebra (cdga). An example is the complex of differential forms on a manifold, with the multiplication given by the exterior product, is a cdga. The cohomology of a cdga is a graded-commutative ring, sometimes referred to as the cohomology ring. A broad range examples of graded rings arises in this way. For example, the Lazard ring is the ring of cobordism classes of complex manifolds.

A graded-commutative ring with respect to a grading by Z/2 (as opposed to Z) is called a superalgebra.

A related notion is an almost commutative ring, which means that &quot;R&quot; is filtered in such a way that the associated graded ring

is commutative. An example is the Weyl algebra and more general rings of differential operators.

=== Simplicial commutative rings ===
A simplicial commutative ring is a simplicial object in the category of commutative rings. They are building blocks for (connective) derived algebraic geometry. A closely related but more general notion is that of E∞-ring.

<text>Émilie Chauchoin (; September 13, 1903July 30, 1996), professionally known as Claudette Colbert ( , ), was an American actress. Colbert began her career in Broadway productions during the late 1920s and progressed to films with the advent of talking pictures. Initially contracted to Paramount Pictures, Colbert became one of the few major actresses of the period who worked freelance; that is to say, independently of the studio system. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Colbert the 12th-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema.

With her Mid-Atlantic accent, versatility, witty dialogues, aristocratic demeanor, and flair for light comedy and emotional drama, Colbert became one of the most popular stars of the 1930s and 1940s. In all, Colbert acted in more than 60 movies. Among her frequent co-stars were Fred MacMurray in seven films (1935–1949), and Fredric March in four (1930–1933).

Colbert won the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), and received two other Academy Award nominations during her career. Her other notable films include &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934), &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (1942) and &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944).

By the mid-1950s Colbert had turned from motion pictures to television and stage work; she earned a Tony Award nomination for &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; in 1959. Her career began to wane in the early 1960s. In the late 1970s she experienced a comeback in the theater, and received a Sarah Siddons Award for her Chicago theater work in 1980. Her television appearance in &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot; (1987) earned her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award nomination.

==Early life==
Émilie &quot;Lily&quot; Chauchoin was born in 1903 in Saint-Mandé, France, to Jeanne (, with British Channel Islands heritage) and Georges Chauchoin.

Although christened &quot;Émilie&quot;, she was called &quot;Lily&quot; after Jersey-born actress Lillie Langtry, and because an unmarried aunt of the same name—her maternal grandmother&#x27;s adopted child, Emily Loew—was living with the family. Colbert&#x27;s brother, Charles Chauchoin, was also born in the Bailiwick of Jersey. Jeanne held various occupations, while Georges owned pastry and bonbon shops, and was also a major stockholder of an ink factory in which he suffered business setbacks. Colbert&#x27;s grandmother Marie Loew had been to the U.S., and Georges&#x27; brother-in-law Charles Loew was living in New York City. Marie was willing to help Georges financially, but also encouraged him to try his luck in the U.S.

To pursue more employment opportunities, Colbert and her family, including Marie and Emily Loew, immigrated to Manhattan in 1906.

They lived in a fifth-floor walk-up at 53rd Street. Colbert stated that she was always climbing those stairs until the age of 18. Her parents formally changed her legal name to Lily Claudette Chauchoin. Georges worked as a minor official in the foreign department at First National City Bank, and the family was naturalized in 1912. Before Colbert entered public school, she quickly learnt British English from Marie, and grew up bilingual, speaking both English and French. She had hoped to become a painter ever since she first gripped a pencil. Her brother was drafted 1917 as private first class. After the First World War, he studied at the School of Military Aeronautics at Cornell University. Colbert&#x27;s mother was an opera music fan, and her aunt was a dressmaker.

Colbert studied at Washington Irving High School, which was known for its strong arts program. Her speech teacher, Alice Rostetter, encouraged her to audition for a play Rostetter had written. In 1921, Colbert made her stage debut at the Provincetown Playhouse in revivals of Rostetter&#x27;s &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Veil&quot; and &quot;Aria da Capo&quot; by Edna St. Vincent Millay, at the age of 17. Her interests, though, still leaned towards painting, fashion design, and commercial art.

Intending to become a fashion designer, she attended the Art Students League of New York, where she paid for her art education by working in a dress shop. After attending a party with writer Anne Morrison, Colbert was offered a bit part in Morrison&#x27;s play, and appeared on the Broadway stage in a small role in &quot;The Wild Westcotts&quot; (1923). She had used the name Claudette, instead of Lily, since high school; for her stage name, she added her paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, Colbert. Her father died in 1925; her grandmother died in New York in the mid-1930s at the age of 88.

== Career ==

=== The beginnings, 1924–1927 ===
Colbert worked in a string of mostly short-lived shows in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston and Connecticut, which enabled her to gain experience in different genres. In 1924 the actor Leslie Howard met her, was impressed by her ability to speak with both Mid-Atlantic and British accents, and contacted the producer Al Woods to cast her in Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;The Fake&quot;, but she was replaced by Frieda Inescort before it opened. After signing a five-year contract with Woods, Colbert played &quot;ingenue&quot; roles on Broadway from 1925 to 1929. During this period she disliked being typecast as a French maid. By 1925 she was having success in the comedy &quot;A Kiss in a Taxi&quot;, which ran for 103 performances over a two-month period. Columnists sang the praises of her unconventional beauty and her power to enrapture an audience. Colbert was again acclaimed as a carnival snake charmer in the Broadway production of &quot;The Barker&quot; (1927), and she reprised the role in London&#x27;s West End. She was noticed by theatrical producer Leland Hayward, who suggested her for the heroine role in the silent film &quot;For the Love of Mike&quot; (1927). Now believed to be lost, the film did not fare well at the box office.

=== The early films, 1928–1934 ===

In 1928, Colbert signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. A demand existed for stage actors who could handle dialogue in the new &quot;talkies&quot;, and Colbert&#x27;s elegance and musical voice were among her best assets. Her distinctive high-cheekboned
beauty drew attention in &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot; (1929), but at first she did not like film acting. Her earliest films were produced in New York. During the filming of &quot;The Lady Lies&quot; (also 1929), she was also appearing nightly in the play &quot;See Naples and Die&quot;. &quot;The Lady Lies&quot; was a box-office success. At this period, many film critics wrote her having potential to be the screen&#x27;s next big star. In 1930, she starred opposite Maurice Chevalier in &quot;The Big Pond&quot;, which was filmed in both English and French for release in their respective markets as was common during the early sound era. With her first husband Norman Foster she co-starred in the film &quot;Young Man of Manhattan&quot; (1930), for which he received negative reviews as one of her weakest leading men.

Colbert co-starred with Fredric March in &quot;Manslaughter&quot; (1930), acclaimed again by critics for her performance as a woman charged with vehicular manslaughter. She was paired with March again in &quot;Honor Among Lovers&quot; (1931), which was popular at that time; he was also originally cast as her co-star in &quot;His Woman&quot; (1931), but was replaced by Gary Cooper. Colbert also starred in &quot;Mysterious Mr. Parkes&quot; (1931), a French-language version of &quot;Slightly Scarlet&quot; for the European market, although her French was tinged with an English accent after American life. It was also screened in the United States. She sang and played piano/violin in the Ernst Lubitsch musical &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot; (1931), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture as well as being a box-office hit and critical success. 

Colbert&#x27;s career got a further boost when she played the supporting role as &quot;femme fatale&quot; Poppaea in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s historical epic &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; (1932), opposite Fredric March and Charles Laughton. In one of the best-remembered scenes of her film career, she bathes nude in a marble pool filled with asses&#x27; milk. The film was the highest-grossing picture of the year in the United States. 

In 1933, Colbert renegotiated her contract with Paramount to allow her to appear in films for other studios. The pioneering screwball comedy film &quot;Three-Cornered Moon&quot; reached No. 9 in the National Board of Review Awards in 1933. Her musical voice, a contralto that footnotes list as being coached by Bing Crosby, was also featured in &quot;Torch Singer&quot; (1933), co-starring Ricardo Cortez and David Manners. Partly as results, she was ranked as the year&#x27;s 13th box-office star. By 1933, she had appeared in 21 films, averaging four per year. Many of her early films were dramatics, and her performances were admired. Colbert&#x27;s leading roles were down-to-earth and diverse, highlighting her versatility.

Colbert was initially reluctant to appear in the screwball comedy &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). The studio agreed to pay her $50,000 for the role and guaranteed filming would be done within four weeks so she could take a planned vacation. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the film.

In &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934), Colbert played the title role opposite Warren William and Henry Wilcoxon. It was the second highest-grossing picture of that year in the United States. Thereafter, Colbert did not wish to be portrayed as overtly sexual and later refused such roles. She was loaned to Universal Pictures for &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1934), which was another box-office success. Those three films were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in the next year; Colbert is the only actress to date to star in three films nominated for Best Motion Picture in the same year.

===Mid-career, 1935–1944===
Colbert&#x27;s rising profile internationally allowed her to renegotiate her contract, which raised her salary. For 1935 and 1936, she was listed sixth and eighth in Quigley&#x27;s annual &quot;Top-Ten Money-Making Stars Poll&quot;. She received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the hospital drama &quot;Private Worlds&quot; (1935).

In 1936, Colbert signed a new contract with Paramount, making her Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actress. When the studio renewed her contract in 1938, she was again reported to be Hollywood&#x27;s top-paid actress, with a salary of $426,924. At the peak of her popularity in the late 1930s, she earned $150,000 per film. In 1937 and 1938, she was listed as the fourteenth and sixth (respectively) top money-making woman in the U.S.

Colbert spent the rest of the 1930s deftly alternating between romantic comedies and dramas: &quot;She Married Her Boss&quot; (1935) with Melvyn Douglas; &quot;The Gilded Lily&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Bride Comes Home&quot; (1935), both with Fred MacMurray; &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936) with Ronald Colman; &quot;Zaza&quot; (1939) with Herbert Marshall; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot; (1939) with James Stewart.

Colbert was tall. One columnist wrote that Colbert placed her career &quot;ahead of everything, save possibly her marriage&quot;, and that she had a strong sense of what was best for her, and a &quot;deep-rooted desire to be in shape, efficient, and under control&quot;. A biographer wrote that Colbert &quot;helped define femininity for her generation with her chic manner&quot;. Colbert once said, &quot;I know what&#x27;s best for me—after all, I have been in the Claudette Colbert business longer than anybody.&quot;

Colbert was very particular about how she appeared on-screen, and believed her face was difficult to light and photograph. She insisted on having the right side of her face away from the camera when shooting close-up, because of a small bump from a broken nose as a child. This sometimes required movie sets to be redesigned. During the filming of &quot;Tovarich&quot; (1937), director Anatole Litvak favored co-starring Charles Boyer over her in the camera angles, so she got very frustrated.
Gary Cooper was terrified at the prospect of working with Colbert in his first comedy, &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Eighth Wife&quot; (1938), considering Colbert an expert in the genre.

&quot;Midnight&quot; (1939) with Don Ameche, directed by Mitchell Leisen and written by 
Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, was one of her best comedy films. Ernst Lubitsch and Mitchell Leisen were her particularly favorite film directors working with.

Colbert learnt about lighting and cinematography, and refused to begin filming until she was satisfied that she would be shown to her best advantage. &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1939) with Henry Fonda was her first color film, and was the 10th-grossing picture of the year in the United States. However, she mistrusted the relatively new Technicolor process, and fearing she would not photograph well, preferred thereafter to be filmed in black-and-white.

During this time, she began performing on CBS&#x27;s popular radio program &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, and was heard in 22 episodes between 1935 and 1954. She also participated in 13 episodes of radio&#x27;s &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, between 1939 and 1952.

In 1940, Colbert was offered a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures that would have paid her $200,000 a year; she declined the offer after learning she could command $150,000 per film as a freelance artist. She secured roles in several prestigious films and this period marked the height of her earning power. As a supporting role, Colbert co-starred with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy in &quot;Boom Town&quot;, released by MGM in 1940 and was the highest-grossing picture of the year in the United States. However, Colbert once often said that &quot;Arise, My Love&quot; (1940) was her favorite of all her movies.
 It won the Academy Award for Best Story.

Preston Sturges&#x27; mature &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (1942) had been accepted some re-evaluation over the years as a comedic classic, where she did one of the best performances of her film career, which featured such a thing as beauty that speaks of intelligence. She again became the industry&#x27;s highest-paid star in 1942.

During filming of &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; (1943), her co-star Paulette Goddard preferred working with the other co-star Veronica Lake, over Colbert; Colbert felt that the younger actress had treated her like an &quot;old lady&quot;. Goddard said that Colbert &quot;was at [my] eyes at every moment&quot;. Goddard insisted that portions of the script be rewritten so that her role was as large as Colbert&#x27;s. This was unusual for Colbert, who was otherwise known for maintaining high standards of professionalism. For example, from her early film career, she offered acting advice to her less experienced co-stars.
Impressed by Colbert&#x27;s role in &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot;, David O. Selznick approached her to play the lead in &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944). Colbert was initially reluctant to appear as a mother of teenaged children, but Selznick eventually convinced her to take the role. Released in June 1944, the film made almost $5 million at the US box office and was the year&#x27;s third highest-grossing picture. One critic praised aspects of the film, but particularly Colbert&#x27;s work. Partly as a result, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

During the World War II, she also volunteered with the Red Cross.

===Middle years, 1945–1961===
In 1945, Colbert ended her association with Paramount and continued to freelance in such films as &quot;Guest Wife&quot; (1945) with Don Ameche. She starred opposite John Wayne in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Without Reservations&quot; (1946), which grossed $3 million in the U.S. While working on it, director Mervyn LeRoy described Colbert as an &quot;interesting&quot; lady to work with, recalling her habit of not watching where she was going and constantly bumping into things. Praised for her sense of style and fashion, Colbert ensured throughout her career that she was impeccably groomed and costumed. For the melodrama &quot;Tomorrow Is Forever&quot; (1946), Jean Louis was hired to create 18 changes of wardrobe for her. &quot;Tomorrow is Forever&quot; and &quot;The Secret Heart&quot; (also 1946) were also substantial commercial successes, and Colbert&#x27;s popularity during 1947 led her to place 9th in Quigley&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Money-Making Stars Poll&quot;.

She achieved great success opposite Fred MacMurray in the comedy &quot;The Egg and I&quot; (1947), which was the year&#x27;s second-highest grossing picture, and later acknowledged as the 12th-most profitable American film of the 1940s. The suspense film &quot;Sleep, My Love&quot; (1948) with Robert Cummings was a modest commercial success. By 1949, she still ranked as the 22nd-highest box-office star.

The romantic comedy &quot;Bride for Sale&quot; (1949), wherein Colbert played part of a love triangle that included George Brent and Robert Young, was well-reviewed. Her performance in the Pacific war film &quot;Three Came Home&quot; (1950) was also praised by critics. However, the mystery melodrama &quot;The Secret Fury&quot; (1950), distributed by RKO Studios, received mixed reviews. During this period, Colbert was unable to work beyond 5 p.m. each day due to orders from her doctor. While Colbert still looked like a young woman, she found it difficult making the transition to playing more mature characters as she entered middle age. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m a very good comedienne, but I was always fighting that image, too.&quot;

In 1949, Colbert was asked to play the lead role in &quot;All About Eve&quot;, because the producer felt that she best represented the style he envisioned for the part. However, Colbert severely injured her back, forcing her to abandon the picture shortly before filming began. Bette Davis was cast, instead. In later life, Colbert said, &quot;I just never had the luck to play bitches.&quot;

In the early 1950s, Colbert traveled to Europe for tax purposes and joined fewer films. &quot;The Planter&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1952) was a success in British market. She played a small role in &quot;Royal Affairs in Versailles&quot; (1954), her only film with a French director (Sacha Guitry). Colbert had found the directorial method disappointing, which was on the heavy-handed and ponderous. It was screened in the United States in 1957.

In 1954, Colbert turned down a million-dollar broadcast deal with NBC-TV, but made a pact with CBS-TV to star in several teleplays. After a successful appearance in a television version of &quot;The Royal Family&quot; (a parody of the Barrymore family in &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; series), she took on more than 20 television works. She starred in television adaptations of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; in 1956 and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; in 1959, and guest-starred on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

In 1956, Colbert hosted the 28th Academy Awards ceremony.

In 1957, she was cast as Lucy Bradford, wife of schoolteacher Jim Bradford (Jeff Morrow), in the &quot;Blood in the Dust&quot; episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;. In the story, Jim refuses to back down when a gunman orders him to leave town, and Lucy is distressed because Jim hasn&#x27;t fired a weapon since he was in the Civil War.
In the show&#x27;s 1960 episode &quot;So Young the Savage Land&quot;, she played Beth Brayden, who becomes disillusioned with her rancher-husband Jim (John Dehner) when he turns to violence to protect their property.

In 1958, she returned to Broadway in &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Best Actress Tony Award.
She made a brief return to the screen, played the supporting role as the mother of Troy Donahue in &quot;Parrish&quot; (1961). It was her last appearance on the big screen. The film was a commercial success, but Colbert received little attention, and she directed her agent to end any further attempts to generate interest in her as a TV actress. Even at this period, she still looked younger than her actual age.

===Later career, 1963–1987===
Colbert made successful Broadway appearances in &quot;The Irregular Verb to Love&quot; (1963); in &quot;The Kingfisher&quot; (1978), with co-star Rex Harrison; and in Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; (1985), also with Harrison. She told an interviewer, &quot;Audiences always sound like they&#x27;re glad to see me, and I&#x27;m damned glad to see them.&quot;　

She appeared in a supporting role in the television miniseries &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot; (1987), which was a ratings success, and for which she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy Award. Towards the end of her life, she explained why she had never written her autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;ve been happy, and that&#x27;s no story.&quot;

Modern critics have pointed out that Colbert had a unique set of assets—her heart-shaped face, distinct facial features, curly hair, aristocratic manner, relaxed acting, little mysterious, and intelligent style,—that distinguishes her from other classic cinema stars through the 1930s and 1940s. In her comedies, she invariably played shrewd, self-reliant women; unlike many of her contemporaries, though, she rarely engaged in physical comedy. Her characters were more likely to be observers and commentators.

==Personal life==
In 1928, Colbert married actor and director Norman Foster, with whom she co-starred in the Broadway show &quot;The Barker&quot;. Their marriage remained a secret for many years while they lived in separate homes.

In Los Angeles, Colbert shared a home with her mother, Jeanne Chauchoin, who disliked Foster and reputedly did not allow him into the home. Colbert and Foster divorced in 1935 in Mexico.

On Christmas Eve, 1935, in Yuma, Arizona, Colbert married Dr. Joel Pressman, who eventually became a professor and chief of the head and neck surgery department of UCLA Medical School. She gave Pressman a Beechcraft airplane as a present. They purchased a ranch in northern California, where Colbert enjoyed horseback riding and her husband kept show cattle. During this time, Colbert drove a Lincoln Continental and a Ford Thunderbird. The marriage lasted 33 years, until Pressman&#x27;s death from liver cancer in 1968.

Jeanne reportedly envied her daughter, preferred her son&#x27;s company, and made Colbert&#x27;s brother Charles serve as his sister&#x27;s agent. Charles used the surname Wendling, borrowed from Jeanne&#x27;s paternal grandmother Rose Wendling. He served as Colbert&#x27;s business manager for a time, and was credited with negotiating some of her more lucrative contracts in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In 1942, Charles enlisted to take part in World War Two. Colbert&#x27;s uncle Charles Loew died in 1953, and her aunt Emily Loew in 1954.

Although virtually retired from motion pictures since the mid-1950s, Colbert continued to maintain an upscale lifestyle. She had a country house in Palm Springs for weekends. An advertising executive said, &quot;Claudette was extravagant; I never, ever saw her question the price of anything.&quot; In 1963, Colbert sold her a Lloyd Wright-designed residence in Holmby Hills, and she and Dr. Pressman rented a small house in Beverly Hills.

In 1958, she met Verna Hull, a wealthy painter, photographer, and the stepdaughter of a Sears Roebuck heiress. They had a nine-year friendship that included travel, and an interest in art, and they rented twin New York penthouses. When Colbert bought a house in Barbados in the early 1960s, Hull bought a house next door, amid rumors that their friendship was a romantic one, which Colbert denied. The friendship ended after an argument that took place as Colbert&#x27;s husband lay dying, during which Hull insisted that Pressman would not only take his own life, but Colbert&#x27;s as well, rather than die alone. Pressman died on February 26, 1968.

Colbert was a lifelong Republican.

===Final years and death===
For years, Colbert divided her time between her Manhattan apartment and her vacation home in Speightstown, Barbados. The latter, purchased from a British gentleman and nicknamed Bellerive, was the island&#x27;s only plantation house fronting the beach. Her permanent address remained Manhattan.

When her mother Jeanne died in 1970, and her brother Charles in 1971, Colbert&#x27;s only surviving relative was her brother&#x27;s daughter, Coco Lewis.

Colbert suffered a series of small strokes during the last three years of her life. She died in 1996 in Barbados, where she had employed a housekeeper and two cooks. She was 92. Her remains were transported to New York City for cremation and funeral services.

A requiem mass was later held at Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan. Her ashes are laid to rest in the Godings Bay Church Cemetery, Speightstown, Saint Peter, Barbados, alongside her mother and second husband.

Colbert never had children. She left most of her estate, estimated at $3.5 million and including her Manhattan apartment and Bellerive, to longtime friend Helen O&#x27;Hagan, a retired director of corporate relations at Saks Fifth Avenue. Colbert had met O&#x27;Hagan in 1961 on the set of &quot;Parrish&quot;, her last film, and they became best friends around 1970.

After Pressman&#x27;s death, Colbert instructed her friends to treat O&#x27;Hagan as they had Pressman, &quot;as her spouse&quot;. Although O&#x27;Hagan was financially comfortable without the generous bequest, Bellerive was sold for over $2 million to David Geffen. Colbert&#x27;s will also left $150,000 to her niece Coco Lewis; a trust of over $100,000 to UCLA, in Pressman&#x27;s memory; and $75,000 to Marie Corbin, her Bajan housekeeper.

<text>In mathematics, a Laurent polynomial (named
after Pierre Alphonse Laurent) in one variable over a field formula_1 is a linear combination of positive and negative powers of the variable with coefficients in formula_1. Laurent polynomials in formula_3 form a ring denoted formula_4. They differ from ordinary polynomials in that they may have terms of negative degree. The construction of Laurent polynomials may be iterated, leading to the ring of Laurent polynomials in several variables. Laurent polynomials are of particular importance in the study of complex variables.

== Definition ==
A Laurent polynomial with coefficients in a field formula_1 is an expression of the form

: formula_6

where formula_3 is a formal variable, the summation index formula_8 is an integer (not necessarily positive) and only finitely many coefficients formula_9 are non-zero. Two Laurent polynomials are equal if their coefficients are equal. Such expressions can be added, multiplied, and brought back to the same form by reducing similar terms. Formulas for addition and multiplication are exactly the same as for the ordinary polynomials, with the only difference that both positive and negative powers of formula_3 can be present:

:formula_11
and
:formula_12

Since only finitely many coefficients formula_13 and formula_14 are non-zero, all sums in effect have only finitely many terms, and hence represent Laurent polynomials.

== Properties ==

* A Laurent polynomial over formula_15 may be viewed as a Laurent series in which only finitely many coefficients are non-zero.
* The ring of Laurent polynomials formula_16 is an extension of the polynomial ring formula_17 obtained by &quot;inverting formula_3&quot;. More rigorously, it is the localization of the polynomial ring in the multiplicative set consisting of the non-negative powers of formula_3. Many properties of the Laurent polynomial ring follow from the general properties of localization.
* The ring of Laurent polynomials is a subring of the rational functions.
* The ring of Laurent polynomials over a field is Noetherian (but not Artinian).
* If formula_20 is an integral domain, the units of the Laurent polynomial ring formula_16 have the form formula_22, where formula_23 is a unit of formula_20 and formula_8 is an integer. In particular, if formula_26 is a field then the units of formula_27 have the form formula_28, where formula_29 is a non-zero element of formula_26.
* The Laurent polynomial ring formula_31 is isomorphic to the group ring of the group formula_32 of integers over formula_20. More generally, the Laurent polynomial ring in formula_34 variables is isomorphic to the group ring of the free abelian group of rank formula_34. It follows that the Laurent polynomial ring can be endowed with a structure of a commutative, cocommutative Hopf algebra.

<doc id="61354" wikidata="Q95019" url="?curid=61354" title="Norma Shearer">
<text>Edith Norma Shearer (August 11, 1902June 12, 1983) was a Canadian-American actress who was active on film from 1919 through 1942. Shearer often played spunky, sexually liberated women. She appeared in adaptations of Noël Coward, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and William Shakespeare, and was the first five-time Academy Award acting nominee, winning Best Actress for &quot;The Divorcee&quot; (1930).

Reviewing Shearer&#x27;s work, Mick LaSalle called her a feminist pioneer, or &quot;the exemplar of sophisticated modern womanhood and ... the first American film actress to make it chic and acceptable to be single and not a virgin on screen&quot;.

== Early life ==
Shearer was of Scottish, English, and Irish descent. Her childhood was spent in Montreal, where she was educated at Montreal High School for Girls and Westmount High School. Her life was one of privilege, due to the success of her father&#x27;s construction business. However, the marriage between her parents was unhappy. Andrew Shearer was prone to manic depression and &quot;moved like a shadow or a ghost around the house.” Her mother was Edith Mary (née Fisher) Shearer. Young Norma was interested in music, but after seeing a vaudeville show for her ninth birthday, she announced her intention to become an actress. Edith offered support, but as Shearer entered adolescence, she became secretly fearful that her daughter&#x27;s physical flaws would jeopardize her chances. Norma Shearer &quot;had no illusions about the image I saw in the mirror&quot;. She acknowledged her &quot;dumpy figure, with shoulders too broad, legs too sturdy, hands too blunt&quot;, and was acutely aware of her small eyes that appeared crossed due to a cast in her left eye. By her own admission, she was &quot;ferociously ambitious&quot; even when she was young.

The childhood and adolescence that Shearer once described as &quot;a pleasant dream&quot; ended in 1918 when her father&#x27;s company collapsed, and her older sister Athole suffered her first serious mental breakdown. Forced to move into a small, dreary house in a &quot;modest&quot; Montreal suburb, Shearer found her determined attitude strengthened by the sudden plunge into poverty: &quot;At an early age, I formed a philosophy about failure. Perhaps an endeavor, like my father&#x27;s business, could fail, but that didn&#x27;t mean Father had failed.&quot;

Edith Shearer thought otherwise. Within weeks, she had left her husband and moved into a cheap boarding house with her two daughters. A few months later, encouraged by her brother, who believed his niece should try her luck in &quot;the picture business&quot;, then operating largely on the East Coast of the United States, Edith sold her daughter&#x27;s piano and the family dog. In her pocket was a letter of introduction for Norma, acquired from a local theatre owner, to Florenz Ziegfeld, who was preparing a new season of his famous &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early days===
In January 1920, the three Shearer women arrived in New York, each of them dressed up for the occasion. &quot;I had my hair in little curls&quot;, Shearer remembered, &quot;and I felt very ambitious and proud.&quot; Her heart sank, however, when she saw their rented apartment: &quot;There was one double bed, a cot with no mattress and a stove with one gas jet. The communal bathroom was at the end of a long, dimly lit hallway. Athole and I took turns sleeping with mother in the bed, but sleep was impossible anyway—the elevated trains rattled right past our window every few minutes.&quot;

The introduction to Ziegfeld proved equally disastrous. He turned Shearer down flat, reportedly calling her a &quot;dog&quot;, and criticized her crossed eyes and stubby legs. She continued doing the rounds with her determination undimmed: &quot;I learned that Universal Pictures was looking for eight pretty girls to serve as extras. Athole and I showed up and found 50 girls ahead of us. An assistant casting director walked up and down looking us over. He passed up the first three and picked the fourth. The fifth and sixth were unattractive, but the seventh would do, and so on, down the line until seven had been selected—and he was still some ten feet ahead of us. I did some quick thinking. I coughed loudly, and when the man looked in the direction of the cough, I stood on my tiptoes and smiled right at him. Recognizing the awkward ruse to which I&#x27;d resorted, he laughed openly and walked over to me and said, &#x27;You win, Sis. You&#x27;re Number Eight.

Other extra parts followed, including one in &quot;Way Down East&quot;, directed by D. W. Griffith. Taking advantage of a break in filming and standing shrewdly near a powerful arc light, Shearer introduced herself to Griffith and began to confide her hopes for stardom. &quot;The Master looked down at me, studied my upturned face in the glare of the arc, and shook his eagle head. Eyes no good, he said. A cast in one and far too blue; blue eyes always looked blank in close-up. You&#x27;ll never make it, he declared, and turned solemnly away.&quot;

Still undeterred, Shearer risked some of her savings on a consultation with Dr. William Bates, a pioneer in the treatment of strabismus. He wrote out a series of muscle-strengthening exercises that after many years of daily practice would successfully conceal Shearer&#x27;s cast for long periods of time on the screen. She spent hours in front of the mirror, exercising her eyes and striking poses that concealed or improved the physical flaws noted by Ziegfeld or Griffith. At night, she sat in the galleries of Broadway theatres, studying the entrances of Ina Claire, Lynn Fontanne, and Katharine Cornell.

In desperate need of money, Shearer resorted to some modeling work, which proved successful. On her modeling career, she commented: &quot;I could smile at a cake of laundry soap as if it were dinner at the Ritz. I posed with a strand of imitation pearls. I posed in dust-cap and house dress with a famous mop, for dental paste and for soft drink, holding my mouth in a whistling pose until it all but froze that way.&quot; She became the new model for Kelly-Springfield Tires, was bestowed with the title &quot;Miss Lotta Miles&quot; and depicted seated inside the rim of a tire, smiling down at traffic from a large floodlit billboard.

Finally, a year after her arrival in New York, she received a break in film: fourth billing in a B-movie titled &quot;The Stealers&quot; (1920). In January 1923, Shearer received an offer from Louis B. Mayer Pictures, a studio in Northeast Los Angeles that was run by a small-time producer, Louis B. Mayer. Irving Thalberg had moved to Louis B. Mayer Pictures as vice president on February 15, 1923, but had already sent a telegram to Shearer&#x27;s agent, inviting her to come to the studio. After three years of hardship, she found herself signing a contract. It called for $250 a week for six months, with options for renewal and a test for a leading role in a major film called &quot;The Wanters&quot;.

=== Hollywood ===
Shearer left New York around February 17. Accompanied by her mother, she felt &quot;dangerously sure of herself&quot; as her train neared Los Angeles. When she was not welcomed, even an hour after her arrival, she realized that there would be no star treatment from her new studio. Dispirited, she allowed Edith to hail a taxi.

The next morning, Shearer went to the Mayer Company on Mission Road to meet with Thalberg. Shearer was momentarily thrown by their confused introduction, but soon found herself &quot;impressed by his air of dispassionate strength, his calm self-possession and the almost black, impenetrable eyes set in a pale olive face&quot;.

Shearer was less impressed, however, with her first screen test: &quot;The custom then was to use flat lighting, to throw a great deal of light from all directions, in order to kill all shadows that might be caused by wrinkles or blemishes. But the strong lights placed on either side of my face made my blue eyes look almost white, and by nearly eliminating my nose, made me seem cross-eyed. The result was hideous.&quot;

The day after the test had been screened for Mayer and Thalberg, cameraman Ernest Palmer found Shearer frantic and trembling in the hallway. Speaking with her, he was struck by her &quot;fierce, almost raging disappointment&quot;, and after viewing the test himself, agreed that she had been &quot;poorly handled&quot;. Under Palmer&#x27;s own supervision, a second test was made and judged a success by the studio brass. The lead in &quot;The Wanters&quot; seemed hers, until the film&#x27;s director, John M. Stahl, objected, finding her &quot;unphotogenic&quot;. Again, Shearer was to be disappointed, relegated to a minor role.

She accepted her next role in &quot;Pleasure Mad&quot;, knowing &quot;it was well understood that if I didn&#x27;t deliver in this picture, I was through&quot;. After only a few days of shooting, things were not looking good. Shearer was struggling. Finally, the film&#x27;s director, Reginald Barker, complained to Mayer that he could get nothing out of the young actress, and when summoned to Mayer&#x27;s office, she fully expected the axe to fall: &quot;But to my surprise, Mr. Mayer&#x27;s manner was paternal. &#x27;There seems to be a problem,&#x27; he said, &#x27;tell me about it.&#x27; I told him that the director had shouted at me and frightened me. Nobody had warned me that Mayer was a better actor than any of us, and I was unprepared for what happened next. He staged an alarming outburst, screaming at me, calling me a fool and a coward, accusing me of throwing away my career because I couldn&#x27;t get on with a director. It worked. I became tearful, but obstinate. &#x27;I&#x27;ll show you!&#x27; I said to him. &#x27;You&#x27;ll see!&#x27; Delighted, Mayer resumed the paternal act. &#x27;That&#x27;s what I wanted to hear&#x27;, he said, smiling.&quot; Returning to the set, Shearer plunged into an emotional scene. &quot;I took that scene lock, stock, and barrel, fur, fins and feathers&quot;, she remembered, earning her the respect of her director and her studio. As a reward, Thalberg cast her in six films in eight months.

The apprenticeship served Shearer well. On April 26, 1924, Louis B. Mayer Pictures was merged with Metro Pictures and the Samuel Goldwyn Company to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Shearer was cast with Lon Chaney and John Gilbert in the studio&#x27;s first official production, &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot;. The film was a conspicuous success and contributed to the meteoric rise of the new company, and to Shearer&#x27;s visibility. By late 1925, she was carrying her own films, and was one of MGM&#x27;s biggest attractions, a &quot;bona fide&quot; star. She signed a new contract; it paid $1,000 a week and would rise to $5,000 over the next five years. She bought a house for herself and Edith at 2004 Vine Street, which was located under the Hollywoodland sign.

=== Irving and Norma ===
Having become a star, Shearer&#x27;s new challenge was to remain one. Many other talented actresses were at the studio, and she realized she would have to fight hard to stay ahead of the pack. Seeing that sensational newcomer Greta Garbo was one of a kind, she went to Thalberg and &quot;demanded recognition as one of another kind&quot;. It was just one of the many visits she paid to his office, always to plead for better material, better parts. Thalberg would listen patiently, then invariably advise her to keep toeing the line, that MGM knew best, and that the movies she complained about had made her a popular actress. Occasionally, Shearer would burst into tears, but this seemed to make &quot;no more impression than rain on a raincoat&quot;.

Privately, Thalberg was very impressed by Shearer. In a story conference, when her name was suggested to him for the part of a girl threatened with rape, Thalberg shook his head, and, with a wry smile, he said, &quot;She looks too well able to take care of herself.&quot;

Thalberg&#x27;s appeal was not primarily sexual. What attracted Shearer was his commanding presence and steely grace, the impression he gave that wherever he sat was always the head of the table. In spite of his youth – he was only 26 – Thalberg became a father figure to the 23-year-old actress.

At the end of a working day in July 1925, Shearer received a phone call from Thalberg&#x27;s secretary, asking if she would like to accompany Thalberg to the premiere of Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;. That night, they made their first appearance as a couple. A few weeks later, Shearer went to Montreal to visit her father. While there, she had a reunion with an old school friend, who remembered: &quot;At the end of lunch, over coffee, Norma leant in across the table. &#x27;I&#x27;m madly in love&#x27;, she whispered. &#x27;Who with?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;With Irving Thalberg&#x27;, she replied, smiling. I asked how Thalberg felt. &#x27;I hope to marry him&#x27;, Norma said, and then, with the flash of the assurance I remembered so well, &#x27;I believe I will.

Over the next two years, both Shearer and Irving saw other people. Louise Brooks remembered: &quot;I held a dinner party sometime in 1926. All the place cards at the dinner table were books. In front of Thalberg&#x27;s place was Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;Genius&quot;, and in front of Norma&#x27;s place, I put &quot;The Difficulty of Getting Married&quot;. It was so funny because Irving walked right in and saw &quot;Genius&quot;, and sat right down, but Norma kept walking around. She wouldn&#x27;t sit down in front of &quot;The Difficulty of Getting Married&quot; – no way!&quot;

By 1927, Shearer had made a total of 13 silent films for MGM. Each had been produced for under $200,000, and had, without fail, been a substantial box-office hit, often making a $200,000+ profit for the studio. She was rewarded for this consistent success by being cast in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg&quot;, her first prestige production, with a budget over $1,000,000. While she was finishing &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, Shearer received a call summoning her to Thalberg&#x27;s office. She entered to find Thalberg sitting at his desk before a tray of diamond engagement rings. He granted her the option to choose her own ring; she picked out the biggest. After weeks of rumors, provoked by wearing the ring, it was announced in August 1927 that they were to wed. On September 29, 1927, they were married in the Hollywood wedding of the year. Shearer had two children with Thalberg – Irving Thalberg, Jr. (1930–1987), and Katherine (1935–2006). Before they were married, Shearer converted to Judaism so she could marry Thalberg.

=== Transition to sound ===
One week after the marriage, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was released. The first feature-length motion picture with sound, it effectively changed the cinematic landscape overnight and signaled the end of the silent motion-picture era. It also spelled the end of many silent careers, and Shearer was determined hers would not be one of them. Her brother, Douglas Shearer, was instrumental in the development of sound at MGM, and every care was taken to prepare her for the microphone.

Her first talkie, &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot; (1929), turned out to be a tremendous success. Shearer&#x27;s &quot;medium-pitched, fluent, flexible Canadian accent, not quite American, but not at all foreign&quot;, was critically applauded, and thereafter widely imitated by other actresses, nervous about succeeding in talkies. Despite the popularity of her subsequent early talking films, &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot; and &quot;Their Own Desire&quot; (both 1929), Shearer feared the public would soon tire of her &quot;good girl&quot; image, and took the advice of friend and co-star Ramón Novarro to visit an unknown photographer named George Hurrell. There, she took a series of sensual portraits that convinced her husband that she could play the lead in MGM&#x27;s racy new film, &quot;The Divorcee&quot; (1930).

=== Pre-Code ===
Shearer won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;The Divorcee&quot;, and a series of highly successful pre-Code films followed, including &quot;Let Us Be Gay&quot; (1930), &quot;Strangers May Kiss&quot; (1931), &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931) with Leslie Howard and Clark Gable, &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1931), and &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1932). All of these were box-office hits, placing Shearer in competition with Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, and Jean Harlow as MGM&#x27;s top actress through the remainder of the decade.

Shearer&#x27;s marriage to Thalberg gave her a degree of power in Hollywood that was resented by rivals such as Crawford, who complained that Shearer would always be offered the best roles and best conditions: &quot;How can I compete with Norma when she&#x27;s sleeping with the boss?&quot;

Shearer&#x27;s pre-Code films included period dramas and theatrical adaptations. &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; (1932), which co-starred Fredric March, was one of the most successful films of the period. An adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s four-hour experimental &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1932), which also starred Clark Gable, was a disappointing adaptation of O&#x27;Neill, but a showcase for Shearer, thus a major hit.

=== The First Lady of MGM ===
The enforcement of the Production Code in 1934 forced Shearer to drop her celebrated &quot;free soul&quot; image, and move exclusively into period dramas and &quot;prestige&quot; pictures. Of these, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; (1934) proved her most successful at the box office, making a profit of $668,000, in part because the film contained elements that slipped by the newly instituted Production Code. In that film, she played a role made famous by Katharine Cornell. Shearer also took on another play popularized by Cornell in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936) (her first film of the 1930s to lose money), and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938) (a budget of almost $2,500,000 was too great for the studio to expect a profit), though their elaborate sets and costumes helped make the films immensely popular with audiences.

Shearer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress on six occasions, winning only for &quot;The Divorcee&quot; in 1930. She was nominated the same year for &quot;Their Own Desire&quot;, for &quot;A Free Soul&quot; in 1931, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; in 1934, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1936, and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; in 1938. Marion Davies later recalled that Shearer came to a party at San Simeon in her Marie Antoinette costume; Davies said she was not about to remove the door so Shearer could enter, so Norma made her grand entrance through wider doors leading from another room. Four chairs were arranged so she could sit at the table in her voluminous skirts.

George Cukor, who directed Shearer in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, offered this character sketch of the actress:

In 1939, she attempted an unusual role in the dark comedy &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;, adapted from the 1936 Robert E. Sherwood play. It was the last of Shearer&#x27;s three films with Clark Gable, after &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931) and &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1932). &quot;The Women&quot; (1939) followed, with an entirely female cast of more than 130 speaking roles.

Shearer was also one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; (1939) and some publications even reported that she won the role in 1938. However, she withdrew herself from consideration after negative feedback from movie fans. Years later when asked about potentially playing Scarlett, Shearer jokingly said, &quot;Scarlett is a thankless role. The one I&#x27;d really like to play is Rhett!&quot;

Critics praised the suspenseful atmosphere in her next film, &quot;Escape&quot; (1940), where she played the lover of a Nazi general who helps an American free his mother from a concentration camp. With increasing interest in the war in Europe, the film performed well at the box office, but Shearer passed up roles in highly successful films &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, to star in &quot;We Were Dancing&quot; and &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; (1942), which both failed at the box office. In 1942, Shearer unofficially retired from acting.

== Retirement ==
After Thalberg&#x27;s unexpected death on September 14, 1936, Shearer retained a lawyer to ensure that Thalberg&#x27;s percentages of films on which he had worked were still paid to his estate, which was contested by MGM. When she took the story to gossip columnist Louella Parsons, the studio was forced to give in and granted all the profits from MGM movies made and released from 1924 to 1938, meaning the estate eventually received over $1.5 million in percentage payments. Nevertheless, Shearer&#x27;s contract was renewed for six films at $150,000 each. During this time, she embarked on a brief romance with the younger actor James Stewart, and then with the married actor George Raft. Raft (who had separated from his wife years earlier, soon after they married) stated publicly that he wanted to marry Shearer. However, his wife&#x27;s refusal to allow a divorce and the disapproval of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer caused Shearer to end the affair.

Following her retirement in 1942, she married Martin Arrougé (March 23, 1914 – August 8, 1999), a World War II Navy aviator, a former ski instructor to her children, 11 years her junior. Despite often attending public events in her later life, Shearer gradually withdrew from the Hollywood social scene. In 1960, her secretary stated: &quot;Miss Shearer does not want any publicity. She doesn&#x27;t talk to anyone. But I can tell you that she has refused many requests to appear in motion pictures and TV shows.&quot; Arrougé and Shearer remained married until her death.

== Death ==
On June 12, 1983, Shearer died of bronchial pneumonia at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, California, where she had been living since 1980.

She is entombed in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in a crypt marked Norma Arrouge, along with her first husband, Irving Thalberg.

== Legacy ==
Shearer&#x27;s fame declined after her retirement in 1942. She was rediscovered in the late 1950s, when her films were sold to television, and in the 1970s, when her films enjoyed theatrical revivals. By the time of her death in 1983, she was best known for her &quot;noble&quot; roles in &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; and &quot;The Women&quot;.

A Shearer revival began in 1988, when Turner Network Television began broadcasting the entire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film library. In 1994, Turner Classic Movies began showcasing her films, most of which had not been seen since the reconstitution of the Production Code in 1934. Shearer&#x27;s work was seen anew, and the critical focus shifted from her &quot;noble&quot; roles to her pre-Code roles.

Shearer&#x27;s work gained more attention in the 1990s through the publication of a series of books. The first was a biography by Gavin Lambert. Next came &quot;Complicated Women: Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood&quot; by Mick LaSalle, film critic at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Mark A. Vieira published three books on subjects closely related to Shearer: a biography of her husband, producer Irving Thalberg; and two biographies of photographer George Hurrell. Shearer was noted not only for the control she exercised over her work, but also for her patronage of Hurrell and Adrian, and for discovering actress Janet Leigh and actor-producer Robert Evans.

For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Shearer has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6636 Hollywood Boulevard. On June 30, 2008, Canada Post issued a postage stamp in its &quot;Canadians in Hollywood&quot; series to honour Norma Shearer, along with others for Raymond Burr, Marie Dressler, and Chief Dan George.

Shearer and Thalberg are reportedly the models for Stella and Miles, the hosts of the Hollywood party in the short story &quot;Crazy Sunday&quot; (1932) by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Most of Shearer&#x27;s MGM films are broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, and many of them are also available on DVD from Warner Home Video. In 2008, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In 2015, a number of Shearer films became available in high-definition format, authored by Warner Home Video, in most cases, from the nitrate camera negatives: &quot;A Free Soul&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, and &quot;The Women&quot;.

Shearer is portrayed in director David Fincher’s film &quot;Mank&quot; by actress Jessie Cohen.

<doc id="61358" wikidata="Q1144567" url="?curid=61358" title="Oral law">
<text>An oral law is a code of conduct in use in a given culture, religion or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by oral tradition and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the Latin &quot;tradere&quot; = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, &quot;from father to son&quot;. This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence, primarily based on the &quot;linear world of academia&quot; where only written down records are accepted. However, &quot;standard&quot; theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.

== In jurisprudence ==

From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a habit, or custom with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal rights and obligations);
*a spoken command or order that has to be respected as a law (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in jurisprudence as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a judge (ordinarily producing a sentence according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a punishment has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like the Mafia do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

==Albanian customary law==

The Kanun is a set of Albanian traditional customary laws, which has directed all the aspects of the Albanian tribal society. For at least the last five centuries and until today, Albanian customary laws have been kept alive only orally by the tribal elders. The success in preserving them exclusively through oral systems is an indication of ancient origins. Strong pre-Christian motifs mixed with motifs from the Christian era reflect the stratification of the Albanian customary law across various historical ages. The Kanun has held a sacred – although secular – longstanding, unwavering and unchallenged authority with a cross-religious effectiveness over the Albanians, which is attributed to an earlier pagan code common to all the Albanian tribes. The northern Albanian customary law is among the Albanian literary monuments that are of interest to Indo-European studies, reflecting many legal practices of great antiquity. It has been pointed out that &quot;The laws governing such matters as hospitality, the rights of the heads of households, marriage, blood-feuds and payment of damages find precise echoes in Vedic India and ancient Greece and Rome&quot;.

Over time, Albanian customary laws have undergone their historical development, they have been changed and supplemented with new norms, in accordance with certain requirements of socio-economic development. According to some historical sources, the government of the Roman and Byzantine empire had to recognize autonomous customary laws to the various local communities for their self-administration. In this context, during different periods, Albanian customary laws were implemented in parallel with Roman, Byzantine, Ecclesiastic, and subsequently Sharia and Ottoman laws. This helped the Albanian mountain tribes to preserve their way of life, identity, and neutrality in the face of external centralizing administration.

== In Judaism ==
Rabbinic Judaism maintains that the books of the Tanakh were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation. Thus, in Judaism, the &quot;Written Instruction&quot; (&quot;Torah she-bi-khtav&quot; תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the Tanakh; the &quot;Oral Instruction&quot; (&quot;Torah she-be&#x27;al peh&quot; תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the Talmud (lit. &quot;Learning&quot;) and Midrashim (lit. &quot;Interpretations&quot;). The interpretation of the Oral Torah is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the Written Torah. Further, Halakha (lit. &quot;The Path&quot;, frequently translated as &quot;Jewish Law&quot;) is based on a written instruction together with an oral instruction. Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

<text>The Canadian province of Prince Edward Island has three counties that have historically been used as administrative divisions for the provincial government, and prior to Confederation (in 1873), the colonial government.

The current system of land division in Prince Edward Island, including its three counties, dates to a series of surveys undertaken in 1764-65 by Captain Samuel Holland of the British Army&#x27;s Corps of Royal Engineers. Holland&#x27;s survey saw the island divided into the three counties, each of which had a &quot;royalty&quot; (or shire town) as a county seat. The rest of the county outside the royalty was sub-divided into parishes for the Church of England, measuring approximately ; the parishes were further sub-divided into townships measuring approximately .

The counties are no longer used as administrative boundaries for the provincial government; however, they continue to be used as census divisions by Statistics Canada for statistical purposes in administering the Canadian census.

<text>In geometry, Boy&#x27;s surface is an immersion of the real projective plane in three-dimensional space. It was discovered in 1901 by the German mathematician Werner Boy, who had been tasked by his doctoral thesis advisor David Hilbert to prove that the projective plane &quot;could not&quot; be immersed in three-dimensional space. 

Boy&#x27;s surface was first parametrized explicitly by Bernard Morin in 1978. Another parametrization was discovered by Rob Kusner and Robert Bryant. Boy&#x27;s surface is one of the two possible immersions of the real projective plane which have only a single triple point.

Unlike the Roman surface and the cross-cap, it has no other singularities than self-intersections (that is, it has no pinch-points).

==Parametrization==

Boy&#x27;s surface can be parametrized in several ways. One parametrization, discovered by Rob Kusner and Robert Bryant, is the following: given a complex number &quot;w&quot; whose magnitude is less than or equal to one (formula_1), let
:formula_2

and then set 
:formula_3

we then obtain the Cartesian coordinates &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; of a point on the Boy&#x27;s surface.

If one performs an inversion of this parametrization centered on the triple point, one obtains a complete minimal surface with three ends (that&#x27;s how this parametrization was discovered naturally). This implies that the Bryant–Kusner parametrization of Boy&#x27;s surfaces is &quot;optimal&quot; in the sense that it is the &quot;least bent&quot; immersion of a projective plane into three-space.

===Property of Bryant–Kusner parametrization===

If &quot;w&quot; is replaced by the negative reciprocal of its complex conjugate, formula_4 then the functions &quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2, and &quot;g&quot;3 of &quot;w&quot; are left unchanged.

By replacing in terms of its real and imaginary parts , and expanding resulting parameterization, one may obtain a parameterization of Boy&#x27;s surface in terms of rational functions of and . This shows that Boy&#x27;s surface is not only an algebraic surface, but even a rational surface. The remark of the preceding paragraph shows that the generic fiber of this parameterization consists of two points (that is that almost every point of Boy&#x27;s surface may be obtained by two parameters values).

===Relation to the real projective plane===
Let formula_5 be the Bryant–Kusner parametrization of Boy&#x27;s surface. Then
:formula_6

This explains the condition formula_7 on the parameter: if formula_8 then formula_9 However, things are slightly more complicated for formula_10 In this case, one has formula_11 This means that, if formula_12 the point of the Boy&#x27;s surface is obtained from two parameter values: formula_13 In other words, the Boy&#x27;s surface has been parametrized by a disk such that pairs of diametrically opposite points on the perimeter of the disk are equivalent. This shows that the Boy&#x27;s surface is the image of the real projective plane, RP2 by a smooth map. That is, the parametrization of the Boy&#x27;s surface is an immersion of the real projective plane into the Euclidean space.

==Symmetries==

Boy&#x27;s surface has 3-fold symmetry. This means that it has an axis of discrete rotational symmetry: any 120° turn about this axis will leave the surface looking exactly the same. The Boy&#x27;s surface can be cut into three mutually congruent pieces.

==Applications==
Boy&#x27;s surface can be used in sphere eversion as a half-way model. A half-way model is an immersion of the sphere with the property that a rotation interchanges inside and outside, and so can be employed to evert (turn inside-out) a sphere. Boy&#x27;s (the case p = 3) and Morin&#x27;s (the case p = 2) surfaces begin a sequence of half-way models with higher symmetry first proposed by George Francis, indexed by the even integers 2p (for p odd, these immersions can be factored through a projective plane). Kusner&#x27;s parametrization yields all these.

==Models==
=== Model at Oberwolfach ===
The Oberwolfach Research Institute for Mathematics has a large model of a Boy&#x27;s surface outside the entrance, constructed and donated by Mercedes-Benz in January 1991. This model has 3-fold rotational symmetry and minimizes the Willmore energy of the surface. It consists of steel strips representing the image of a polar coordinate grid under a parameterization given by Robert Bryant and Rob Kusner. The meridians (rays) become ordinary Möbius strips, i.e. twisted by 180 degrees. All but one of the strips corresponding to circles of latitude (radial circles around the origin) are untwisted, while the one corresponding to the boundary of the unit circle is a Möbius strip twisted by three times 180 degrees — as is the emblem of the institute .

=== Model made for Clifford Stoll ===
A model was made in glass by glassblower Lucas Clarke, with the cooperation of Adam Savage, for presentation to Clifford Stoll. It was featured on Adam Savage&#x27;s YouTube channel, Tested. All three appeared in the video discussing it.

<doc id="61363" wikidata="Q2494794" url="?curid=61363" title="Epacris impressa">
<text>Epacris impressa, also known as common heath, is a species of plant in the heath family Ericaceae. It is native to south-eastern Australia (the states of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales). French botanist Jacques Labillardière collected the species in 1793 and described it in 1805. Four forms have been identified, but no subspecies are recognised. Growing in heathland, shrubland or open forest, it is generally a small shrub around tall, with small stiff leaves. The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring. Honeyeater birds, particularly the eastern spinebill, feed upon the nectar of the flowers. It regenerates after bushfire by seed or by resprouting.

A highly regarded garden plant, the common heath was first cultivated in England in 1825; over seventy named cultivars have been developed, most of which have now vanished. A pink-flowered form, often referred to as &quot;pink heath&quot;, is the floral emblem of the state of Victoria. &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; has proven a difficult plant to propagate reliably, which has limited its use in horticulture and revegetation. It grows best in well-drained but moist soil in a semishaded position.

==Description==
&quot;Epacris impressa&quot; grows as a woody shrub with an erect habit, sometimes reaching in height although plants in the range of tall are more commonly observed. The branches are stiff and have small leaves with prickly, pointed apices that are long. The flowers mainly occur between late autumn and early spring, arising in dense and sometimes pendulous clusters along the stems. White, pink or red in colour, they are and are narrow and tubular with five indentations on the base. The corolla of the flower is formed by five petals, fused at the base to form a tubelike structure, with the free petal ends forming five lobes at the apex. There are five whorled sepals at the base of the corolla. Within the corolla is a central style that persists through development of the fruit. The style connects the stigma at the apex and ovary at the base, where the nectar is also located. Different colour forms are often observed growing near each other. The fruit is a 5-locule capsule that is about in diameter. It is globular in shape, sometimes with one end flattened. Initially green, it dries and splits, releasing numerous tiny seeds.

==Taxonomy==

The type specimen of common heath was collected in 1793 by French botanist Jacques Labillardière in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) during a voyage with Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux. Labillardière described it in his 1805 work &quot;Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen&quot;, giving it its current name &quot;Epacris impressa&quot;. The Latin specific epithet &quot;impressa&quot; (meaning &quot;impressed&quot; or &quot;indented&quot;) alludes to the indentations on the floral tube. The original mounted specimen is currently held at the National Herbarium of Victoria at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.

A number of specimens once described as separate species are now regarded as &quot;Epacris impressa&quot;, with no recognised subspecies. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described &quot;Epacris ruscifolia&quot; in his 1810 work &quot;Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen&quot; alongside &quot;E. impressa&quot;. John Lindley described &quot;Epacris tomentosa&quot; from plant specimens collected during the third expedition of Thomas Mitchell in 1838. Upon encountering &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; on Mount William in the Grampians, Mitchell remarked that it was &quot;A most beautiful downy-leaved Epacris with large, curved, purple flowers, allied to &quot;E. grandiflora&quot; but much handsomer&quot;. Dr Robert Graham described &quot;Epacris ceriflora&quot; (which he spelt &quot;ceraeflora&quot;) from plants cultivated at the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens in 1832. The seed had come from Tasmania, the resulting progeny flowering over April and May 1832. A year later, he described &quot;E. nivalis&quot;, which he called an &quot;exceedingly beautiful species&quot;, from specimens growing in Loddiges nursery. He also noted a form with long corollas that had been called &quot;E. variabilis&quot; that was in cultivation at the time, and noted it was difficult to describe the precise characteristics that distinguished &quot;E. ceraeflora&quot;, &quot;E. nivalis&quot;, &quot;E. variabilis&quot; and &quot;E. impressa&quot;.

In his landmark &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot; (1869), George Bentham argued that several previously described species were in fact a single species – &quot;E. impressa&quot;, uniting &quot;E. variabilis&quot;, a short red-flowered &quot;E. campanulata&quot;, &quot;E. ruscifolia&quot;, which had narrow leaves and long flowers, the white-flowered &quot;E. nivalis&quot;, and short white-flowered &quot;E. ceraeflora&quot;. He re-classified as a separate species – &quot;E. reclinata&quot; – several plants that Allan Cunningham had collected in the Blue Mountains and classified as &quot;E. impressa&quot;.

In the same work, Bentham named and described two naturally occurring varieties, &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; var. &quot;grandiflora&quot; and &quot;E. impressa&quot; var. &quot;ovata&quot;. Plant specimens designated as &quot;grandiflora&quot; had been collected in the Wimmera, the Grampians (including those previously designated as &quot;E. tomentosa&quot;) and at Stawell in Victoria. Those classified as &quot;ovata&quot; were collected at Twofold Bay and Mount Imlay in southeastern New South Wales as well as Woolnorth and Rocky Cape in northern Tasmania. Bentham noted that, although variable, all forms had &quot;five impressed cavities outside, alternating with the stamens immediately above the ovary.&quot;

In his 1972 publication &quot;A Handbook to Plants in Victoria&quot;, Australian botanist Jim Willis expressed his view that dividing the species into subspecies was not feasible given that common heath is highly variable in flower colour and leaf shape, though he conceded the Grampians race &quot;grandiflora&quot; might be distinctive based on its larger corollas and coarser and hairier foliage. Currently, both &quot;grandiflora&quot; and &quot;ovata&quot; are regarded as synonyms of &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; rather than being classified as distinct varieties. The plant populations that best fit Bentham&#x27;s original description of &quot;grandiflora&quot;, also known as Grampians heath, occur naturally on sandstone at locations including Mount Zero, Mount Stapylton and the Black Range. Other nearby populations are regarded as having intermediate characteristics, including those in the Victoria Range and Mount Arapiles. Although not recognised in the Australian Plant Census, the variety is noted as &quot;rare&quot; on the list of &quot;Advisory List of Rare or Threatened Plants in Victoria&quot; issued by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries.

In 1977 Helen Stace and Yvonne Fripp from La Trobe University studied 195 populations of &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and found that 120 consisted of mixed stands of two or more races while 75 populations were of one race only. They identified four races based on the following corolla characteristics:

*white-flowered with a markedly shortened corolla that is long and red-purple anthers, usually found in sites with greater sun exposure. Occurring throughout the species range, this form is the most widely distributed. 
*pink-flowered, with a longer corolla that is long and cream-white anthers, in more shaded sites. This form occurs throughout the species range. Field work in Victoria and Tasmania found that pink-flowered plants in mixed populations often have pink or red anthers.
*long scarlet race, with orange-red flowers and corolla long and cream-white anthers. Those from the granitic mountains of Wilsons Promontory and near W Tree in East Gippsland in Victoria flower between April and November. Other localities where this race has been recorded include the Howe Ranges and Clyde Mountain in New South Wales.
*broad pink or white, the &quot;grandiflora&quot; race from the Grampians and Mount Arapiles in Victoria. Plants of this race are taller, often reaching in height. White or pink colour bear no relation to corolla length. Plants from Mount Arapiles are always pink-flowered.
The long-pink and short-white races frequently occur in close proximity to each other; in these mixed populations the former tends to flower in winter and the latter in spring. The question has been raised whether these different forms are becoming incompatible. However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.

Pink-flowering populations have a relatively distinct genetic makeup, whereas red or white flowering populations have more evident sharing of genetic traits. Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial genetic diversity within and between flower colour races and site populations. This has implications for vegetation projects in that provenance material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity.

==Distribution==
&quot;Epacris impressa&quot; is commonly found in coastal regions and nearby foothills, ranging from Kangaroo Island and the southern Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia across southern Victoria, extending to the Grampians and the Little Desert, and northwards to southern New South Wales as far as the Clyde River in the Budawang Range. It is also widespread in Tasmania. Plants are recorded at altitudes up to at Mount Stradbroke and Mount Tingaringy in East Gippsland. The species grows in widely diverse habitats including sand and clay heathland, herb-rich and heathy woodland, lowland and shrubby dry forests, riparian thickets, montane rocky shrubland and rocky outcrops.

==Ecology==

Honeyeaters such as the eastern spinebill are attracted to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, the pollen, which has fins, attaches itself to the feathers on the heads of the birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding cross pollination. A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area at the same time the common heath was in flower in March, and left once flowering had finished. Other honeyeaters, such as the strong-billed, crescent and yellow-throated honeyeaters, fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white-plumed and New Holland honeyeaters, as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.

Insects recorded visiting white-flowered plants include the Australian painted lady (&quot;Vanessa kershawi&quot;) and yellow admiral (&quot;V. itea&quot;), as well as bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee (&quot;Bombus terrestris&quot;) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing the base of the tube. This then allowed honeybees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) to retrieve nectar the same way. &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; is host to the scale insect &quot;Lecanodiaspis microcribraria&quot;.

A field study of the invasion of the pathogen &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that &quot;E. impressa&quot; seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot; a decade before.

&quot;Epacris impressa&quot; regenerates after bushfire by seed and resprouting. Fieldwork in heathland in the Otway Ranges in the years following the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires showed that large numbers of &quot;E. impressa&quot; seedlings appeared in some areas, and that flowering took place as early as the second year after the fire.

The roots of &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; are colonized by fungi forming ericoid mycorrhiza. It is believed that the fungal species vary between regions.

==Cultivation==

Propagated from seed collected by William Baxter in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825. Due to its frost-tenderness, it was mostly restricted to greenhouse cultivation. In 1873, a variety known as &quot;Epacris impressa alba&quot; was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers in Boston in the United States. While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared.

Plants grow best in a moist but well-drained, acidic soil, with added peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a sheltered position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along with other members of the genus, &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.

Propagation both by seed and cuttings is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds have been found to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.

===Cultivars===
The following forms have been selected and grown for cultivation:

;&#x27;Bega&#x27;
This is a form from Bega in southern New South Wales that has bright red flowers and grows to high. It is regarded as one of the more reliable forms in cultivation. White- and pink-flowered forms from the same region also have horticultural potential.

; &#x27;Cranbourne Bells&#x27; and other double-flowered forms

&#x27;Cranbourne Bells&#x27; is a double-flowered form with pink flower buds fading to white as they open. Registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1988, it occurred naturally near the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne in Victoria, but its habitat has since been cleared. A double-flowered form of &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; was collected as early as the 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller sent a specimen to Kew Gardens. This was examined by botanist William Hemsley in 1865. The specimen, labelled as &quot;Epacris impressa&quot; var. &quot;pleniflora&quot;, originated from Stawell in western Victoria. Another specimen given the same name by Mueller was collected at Nunawading, today a suburb of Melbourne. Charles French, co-founder of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, collected a white double-flowered form from Cheltenham south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink double-flowered form from Dromana on the Mornington Peninsula in about 1862. These were later sent as rooted cuttings to Veitch Nurseries in England. Double-flowered forms of various colours have since been found throughout Victoria, but only single plants have been observed in any location, and they are still regarded as a rarity. A naturally occurring form of the variety &quot;grandiflora&quot; with rosebud-like double flowers is also grown.

;&#x27;Spring Pink&#x27;
A form with deep pink flowers on long spikes, &#x27;Spring Pink&#x27; appears in spring. It grows to high.

==Floral emblem of Victoria==
In 1951, at a meeting of representatives of government and other bodies, it was agreed that the pink form of the common heath, the &quot;pink heath&quot;, be adopted as the official floral emblem for the state of Victoria. Victoria was the first Australian state to adopt a floral emblem. The proclamation, made on 11 November 1958 by the Governor, Dallas Brooks, was as follows:

An Australian stamp series of state floral emblems was issued in 1968. The pink heath was featured on the 13 cent stamp. In 2014, a 70-cent stamp labelled as &quot;Common Heath&quot; was issued. The pink heath is also depicted on the Victorian driver&#x27;s licence. In 1973, a depiction of pink heath was added to the armorial bearings for Victoria.

<text>X.500 is a series of computer networking standards covering electronic directory services. The X.500 series was developed by the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T). ITU-T was formerly known as the Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy (CCITT). X.500 was first approved in 1988. The directory services were developed to support requirements of X.400 electronic mail exchange and name lookup. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) were partners in developing the standards, incorporating them into the Open Systems Interconnection suite of protocols. ISO/IEC 9594 is the corresponding ISO/IEC identification.

==X.500 protocols==
The protocols defined by X.500 include:

* These protocols are typically defined piecemeal throughout multiple specifications and ASN.1 modules. The &quot;Defining Specification&quot; column above indicates (subjectively) which specification contributes most specifically to a protocol.

Because these protocols used the OSI networking stack, a number of alternatives to DAP were developed to allow Internet clients to access the X.500 Directory using the TCP/IP networking stack. The most well-known alternative to DAP is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). While DAP and the other X.500 protocols can now use the TCP/IP networking stack, LDAP remains a popular directory access protocol.

== Transport Protocols ==
The X.500 protocols traditionally use the OSI networking stack. However, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) uses TCP/IP for transport. In later versions of the ITU Recommendation X.519, the Internet Directly-Mapped (IDM) protocols were introduced to allow X.500 protocol data units (PDUs) to be transported over the TCP/IP stack. This transport involves ISO Transport over TCP as well as a simple record-based binary protocol to frame protocol datagrams.

==X.500 data models==
The primary concept of X.500 is that there is a single Directory Information Tree (DIT), a hierarchical organization of entries which are distributed across one or more servers, called Directory System Agents (DSA). An entry consists of a set of attributes, each attribute with one or more values. Each entry has a unique Distinguished Name, formed by combining its Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), one or more attributes of the entry itself, and the RDNs of each of the superior entries up to the root of the DIT. As LDAP implements a very similar data model to that of X.500, there is further description of the data model in the article on LDAP.

X.520 and X.521 together provide a definition of a set of attributes and object classes to be used for representing people and organizations as entries in the DIT. They are one of the most widely deployed white pages schema.

X.509, the portion of the standard providing for an authentication framework, is now also widely used outside of the X.500 directory protocols. It specifies a standard format for public-key certificates.

==The relationship of the X.500 Directory and X.509v3 digital certificates==

The current use of X.509v3 certificates outside the Directory structure loaded directly into web browsers was necessary for e-commerce to develop by allowing for secure web based (SSL/TLS) communications which did not require the X.500 directory as a source of digital certificates as originally conceived in X.500 (1988). One should contrast the role of X.500 and X.509 to understand their relationship in that X.509 was designed to be the secure access method for updating X.500 before the WWW, but when web browsers became popular there needed to be a simple method of encrypting connections on the transport layer to web sites. Hence the trusted root certificates for supported certificate authorities were pre loaded into certificate storage areas on the personal computer or device.

Added security is envisaged by the scheduled 2011-2014 implementation of the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, a two- to three-year project protecting digital identities in cyberspace.

The WWW e-commerce implementation of X.509v3 bypassed but did not replace the original ISO standard authentication mechanism of binding distinguished names in the X.500 Directory.

These packages of certificates can be added or removed by the end user in their software, but are reviewed by Microsoft and Mozilla in terms of their continued trustworthiness. Should a problem arise, such as what occurred with DigiNotar, browser security experts can issue an update to mark a certificate authority as untrusted, but this is a serious removal effectively of that CA from &quot;internet trust&quot;. X.500 offers a way to view which organization claims a specific root certificate, outside of that provided bundle. This can function as a &quot;4 corner model of trust&quot; adding another check to determine if a root certificate has been compromised. Rules governing the Federal Bridge policy for revoking compromised certificates are available at www.idmanagement.gov.

The contrast of this browser bundled approach is that in X.500 or LDAP the attribute &quot;caCertificate&quot; can be &quot;bound&quot; to a directory entry and checked in addition to the default pre-loaded bundle of certificates of which end users typically have never noticed unless an SSL warning message has appeared.

For example, a web site using SSL, typically the DNS site name &quot;www.foobar.com&quot; is verified in a browser by the software using libraries that would check to see if the certificate was signed by one of the trusted root certificates given to the user.

Therefore, creating trust for users that they had reached the correct web site via HTTPS.

However, stronger checks are also possible, to indicate that more than the domain name was verified. To contrast this with X.500, the certificate is one attribute of many for an entry, in which the entry could contain anything allowable by the specific Directory schema. Thus X.500 does store the digital certificate, but it is one of many attributes that could potentially verify the organization, such as physical address, a contact telephone number and an email contact.

CA Certs or certificate authority certs are loaded into the browser automatically (in the case of Microsoft&#x27;s update mechanism), or in new version updates of browsers, and the user is given further choices to import, delete, or develop an individual trust relationship with the loaded Certificate Authorities and determine how the browser will behave if OCSP revocation servers are unreachable.

This is in contrast with the Directory model which associates the attribute caCertificate with a listed certificate authority.

Thus the browser can verify the SSL cert of the website by means of the loaded group of accepted certificates or the root certificates can be looked up in an X.500 or LDAP Directory (or via HTTP/S) and imported into the list of trusted certificate authorities.

The &quot;bound&quot; distinguished name is located in the subject fields of the certificate which matches the Directory entry. X.509v3 can contain other extensions depending on the community of interest other than international domain names. For broad Internet use, RFC-5280 PKIX describes a profile for fields that may be useful for applications such as encrypted email.

An end user who relies on the authenticity of a certificate being presented to a browser or email has no simple way to compare a forged certificate presented (perhaps which triggers a browser warning) with a valid certificate, without also being given the opportunity to validate the DN or Distinguished Name which was designed to be looked up in an X.500 DIT.

The certificate itself is public and considered to be unforgeable and can therefore be distributed in any manner, but an associated binding to an identity occurs in the Directory. Binding is what links the certificate to the identity who claims to be using that certificate. For example, the X.500 software that runs the Federal Bridge has cross certificates that enable trust between certificate authorities.

Simple homographic matching of domain names has resulted in phishing attacks where a domain can appear to be legitimate, but is not.

If a X.509v3 certificate is bound to a valid organization&#x27;s distinguished name within the Directory, then a simple check can be made in regards to the authenticity of the certificate by a comparison with what is presented to the browser with what is present in the Directory.

Some options do exist to check notaries to see if a certificate has only recently been seen, and therefore more likely to have been compromised. If the cert is likely to be trusted and is failing because the domain name is a slight mismatch, it will then initially fail in the browser, but then be subjected to the notary trust, which can then bypass the browser warning.

A valid organizational entry, such as o=FoobarWidgets, will also have an associated alphanumeric OID, and it has been &quot;identity proofed&quot; by ANSI, providing another layer of assurance regarding binding the certificate to the identity.

Recent events (2011) have indicated a threat from unknown actors in nation states who have forged certificates. This was done in order to create a MITM attack against political activists in Syria accessing Facebook over the web. This would have normally triggered a browser warning, but would not if the MITM certificate was issued by a valid certificate authority already trusted by a browser or other software. Similar attacks were used by Stuxnet which allowed software to impersonate trusted code. The point of certificate transparency is to allow an end user to determine, using a simple procedure if a certificate is in fact valid. Checking against the default bundle of certificates may not be enough to do this, and therefore an additional check is desired. Other suggestions for certificate transparency have also been advanced.

A different attack was used against Comodo, a certificate authority, that resulted in forged certificates that were directed at high-profile communications websites. This necessitated an emergency patch to major browsers. These certificates were actually issued from a trusted Certificate Authority, and therefore a user would have had no warning if they had gone to a faked website, in contrast with the Syria incident, where the certificate was crudely forged, including substituting Alto Palo, for Palo Alto. and incorrect serial numbers.

Some projects designed to exchange PHI, protected Health Information (which is considered to be highly HIPAA sensitive) may obtain X.509v3 certs via a CERT DNS resource record, or via LDAP to a X.500[2008] Directory. The issue of an authoritative bind then is detailed in RFCs related to the accuracy of the DNS information secured by signing from the root using DNSSEC.

The concept of root name servers has been a source of major contention in the Internet community, but for DNS is largely resolved. The name space associated with X.500 has traditionally been thought to start with a national naming authority, which mirrors the ISO/ITU approach to global systems with national representation. Thus different countries will create their own unique X.500 services. The U.S. X.500 was privatized in 1998, when the U.S. Government no longer offered X.500 or DNS registration outside of known government agencies.

The X.500 pilot project has been in development in the commercial space, and the technology continues to be present in major installations of millions of users within corporate data centers, and within the U.S. Government for credentialing.

==List of X.500 series standards==
==Criticism==
The authors of RFC 2693 (concerning SPKI) note that &quot;The original X.500 plan is unlikely ever to come to fruition. Collections of directory entries... are considered valuable or even confidential by those owning the lists and are not likely to be released to the world in the form of an X.500 directory sub-tree.&quot; and that &quot;The X.500 idea of a distinguished name (a single, globally unique name that everyone could use when referring to an entity) is also not likely to occur.&quot;

<text>Ohio County is a county located in the Northern Panhandle of the U.S. state of West Virginia, and forms part of the Wheeling metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 42,425. Its county seat is Wheeling. The county was formed in 1776 from the District of West Augusta, Virginia. It was named for the Ohio River, which forms its western boundary with the state of Ohio. West Liberty (formerly Black&#x27;s Cabin) was designated as the county seat in 1777, serving to 1797.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in West Virginia by area. The highest point of elevation in Ohio County is approximately and located about southwest of West Alexander, Pennsylvania.
The county is drained by Wheeling and other small creeks.

When Ohio County was formed in 1776, its area was much larger totaling and included portions of what is now Washington and Greene counties in Pennsylvania. The formation of the Mason–Dixon line and resolution of border disputes between Pennsylvania and Virginia began the first in a long series of reductions in the county&#x27;s size.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Ohio County was divided into five districts: Center, Clay, Liberty, Madison, Richland, Ritchie, Triadelphia, Union, Washington, and Webster. Centre, Clay, Madison, Union, and Webster Districts all lay within the city of Wheeling, as did part of Washington District.

By 1880, part of Ritchie District had also been subsumed by Wheeling. In the 1970s, the ten historic magisterial districts were consolidated into five new districts: Liberty Triadelphia; Madison, Union Clay, Washington District; Titchie Webster Center District, and Triadelphia. These were further consolidated in the 1980s to form District 1, District 2, and District 3.

==Government==
Ohio County is governed by a three-member county commission. The three county commissioners are elected from single-member magisterial districts and serve six-year terms, staggered so that one seat is up for election every even year. The County Commission annually chooses its own President. The Ohio County Commissioners are Commission President Randy Wharton, Zachary Abraham, and Don Nickerson. The county commission typically appoints a county administrator to oversee the daily executive duties for the commission. The current county administrator is Randy Russell. In addition to the three members of the county commission, other elected officials include a county clerk, currently Michael E. Kelly, and a county assessor, currently Tiffany Hoffmann.

Ohio County is part of the West Virginia&#x27;s First Judicial Circuit, which also includes nearby Hancock and Brooke counties. In West Virginia, circuit judges are elected in non-partisan elections to eight-year terms. The current judges of the First Judicial Circuit are Jason A. Cuomo, Michael J. Olejasz, David Sims, and Ronald E. Wilson. The clerk of the circuit court is elected in a partisan election and serves a six-year term. The current clerk of the First Judicial Circuit in Ohio County is Brenda Miller. Ohio County is part of the First Family Court Circuit of West Virginia, which covers the same three territories as the First Judicial Circuit. In West Virginia, Family Court judges have been elected to eight-year terms since 2008. The current judges of the First Family Circuit are Joyce D. Chernenko and Heather Wood.

Magistrates are elected in non-partisan elections serving four-year terms. Vacancies occurring in unexpired terms can be filled by a respective Circuit Court judge. Unlike Circuit Court and Family Court judges, magistrates are not required to be attorneys. Ohio County currently has four magistrates: Charles W. Murphy, Patricia L. Murphy, Joseph E. Roxby, and Janine L. Varner.

In West Virginia, prosecuting attorneys in each county are elected in partisan elections to four-year terms, currently Scott R. Smith. County sheriffs (who also serve &quot;ex-officio&quot; as county treasurer) are elected by each county to a four-year term, currently Thomas J. Howard. They are limited to two terms.

===Proposed metro government===
In 2006, the West Virginia Legislature adopted a new section to the West Virginia code – Chapter 7A – which provided for the consolidation of cities, cities with counties, or counties with counties. Interest has been expressed by some Ohio County residents and officials and has become the main political endeavour of a local council of churches called &quot;Hopeful City&quot;. As of March 2007, no official action has been taken in Ohio County on this matter. Other municipalities in West Virginia are considering consolidation including Beckley-Raleigh County and Fairmont-Marion County. The most significant proposals under this legislation include a consolidation of Wirt County with Wood County and a population consolidation for Kanawha-Putnam-Cabell counties.

==Politics==
In the West Virginia Senate, Ohio County is in the first Senate district, along with Hancock, Brooke, and part of Marshall counties. The district is represented by Laura Wakim Chapman (R-Wheeling) and Ryan Weld (R-Wellsburg).

In the West Virginia House of Delegates, parts of Ohio County are represented by the third, fourth, and fifth House of Delegates districts. The third district is represented by Delegate Jimmy Willis (R-Brooke County). The fourth district is represented by Diana Winzenreid (R-Wheeling). The fifth district is represented by Delegate Shawn Fluharty (D-Wheeling). All delegates to the state House serve two-year terms.

In the United States House of Representatives, Ohio County is part of the West Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which includes nearly all of the northern part of the state. The current Representative is Alex Mooney, a Republican from Charles Town in Jefferson County. West Virginia&#x27;s two senators, who represent the entire state, are Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin, a Republican from Charleston and a Democrat from Fairmont, respectively.

Although powerfully Unionist during the Civil War, Ohio County politics differs substantially from the two more northerly counties of the Northern Panhandle. The county was a competitive swing county for most of the period between Reconstruction and the end of the twentieth century, voting for the popular vote winner in every election except 1916, 1968 and 1976. Since 2000, like all of West Virginia, its conservative white voters have trended Republican due to a combination of declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social issues. The trend in the county has been less extreme than in most counties of the state.

===Dog races and gaming===
In 2007, the West Virginia Legislature adopted HB2718 which created Chapter 29-22 C of the West Virginia Code and permits county residents where racetracks are located to vote on expansion to table games. Ohio County was the first county in West Virginia to take action concerning the matter when the Ohio County Commission initiated a special election date of June 9 for the referendum. The ballot initiative successfully passed in Ohio County with 66% of the vote. The measure permits Wheeling Island Racetrack and Gaming Center to operate table games such as blackjack and poker. On June 9, Jefferson County voters rejected their ballot measure. On June 30, Hancock County voters approved their ballot measure. Kanawha County has scheduled a special election for August 11. While the West Virginia Family Foundation vowed to challenge the constitutionality of HB 2718, it announced on August 7 that it would not file any appeal on the matter. According to newspaper accounts, the West Virginia Lottery Commission has set November 1, 2007, as the latest date at which table games will begin preliminary operation at Wheeling Island Racetrack and Gaming Center.

<text>The Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) was an American atmospheric prediction system that consisted primarily of a numerical forecast model and an analysis system to initialize the model. The first operational implementation was created in 1994, with 60km resolution and a 3-hour cycle. 

The RUC was designed to provide accurate short-range (0- to 12-hr, later expanded to 18-hr in 2010) numerical forecast guidance for weather-sensitive users, such as those in the aviation community. Significant weather forecasting problems that occur in the 0- to 12-hr range include severe weather in all seasons (for example, tornadoes, thunderstorms, snow, and ice storms) and hazards to aviation (for example, clear air turbulence, icing, and downbursts). 

The RUC ran at the highest frequency of any forecast model at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), assimilating recent observations to provide very high frequency updates of current conditions and short-range forecasts. This update frequency was only once an hour (the standard interval for ASOS observation reporting), and with computational limitations and the time required to assimilate all of the data, there is approximately a one-hour delay in producing the forecasts. Because of this, it was common practice to use a one-hour forecast from the RUC as a current analysis, as the one-hour forecast would come out only a few minutes before the time it is forecasting for. There is also little possibility for error in a one-hour forecast, meaning that the RUC&#x27;s one-hour forecast would not usually vary greatly from the actual state of the atmosphere at that particular point in time.

The RUC was decommissioned on May 1, 2012; it was replaced by the Rapid Refresh (RR or RAP) model, based on the WRF. Like the RUC, the Rapid Refresh model also runs hourly out to 18 hours on a grid spacing, but also covers a wider area. An experimental High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) ran by the Earth System Research Laboratories (ESRL) offers resolution at 15-minute intervals. A backup version of the RUC continued to run until that too was stopped on May 15, 2013, thus formally bringing an end to the model.

<text>Barbour County is a county in north central West Virginia, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 15,465. The county seat is Philippi, which was chartered in 1844. Both county and city were named for Philip P. Barbour (1783–1841), a U.S. Congressman from Virginia and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The county was formed in 1843 when the region was still part of the state of Virginia. In 1871, a small part of Barbour County was transferred to Tucker County, West Virginia.

The Battle of Philippi, also known as the &quot;Philippi Races&quot;, was fought in Barbour County on June 3, 1861. Although a minor action, it is generally considered the first land engagement of the American Civil War.

For 114 years (1909-2023), Barbour County was home to Alderson-Broaddus College (later Alderson Broaddus University), an American Baptist institution. Its four-year Physician Assistant (PA) baccalaureate program was the first such anywhere.

==History==
===Settlement and formation===
The first white settlement in present-day Barbour County was established in 1780 by Richard Talbott – along with his brother Cotteral and sister Charity – about downriver from the future site of Philippi. At this time the region was still a part of Monongalia County, Virginia. The region had had no permanent Indian settlements and so conflicts with Native Americans were relatively infrequent in the early days. Nevertheless, the Talbotts were obliged to leave their homestead several times for safety and twice found it necessary to retreat back east of the Alleghenies, returning each time. No member of this eventually large family was ever killed by Indian attacks.

Over time, parts of the future Barbour County were included in the newly created Harrison (1784), Randolph (1787), and Lewis (1816) Counties. Barbour County itself was created in 1843 and named for the late Virginia politician and jurist Philip P. Barbour (1783–1841). (Barbour had served as a U.S. Congressman from Virginia, Speaker of the House, and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.) The settlement of Philippi – formerly &quot;Anglin&#x27;s Ford&quot; and &quot;Booth&#x27;s Ferry&quot; – was platted, named, and made the county seat in the same year; it was chartered in 1844. By the 1850s, when a major covered bridge was constructed at Philippi to service travellers on the Beverly-Fairmont Turnpike, the county&#x27;s population was approaching 10,000 people.

The first newspaper in the county was the &quot;Barbour Jeffersonian&quot;, published starting in August 1857 and running only to about June 1861. It was put out by Thompson Surghnor (1820-1864).

===Civil War===
In April 1861, an Ordinance of Secession from the United States of America was approved throughout the state of Virginia in a referendum. Delegates from 25 western counties, however, assembled at Wheeling on 13 May for the first of a two meetings (see Wheeling Convention) called to repeal the Ordinance. The delegates from Barbour County for the first convention were Spencer Dayton, John H. Shuttleworth, and E.H. Manafee. Barbour County had voted in favor of Virginia&#x27;s secession, though, and a palmetto secession flag had been flying above the courthouse since January, 1861.

On 3 June 1861, Philippi was the scene of one of the first battles of the American Civil War. The battle was later lampooned as the &quot;Philippi Races&quot; because of the hurried retreat by the Confederate troops encamped in the town. (The skirmish is reenacted every June during the town&#x27;s &quot;Blue and Gray Reunion&quot;.) At daylight on June 3, two columns of Union forces under the command of Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley and Col. Ebenezer Dumont, with perhaps 3,000 men, arrived from Grafton and attacked about 800 poorly armed Confederate recruits under the command of Col. George A. Porterfield. The Union troops had marched all night through a heavy rain storm to arrive just before daylight. The surprise attack awakened the sleeping Confederates. After firing a few shots at the advancing Union troops, the Southerners broke lines and began running frantically to the south, some still in their bed clothes.

The Union victory in a relatively bloodless battle propelled the young Major General George B. McClellan into the national spotlight, and he would soon be given command of all Union armies. The battle also inspired more vocal protests in the Western part of Virginia against secession. On 11 June, the second Wheeling Convention met in that city and Barbour County was again represented by Dayton and Shuttleworth, who were this time joined by N.H. Taft. The Convention nullified the Virginia Ordinance of Secession and named Francis H. Pierpont governor. These events would eventually result in the separate statehood of West Virginia.

===Later history===
The economy and infrastructure in Barbour grew steadily, but slowly, through the late 19th century. Although the first railroad had reached nearby Grafton in 1852, a narrow-gauge railroad was not laid through the county until the early 1880s; a standard gauge line followed in the 1890s.

In 1990, private developers offered Barbour County citizens $4M to $6M annually in host fees to accept out-of-state garbage into a County landfill over the following three decades. Up to 200,000 tons of garbage per month would be delivered. (At the time, the county&#x27;s annual budget was only about $1M.) County voters rejected the offer.

In 2023, Barbour County lost its major employer when Alderson-Broaddus University&#x27;s board of trustees voted to close the institution some 152 years after its founding.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

Barbour County is situated on the Allegheny Plateau at the western edge of the Allegheny Mountains (represented by Laurel Mountain at the county&#x27;s eastern boundary). Most of the county is drained by the Tygart Valley River which traverses it from south to north and on which its three largest settlements – Philippi, Belington, and Junior – are sited. Tributaries of the Tygart in the County include Teter Creek, Laurel Creek, Hacker&#x27;s Creek, the Buckhannon River and the West Fork River. A portion of the County in the west drains into the Middle Fork River, principally through Elk Creek. Audra State Park – the county&#x27;s only state park – is situated on the Middle Fork in the southwest corner. Teter Creek Lake Wildlife Management Area – the county&#x27;s only WMA – is located on that stream and lake in the eastern portion. All of the mentioned streams are part of the greater Monongahela River watershed.

Barbour County was generally split for most of the twentieth century, though it tended to vote more for Democrats rather than Republicans. This is due to the county&#x27;s split position in the American Civil War between Unionists and Secessionists. Since the 2000 presidential election, Barbour County has followed the trend with the rest of the state towards the Republicans.











==Economy==
Major employment in Barbour County is provided by health care and social service sectors, retail, education, accommodation and food services, logging and wood product manufacturing, trucking and construction. The largest employers are Alderson Broaddus University and Broaddus Hospital.

Bituminous coal mining has been significant in Barbour; seven times as much tonnage has been produced from underground as by surface mining. Natural gas and oil wells provide a modest amount of employment. Wholesale lumber production (wood and wood products) is also present. (The county is a member of the West Virginia Hardwood Alliance Zone.) There is notable production of eggs and horse raising, but the major agricultural products are livestock, forage, dairy foods and orchard fruits.

===Minor civil divisions===
In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Barbour County&#x27;s original magisterial districts were Barker, Cove, Elk, Glade, Philippi, Pleasant, and Union. Between 1880 and 1890, part of Barker District was split off to form Valley District. These eight districts continued until the 1970s, when they were consolidated into three districts: North, South, and West.

The names and boundaries of Barbour county&#x27;s historic magisterial districts were preserved as assessment and tax districts, alongside the corporations of Belington, Junior, and Philippi. The City of Philippi is divided into four wards, all of which are in Philippi District. The first and second wards of Belington are in Valley District, while the second and third ward are in Barker District.

<doc id="61373" wikidata="Q2886580" url="?curid=61373" title="Golden ratio base">
<text>Golden ratio base is a non-integer positional numeral system that uses the golden ratio (the irrational number formula_1 ≈ 1.61803399 symbolized by the Greek letter φ) as its base. It is sometimes referred to as base-φ, golden mean base, phi-base, or, colloquially, phinary. Any non-negative real number can be represented as a base-φ numeral using only the digits 0 and 1, and avoiding the digit sequence &quot;11&quot; – this is called a &quot;standard form&quot;. A base-φ numeral that includes the digit sequence &quot;11&quot; can always be rewritten in standard form, using the algebraic properties of the base φ — most notably that φ + φ = φ. For instance, 11φ = 100φ.

Despite using an irrational number base, when using standard form, all non-negative integers have a unique representation as a terminating (finite) base-φ expansion. The set of numbers which possess a finite base-φ representation is the ring [[Golden ratio base|Z]][formula_1]; it plays the same role in this numeral systems as dyadic rationals play in binary numbers, providing a possibility to multiply.

Other numbers have standard representations in base-φ, with rational numbers having recurring representations. These representations are unique, except that numbers with a terminating expansion also have a non-terminating expansion. For example, 1 = 0.1010101… in base-φ just as 1 = 0.99999… in decimal.

==Examples==
==Writing golden ratio base numbers in standard form==
In the following example of conversion from non-standard to standard form, the notation 1 is used to represent the signed digit −1.

211.01φ is not a standard base-φ numeral, since it contains a &quot;11&quot; and additionally a &quot;2&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; = −1, which are not &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.

To put a numeral in standard form, we may use the following substitutions: formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6. The substitutions may be applied in any order we like, as the result will be the same. Below, the substitutions applied to the number on the previous line are on the right, the resulting number on the left.

formula_7

Any positive number with a non-standard terminating base-φ representation can be uniquely standardized in this manner. If we get to a point where all digits are &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, except for the first digit being negative, then the number is negative. (The exception to this is when the first digit is negative one and the next two digits are one, like 1111.001=1.001.) This can be converted to the negative of a base-φ representation by negating every digit, standardizing the result, and then marking it as negative. For example, use a minus sign, or some other significance to denote negative numbers.

==Representing integers as golden ratio base numbers==

We can either consider our integer to be the (only) digit of a nonstandard base-φ numeral, and standardize it, or do the following:

1 × 1 = 1, φ × φ = 1 + φ and = −1 + φ. Therefore, we can compute

: (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ) + (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;φ) = ((&quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot;) + (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)φ),
: (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ) − (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;φ) = ((&quot;a&quot; − &quot;c&quot;) + (&quot;b&quot; − &quot;d&quot;)φ)

and

: (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ) × (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;φ) = ((&quot;ac&quot; + &quot;bd&quot;) + (&quot;ad&quot; + &quot;bc&quot; + &quot;bd&quot;)φ).

So, using integer values only, we can add, subtract and multiply numbers of the form (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ), and even represent positive and negative integer powers of φ.

(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ) &gt; (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;φ) if and only if 2(&quot;a&quot; − &quot;c&quot;) − (&quot;d&quot; − &quot;b&quot;) &gt; (&quot;d&quot; − &quot;b&quot;) × . If one side is negative, the other positive, the comparison is trivial. Otherwise, square both sides, to get an integer comparison, reversing the comparison direction if both sides were negative. On squaring both sides, the formula_8 is replaced with the integer 5.

So, using integer values only, we can also compare numbers of the form (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;φ).

# To convert an integer &quot;x&quot; to a base-φ number, note that &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;x&quot; + 0φ).
# Subtract the highest power of φ, which is still smaller than the number we have, to get our new number, and record a &quot;1&quot; in the appropriate place in the resulting base-φ number.
# Unless our number is 0, go to step 2.
# Finished.

The above procedure will never result in the sequence &quot;11&quot;, since 11φ = 100φ, so getting a &quot;11&quot; would mean we missed a &quot;1&quot; prior to the sequence &quot;11&quot;.

Start, e.g., with integer = 5, with the result so far being ...00000.00000...φ

Highest power of φ ≤ 5 is φ3 = 1 + 2φ ≈ 4.236067977

Subtracting this from 5, we have 5 − (1 + 2φ) = 4 − 2φ ≈ 0.763932023..., the result so far being 1000.00000...φ

Highest power of φ ≤ 4 − 2φ ≈ 0.763932023... is φ−1 = −1 + 1φ ≈ 0.618033989...

Subtracting this from 4 − 2φ ≈ 0.763932023..., we have 4 − 2φ − (−1 + 1φ) = 5 − 3φ ≈ 0.145898034..., the result so far being 1000.10000...φ

Highest power of φ ≤ 5 − 3φ ≈ 0.145898034... is φ−4 = 5 − 3φ ≈ 0.145898034...

Subtracting this from 5 − 3φ ≈ 0.145898034..., we have 5 − 3φ − (5 − 3φ) = 0 + 0φ = 0, with the final result being 1000.1001φ.

===Non-uniqueness===

Just as with any base-n system, numbers with a terminating representation have an alternative recurring representation. In base-10, this relies on the observation that 0.999...=1. In base-φ, the numeral 0.1010101... can be seen to be equal to 1 in several ways:

*Conversion to nonstandard form: 1 = 0.11φ = 0.1011φ = 0.101011φ = ... = 0.10101010...φ
*Geometric series: 1.0101010...φ is equal to
:formula_9
*Difference between &quot;shifts&quot;: φ2 &quot;x&quot; − &quot;x&quot; = 10.101010...φ − 0.101010...φ = 10φ = φ so that &quot;x&quot; = = 1

This non-uniqueness is a feature of the numeration system, since both 1.0000 and 0.101010... are in standard form.

In general, the final 1 of any number in base-φ can be replaced with a recurring 01 without changing the value of that number.

==Representing rational numbers as golden ratio base numbers==

Every non-negative rational number can be represented as a recurring base-φ expansion, as can any non-negative element of the field Q[] = Q + Q, the field generated by the rational numbers and formula_8. Conversely any recurring (or terminating) base-φ expansion is a non-negative element of Q[]. For recurring decimals, the recurring part has been overlined:

* = 0.010φ
* = 0.00101000φ
* = 0.001000φ
* = 0.001001010100100100φ
* = 0.000010000100010100001010001010101000100101000001001000100000φ

The justification that a rational gives a recurring expansion is analogous to the equivalent proof for a base-&quot;n&quot; numeration system (&quot;n&quot; = 2,3,4...). Essentially in base-φ long division there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and so once there must be a recurring pattern. For example, with = = long division looks like this (note that base-φ subtraction may be hard to follow at first):

The converse is also true, in that a number with a recurring base-φ; representation is an element of the field Q[]. This follows from the observation that a recurring representation with period k involves a geometric series with ratio φ−k, which will sum to an element of Q[].

==Representing irrational numbers of note as golden ratio base numbers==
The base-φ representations of some interesting numbers:
*  ≈ 100.0100 1010 1001 0001 0101 0100 0001 0100 ...φ 
* ≈ 100.0000 1000 0100 1000 0000 0100 ...φ 
* formula_11 ≈ 1.0100 0001 0100 1010 0100 0000 0101 0000 0000 0101 ...φ
* formula_8 = 10.1φ

==Addition, subtraction, and multiplication==
It is possible to adapt all the standard algorithms of base-10 arithmetic to base-φ arithmetic. There are two approaches to this:

===Calculate, then convert to standard form===
For addition of two base-φ numbers, add each pair of digits, without carry, and then convert the numeral to standard form. For subtraction, subtract each pair of digits without borrow (borrow is a negative amount of carry), and then convert the numeral to standard form. For multiplication, multiply in the typical base-10 manner, without carry, then convert the numeral to standard form.

For example,
*2 + 3 = 10.01 + 100.01 = 110.02 = 110.1001 = 1000.1001
*2 × 3 = 10.01 × 100.01 = 1000.1 + 1.0001 = 1001.1001 = 1010.0001
*7 − 2 = 10000.0001 − 10.01 = 10010.0101 = 1110.0101 = 1001.0101 = 1000.1001

===Avoid digits other than 0 and 1===
A more &quot;native&quot; approach is to avoid having to add digits 1+1 or to subtract 0 – 1. This is done by reorganising the operands into nonstandard form so that these combinations do not occur. For example,
* 2 + 3 = 10.01 + 100.01 = 10.01 + 100.0011 = 110.0111 = 1000.1001
* 7 − 2 = 10000.0001 − 10.01 = 1100.0001 − 10.01 = 1011.0001 − 10.01 = 1010.1101 − 10.01 = 1000.1001
The subtraction seen here uses a modified form of the standard &quot;trading&quot; algorithm for subtraction.

==Division==
No non-integer rational number can be represented as a finite base-φ number. In other words, all finitely representable base-φ numbers are either integers or (more likely) an irrational in a quadratic field Q[]. Due to long division having only a finite number of possible remainders, a division of two integers (or other numbers with finite base-φ representation) will have a recurring expansion, as demonstrated above.

==Relationship with Fibonacci coding==
Fibonacci coding is a closely related numeration system used for integers. In this system, only digits 0 and 1 are used and the place values of the digits are the Fibonacci numbers. As with base-φ, the digit sequence &quot;11&quot; is avoided by rearranging to a standard form, using the Fibonacci recurrence relation &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1. For example,
:30 = 1×21 + 0×13 + 1×8 + 0×5 + 0×3 + 0×2 + 1×1 + 0×1 = 10100010fib.

==Practical usage==
It is possible to mix base-φ arithmetic with Fibonacci integer sequences. The sum of numbers in a General Fibonacci integer sequence that correspond with the nonzero digits in the base-φ number, is the multiplication of the base-φ number and the element at the zero-position in the sequence. For example:
*product 10 (10100.0101 base-φ) and 25 (zero position) = 5 + 10 + 65 + 170 = 250
*:base-φ: 1 0 1 0 0. 0 1 0 1 
*:partial sequence: ... 5 5 10 15 &quot;25&quot; 40 65 105 170 275 445 720 1165 ...
*product 10 (10100.0101 base-φ) and 65 (zero position) = 10 + 25 + 170 + 445 = 650
*:base-φ: 1 0 1 0 0. 0 1 0 1 
*:partial sequence: ... 5 5 10 15 25 40 &quot;65&quot; 105 170 275 445 720 1165 ...

<text>Correa is a genus of eleven species of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae that are endemic to Australia. Plants in the genus &quot;Correa&quot; are shrubs to small trees with simple leaves arranged in opposite pairs, bisexual flowers with four sepals, four petals usually fused for most of their length and eight stamens.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Correa&quot; are shrubs to small trees with simple leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are bisexual and are arranged in cymes in leaf s or on the ends of branchlets. The four sepals are fused, at least at the base, forming a cup-shaped calyx. The four petals are usually fused for most of their length to form a tubular corolla and the eight stamens are free from each other. There are four carpels fused at the base, the four styles are fused and the stigma is similar to the style. The follicles contain up to two dull brown seed that are released explosively.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Correa&quot; was first formally described in 1798 by Henry Cranke Andrews in &quot;The Botanist&#x27;s Repository for New, and Rare Plants&quot; and the first species he described was &quot;Correa alba&quot;. The genus is named after the Portuguese botanist José Correia da Serra (1750–1823), known as Abbé Correa.

==Use in horticulture==
Many &quot;Correa&quot; hybrids are grown in Australian gardens. They are generally easy to grow. &quot;Correa alba&quot; and &quot;C. glabra&quot; varieties are the hardiest withstanding heavy frost and severe droughts. They can be grown in either full sun or a partly shaded spot in the garden. &quot;Correa glabra&quot; varieties have fragrant leaves. &quot;Correa lawrenceana&quot; is the largest of the correas. These need to be grown in the shade and do best in an understorey habitat. They are highly attractive to birds for both nectar and nest sites and are ideally planted in a thicket. &quot;Correa pulchella&quot; varieties produce the most beautiful coloured bells ranging from pale pink to deep orange to carmine. They need to be grown in part shade and watered regularly. &quot;Correa reflexa&quot; varieties range in colour from green to deep red. They also need to be grown in a partly shaded position and watered regularly. Some &quot;Correa&quot; species, such as &quot;C. eburnea&quot; and &quot;C. calycina&quot;, are endangered and difficult to obtain in the nursery trade.

There are also hundreds of named cultivars, many of which have been registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA).

In cultivation in the UK the following species and cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-
*&quot;Correa backhouseana&quot; 
*&quot;Correa pulchella&quot; 
*&quot;Correa reflexa&quot; 
*&quot;Correa&quot; &#x27;Dusky Bells&#x27;
*&quot;Correa&quot; &#x27;Mannii&#x27;

<text>ObjectPAL is short for Object-Oriented Paradox Application Language, which is the programming language used by the Borland Paradox database application (now owned by Corel).

Paradox, now in its 11th version, is a constituent of Corel&#x27;s Word Perfect X3 office suite, for 32-bit Microsoft Windows. The language is tightly-bound to the application&#x27;s forms, and provides a very rapid and robust development environment for creating database applications for Windows. ObjectPAL is not a full free-standing object-oriented language. It belongs to the family of languages inspired by Hypercard, with influences from PAL (wherever functionality could be kept the same), Smalltalk, and Garnet (a UI language created by Brad Myers). While its objects do encapsulate source code, there is no support for polymorphism, and only a very limited inheritance concept, which is wedded to objects on a form which can be controlled by code placed on a higher object in a form&#x27;s object hierarchy. However, for what it is, ObjectPAL provides a wideranging and versatile language for creating Paradox applications. The syntax and structure of the language resembles Visual Basic, but knowing Visual Basic would only help someone new to ObjectPAL in the sense that any other programming skill would be transferable to ObjectPAL. ObjectPAL was the successor to PAL, which was the Paradox for DOS programming language. With the advent of Paradox for Windows 1.0 in 1993, which was then owned by Borland Corporation, ObjectPAL was born. Version 1.0 was quickly succeeded by version 4.5 that same year.

It can be used as such as a web server scripting language when combined with the Corel Web Server Control OCX, which implements a server API similar to the CGI, and its standalone console, the Corel Web Server.

<text>John Canaparius, O.S.B. Cam., (), was a German Camaldolese monk who became the prior of the Monastery of Santi Bonifacio ed Alessio in Rome. It had been long assumed that in the year 999 he wrote the first &quot;Vita sancti Adalberti episcopi Pragensis&quot;, or &quot;Life of St. Adalbert of Prague&quot;, another member of that monastery, just two years after Adalbert&#x27;s death.

Adalbert was sent by Pope Gregory V to convert the pagan Old Prussians to Christianity and had come to Prussia, apparently taking the route along the Vistula River to reach the Baltic Sea at „urbem Gyddanyzc“., which is identified with the later Gdańsk (Danzig). Then a small trading and fishing settlement with wooden buildings.

It is, however, now assumed by Johannes Fried, that the &#x27;Vita&#x27; was not written by Canaparius, but was written down in Liège, with the oldest traceable version having been at the imperial Adalbert shrine at Aachen. It was only recently recovered at the Marienstift, and is used to reconstruct the archetype of the &quot;Vita&quot;. Notger of Liège, a hagiographer himself, apparently had knowledge of the earlier handwritten &quot;Vita&quot; from Aachen. The imperial court at Aachen had in 997 assembled immediately upon receiving word of Adalbert&#x27;s death and had thereupon planned the upcoming events.

Another famous biographer of Adalbert was St. Bruno of Querfurt who wrote his hagiography in 1001–1004.

Nikolaus von Jeroschin, a priest of the Teutonic Order, translated the &quot;Vita Sancti Adalberti&quot; into Middle High German in the 14th century.

<doc id="61388" wikidata="Q192454" url="?curid=61388" title="Deoxyribose">
<text>Deoxyribose, or more precisely 2-deoxyribose, is a monosaccharide with idealized formula H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H. Its name indicates that it is a deoxy sugar, meaning that it is derived from the sugar ribose by loss of a hydroxy group. Discovered in 1929 by Phoebus Levene, deoxyribose is most notable for its presence in DNA. Since the pentose sugars arabinose and ribose only differ by the stereochemistry at C2′, 2-deoxyribose and 2-deoxyarabinose are equivalent, although the latter term is rarely used because ribose, not arabinose, is the precursor to deoxyribose.

==Structure==
Several isomers exist with the formula H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H, but in deoxyribose all the hydroxyl groups are on the same side in the Fischer projection. The term &quot;2-deoxyribose&quot; may refer to either of two enantiomers: the biologically important -2-deoxyribose and to the rarely encountered mirror image -2-deoxyribose. -2-deoxyribose is a precursor to the nucleic acid DNA. 2-deoxyribose is an aldopentose, that is, a monosaccharide with five carbon atoms and having an aldehyde functional group.

In aqueous solution, deoxyribose primarily exists as a mixture of three structures: the linear form H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H and two ring forms, deoxyribofuranose (&quot;C3′-endo&quot;), with a five-membered ring, and deoxyribopyranose (&quot;C2′-endo&quot;), with a six-membered ring. The latter form is predominant (whereas the C3′-endo form is favored for ribose). 
== Biological importance ==
As a component of DNA, 2-deoxyribose derivatives have an important role in biology. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule, which is the main repository of genetic information in life, consists of a long chain of deoxyribose-containing units called nucleotides, linked via phosphate groups. In the standard nucleic acid nomenclature, a DNA nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose molecule with an organic base (usually adenine, thymine, guanine or cytosine) attached to the 1′ ribose carbon. The 5′ hydroxyl of each deoxyribose unit is replaced by a phosphate (forming a nucleotide) that is attached to the 3′ carbon of the deoxyribose in the preceding unit. 

The absence of the 2′ hydroxyl group in deoxyribose is apparently responsible for the increased mechanical flexibility of DNA compared to RNA, which allows it to assume the double-helix conformation, and also (in the eukaryotes) to be compactly coiled within the small cell nucleus. The double-stranded DNA molecules are also typically much longer than RNA molecules. The backbone of RNA and DNA are structurally similar, but RNA is single stranded, and made from ribose as opposed to deoxyribose.

Other biologically important derivatives of deoxyribose include mono-, di-, and triphosphates, as well as 3′-5′ cyclic monophosphates.

===Biosynthesis===
Deoxyribose is generated from ribose 5-phosphate by enzymes called ribonucleotide reductases. These enzymes catalyse the deoxygenation process.

===Angiogenesis===
In one study, deoxyribose was shown to have pro-angiogenic properties when applied topically in a gel to wounds in rats. In addition, this topical gel also increased Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which has been implicated in hair growth. This could potentially lead to future products to treat hair loss in humans.

<doc id="61392" wikidata="Q160813" url="?curid=61392" title="1962 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 1962 FIFA World Cup was the 7th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football championship for senior men&#x27;s national teams. It was held from 30 May to 17 June 1962 in Chile. The qualification rounds took place between August 1960 and December 1961, with 56 teams entering from six confederations, and fourteen qualifying for the finals tournament alongside Chile, the hosts, and Brazil, the defending champions.

Brazil successfully defended their World Cup title, defeating Czechoslovakia 3–1 in the final in the Chilean capital Santiago. They became the second team, after Italy in 1934 and 1938, to win the World Cup twice consecutively; no team has since achieved the feat. Host nation Chile finished third, defeating Yugoslavia 1–0 in the third-place play-off.

The tournament was marred by violence between players on the pitch and a toxic atmosphere; it included the first-round match between Chile and Italy (2–0), which became known as the Battle of Santiago, one of a number of violent matches played throughout the tournament. It was the first World Cup that used goal average as a means of separating teams with the same number of points. It was also the first World Cup in which the average number of goals per match was less than three (2.78); this has been repeated at every World Cup since.

==Host selection==

After Europe hosted two consecutive World Cups, the American federations demanded the 1962 edition must be held in South America or they would stage a complete boycott of the tournament, similar to 1938. Argentina, after previously failed candidacies, was the favorite. Magallanes&#x27; chairman, Ernesto Alvear, attended a FIFA Congress held in Helsinki while the Finnish city was hosting the 1952 Summer Olympics. He considered that Chile was able to organise the World Cup. Several sources also say that FIFA did not want Argentina to run alone, requesting the participation of Chile as almost symbolic. Chile registered its candidacy in 1954 alongside Argentina and West Germany, the latter withdrawing at the request of FIFA.

Chile&#x27;s football federation committee, led by Carlos Dittborn and Juan Pinto Durán, toured many countries convincing various football associations about the country&#x27;s ability to organise the tournament in comparison to Argentina&#x27;s superior sports infrastructure and prestige. The FIFA Congress met in Lisbon, Portugal on 10 June 1956. That day, Raul Colombo, representing Argentina&#x27;s candidacy, ended his speech with the phrase &quot;We can start the World Cup tomorrow. We have it all.&quot; The next day, Dittborn presented four arguments that supported Chile&#x27;s candidacy: Chile&#x27;s continued participations at FIFA-organised conferences and tournaments, sports climate, tolerance of race and creed and political and institutional stability of the country. In addition, Dittborn invoked Article 2 of the FIFA statutes that addressed the tournament&#x27;s role in promoting the sport in countries deemed &quot;underdeveloped&quot;. In a counter-point to Colombo&#x27;s claim that &quot;We have it all&quot; Dittborn coined the phrase &quot;Because we have nothing, we want to do it all&quot; () around the fifteenth minute of his speech. Chile won 32 votes to Argentina&#x27;s 10. Fourteen members abstained from voting.

==Qualification==
57 teams entered the 1962 World Cup (due to rejected entries and withdrawals, 52 teams eventually participated in the qualifying stages). Chile as host nation and Brazil as reigning World Cup champions were granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 14 finals places divided among the continental confederations.

Eight places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe) and three by CONMEBOL teams (South America). CAF teams (Africa), AFC teams (Asia), NAFC teams (North America), and CCCF teams (Central America and Caribbean) contested three play-offs slots. The three winners would then face a European or South American team for entry into the World Cup. The 1962 tournament was the last one for which only nations from Europe or the Americas qualified.

Two teams qualified for the first time ever: Colombia and Bulgaria. Colombia would not qualify for another World Cup until 1990.

Among the teams who failed to qualify were the 1958 runners up Sweden and third-place finishers France. Austria withdrew during the qualification tournament due to financial problems.

Italy, Switzerland and Uruguay all qualified for the first time since 1954, and Spain for the first time since 1950. Scotland failed to qualify for the first time since rejoining FIFA in 1946 (though they had ultimately also declined to participate in the 1950 edition).

==Venues==
Originally, eight stadiums were selected to host the World Cup matches in eight cities: Santiago, Viña del Mar, Rancagua, Arica, Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia.

The Valdivia earthquake, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, occurred on 22 May 1960. With over 50,000 casualties and more than 2 million people affected, the earthquake forced the organising committee to completely modify the World Cup&#x27;s calendar. Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia were severely damaged and discarded as venues. Antofagasta and Valparaíso declined to host any matches as their venues were not financially self-sustainable. Viña del Mar and Arica managed to rebuild their stadiums while Braden Copper Company, then an American company that controlled the El Teniente copper mine, allowed the use of its stadium in Rancagua. Due to these setbacks, this is the World Cup edition with the smallest number of venues spread across the country (while the 1930 FIFA World Cup was held in three venues, all of them were located in a single city). The most used stadium was the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, with 10 matches; the Estadio Sausalito in Viña del Mar hosted 8 matches, and the stadiums in Rancagua and far-away Arica (the only location that was not close to the other cities) both hosted 7 matches. Being that Estadio Nacional was the only large venue of the tournament (all others had less than 20,000 seats), it also saw the largest attendance average, by far, with Estadio Sausalito&#x27;s attendance only being boosted with the Brazil matches it hosted (the semifinal between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia was the only one in the stadium with less than 10,000 spectators).

Being largely concerned with the build-up of the country after the 1960 earthquake, government support for the tournament was minimal.

===Team bases===
==Squads==

Squads for the 1962 World Cup consisted of 22 players, as for the previous tournament in 1958.

After Attilio Demaría and Luis Monti, who both represented Argentina in 1930 and Italy in 1934, Ferenc Puskás (Hungary in 1954, then Spain), José Santamaría (Uruguay in 1954, then Spain) and José Altafini (Brazil in 1958, then Italy) became the third, fourth and fifth players to play for two national teams in the World Cup. In light of this, FIFA created stipulations describing that once a player represents a nation during a World Cup or its qualifying rounds the player cannot switch to another national team. Robert Prosinečki and Robert Jarni would later become the sixth and seventh such players, playing for Yugoslavia in 1990, then for Croatia in 1998; Davor Šuker was also selected in both squads, but did not play in 1990. This was accepted by FIFA because Croatia was a newly independent former republic of Yugoslavia.

==Match officials==
Eighteen match officials from 17 countries were assigned to the tournament to serve as referees and assistant referees.

==Seeding==
==Format==
The format of the competition was similar to that of the 1958 competition: 16 teams qualified, divided into four groups of four. Four teams were seeded in the draw taking place in Santiago, on 18 January 1962: Brazil, England, Italy and Uruguay. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter-finals.

Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw. In a change from the 1958 format, goal average was used to separate any teams equal on points. (In 1958, goal average was available, but was only between teams level on points in first place, or if a playoff between teams equal in second place failed to yield a result after extra time). Argentina became the first team in World Cup history to be eliminated on goal average when England advanced from Group 4 in second place.

In the knockout games, if the teams were level after ninety minutes, thirty minutes of extra time were played. For any match other than the final, if the teams were still even after extra time then lots would be drawn to determine the winner. The final would have been replayed if still tied after extra time; but if still tied after the replay, the champion would have been decided by drawing lots. In the event, no replays or drawing of lots were necessary.

==Summary==
In May 1960, as the preparations were well under way, Chile suffered the largest earthquake ever recorded (9.5 magnitude), which caused enormous damage to the national infrastructure. In the face of this, Carlos Dittborn, the president of the Organization Committee, coined the phrase &quot;Porque nada tenemos, lo haremos todo&quot; (Because we have nothing, we will do everything). Stadia and other infrastructure were rebuilt at record speed and the tournament occurred on schedule with no major organisational flaw. Dittborn did not live to see the success of his efforts, as he died one month before the start of the tournament. The World Cup venue at Arica was named Estadio Carlos Dittborn in his honour and bears his name to this day. Even with these few and low-capacity stadiums Chile was able to meet the demand for seats as international travel to Chile, far-away for Europe, was minimal at the time.

President Jorge Alessandri gave an uninspiring inaugural speech before the first match, which was played between Chile and Switzerland. Alessandri left however before the end of the match. While Chilean society was living in a &quot;footballized&quot; atmosphere, Alessandri was criticized for his cold attitude towards the tournament, which forced his ministers to come out and claim he was as &quot;footballized&quot; as everybody else, but was too busy to devote too much attention to the competition.

The competition was marred by constant violence on the pitch. This poisonous atmosphere culminated in the first-round match between host Chile and Italy (2–0), known as the &quot;Battle of Santiago&quot;. Two Italian journalists had written unflattering articles about the host country and its capital city; describing Santiago as a &quot;proudly backwards and poverty-stricken dump full of prostitution and crime&quot;. Although only two players (both of them Italian) were sent off by the English referee Ken Aston, the match saw repeated attempts from players on both sides to harm opponents, and the Italian team needed police protection to leave the field in safety. Articles in the Italian papers &quot;La Nazione&quot; and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; were saying that allowing Chile to host the World Cup was &quot;pure madness&quot;; this was used and magnified by local newspapers to inflame the Chilean population. The British newspaper the Daily Express wrote &quot;The tournament shows every sign of developing into a violent bloodbath. Reports read like battlefront despatches; the Italy vs West Germany match was described as &#x27;wrestling and warfare&#x27;&quot;.

As the competition began, a shift in strategy was imminent. Defensive strategies began to take hold as the average goals per match dropped to 2.78, under 3 for the first time in competition history (the average has never been above 3 since).

Pelé was injured in the second group match against Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union goalkeeper Lev Yashin, arguably the best goalkeeper in the world at the time, was in poor form and his team went out to Chile (1–2) in the quarter-finals. Bright spots included the emergence of the young Brazilians Amarildo (standing in for Pelé) and Garrincha, the heroics of Czechoslovakia goalkeeper Viliam Schrojf against Hungary and Yugoslavia, and the performance of the host nation Chile, who took third place with a squad of relatively unknown players.. This has been the best performance of a South American team in a World Cup so far without taking into account the historical ones (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay).

In the first round, Brazil topped their group with Czechoslovakia finishing second, above Mexico and Spain, even as the latter had in their ranks the naturalized Ferenc Puskás and Alfredo Di Stéfano who, injured, was called up but did not play. USSR and Yugoslavia finished above Uruguay and Colombia. Hungary, along with England progressed to the quarter-finals, while Argentina and Bulgaria were eliminated. England had the same number of points as Argentina but progressed due to a superior goal average; the first time such a requirement had been necessary in a World Cup finals tournament. Switzerland lost all three games while West Germany and Chile both went through over Italy.

Chile defeated European champions USSR to earn a semi-final game against the winner of the England – Brazil game. Garrincha scored two goals in a 3–1 win against England. Meanwhile, 1–0 wins for Yugoslavia against West Germany – and another 1–0 win of Czechoslovakia against neighbours Hungary – saw the two Slavic states meet in the semi-finals.

Viña del Mar was the original venue for the South American semi-final and Santiago for the Slavic one, but due to Chile&#x27;s surprise qualification, the organisers prompted FIFA to switch the venues. This irritated crowds in Viña del Mar and only a little under 6,000 spectators came to Estadio Sausalito to watch Czechoslovakia beat Yugoslavia 3–1, whereas a capacity crowd of 76,600 in Santiago watched Brazil beat the hosts 4–2. This game saw Garrincha sent off for Brazil and Honorino Landa sent off for Chile. Chile eventually took third place in a 1–0 victory over Yugoslavia with the last play of the match. The same player, Eladio Rojas, had also scored the winning goal in Chile&#x27;s game against USSR.

Santiago&#x27;s Estadio Nacional served as the venue for the final, and after 15 minutes, Brazil again found themselves a goal behind in the World Cup final, as a long ball from Adolf Scherer was latched onto by Josef Masopust: 1–0 Czechoslovakia. As in the previous final in 1958, Brazil soon hit back, equalising two minutes later through Amarildo after an error by Czechoslovak goalkeeper Schroijf. The Brazilians scored goals from Zito and Vavá (another Schrojf error) midway through the second half, and the Czechoslovaks could not get back into the game. The match ended 3–1 to Brazil, a successful defence of the title for only the second time in the history of the competition in spite of the absence of one of their star players of 1958, Pelé, who was replaced by Amarildo.

<text>Arthur Edward Waite (2 October 1857 – 19 May 1942) was a British poet and scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult and esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider–Waite Tarot (also called the Rider–Waite–Smith or Waite–Smith deck). As his biographer R. A. Gilbert described him, &quot;Waite&#x27;s name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of Western occultism—viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of protoscience or as the pathology of religion.&quot;

He was a Freemason, as well as being a member of the SRIA and Golden Dawn.

He spent most of his life in or near London, connected to various publishing houses and editing a magazine, &quot;The Unknown World&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Arthur Edward Waite was born on 2 October 1857 in Brooklyn, New York, America, to unmarried parents. Waite&#x27;s father, Capt. Charles F. Waite, died at sea when Arthur was very young, and his widowed mother, Emma Lovell, returned to her home country of England, where he was then raised. They were well enough off to educate Waite at a small private school in North London.

When he was 13, he was educated for two terms at St. Charles&#x27; College. When he left school to become a clerk he wrote verse in his spare time. In 1863 Waite&#x27;s mother converted to Catholicism and Arthur was raised a Catholic. The death of his sister Frederika Waite in 1874 soon attracted him into psychical research. At 21, he began to read regularly in the Library of the British Museum, studying many branches of esotericism. In 1881 Waite discovered the writings of Eliphas Levi.

==Career==

===Golden Dawn===

Waite joined the Outer Order of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in January 1891 after being introduced by E.W. Berridge. In 1893 he withdrew from the Golden Dawn. In 1896 he rejoined the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1899 he entered the Second order of the Golden Dawn. He became a Freemason in 1901, and entered the &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia&quot; in 1902.

In 1903 Waite founded the Independent and Rectified Order R. R. et A. C. This Order was disbanded in 1914. The Golden Dawn was torn by internal feuding until Waite&#x27;s departure in 1914; in July 1915 he formed the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross, not to be confused with the &quot;Societas Rosicruciana&quot;. By that time there existed some half-dozen offshoots from the original Golden Dawn, and as a whole it never recovered.

===Freemason===
Waite was interested in the higher grades of Freemasonry and saw initiation into Craft Masonry as a way to gain access to these rites. After joining the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and the Knights Templar, Waite traveled to Switzerland in 1903 to receive the &quot;Régime Ecossais Rectifié&quot; or the Rectified Scottish Rite and its grade of &quot;Chevalier Bienfaisant de la Cité Sainte&quot; (C.B.C.S.). Waite believed that the Rectified Scottish Rite, more than any other Masonic Rite, represented the &quot;Secret Tradition&quot; of mystical spiritual illumination.

===Writer and scholar===
Waite was a writer and many of his works were well received in the esoteric circles of his time, but his lack of academic training is visible in his limitations as a historian and in his belittling of other authors.

He wrote texts on subjects including divination, esotericism, freemasonry, and ceremonial magic, Kabbalism and alchemy; he also translated and reissued several mystical works. He wrote about the Holy Grail, influenced by his friendship with Arthur Machen. A number of his volumes remain in print, including &quot;The Book of Ceremonial Magic&quot; (1911), &quot;The Holy Kabbalah&quot; (1929), &quot;A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry&quot; (1921), and his edited translation of Eliphas Levi&#x27;s 1896 &quot;Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual&quot; (1910), having been reprinted in recent years.

Waite also wrote two allegorical fantasy novels, &quot;Prince Starbeam&quot; (1889) and &quot;The Quest of the Golden Stairs&quot; (1893), and edited &quot;Elfin Music&quot;, an anthology of poetry based on English fairy folklore.

==Tarot deck==

Waite is best known for his involvement with the Rider–Waite Tarot, first published in 1910, with illustrations by fellow Golden Dawn member Pamela Colman Smith. Waite authored the deck&#x27;s companion volume, the &quot;Key to the Tarot&quot;, republished in expanded form in 1911 as the &quot;Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, a guide to tarot reading. The Rider–Waite Tarot was notable for illustrating all 78 cards fully, at a time when only the 22 Major Arcana cards were typically illustrated, with the Sola Busca tarot, 1491, being a notable historical exception. Prior to the publication of this deck, many esoteric tarot readers used the Tarot of Marseilles playing card deck. The Rider-Waite deck has gone on to have a large influence on contemporary tarot card reading.

==Personal life==
In 1888, he married Ada Lakeman (also called &quot;Lucasta&quot;), and they had one daughter, Sybil. From 1900 to 1909, Waite earned a living as a manager for Horlicks, the manufacturer of malted milk.

Lucasta died in 1924. In 1933, Waite married Mary Broadbent Schofield.

==In popular culture==
H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; includes a character named Ephraim Waite. According to Robert M. Price, this character was based on A. E. Waite.

<doc id="61398" wikidata="Q1489259" url="?curid=61398" title="Superpower">
<text>Superpower describes a sovereign state or supranational union that holds a dominant position characterized by the ability to exert influence and project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined means of economic, military, technological, political, and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers. While a great power state is capable of exerting its influence globally, superpowers are states so influential that no significant action can be taken by the global community without first considering the positions of the superpowers on the issue.

In 1944, during World War II, the term was first applied to the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the United States. During the Cold War, the British Empire dissolved, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union to dominate world affairs. At the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States became the world&#x27;s sole superpower, a position sometimes referred to as that of a &quot;hyperpower&quot;. Since the late 2010s and into the 2020s, China has increasingly been described as an emerging superpower or even an established one, as China represents the &quot;biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century&quot; to the United States, as it is &quot;the only country with enough power to jeopardize the current global order&quot;.

== Origin ==
No agreed definition of what a superpower is exists and may differ between sources. However, a fundamental characteristic that is consistent with all definitions of a superpower is a nation or state that has mastered the seven dimensions of state power, namely geography, population, economy, resources, military, diplomacy, and national identity.

The term was first used to describe nations with greater than great power status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. This was because the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance. The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book &quot;The Geography of the Peace&quot;, which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and the United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.

A year later, William T. R. Fox, an American foreign policy professor, elaborated on the concept in the book &quot;The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace&quot; which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation. Fox used the word superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which—as the war then raging demonstrated—states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, at that moment, there were three states that were superpowers, namely the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The British Empire was the most extensive empire in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world&#x27;s population and controlling about 25% of the Earth&#x27;s total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during World War II. The UK would face serious political, financial, and colonial issues after World War II that left it unable to match Soviet or American power. Ultimately, Britain&#x27;s empire would gradually dissolve over the course of the 20th century, sharply reducing its global power projection.

According to Lyman Miller, &quot;[t]he basic components of superpower stature may be measured along four axes of power: military, economic, political, and cultural (or what political scientist Joseph Nye has termed &quot;soft power&quot;)&quot;.

In the opinion of Kim Richard Nossal of Queen&#x27;s University in Canada, &quot;generally, this term was used to signify a political community that occupied a continental-sized landmass; had a sizable population (relative at least to other major powers); a superordinate economic capacity, including ample indigenous supplies of food and natural resources; enjoyed a high degree of non-dependence on international intercourse; and, most importantly, had a well-developed nuclear capacity (eventually, normally defined as second strike capability)&quot;.

In the opinion of Professor Paul Dukes, &quot;a superpower must be able to conduct a global strategy, including the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universal ideology&quot;. Although &quot;many modifications may be made to this basic definition&quot;. According to Professor June Teufel Dreyer, &quot;[a] superpower must be able to project its power, soft and hard, globally&quot;. In his book &quot;&quot;, Dr. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, argues that a superpower is &quot;a country that can exert enough military, political, and economic power to persuade nations in every region of the world to take important actions they would not otherwise take&quot;.

Apart from its common denotation of the foremost post-WWII states, the term &quot;superpower&quot; has colloquially been applied by some authors retrospectively to describe various preeminent ancient great empires or medieval great powers, in works such as Channel 5 (UK)&#x27;s documentary &quot;&quot; or the reference in &quot;The New Cambridge Medieval History&quot; to &quot;the other superpower, Sasanian Persia&quot;.

== During the Cold War ==


The 1956 Suez Crisis suggested that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its foreign policy objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world&#x27;s largest long-term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods; moreover, it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.

The two countries opposed each other ideologically, politically, militarily, and economically. The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of Marxism–Leninism, planned economy, and a one-party state while the United States promoted the ideologies of liberal democracy and the free market in a capitalist market economy. This was reflected in the Warsaw Pact and NATO military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. These alliances implied that these two nations were part of an emerging bipolar world, in contrast with a previously multipolar world.

The idea that the Cold War period revolved around only two blocs, or even only two nations, has been challenged by some scholars in the post–Cold War era, who have noted that the bipolar world only exists if one ignores all of the various movements and conflicts that occurred without influence from either of the two superpowers. Additionally, much of the conflict between the superpowers was fought in proxy wars, which more often than not involved issues more complex than the standard Cold War oppositions.

After the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s, the term hyperpower began to be applied to the United States as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era. This term, popularized by French foreign minister Hubert Védrine in the late 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory is Samuel P. Huntington, who rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar balance of power. Other international relations theorists such as Henry Kissinger theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Western Europe and Japan, American influence is only declining since the end of the Cold War because such regions no longer need protection or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.

== After the Cold War ==

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 which ended the Cold War, the post–Cold War world has in the past been considered by some to be a unipolar world, with the United States as the world&#x27;s sole remaining superpower. In 1999, political scientist and author Samuel P. Huntington wrote: &quot;The United States, of course, is the sole state with preeminence in every domain of power – economic, military, diplomatic, ideological, technological, and cultural – with the reach and capabilities to promote its interests in virtually every part of the world&quot;. However, Huntington rejected the claim that the world was unipolar, arguing: &quot;There is now only one superpower. But that does not mean that the world is unipolar&quot;, describing it instead as &quot;a strange hybrid, a uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers&quot;. He further wrote that &quot;Washington is blind to the fact that it no longer enjoys the dominance it had at the end of the Cold War. It must relearn the game of international politics as a major power, not a superpower, and make compromises&quot;.

Experts argue that this older single-superpower assessment of global politics is too simplified, in part because of the difficulty in classifying the European Union at its current stage of development. Others argue that the notion of a superpower is outdated, considering complex global economic interdependencies and propose that the world is multipolar.

A 2012 report by the National Intelligence Council predicted that the United States superpower status will have eroded to merely being first among equals by 2030, but that it would remain highest among the world&#x27;s most powerful countries because of its influence in many different fields and global connections that the great regional powers of the time would not match. Additionally, some experts have suggested the possibility of the United States losing its superpower status completely in the future, citing speculation of its decline in power relative to the rest of the world, economic hardships, a declining dollar, Cold War allies becoming less dependent on the United States, and the emergence of future powers around the world.

According to a RAND Corporation paper by American diplomat James Dobbins, Professor Howard J. Shatz, and policy analyst Ali Wyne, Russia in the breakdown of a disintegrating unipolar world order, while not a peer competitor to the United States, would still remain a player and a potential rogue state that would undermine global affairs. The West could contain Russia with methods like those employed during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, though this would be tested by Russia&#x27;s overt and covert efforts to destabilize Western alliances and political systems. On the other hand, China is a peer competitor to the United States that cannot be contained, and will be a far more challenging entity for the West to confront. The authors state that China&#x27;s military dominance in the Asia-Pacific is already eroding American influence at a rapid pace, and the costs for the US to defend its interests there will continue to rise. Moreover, China&#x27;s economic influence has already broken out of its regional confines long ago and is on track to directly contest the US role as the center for economic trade and commerce.

== Potential superpowers ==


The term potential superpowers has been applied by scholars and other qualified commentators to the possibility of several political entities achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Due to their large markets, growing military strength, economic potential, and influence in international affairs, China, the European Union, India, and Russia are among the political entities most cited as having the potential of achieving superpower status in the 21st century. In 2020, a new UBS survey found that 57% of global investors predicted that China would replace the U.S. as the world&#x27;s biggest superpower by 2030. However, many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts about whether China or India would ever emerge as a new superpower. Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries might simply be emerging powers, as opposed to potential superpowers. The European Union has been called a &quot;regulatory superpower&quot; due to the Brussels effect.

The record of such predictions has not been perfect. For example, in the 1980s, some commentators thought Japan would become a superpower due to its large GDP and high economic growth at the time. However, Japan&#x27;s economy crashed in 1991, creating a long period of economic slump in the country which has become known as the &quot;Lost Decades&quot;.

Increasing doubts have emerged around the potential of Russia to gain superpower status given its declining economy, severe military underperformance during the invasion of Ukraine, and its loss of influence in Central Asia, a region once dominated by Moscow for centuries.

== Superpower collapse ==
=== Soviet Union ===
Dramatic changes occurred in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc during the 1980s and early 1990s, with &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot;, the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, and finally the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. As early as 1970, Andrei Amalrik had made predictions of Soviet collapse, and Emmanuel Todd made a similar prediction in 1976. Due to Russia&#x27;s capabilities of conventional warfare during the Russian invasion of Ukraine Russia was compared to a &quot;Potemkin Superpower&quot; by Paul Krugman. Russia is a nuclear-weapon state.

=== British Empire ===

The Suez Crisis of 1956 is considered by some commentators to be the beginning of the end of Britain&#x27;s period as a superpower, but other commentators have pointed much earlier such as in World War I, the Depression of 1920–21, the Partition of Ireland, the return of the pound sterling to the gold standard at its prewar parity in 1925, the Fall of Singapore, the loss of wealth from World War II, the end of Lend-Lease Aid from the United States in 1945, the postwar Age of Austerity, the Winter of 1946–47, the beginning of decolonization and the independence of British India as other key points in Britain&#x27;s decline and loss of superpower status.

The Suez Crisis in particular is regarded by historians to be a political and diplomatic disaster for the British Empire, as it led to large-scale international condemnation, including extensive pressure from the United States and Soviet Union. This forced the British and the French to withdraw in embarrassment and cemented the increasingly-bipolar Cold War politics between the Soviet Union and United States. In the 1960s, the movement for decolonization reached its peak, with remaining imperial holdings achieving independence, accelerating the transition from the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations. As the Empire continued to crumble, the home islands of the United Kingdom later experienced deindustrialization throughout the 1970s, coupled with high inflation and industrial unrest that unraveled the postwar consensus. This led to some economists to refer to Britain as the Sick Man of Europe. In 1976, the United Kingdom had to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which it had previously ironically helped create, receiving funding of $3.9 billion, the largest-ever loan to be requested up until that point. In 1979, the country suffered major widespread strikes known as the Winter of Discontent. All these factors were seen by academics, economists and politicians as symbolising Britain&#x27;s postwar decline. Lastly, the Handover of Hong Kong to China was seen by experts as the definitive end of the British Empire.

Nevertheless, the United Kingdom today has retained global soft power in the 21st century, including a formidable military. The United Kingdom continues to have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council alongside only four other powers, and is one of the nine nuclear powers. Its capital city, London, continues to be regarded as one of the pre-eminent cities in the world, being ranked as a global city by the Mori Foundation. In 2022, the United Kingdom was ranked the foremost European country in terms of soft power by Brand Finance.

=== United States ===
In &quot;After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order&quot; (2001), French sociologist Emmanuel Todd predicts the eventual decline and fall of the United States as a superpower. &quot;After years of being perceived as a problem-solver, the US itself has now become a problem for the rest of the world.&quot; Since the 2010s, as a result of asymmetric polarization within the United States, as well as globally perceived U.S. foreign policy failures, and China&#x27;s growing influence around the world, some academics and geopolitical experts have argued that the United States may already be experiencing a decay in its soft power around the world.

== Superpower disengagement ==
Superpower disengagement is a foreign policy option whereby the most powerful nations, the superpowers, reduce their interventions in an area. Such disengagement could be multilateral among superpowers or lesser powers, or bilateral between two superpowers, or unilateral. It could mean an end to either direct or indirect interventions. For instance, disengagement could mean that the superpowers remove their support of proxies in proxy wars to de-escalate a superpower conflict back to a local problem based on local disputes. Disengagement can create buffers between superpowers that might prevent conflicts or reduce the intensity of conflicts.

The term usually refers to various policy proposals during the Cold War which attempted to defuse tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, largely because of the risk of any superpower conflict to escalate to nuclear war. Examples of one-sided disengagement include when Joseph Stalin decided to end Soviet support for the communist guerrillas in Greece during the Greek Civil War, and when Richard Nixon withdrew US troops from Vietnam in the early 1970s.

The more important candidates for disengagement were where Soviet and US forces faced each other directly such as in Germany and Austria. The Austrian State Treaty is an example of formal, multilateral, superpower disengagement which left Austria as neutral for the duration of the Cold War, with Austria staying out of the Warsaw Pact, NATO, and the European Economic Community. The 1952 Stalin Note is perhaps the most controversial proposal of superpower disengagement from Germany.

== Proposed early superpowers ==
These are proposed examples of ancient or historical superpowers, taking into account that the knowledge of what the &quot;known world&quot; comprised was extremely limited in past eras (for example, Europeans became aware of the existence of the Americas and Australia only after the Age of Discovery, which began in the late 15th century, and prior to this era, they had a very limited knowledge about East Asia as well).

===Archaic globalization (before 1500)===

Many of the nations of this historical period were never superpowers, however they were regional powers with influence in their respective regions. 

Note: Does not take into account city-states and stateless nomadic peoples.

===Proto-globalization (1500–1800)===

The Age of Discovery brought a broad change in globalization, being the first period in which previously isolated parts of the world became connected to form the world system, and the first colonial empires of the early modern age emerged, such as the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and French empires. The British Empire, after its Glorious Revolution in 1688 and its pioneering role in the industrialization process in the 18th century would lead to its global hegemony in the 19th century and early 20th century (before the World War I). 

The contact between distant civilizations was highly facilitated as well as the mapping of a large part of the planet, with people in this historical period having a better understanding of the global map of the Planet Earth.

<text>Camprodon (; from &quot;Camp Rodó&quot; &quot;Round Field&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;Campus Rotundus&quot;) is a small town in the comarca of Ripollès in Girona, Catalonia, Spain, located in the Pyrenees, near the French border.

==History==
The settlement of Camprodon was in 1118, when Ramon Berenguer III allowed the building of a market near the monastery of Sant Pere de Camprodon, which is located in the present-day town. In 1252, Camprodon was granted the title of royal city and left the jurisdiction of the abbot of Sant Pere.
The city celebrates the feast day of &quot;Sant Patllari&quot; (Palladius of Embrun), and the church of Santa Maria de Camprodon claims his relics, which lie in a 14th-century reliquary (&quot;arqueta de Sant Patllari&quot;).

The epicentre of the Catalan earthquake of 1428 that killed hundreds of people was near Camprodon. The earthquake was related to the active Amer-Brugent fault system which lies to the south-east of Camprodon.

== Notable people ==
* It is the birthplace of the musician Isaac Albéniz, and has a museum dedicated to him. 
* Ski mountaineer Marc Solà Pastoret was born there.

<text>Figueres (; ) is the capital city of Alt Empordà county, in the Girona region, Catalonia, Spain.

The town is the birthplace of artist Salvador Dalí, and houses the Dalí Theatre and Museum, a large museum designed by Dalí himself which attracts many visitors. It is also the birthplace of Narcís Monturiol, inventor of the first successful machine-powered submarine. Also born here was Mónica Naranjo, one of the best selling Spanish singers of the 1990s and 2000s.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name derives from that of Ficaris, of Visigoth origin. In 1267, King James I of Aragon conceded it &quot;fuero&quot; rights, but four years later Count Ponç IV of Empúries set the town on fire.

In 1794 Figueras was surrendered to France, but it was regained in 1795. During the Peninsular War it was taken by the French in 1808, recaptured by the Spaniards in 1811, and retaken by the French in the same year.

During the Spanish Civil War, it remained loyal to the Republican government, and was repeatedly bombed by the Nazi and Fascist Italian aviation.

It was one of the most heavily bombed Catalan cities during the Civil War, in 1938, and, especially, at the beginning of 1939, when thousands of people passed through the town on their way into exile. The number of bombing victims cannot be known with certainty, but could be close to 400.

Spain&#x27;s Republican government held its final meeting of the civil war (on 1 February 1939) in the dungeons of its Sant Ferran Castle.

Figueres recovered starting from the 1950s, consolidating its economy around the tourism industry.

Figueres was once home to a Jewish community prior to the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, and a small Jewish quarter remains.

==Main sights==
* Sant Ferran Castle, built in 1753 during the reign of Ferdinand VI of Spain, on the site of a Capuchin convent. It has a pentagonal layout, with a total perimeter of .
* Parish church of St. Peter, in Gothic. It has a single nave with side chapels.
* Dalí Theatre and Museum (19th century, renovated in the 1960s). It incorporates a tower from the ancient walls.
* Technical Museum of the Empordà, a technology museum with hundreds of antique typewriters
* Museu de l&#x27;Empordà


==Transport==
Situated in the northeast corner of Catalonia, Figueres is about from Girona, from Barcelona, from Perpignan, and from Girona-Costa Brava Airport. It is also served by its own railway station just east of the old town center.

Figueres has been connected since December 2010 to the high-speed rail network with the start of services connecting Figueres to Perpignan via LGV, allowing direct TGV services to Paris in 5 h 27 min. Connections to Madrid-Barcelona via AVE began on 8 January 2013 and the trip takes 53 min to Barcelona Sants (12 min to Girona).

==Economy==
The Gondán Shipyard in Figueres is a large shipyard that carries out ship construction and repair. It has been in operation since 1969. Among other vessel types, the ship produces large wind farm service vessels and in recent years has also built electric ferries.

==Notable people==
*Narcís Monturiol (1819–1885), pioneering submarine engineer and inventor
*Salvador Dalí (1904–1989), artist

<doc id="61403" wikidata="Q354759" url="?curid=61403" title="Winfield Scott">
<text>Winfield Scott (June 13, 1786May 29, 1866) was an American military commander and political candidate. He served as Commanding General of the United States Army from 1841 to 1861, and was a veteran of the War of 1812, American Indian Wars, Mexican–American War, and the early stages of the American Civil War. Scott was the Whig Party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1852 election but was defeated by Democrat Franklin Pierce. He was known as Old Fuss and Feathers for his insistence on proper military etiquette and the Grand Old Man of the Army for his many years of service.

Scott was born near Petersburg, Virginia, in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the Canadian front, taking part in the Battle of Queenston Heights and the Battle of Fort George, and was promoted to brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the Battle of Chippawa but was badly wounded in the subsequent Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the Black Hawk War, took part in the Second Seminole War and the Creek War of 1836, and presided over the forced removal of the Cherokee. Scott also helped to avert war with the United Kingdom, defusing tensions arising from the Patriot War and the Aroostook War.

In 1841, Scott became the Commanding General of the United States Army, beating out his rival Edmund P. Gaines for the position. After the outbreak of the Mexican–American War in 1846, Scott was relegated to an administrative role, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the Mexican capital of Mexico City. After capturing the port city of Veracruz, he defeated Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s armies at the Battles of Cerro Gordo, Contreras, and Churubusco. He then captured Mexico City, after which he maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy Nicholas Trist negotiate the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which brought an end to the war.

Scott unsuccessfully sought the Whig presidential nomination three times, in 1840, 1844, and 1848. He won it in 1852, when the party was in danger of dying off. The Whigs were severely divided over the Compromise of 1850, and Democrat Franklin Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public. In 1855, he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant general, becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since George Washington. In 1859, he peacefully solved the Pig War in Washington Territory, ending the last in a long series of British-American border conflicts. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union when the Civil War broke out and served as an essential adviser to President Abraham Lincoln during the opening stages of the war. He developed a strategy known as the Anaconda Plan but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General George B. McClellan for military advice and leadership. In retirement, he lived in West Point, New York, where he died on May 29, 1866. 

Contemporaries highly regarded Scott&#x27;s military talent, and historians generally consider him one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.

==Early life==
Scott was born on June 13, 1786, the fifth child of Ann (Mason) Scott and William Scott, a planter, veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and officer in the Dinwiddie County militia. At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near Petersburg, Virginia. Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and Scott&#x27;s parents chose his maternal grandmother&#x27;s surname for his first name. Scott&#x27;s paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from Scotland after the defeat of Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Culloden. Scott&#x27;s father died when Scott was six years old; his mother did not remarry. She raised Scott, his older brother James, and their sisters Mary, Rebecca, Elizabeth, and Martha until her death in 1803. Although Scott&#x27;s family held considerable wealth, most of the family fortune went to James, who inherited the plantation. At six feet, five inches tall and 230 pounds, with a hardy constitution, in his prime Scott was a physically large and imposing figure.

Scott&#x27;s education included attendance at schools run by James Hargrave and James Ogilvie. In 1805, Scott began attending the College of William and Mary, but he soon left to study law in the office of attorney David Robinson. His contemporaries in Robinson&#x27;s office included Thomas Ruffin. While apprenticing under Robinson, Scott attended the trial of Aaron Burr, who had been accused of treason for his role in events now known as the Burr conspiracy. During the trial, Scott developed a negative opinion of the Senior Officer of the United States Army, General James Wilkinson, as the result of Wilkinson&#x27;s efforts to minimize his complicity in Burr&#x27;s actions by providing forged evidence and false, self-serving testimony.

Scott was admitted to the bar in 1806, and practiced in Dinwiddie. In 1807, Scott gained his initial military experience as a corporal of cavalry in the Virginia Militia, serving amid the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair. Scott led a detachment that captured eight British sailors who had attempted to land to purchase provisions. Virginia authorities did not approve of this action, fearing it might spark a wider conflict, and they soon ordered the release of the prisoners. Later that year, Scott attempted to establish a legal practice in South Carolina but was unable to obtain a law license because he did not meet the state&#x27;s one-year residency requirement.

==Early career, 1807–1815==
===First years in the army===
In early 1808, President Thomas Jefferson asked Congress to authorize an expansion of the United States Army after the British announced an escalation of their naval blockade of France, thereby threatening American shipping. Scott convinced U.S. Senator William Branch Giles, a family friend, to help him obtain a commission in the newly expanded army. In May 1808, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Scott was commissioned as a captain in the light artillery. Tasked with recruiting a company, he raised his troops from the Petersburg and Richmond areas, then traveled with his unit to New Orleans to join their regiment. Scott was deeply disturbed by what he viewed as the unprofessionalism of the army, which at the time consisted of just 2,700 officers and men. He later wrote that &quot;the old officers had, very generally, sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking.&quot;

He soon clashed with his commander, General James Wilkinson, over Wilkinson&#x27;s refusal to follow the orders of Secretary of War William Eustis to remove troops from an unhealthy bivouac site. Wilkinson owned the site, and while the poor location caused several illnesses and deaths among his soldiers, Wilkinson refused to relocate them because he personally profited. In addition, staying near New Orleans enabled Wilkinson to pursue his private business interests and continue the courtship of Celestine Trudeau, whom he later married.

Scott briefly resigned his commission over his dissatisfaction with Wilkinson, but before his resignation had been accepted, he withdrew it and returned to the army. In January 1810, Scott was convicted in a court-martial, partly for making disrespectful comments about Wilkinson&#x27;s integrity, and partly because of a $50 shortage in the $400 account he had been provided to conduct recruiting duty in Virginia after being commissioned. Concerning the money, the court-martial members concluded that Scott had not been intentionally dishonest but had failed to keep accurate records. His commission was suspended for one year. After the trial, Scott fought a duel with William Upshaw, an army medical officer and Wilkinson friend Scott blamed for initiating the court-martial. Each fired at the other, and Upshaw&#x27;s bullet grazed the top of Scott&#x27;s head, but both emerged unharmed.

After the duel, Scott returned to Virginia, where he spent the year studying military tactics and strategy, and practicing law in partnership with Benjamin Watkins Leigh. Meanwhile, Wilkinson was removed from command for insubordination and was succeeded by General Wade Hampton. The rousing reception Scott received from his army peers as he began his suspension led him to believe that most officers approved of his anti-Wilkinson comments, at least tacitly; their high opinion of him, coupled with Leigh&#x27;s counsel to remain in the army, convinced Scott to resume his military career once his suspension had been served. He rejoined the army in Baton Rouge, where one of his first duties was to serve as a judge advocate (prosecutor) in the court-martial of Colonel Thomas Humphrey Cushing.

===War of 1812===


During the early 19th century, relationships between Britain and the United States continued to deteriorate due to a variety of factors, including the British impressment of American citizens alleged to be Royal Navy deserters and Britain&#x27;s support to Native Americans who were resisting U.S. colonization in the Northwest Territory. In July 1812, the U.S. Congress declared war on Britain. After the declaration of war, Scott was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and assigned as second-in-command of the 2nd Artillery Regiment, serving under George Izard. While Izard continued to lead recruitment efforts, Scott led two companies north to join General Stephen Van Rensselaer&#x27;s militia force, which was preparing for an invasion of the Canadas. President James Madison made the invasion the central part of his administration&#x27;s war strategy in 1812, as he sought to capture Montreal and thereby take control of the St. Lawrence River and cut off Upper Canada from Lower Canada. The invasion would begin with an attack on the town of Queenston, which was just across the Niagara River from Lewiston, New York.

In October 1812, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s force attacked a British force in the Battle of Queenston Heights. Scott led an artillery bombardment that supported an American crossing of the Niagara River, and he took overall command of U.S. forces at Queenston after Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer was badly wounded. Shortly after Scott took command, a British column under Roger Hale Sheaffe arrived. Sheaffe&#x27;s numerically superior force compelled an American retreat, ultimately forcing Scott to surrender to the British after reinforcements from the militia failed to materialize. As a prisoner of war, Scott was treated hospitably by the British, although two Mohawk leaders nearly killed him while he was in British custody. As part of a prisoner exchange, Scott was released in late November; upon his return to the United States, he was promoted to colonel and appointed to command the 2nd Artillery Regiment. He also became the chief of staff to Henry Dearborn, who was the senior general of the army and personally led operations against Canada in the area around Lake Ontario.

Dearborn assigned Scott to lead an attack against Fort George, which commanded a strategic position on the Niagara River. With help from United States Navy elements commanded by Isaac Chauncey and Oliver Hazard Perry, he led U.S. troops to land behind the fort, forcing its surrender. Scott was widely praised for his conduct in the battle, although he was personally disappointed that the bulk of the British garrison escaped capture. As part of another campaign to capture Montreal, Scott forced the British to withdraw from Hoople Creek in November 1813. Despite this success, the campaign fell apart after the American defeat at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm and after Wilkinson (who had taken command of the front in August) and Hampton failed to cooperate on a strategy to take Montreal. With the failure of the campaign, President Madison and Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. relieved Wilkinson and some other senior officers of their battlefield commands. They were replaced with younger officers such as Scott, Izard, and Jacob Brown. In early 1814, Scott was promoted to brigadier general and was assigned to lead a regiment under Brown.

In mid-1814, Scott took part in another invasion of Canada, which began with a crossing of the Niagara River under Brown&#x27;s command. Scott was instrumental in the American success at the Battle of Chippawa, which took place on July 5, 1814. Though the battle was regarded as inconclusive from the strategic point of view because the British force remained intact after the battle, it was seen as a significant moral victory. The battle was &quot;the first real success attained by American troops against British regulars.&quot;

Later, in July 1814, a scouting expedition led by Scott was ambushed, beginning the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Scott&#x27;s brigade was decimated after British troops led by General Gordon Drummond arrived as reinforcements, and he was placed in the reserve in the second phase of the battle. Scott was later severely wounded while seeking a place to commit his reserve forces. He believed that Brown&#x27;s decision to refrain from fully committing his strength at the outset of this battle resulted in the destruction of Scott&#x27;s brigade and many unnecessary deaths. The battle ended inconclusively after Brown ordered his army to withdraw, effectively bringing an end to the invasion. Scott spent the following months convalescing under the supervision of military doctors and physician Philip Syng Physick.

Scott&#x27;s performance at the Battle of Chippawa had earned him national recognition. He was promoted to the brevet rank of major general and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal. In October 1814, Scott was appointed commander of American forces in Maryland and northern Virginia, taking command in the aftermath of the Burning of Washington. The War of 1812 came to an effective end in February 1815, after news of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent (which had been signed in December 1814) reached the United States.

In 1815, Scott was admitted to the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati as an honorary member in recognition of his service in the War of 1812. Scott&#x27;s Society of the Cincinnati insignia, made by silversmiths Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner of Philadelphia, was a one-of-a-kind, solid gold eagle measuring nearly three inches in height. It is one of the most unique military society insignias ever produced. There are no known portraits or photographs of Scott wearing the insignia, which is now in the collection of the United States Military Academy Museum.

==Family==

In March 1817, Scott married Maria DeHart Mayo (1789–1862). She was the daughter of Abigail (née DeHart) Mayo and Colonel John Mayo, a wealthy engineer and businessman who came from a distinguished family in Virginia. Scott and his family lived in Elizabethtown, New Jersey for most of the next thirty years. Beginning in the late 1830s, Maria spent much of her time in Europe because of a bronchial condition, and she died in Rome in 1862. They were the parents of seven children, five daughters and two sons:

* Maria Mayo Scott (1818–1833), who died as a teenager.
* John Mayo Scott (1819–1820), died young
* Virginia Scott (1821–1845), became Sister Mary Emanuel of the Georgetown convent of Visitation nuns
* Edward Winfield Scott (1823–1827), died young
* Cornelia Winfield Scott (1825–1885), married Colonel Henry Lee Scott (1814–1886) (no relation), Winfield Scott&#x27;s aide-de-camp and Inspector General of the Army
* Adeline Camilla Scott (1831–1882), married New York City businessman Goold Hoyt (1818–1883)
* Marcella Scott (1834–1909), married Charles Carroll MacTavish (1818–1868), grandson of Richard Caton and a member of Maryland&#x27;s prominent Carroll family

==Mid-career, 1815–1841==
===Post-war years===
With the conclusion of the War of 1812, Scott served on a board charged with demobilizing the army and determining who would continue to serve in the officer corps. Andrew Jackson and Brown were selected as the army&#x27;s two major generals, while Alexander Macomb, Edmund P. Gaines, Scott, and Eleazer Wheelock Ripley would serve as the army&#x27;s four brigadier generals. Jackson became commander of the army&#x27;s Southern Division, Brown became commander of the army&#x27;s Northern Division, and the brigadier generals were assigned leadership of departments within the divisions. Scott obtained a leave of absence to study warfare in Europe, though to his disappointment, he reached Europe only after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Upon his return to the United States in May 1816, he was assigned to command army forces in parts of the Northeastern United States. He made his headquarters in New York City and became part of the city&#x27;s social life. He earned the nickname &quot;Old Fuss and Feathers&quot; for his insistence on proper military bearing, courtesy, appearance, and discipline. In 1835, Scott wrote &quot;Infantry Tactics, Or, Rules for the Exercise and Maneuvre of the United States Infantry&quot;, a three-volume work that served as the standard drill manual for the United States Army until 1855.

Scott developed a rivalry with Jackson after Jackson took offense to a comment Scott had made at a private dinner in New York, though they later reconciled. He also continued a bitter feud with Gaines that centered over which of them had seniority, as both hoped to eventually succeed the ailing Brown. In 1821, Congress reorganized the army, leaving Brown as the sole major general and Scott and Gaines as the only brigadier generals; Macomb accepted demotion to colonel and appointment as the chief of engineers, while Ripley and Jackson both left the army. After Brown died in 1828, President John Quincy Adams passed over Scott and Gaines due to their feuding, instead appointing Macomb. Scott was outraged and asked to be relieved of his commission, but ultimately backed down.

===Black Hawk War and Nullification Crisis===

In 1832, President Andrew Jackson ordered Scott to Illinois to take command of a conflict known as the Black Hawk War. By the time Scott arrived in Illinois, the conflict had come to a close with the army&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Bad Axe. Scott and Governor John Reynolds concluded the Black Hawk Purchase with Chief Keokuk and other Native American leaders, opening up much of present-day Iowa to settlement by whites. Later, in 1832, Jackson placed Scott in charge of army preparations for a potential conflict arising from the Nullification Crisis. Scott traveled to Charleston, South Carolina, the center of the nullification movement, where he strengthened federal forts but also sought to cultivate public opinion away from secession. Ultimately, the crisis ended in early 1833 with the passage of the Tariff of 1833.

===Indian Removal===

President Jackson launched a policy of Indian removal, forcing Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi River. Some Native Americans moved peacefully, but others resisted, including many Seminoles. In December 1835, the Second Seminole War broke out after the Dade massacre, in which a group of Seminoles ambushed and massacred a U.S. Army company in Central Florida. President Jackson ordered Scott to take command of operations against the Seminoles personally, and the officer arrived in Florida by February 1836. After several months of inconclusive campaigning, Scott was ordered to the border of Alabama and Georgia to put down a Muscogee uprising known as the Creek War of 1836. American forces under Scott, General Thomas Jesup, and Alabama Governor Clement Comer Clay quickly defeated the Muscogee. Some subordinates and civilians criticized Scott&#x27;s actions in the campaigns against the Seminole and the Muscogee, and President Jackson convened a Court of Inquiry that investigated Scott and Gaines. The court cleared Scott of misconduct; still, it reprimanded him for his language criticizing Gaines in official communications. The court was critical of Gaines&#x27; actions during the campaign, though it did not accuse him of misconduct or incompetence. It also criticized the language he used to defend himself publicly and to the court.

Martin Van Buren, a personal friend of Scott&#x27;s, assumed the presidency in 1837, and Van Buren continued Jackson&#x27;s Indian removal policy. In April 1838, Van Buren placed Scott in command of the removal of Cherokee people from the Southeastern United States. Some of Scott&#x27;s associates tried to dissuade Scott from what they viewed as an immoral mission, but Scott accepted his orders. After almost all of the Cherokee refused to relocate voluntarily, Scott made careful plans to ensure that his soldiers forcibly but humanely relocated the Cherokee. Nonetheless, the Cherokee endured abuse from Scott&#x27;s soldiers; one account described soldiers driving the Cherokee &quot;like cattle, through rivers, allowing them no time to take off their shoes and stockings. In mid-1838, Scott agreed to Chief John Ross&#x27;s plan to let the Cherokee lead a movement west, and he awarded a contract to the Cherokee Council to complete the removal. Scott was strongly criticized by many Southerners, including Jackson, for awarding the contract to Ross rather than continuing the removal under his own auspices. Scott accompanied one Cherokee group as an observer, traveling with them from Athens, Tennessee, to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was ordered to the Canada–United States border.

===Tensions with the United Kingdom===
In late 1837, the so-called &quot;Patriot War&quot; broke out along the Canadian border when some Americans sought to support the Rebellions of 1837–1838 in Canada. Tensions escalated after the Caroline affair, in which Canadian forces burned a steamboat that had delivered supplies to rebel forces. President Van Buren dispatched Scott to western New York to prevent unauthorized border crossings and war between the United States and the United Kingdom. Still popular in the area due to his service in the War of 1812, Scott issued public appeals, asking Americans to refrain from supporting the Canadian rebels. In late 1838, a new crisis known as the Aroostook War broke out over a dispute regarding the border between Maine and Canada, which had not been conclusively settled in previous treaties between Britain and the United States. Scott was tasked with preventing the conflict from escalating into a war. After winning the support of Governor John Fairfield and other Maine leaders, Scott negotiated a truce with John Harvey, who commanded British forces in the area.

===Presidential election of 1840===
In the mid-1830s, Scott joined the Whig Party, which opponents of President Jackson established. Scott&#x27;s success in preventing war with Canada under Van Buren confirmed his popularity with the broad public, and in early 1839, newspapers began to mention him as a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1839 Whig National Convention. By the time of the convention in December 1839, party leader Henry Clay and 1836 presidential candidate William Henry Harrison had emerged as the two front-runners, but Scott loomed as a potential compromise candidate if the convention deadlocked. After several ballots, the convention nominated Harrison for president. Harrison went on to defeat Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election, but he died just one month into his term and was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler.

==Commanding General, 1841–1861==

===Service under Tyler===
On June 25, 1841, Macomb died, and Scott and Gaines were still the two most obvious choices for the position of Commanding General of the United States Army. Secretary of War John Bell recommended Scott, and President Tyler approved; Scott was also promoted to the rank of major general. According to biographer John Eisenhower, the office of commanding general had, since its establishment in 1821, been an &quot;innocuous and artificial office ... its occupant had been given little control over the staff, and even worse, his advice was seldom sought by his civilian superiors.&quot; Macomb had largely been outside the chain of command, and senior commanders like Gaines, Scott, and Quartermaster General Thomas Jesup reported directly to the Secretary of War. Despite Scott&#x27;s efforts to invigorate the office, he enjoyed little influence with President Tyler, who quickly became alienated from most of the Whig Party after taking office. Some Whigs, including Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, favored Scott as the Whig candidate in the 1844 presidential election. Still, Clay quickly emerged as the prohibitive front-runner for the Whig nomination. Clay won the 1844 Whig nomination, but he was defeated in the general election by Democrat James K. Polk. Polk&#x27;s campaign centered on his support for the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which had gained independence from Mexico in 1836. After Polk won the election, Congress passed legislation enabling the annexation of Texas, and Texas achieved statehood in 1845.

===Mexican–American War===
====Early war====
Polk and Scott had never liked one another, and their distrust deepened after Polk became president, partly due to Scott&#x27;s affiliation with the Whig Party. Polk came into office with two primary foreign policy goals: the acquisition of Oregon Country, which was under joint American and British rule, and the acquisition of Alta California, a Mexican province. The United States nearly went to war with Britain over Oregon, but the two powers ultimately agreed to partition Oregon Country at the 49th parallel north. The Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846 after U.S. forces under the command of Brigadier General Zachary Taylor clashed with Mexican forces north of the Rio Grande in a region claimed by both Mexico and Texas. Polk, Secretary of War William L. Marcy, and Scott agreed on a strategy in which the U.S. would capture Northern Mexico and then pursue a favorable peace settlement. While Taylor led the army in Northern Mexico, Scott presided over the expansion of the army, ensuring that new soldiers were properly supplied and organized.

====Invasion of Central Mexico====
Taylor won several victories against the Mexican army, but Polk eventually concluded that merely occupying Northern Mexico would not compel Mexico to surrender. Scott drew up an invasion plan that would begin with a naval assault on the Gulf port of Veracruz and end with the capture of Mexico City. With Congress unwilling to establish the rank of lieutenant general for Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Polk reluctantly turned to Scott to command the invasion. Among those who joined the campaign were several officers who would later distinguish themselves in the American Civil War, including Major Joseph E. Johnston, Captain Robert E. Lee, and Lieutenants Ulysses S. Grant, George B. McClellan, George G. Meade, and P. G. T. Beauregard. While Scott prepared the invasion, Taylor inflicted what the U.S. characterized as a crushing defeat on the army of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista. In the encounter known in Mexico as the Battle of La Angostura, Santa Anna brought U.S. forces to near collapse, capturing cannons and flags, and returned to Mexico City, leaving U.S. forces on the field. Santa Anna left to put down a minor insurrection, and recruited a new army.

Biographer John Eisenhower said the invasion of Mexico through Veracruz was &quot;up to that time the most ambitious amphibious expedition in human history.&quot; The operation commenced on March 9, 1847, with the Siege of Veracruz, a joint army-navy operation led by Scott and Commodore David Conner. After safely landing his 12,000-man army, Scott encircled Veracruz and began bombarding it; the Mexican garrison surrendered on March 27. Seeking to avoid a rising by the divided Mexicans against the American invasion, Scott placed a priority on winning the cooperation of the Catholic Church. Among other initiatives designed to show respect for church property and officials, he ordered his men to salute Catholic priests on the streets of Veracruz. After securing supplies and wagons, Scott&#x27;s army began the march toward Xalapa, a city on the way to Mexico City. Meanwhile, Polk dispatched Nicholas Trist, Secretary of State James Buchanan&#x27;s chief clerk, to negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders. Though they initially feuded, Scott and Trist eventually developed a strong working relationship.

In mid-April, Scott&#x27;s force met Santa Anna&#x27;s army at Cerro Gordo, near Xalapa. Santa Anna had established a solid defensive position, but he left his left flank undefended on the assumption that dense trees made the area impassable. Scott decided to attack Santa Anna&#x27;s position on two fronts, sending a force led by David E. Twiggs against Santa Anna&#x27;s left flank, while another force, led by Gideon Pillow, would attack Santa Anna&#x27;s artillery. In the Battle of Cerro Gordo, Pillow&#x27;s force was largely ineffective, but Twiggs and Colonel William S. Harney captured the key Mexican position of El Telegrafo in hand-to-hand fighting. Mexican resistance collapsed after the capture of El Telegrafo; Santa Anna escaped the battlefield and returned to Mexico City, but Scott&#x27;s force captured about 3,000 Mexican soldiers. After the battle, Scott continued to press toward Mexico City, cutting him and his army off from his supply base at Veracruz.

====Mexico City====

Scott&#x27;s force arrived in the Valley of Mexico in August 1847, by which time Santa Anna had formed an army of approximately 25,000 men. Because Mexico City lacked walls and was essentially indefensible, Santa Anna sought to defeat Scott in a pitched battle, choosing to mount a defense near the Churubusco River several miles south. The Battle of Contreras began on the afternoon of August 19, when the Mexican army under General Gabriel Valencia attacked and pushed back an American detachment charged with building a road. In the early morning of the following day, an American force led by General Persifor Frazer Smith surprised and decimated Valencia&#x27;s army. News of the defeat at Contreras caused a panic among the rest of Santa Anna&#x27;s army, and Scott immediately pressed the attack, beginning the Battle of Churubusco. Despite the strong defense by the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion and some other units, Scott&#x27;s force quickly defeated the demoralized Mexican army. After the battle, Santa Anna negotiated a truce with Scott, and the Mexican foreign minister notified Trist that they were ready to begin negotiations to end the war.

Despite the presence of Scott&#x27;s army just outside of Mexico City, the Mexican and American delegations remained far apart on terms; Mexico was only willing to yield portions of Alta California and refused to accept the Rio Grande as its northern border. While negotiations continued, Scott faced a difficult issue in the disposition of 72 members of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion who had deserted from the U.S. Army and were captured while fighting for Mexico. All 72 were court-martialed and sentenced to death. Under pressure from some Mexican leaders and personally feeling that the death penalty was an unjust punishment for some defendants, Scott spared 20, but the rest were executed. In early September, negotiations between Trist and the Mexican government broke down, and Scott exercised his right to end the truce. In the subsequent Battle for Mexico City, Scott launched an attack from the west of the city, capturing the critical fortress of Chapultepec on September 13. Santa Anna retreated from the city after the fall of Chapultepec, and Scott accepted the surrender of the remaining Mexican forces early on the 14th.

Unrest broke out in the days following the capture of Mexico City, but with the cooperation of civil leaders and the Catholic Church, Scott and the army restored order in the city by the end of the month. Peace negotiations between Trist and the Mexican government resumed, and Scott did all he could to support the talks, ceasing all further offensive operations. As military commander of Mexico City, Scott was held in high esteem by Mexican civil and American authorities alike, primarily owing to the fairness with which he treated Mexican citizens. In November 1847, Trist received orders to return to Washington. Scott received orders to continue the military campaign against Mexico; Polk had grown frustrated at the slow pace of negotiations. With the support of Scott and Mexican president Manuel de la Peña y Peña, Trist defied his orders and continued the negotiations. Trist and the Mexican negotiators concluded the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848; it was ratified by the U.S. Senate the following month. In late 1847, Scott arrested Pillow and two other officers after they wrote letters to American newspapers that were critical of Scott. In response, Polk ordered the release of the three officers and removed Scott from command.

Upon founding the Aztec Club of 1847, a military society of officers who served in Mexico during the war, Scott was elected as one of only two honorary members of the organization.

===Taylor and Fillmore administrations===

Scott was again a contender for the Whig presidential nomination in the 1848 election. Clay, Daniel Webster, and General Zachary Taylor were also candidates for the nomination. As in 1840, Whigs were looking for a non-ideological war hero to be their candidate. Scott&#x27;s main appeal was to anti-slavery &quot;conscience Whigs&quot;, who were dismayed by the fact that two of the leading contenders, Clay and Taylor, were enslavers. Ultimately, however, the delegates passed on Scott for a second time, nominating Taylor on the fourth ballot. Many anti-slavery Whigs then defected to support the nominee of the Free-Soil Party, former President Martin Van Buren. Taylor went on to win the general election.

After the war, Scott returned to his administrative duties as the army&#x27;s senior general. Congress became engaged in a divisive debate over the status of slavery in the territories, and Scott joined with Whig leaders Henry Clay and Daniel Webster in advocating for the passage of what became known as the Compromise of 1850. Meanwhile, Taylor died of an illness in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore. The Compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 badly divided the country as a whole and the Whig Party in particular. Northerners strongly objected to the stringent provisions of the act, while Southerners complained bitterly about any perceived slackness in enforcement. Despite Scott&#x27;s support for the Compromise of 1850, he became the chosen candidate of William Seward, a leading Northern Whig who objected to the Compromise of 1850 partly because of the fugitive slave act.

===Presidential election of 1852===

By early 1852, the three leading candidates for the Whig presidential nomination were Scott, who anti-Compromise Northern Whigs backed; President Fillmore, the first choice of most Southern Whigs; and Secretary of State Webster, whose support was concentrated in New England. The 1852 Whig National Convention convened on June 16, and Southern delegates won approval of a party platform endorsing the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement of the slavery question. On the convention&#x27;s first presidential ballot, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. After the 46th ballot still failed to produce a presidential nominee, the delegates voted to adjourn until the following Monday. Over the weekend, Fillmore and Webster supporters conducted unsuccessful negotiations to unite behind one candidate. On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot. Fillmore accepted his defeat with equanimity and endorsed Scott, but many Northern Whigs were dismayed when Scott publicly endorsed the party&#x27;s pro-Compromise platform. Despite the party&#x27;s effort to appeal to southerners by nominating William Alexander Graham of North Carolina for vice president, many Southern Whigs, including Alexander H. Stephens and Robert Toombs, refused to support Scott.

The 1852 Democratic National Convention nominated dark horse candidate Franklin Pierce, a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery who had served under Scott as a brigadier general during the Mexican War. Pierce had resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1842, and had briefly held only the minor office of United States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire since then, but emerged as a compromise candidate partly because he served under Scott in the Mexican–American War. The Democrats attacked Scott for various incidents from his long public career, including his court-martial in 1809 and the hanging of members of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion during the Mexican–American War. Scott proved to be a poor candidate who lacked popular appeal and suffered the worst defeat in Whig history. In the South, distrust and apathy toward Scott led many Southern Whigs to vote for Pierce or to sit out the election, and in the North, many anti-slavery Whigs voted for John P. Hale of the Free Soil Party. Scott won just four states and 44 percent of the popular vote, while Pierce won just under 51 percent of the popular vote and a large majority of the electoral vote.

===Pierce and Buchanan administrations===
After the 1852 election, Scott continued his duties as the army&#x27;s senior officer. He maintained cordial relations with President Pierce but frequently clashed with Pierce&#x27;s Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, over issues like travel expenses. Despite his defeat in the 1852 presidential election, Scott remained broadly popular, and on Pierce&#x27;s recommendation, in 1855, Congress passed a resolution promoting Scott to brevet lieutenant general. Scott was the first U.S. Army officer since George Washington to hold the rank. He also earned the appellation of the &quot;Grand Old Man of the Army&quot; for his long career.

The passage of the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act and the outbreak of violent confrontations between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces in Kansas exacerbated sectional tensions and split both major parties. Pierce was denied re-nomination in favor of James Buchanan, while the Whig Party collapsed. In the 1856 presidential election, Buchanan defeated John C. Frémont of the anti-slavery Republican Party and former President Fillmore, the candidate of the nativist American Party. Sectional tensions continued to escalate after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Buchanan proved incapable of healing sectional divides, and some leading Southerners became increasingly vocal in their desire to secede from the union. In 1859, Buchanan assigned Scott to lead a mission to settle a dispute with Britain over the ownership of the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest. Scott reached an agreement with British official James Douglas to reduce military forces on the islands, thereby resolving the so-called &quot;Pig War&quot;.

In the 1860 presidential election, the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln, while the Democrats split along sectional lines, with Northern Democrats supporting Senator Stephen A. Douglas and Southern Democrats supporting Vice President John C. Breckinridge. Lincoln won the election, taking just 44 percent of the popular vote but winning a majority of the electoral vote due to his support in the North despite his name not being on the ballot in many Southern States. Fearing the possibility of imminent secession, Scott advised Buchanan and Secretary of War John B. Floyd to reinforce federal forts in the South. He was initially ignored, but Scott gained new influence within the administration after Floyd was replaced by Joseph Holt in mid-December. With assistance from Holt and newly appointed Secretary of State Jeremiah S. Black, Scott convinced Buchanan to reinforce or resupply Washington, D.C., Fort Sumter (near Charleston, South Carolina), and Fort Pickens (near Pensacola, Florida). Meanwhile, several Southern states seceded, formed the Confederate States of America, and chose Jefferson Davis as president.

Because Scott was from Virginia, Lincoln sent an envoy, Thomas S. Mather, to ask whether Scott would remain loyal to the United States and keep order during Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration. Scott responded to Mather, &quot;I shall consider myself responsible for [Lincoln&#x27;s] safety. If necessary, I shall plant cannon at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and if any of the Maryland or Virginia gentlemen who have become so threatening and troublesome show their heads or even venture to raise a finger, I shall blow them to hell.&quot; Scott helped ensure that Lincoln arrived in Washington safely and ensured the security of Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration, which ultimately was conducted without a major incident.

===Lincoln administration===

By the time Lincoln assumed office, seven states had declared their secession and had seized federal property within their bounds. Still, the United States retained control of the military installations at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens. Scott advised evacuating the forts because an attempted re-supply would inflame tensions with the South, and Confederate shore batteries made re-supply impossible. Lincoln rejected the advice and chose to re-supply the forts; although Scott accepted the orders, his resistance to the re-supply mission, along with poor health, undermined his status within the administration. Nonetheless, he remained a critical military adviser and administrator. On April 12, Confederate forces began an attack on Fort Sumter, forcing its surrender the following day. On April 15, Lincoln declared that a state of rebellion existed and called up tens of thousands of militiamen. On the advice of Scott, Lincoln offered Robert E. Lee command of the Union forces, but Lee ultimately chose to serve the Confederacy.

Scott took charge of molding Union military personnel into a cohesive fighting force. Lincoln rejected Scott&#x27;s proposal to build up the regular army, and the administration would largely rely on volunteers to fight the war. Scott developed a strategy, later known as the Anaconda Plan, that called for the capture of the Mississippi River and a blockade of Southern ports. By cutting off the eastern states of the Confederacy, Scott hoped to force the surrender of Confederate forces with a minimal loss of life on both sides. Scott&#x27;s plan was leaked to the public and was derided by most Northern newspapers, which tended to favor an immediate assault on the Confederacy. As Scott was too old for battlefield command, Lincoln selected General Irvin McDowell, an officer whom Scott saw as unimaginative and inexperienced, to lead the main Union army in the eastern theater of the war. Though Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, Lincoln ordered an offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond. Irvin McDowell led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met the Confederate Army at the First Battle of Bull Run. The Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.

McDowell took the brunt of public vituperation for the defeat at Bull Run, but Scott, who had helped plan the battle, also received criticism. Lincoln replaced McDowell with McClellan, and the president began meeting with McClellan without Scott in attendance. Frustrated with his diminished standing, Scott submitted his resignation in October 1861. Though Scott favored General Henry Halleck as his successor, Lincoln made McClellan the army&#x27;s senior officer instead.

==Retirement, consultations, writings, and death==

Scott grew very heavy in his last years of service and could not mount a horse or walk more than a few paces without stopping to rest. He was often in ill health, and suffered from gout, dropsy, rheumatism, and vertigo. After retiring, he traveled to Europe with his daughter, Cornelia, and her husband, H. L. Scott. In Paris, he worked with Thurlow Weed to aid American consul John Bigelow in defusing the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair, a diplomatic incident with Britain. On his return from Europe in December 1861, he lived alone in New York City and at West Point, New York, where he wrote his memoirs and closely followed the ongoing civil war.

On June 23–24, 1862, President Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point, where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department. After McClellan&#x27;s defeat in the Seven Days Battles, Lincoln accepted Scott&#x27;s advice and appointed General Halleck as the army&#x27;s senior general. In 1864, Scott sent a copy of his newly published memoirs to Ulysses S. Grant, who had succeeded Halleck as the lead Union general. The copy that Scott sent was inscribed &quot;from the oldest to the greatest general.&quot; Following a strategy similar to Scott&#x27;s Anaconda Plan, Grant led the Union to victory, and Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia surrendered in April 1865.

On October 4, 1865, Scott was elected as a Companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was assigned insignia number 27. He is one of the few individuals who belonged to the three most senior military societies of the United States – the Society of the Cincinnati, the Aztec Club of 1847 and the Loyal Legion.

Scott died at West Point on May 29, 1866, at age 79. President Andrew Johnson ordered the flags flown at half-staff to honor Scott. Scott&#x27;s funeral was attended by many of the leading Union generals, including Grant, George G. Meade, George H. Thomas, and John Schofield. He is buried at the West Point Cemetery.

===Historical reputation===

Scott holds the record for the greatest length of active service as a general in the U.S. Army, as well as the longest tenure as the army&#x27;s chief officer. Steven Malanga of &quot;City Journal&quot; writes that &quot;Scott was one of America&#x27;s greatest generals ... but he had the misfortune to serve in two conflicts—the War of 1812 and the controversial Mexican-American War—bracketed by the far more significant American Revolution and Civil War.&quot; Biographer John Eisenhower writes that Scott &quot;was an astonishing man&quot; who was the country&#x27;s &quot;most prominent general&quot; between the retirement of Andrew Jackson in 1821 and the onset of the Civil War in 1861. The Duke of Wellington proclaimed Scott &quot;the greatest living general&quot; after his capture of Mexico City. Robert E. Lee wrote, &quot;the great cause of our success [in Mexico] was in our leader [Scott]&quot;. Historians Scott Kaufman and John A. Soares Jr. write that Scott was &quot;an able diplomat who proved crucial in helping avert war between Britain and the United States in period after the War of 1812.&quot; Fanny Crosby, the hymn writer, recalled that Scott&#x27;s &quot;gentle manner did not indicate a hero of so many battles; yet there was strength beneath the exterior appearance and a heart of iron within his breast. But from him I learned that the warrior only it is, who can fully appreciate the blessing of peace.&quot;

In addition to his reputation as a tactician and strategist, Scott was also noteworthy for his concern about the welfare of his subordinates, as demonstrated by his willingness to risk his career in the dispute with Wilkinson over the Louisiana bivouac site. In another example, when cholera broke out among his soldiers while they were aboard the ship during the Black Hawk campaign and the ship&#x27;s surgeon was incapacitated by the disease, Scott had the doctor tutor him in treatment and risked his health by tending to the sick troops himself.

Scott was the recipient of several honorary degrees. These included a Master of Arts from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1814, a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Columbia University in 1850, and an LL.D. from Harvard University in 1861.

===Memorials===
Scott has been memorialized in numerous ways. Various counties are named for him, including Scott County, Iowa; Scott County, Kansas; Scott County, Virginia; Scott County, Minnesota; and Scott County, Tennessee. Communities named for Scott include Winfield, Illinois; Winfield, Indiana; Winfield, Iowa; Winfield, Alabama; and Winfield, Tennessee; Fort Scott, Kansas; and Scott Depot and Winfield, West Virginia. Fort Winfield Scott at the Presidio of San Francisco was part of the coastal defenses of San Francisco Bay from 1861 to 1970, and is now a part of the Fort Point National Historic Site. Other things named for Scott include Lake Winfield Scott in Georgia, Mount Scott in Oklahoma, and the Scott&#x27;s oriole, a bird.

A statue of Scott stands at Scott Circle in Washington, D.C. Scott was honored by having his likeness depicted on a U.S. postage stamp. A paddle steamer named &quot;Winfield Scott&quot; launched in 1850, and a U.S. Army tugboat in service in the 21st century is named &quot;Winfield Scott&quot;. Scott is the namesake of various people, including officers Union General Winfield Scott Hancock, Confederate General Winfield Scott Featherston, and Admiral Winfield Scott Schley. The U.S. Army Civil Affairs Association views General Scott as the &quot;Father of Civil Affairs&quot; and the regimental award medallions bear his name.

The General Winfield Scott House, his home in New York City from 1853 to 1855, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Scott&#x27;s papers are held by the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan.

==Dates of rank==
During his career, which ended with his retirement on November 1, 1861, Scott was promoted from captain to brevet lieutenant general. The effective dates of his promotions were:

==In popular culture==
Scott&#x27;s fame and political career led to publishing various works, including almanacs with titles such as &quot;Scott &amp; Taylor Almanac&quot; or &quot;General Taylor Almanac&quot; plus multiple musical compositions. In 1848, Boston publisher Hall produced the &quot;Scott &amp; Taylor Almanac&quot; to capitalize on the name recognition of the Mexican–American War&#x27;s two most famous generals while other almanacs including an 1853 almanac with the title of &quot;The Gen. Scott Almanac&quot; were published as campaign literature in 1852. In 1852, Huestis and Couzans of New York City published &quot;Scott and Graham Melodies&quot;, a book of songs used during the 1852 presidential campaign. Another book of songs used by Whig campaigners in 1852, &quot;The Scott Songster&quot;, was published by Edwards &amp; Goshorn of Cincinnati. In 1861, Stephen Glover created an instrumental music piece in Scott&#x27;s honor titled &quot;General Scott&#x27;s Grand Review March&quot;.

Actor Roy Gordon portrayed Scott in the 1953 film &quot;Kansas Pacific&quot;. Sydney Greenstreet played Scott in the 1941 film &quot;They Died with their Boots On.&quot; Scott was played by Patrick Bergin in the 1999 film &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot;, a drama about the Mexican–American War&#x27;s Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion.

Scott is mentioned in &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot;, a Season 6 episode of the &quot;Outlander&quot; TV series. During a scene set during the American Revolution, Jamie asks what will be the fate of the Cherokee people. Brianna, who has traveled back in time from the 1960s, tells Jamie about the Trail of Tears and Scott&#x27;s role in it.

<text>Sylvester Gardenzio &quot;Sly&quot; Stallone (; born July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. In a film career spanning more than fifty years, Stallone has received numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Critics&#x27; Choice Award, as well as nominations for three Academy Awards and two BAFTA Awards. Stallone is one of only two actors in history (alongside Harrison Ford) to have starred in a box-office No. 1 film across six consecutive decades.

Struggling as an actor for a number of years upon moving to New York City in 1969, Stallone found gradual work in films such as &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; (1974). He achieved his greatest critical and commercial success starting in 1976 with his iconic role as boxer Rocky Balboa in the first film of the successful &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise, which he also wrote. In 1977, he became the third actor in history to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo in &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), a role he would play across five &quot;Rambo&quot; films (1982–2019). He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1984. From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, Stallone would go on to become one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actors acting in action films such as &quot;Cobra&quot; (1986), &quot;Tango and Cash&quot; (1989), &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993), &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Specialist&quot; (1994). At the height of his career, Stallone was known for his rivalry with Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

Stallone continued his established roles in &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006) and &quot;Rambo&quot; (2008) before launching &quot;The Expendables&quot; film franchise (2010–present), in which he starred as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful film &quot;Escape Plan&quot; and appeared in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to &quot;Rocky&quot; again with &quot;Creed&quot;, in which a retired Rocky mentors former rival Apollo Creed&#x27;s son Donnie Creed. The film brought Stallone widespread praise and his first Golden Globe Award, as well as a third Academy Award nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior. He also starred in the sequel &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018) and portrayed Stakar Ogord in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017) and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023).

Regarded as an icon of action cinema, Stallone is credited with helping redefine the Hollywood action hero. He has occasionally ventured from the action genre, with mixed results. He starred in the comedies &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991) and &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot; (1992), both of which had modest success. He also starred in the 1997 drama &quot;Cop Land&quot;, for which he temporarily shed his sculpted physique and gained weight for his role as a powerless sheriff. In television, he has starred in the Paramount+ crime series &quot;Tulsa King&quot; (2022–present). In addition to his film work, Stallone is a noted art collector and painter, and has written books on fitness.

== Early life and education ==
Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough on July 6, 1946, the elder son of women&#x27;s professional wrestling promoter Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Stallone (née Labofish; 1921–2020) and hairdresser Francesco &quot;Frank&quot; Stallone Sr. (1919–2011). His mother was an American from Washington, D.C., with Breton French and Ukrainian Jewish ancestry, while his father was an Italian immigrant from Gioia del Colle who moved to the U.S. in the 1930s. His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone. Many biographies of Stallone indicate that his birth name is &quot;Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone&quot; and his mother explained in an interview that she originally named him &quot;Tyrone&quot; because she admired the actor Tyrone Power, but Stallone&#x27;s father changed it to &quot;Sylvester&quot;. His nickname as a child was &quot;Binky&quot; but he chose to go by the nickname of Mike/Michael after schoolmates began calling him &quot;Stinky&quot;. His middle name &quot;Gardenzio&quot; is an alteration of the Italian given name &quot;Gaudenzio&quot; and he usually shortened it to &quot;Enzio&quot;.

Complications during Stallone&#x27;s birth forced his mother&#x27;s obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps while delivering him, accidentally severing a nerve in the process. This caused paralysis of the lower left side of his face (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin) which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech. As a result, he was bullied in his childhood, with which he coped by getting into bodybuilding and acting. A guidance counselor once told Stallone&#x27;s mother: &quot;Your son is suited to run a sorting machine or to be an assistant electrician, primarily in the area of elevator operations&quot;; nevertheless, Sylvester aspired to be an actor and a screenwriter.”

Stallone spent part of his infancy in foster and boarding care, rejoining and moving back with his family to Maryland when he was five. In the early 1950s, his father moved the family to his mother&#x27;s native Washington, D.C. to open a beauty school. In 1954, his mother opened a women&#x27;s gym called Barbella&#x27;s. He initially stayed with his father following his parents&#x27; divorce when he was 11, but joined his remarried mother in Philadelphia when he was 15.

At one point, Stallone was voted &quot;Most Likely To End Up In The Electric Chair&quot; in high school; nevertheless, Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Abraham Lincoln High School in Philadelphia, and Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Charlotte Hall, Maryland, prior to attending Miami Dade College. He spent two years, from September 1965 to June 1967, at the American College of Switzerland. He returned to the United States to study as a drama major at the University of Miami, from 1967 to 1969, but did not graduate. Decades later, after Stallone&#x27;s request that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining needed college credits to graduate, he was granted a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree by the University of Miami in 1998.

== Film and stage career ==
=== 1968–1976: early roles to breakthrough ===

Until 1969, he appeared on the stage under the name Mike Stallone; in 1970, he started using the stage name Sylvester E. Stallone. While attending the University of Miami, Stallone had a role in the drama &quot;That Nice Boy&quot; (aka &quot;The Square Root&quot;), filmed in 1968. Moreover, he and John Herzfeld worked together in 1969 on a low-budget self-produced film called &quot;Horses&quot;.

Stallone had his first starring role in the softcore pornography feature film &quot;The Party at Kitty and Stud&#x27;s&quot; (1970). He was paid for two days&#x27; work. Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has also said that he slept three weeks in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City prior to seeing a casting notice for the film. In the actor&#x27;s words, &quot;it was either do that movie or rob someone, because I was at the end – the very end – of my rope&quot;. The film was released several years later as &quot;Italian Stallion&quot;, in order to cash in on Stallone&#x27;s newfound fame (the new title was taken from Stallone&#x27;s nickname since &quot;Rocky&quot;). Stallone also starred in the erotic off-Broadway stage play &quot;Score&quot; which ran for 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 to November 15, 1971, and was later made into the 1974 film &quot;Score&quot; by Radley Metzger.

After moving to New York City, Stallone shared an apartment with his girlfriend, Sasha Czack, an aspiring actress who supported them by working as a waitress. Stallone took odd jobs around this time, including being a cleaner at a zoo, and a theater usher; he was fired from the latter for scalping tickets. He furthered his writing skills by frequenting a local library, and became interested in the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

In 1972, Stallone was on the verge of giving up on having an acting career; in what he later described as a low point, he tried and failed to get a job as an extra in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Instead, he was relegated to a background role in another Hollywood hit, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, starring Barbra Streisand. Stallone is hardly visible in his two appearances.

Stallone happened to be acting in a play that a friend invited him to partake in, and an agent in attendance thought that Stallone fit the role of Stanley, a main character in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot;, which had a start-stop schedule from 1972 to 1974 over budget issues. Stallone, around mid-1973, achieved his first proper starring role, in the independent film &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, playing a man who is associated with a New York–based urban terrorist movement, with a jewelry-seller as his love interest. The film was re-cut and retitled &quot;Rebel&quot; years later, this second version featuring Stallone as its star. In 1990, this film was re-edited with outtakes from the original film and newly shot matching footage, then redubbed – in the style of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; – into a parody of itself titled &quot;A Man Called... Rainbo&quot;.

Stallone&#x27;s other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), as a soldier sitting at a table; &quot;Pigeons&quot; (1970), as a party guest; Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971), as a subway thug; in the psychological thriller &quot;Klute&quot; (1971), as an extra dancing in a club; and in the Jack Lemmon film &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; (1975), as a youth. In the latter film, Jack Lemmon&#x27;s character chases, tackles, and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone&#x27;s character is a pickpocket. He had his second starring role in 1974, in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot;. In 1975, he played supporting roles in &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;; &quot;Capone&quot;; and &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;. He made guest appearances on the TV series &quot;Police Story&quot; and &quot;Kojak&quot;. He is also supposedly in &quot;Mandingo&quot;. It is often said that his scene was deleted.

Stallone gained worldwide fame with his starring role in the smash hit &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), a sports drama about a struggling boxer, Rocky Balboa, taking on heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. On March 24, 1975, Stallone saw the Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner fight. That night Stallone went home, and after three days he had completed the first draft of &quot;Rocky&quot;. Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script; however, Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount. Other possible inspirations for the film may have included Rocky Graziano&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, and the film of the same name. Stallone attempted to sell the script to multiple studios, with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone for the rights, but they had their own casting ideas for the lead role, including Robert Redford and Burt Reynolds. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character – and, eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star. Upon its release, critic Roger Ebert stated that Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando.

In 1977, at the 49th Academy Awards, &quot;Rocky&quot; was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, and Best Film Editing. &quot;Rocky&quot; has since been inducted into the National Film Registry and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone&#x27;s use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the &quot;Rocky&quot; series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps, and the city has a statue of the Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. The character was also voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

=== 1978–1999: subsequent success ===

Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;, a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who get involved in professional wrestling. That same year, he starred in Norman Jewison&#x27;s &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modeled on James Hoffa, who becomes involved in labor union leadership. In 1979, he wrote, starred, and directed (replacing John G. Avildsen) in &quot;Rocky II&quot;. The sequel became a major success, grossing  million.

In 1981, he starred alongside Michael Caine and soccer star Pelé in &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;, a sports drama in which he plays a prisoner of war involved in a Nazi propaganda soccer game. That same year, he starred in the thriller &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a foreign terrorist, played by Rutger Hauer.

In 1982, Stallone starred as Vietnam veteran John Rambo, a former Green Beret, in the action film &quot;First Blood&quot;, an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, though the script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film&#x27;s production, which was both a critical and box-office success. Critics praised Stallone&#x27;s performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. It launched the Rambo franchise. That year &quot;Rocky III&quot; was released in which Stallone wrote, directed, and starred. The second sequel became a box-office success. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings. Stallone claims to have reduced his body fat percentage to his all-time low of 2.8% for &quot;Rocky III&quot;.

In 1983, he directed &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, starring John Travolta. This was the only film Stallone directed that he did not star in. &quot;Staying Alive&quot; was universally panned by film critics. Despite being a critical failure, &quot;Staying Alive&quot; was a commercial success. The film opened with the biggest weekend for a musical film ever (at the time) with a gross of $12,146,143 from 1,660 screens. Overall, the film grossed nearly $65 million in the US box office against its $22 million budget. Worldwide it grossed $127 million. Though the US box-office intake was significantly less than the $139.5 million earned by &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, the film nevertheless ranked in the top ten most financially successful films of 1983.

During the 1980s, Stallone was considered one of the biggest action film stars in the world, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry continued for years; they attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons.

Stallone occasionally attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, roles in different genres. In 1984, he co-wrote and starred alongside Dolly Parton in the comedy film &quot;Rhinestone&quot;, where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the &quot;Rhinestone&quot; soundtrack, he performed a song. Stallone turned down the lead male role in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; in order to make &quot;Rhinestone&quot; instead, a decision he later regretted.

In 1985, Stallone continued his success with the &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Rambo&quot; franchises with &quot;Rocky IV&quot; and &quot;.&quot; Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of 13 films. Stallone met former Mr. Olympia Franco Columbu to develop his character&#x27;s appearance for the film &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, just as if he were preparing for the Mr. Olympia competition. That meant two workouts a day, six days a week. Both films were major financial successes.

It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 James Cagney classic &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star Christopher Reeve and be directed by Menahem Golan. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by &quot;Variety&quot; and horror by top critic Roger Ebert. Cannon opted to make the action film &quot;Cobra&quot; which was released in 1986 and became a box-office success. It led to the setting up of his production company White Eagle Enterprises.

In 1987, he starred in the family drama &quot;Over the Top&quot; as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son and enters an arm wrestling competition. This was poorly received by critics and was a box-office failure. In 1989, he co-starred alongside Kurt Russell in the buddy cop action film &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, which did solid business domestically and overseas, grossing  million in foreign markets and over  million worldwide. Stallone became a boxing promoter in the 1980s. His boxing promoting company, Tiger Eye Productions, signed world champion boxers Sean O&#x27;Grady and Aaron Pryor.

Stallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise, &quot;Rocky V&quot;. This film brought back the first film&#x27;s director, John G. Avildsen, and was intended to be the final installment in the series. It was considered a box-office disappointment and received negative reviews.

Stallone next appeared in John Landis&#x27; period comedy &quot;Oscar&quot; which was both a critical and box-office failure. In 1992, he appeared in Roger Spottiswoode&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot; which was also both a critical and box-office disaster. Stallone signed onto the film based on rumors that Schwarzenegger was interested in the lead. Schwarzenegger said that, knowing the script&#x27;s quality was poor, he publicly faked interest in starring for producers to lure Stallone.

In 1993, he made a comeback with Renny Harlin&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, which was a success in the US, grossing  million, and worldwide, grossing  million. Later that year, he starred in the futuristic action film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; directed by Marco Brambilla, co-starring Wesley Snipes and Sandra Bullock. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 5.43/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A better-than-average sci-fi shoot-em-up with a satirical undercurrent, &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is bolstered by strong performances by Stallone, Snipes, and Bullock.&quot; The film debuted at No. 1 at the box office. &quot;Demolition Man&quot; grossed $58,055,768 by the end of its box-office run in North America and $159,055,768 worldwide.

His string of hits continued with 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Specialist&quot; co-starring Sharon Stone and directed by Luis Llosa, which opened in the U.S. on October 7. While the critical reception was overwhelmingly negative, the film was a commercial success. In its opening weekend it made $14,317,765 and ended up making back its budget with $57,362,582 at the domestic box office while making another $113,000,000 overseas, giving it a worldwide gross of $170,362,582. 

In 1995, he played the title character (from the British comic book &quot;2000 AD&quot;) in the science fiction action film &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. His overseas box-office appeal saved the domestic box-office disappointment of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, which cost almost  million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of  million. Despite the film&#x27;s poor box-office performance, Stallone signed a three-picture deal with Universal Pictures for $60 million, making him the second star after Jim Carrey to receive $20 million per film. The deal expired in February 2000 without him making any films, however, so he received no payment.

That year, he also appeared in the thriller &quot;Assassins&quot; with Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. That same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the Trey Parker and Matt Stone short comedy film &quot;Your Studio and You&quot; commissioned by the Seagram Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of Universal Studios and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a wine cooler and calling him &quot;brainiac.&quot; In response, Stallone says, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot; He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, &quot;Stupid cheap studio!&quot;

In 1996, he starred in the disaster film &quot;Daylight&quot; as a disgraced former emergency services chief who attempts to rescue survivors of an underground tunnel explosion. &quot;Daylight&quot; also underperformed at the domestic box office, grossing $33 million, but did better overseas and grossed a total of $158 million worldwide. In 1997, Stallone was cast against type as an overweight sheriff in the crime drama &quot;Cop Land&quot; in which he starred alongside Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. The film was critically well-received and was a modest success at the box office, earning $63 million on a $15 million budget, and Stallone&#x27;s performance earned him the Stockholm International Film Festival Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the animated film &quot;Antz&quot;, which was a success domestically.

=== 2000–2005: declining years ===
In 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller &quot;Get Carter&quot;, a remake of the 1971 British film of the same name, but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone&#x27;s career declined considerably after his subsequent films &quot;Driven&quot; (2001), &quot;Avenging Angelo&quot; (2002) and &quot;D-Tox&quot; (2002) were also critical and commercial failures.

In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; series: &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot;, which was a huge box-office success (almost  million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film &quot;Taxi 3&quot; as a passenger. Also that year, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the neo-noir crime drama &quot;Shade&quot; which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics. He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled &quot;Rampart Scandal&quot;, which was to be about the murder of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. and the surrounding Los Angeles Police Department corruption scandal. It was later titled &quot;Notorious&quot; but was shelved.

In 2005, alongside Sugar Ray Leonard, he was the co-presenter of the NBC reality television boxing competition series &quot;The Contender&quot;. That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. That year, Stallone also inducted professional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who appeared in &quot;Rocky III&quot; as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the cameo in &quot;Rocky III&quot;. In August, Stallone released his book &quot;Sly Moves&quot; which claimed to be a guide to fitness and nutrition as well as a candid insight into his life and works from his own perspective. The book also contained many photographs of Stallone throughout the years as well as pictures of him performing exercises.

=== 2006–present: Franchise films ===
After a three-year hiatus from films, Stallone had a comeback in 2006 with the sixth installment of the &quot;Rocky&quot; series, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, which was a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box-office failure of the previous installment &quot;Rocky V&quot;, Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series. The total domestic box office came to .3 million (and  million worldwide). The budget of the film was only  million. His performance in &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; has been praised and garnered mostly positive reviews. That year, the development &quot;Death Wish&quot; remake began, when Stallone announced that he would be directing and starring in a remake of the 1974 film. Stallone said, &quot;Instead of the Charles Bronson character being an architect, my version would have him as a very good cop who had incredible success without ever using his gun. So when the attack on his family happens, he&#x27;s really thrown into a moral dilemma in proceeding to carry out his revenge.&quot; He later told the publication that he was no longer involved. In a 2009 interview with MTV, though, Stallone stated that he was again considering the project. However the role went to Bruce Willis with Eli Roth as director.

Stallone partnered with a beverage company producing an upscale bottled water brand called Sly Water.

In 2008, Stallone reprised his other famous role as Rambo with the fourth installment of his other successful film franchise which was titled simply &quot;Rambo&quot; (&quot;John Rambo&quot; in some countries where the first film was titled &quot;Rambo&quot;). The film opened in 2,751 theaters on January 25, 2008, grossing on its opening day and over its opening weekend. Its box office was worldwide with a budget of  million.

In July 2009, Stallone made a cameo appearance in the Bollywood film &quot;Kambakkht Ishq&quot;, where he played himself. 

It was announced on December 7, 2010, that Stallone was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the non-participant category.

Also that year, Stallone wrote, directed and starred in the ensemble action film &quot;The Expendables&quot;. The film, which was filmed during summer/winter 2009, was released on August 13, 2010. Joining him in the film were fellow action stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren, as well as Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Eric Roberts, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, and cameos by fellow &#x27;80s action icons Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The film took in its opening weekend, going straight in at No. 1 in the US box office. The figure marked the biggest opening weekend in Stallone&#x27;s career. In summer 2010, Brazilian company O2 Filmes released a statement saying it was still owed more than  million for its work on the film. In 2011, Stallone provided the voice of a lion in Kevin James&#x27; comedy &quot;Zookeeper&quot;.

&quot;The Expendables 2&quot; was released August 17, 2012; the sequel received a positive critical reception of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, as opposed to the original&#x27;s 41%. As well as returning cast members from the first film, the ensemble cast also included Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris. That year, Stallone co-wrote the book for the of &quot;Rocky&quot;.

In 2013, Stallone starred in the action film &quot;Bullet to the Head&quot;, directed by Walter Hill, based upon Alexis Nolent&#x27;s French graphic novel &quot;Du Plomb Dans La Tete&quot;. Also in 2013, he starred in the action thriller &quot;Escape Plan&quot;, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Caviezel, and in the sports comedy drama &quot;Grudge Match&quot; alongside Robert De Niro, harkening back to the &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise. Stallone was reported to be developing an English-language remake of the Spanish film &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;, though the project was shelved. That year Stallone was credited as writer for the Jason Statham action film vehicle &quot;Homefront.&quot;

&quot;The Expendables 3&quot;, the third installment in the ensemble action film series, was released on August 15, 2014. The returning ensemble cast also added Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. This film was negatively received by both critics and audiences and became the lowest-grossing film in the series.

In 2015, Stallone reprised his role as Rocky Balboa in a spin-off-sequel film, &quot;Creed&quot;, which focused on Adonis &quot;Donnie&quot; Creed, the son of his deceased friend/rival, Apollo Creed, becoming a professional boxer, played by Michael B. Jordan. The film, directed by Ryan Coogler, received critical acclaim. Portraying the iconic cinematic boxer for the seventh time in a span of 40 years, Stallone&#x27;s portrayal of the character received widespread acclaim and accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, and his third Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actor.

In 2017, Stallone appeared in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; as Stakar Ogord / Starhawk, the leader of a Ravagers faction. In 2018, he co-starred in &quot;Escape Plan 2: Hades&quot; with Dave Bautista which was released straight to home-video. Upon wrapping production, he announced via his social media page that work on the third movie titled &quot;Escape Plan: The Extractors&quot;, began immediately thereafter. In July, Stallone announced that he had finished a script for a sequel to &quot;Creed&quot;, with a plot including the return of Ivan Drago from &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. That year, Stallone was featured in Derek Wayne Johnson&#x27;s &quot;John G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs&quot;, a documentary about director John G. Avildsen.

&quot;Creed II&quot; went into production in March 2018, with a scheduled release on Thanksgiving 2018. Stallone was originally slated to direct before the appointment of Steven Caple Jr., in his feature film directorial debut. &quot;Creed II&quot; was released in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on November 21, 2018. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and it went on to debut to $35.3 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $55.8 million), marking the biggest debut ever for a live-action release over Thanksgiving.

On July 23, 2019, in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Stallone said that a Rocky sequel and prequel are in development. Producer Irwin Winkler said &quot;We&#x27;re very high on it&quot; and that negotiations are underway for Stallone to write and star in the feature. &quot;We&#x27;re very anxious to make it.&quot; Stallone said the plot of the film would be about Rocky befriending a young fighter who is an undocumented immigrant. &quot;Rocky meets a young, angry person who got stuck in this country when he comes to see his sister. He takes him into his life, and unbelievable adventures begin, and they wind up south of the border. It&#x27;s very, very timely.&quot; Stallone said. Stallone also said there are &quot;ongoing discussions&quot; about a Rocky prequel television series, which he hopes will land on a streaming service and the series will likely follow a young Rocky Balboa as a professional boxing hopeful. Stallone said producer Irwin Winkler is hesitant on making the series saying that &quot;There was some conflict there, yes. He felt in his mind that &quot;Rocky&quot; was primarily a feature film, and he didn&#x27;t see it as being translated for cable, so there was a big bone of contention.&quot; That year, Stallone hand-picked Derek Wayne Johnson to direct and produce a documentary on the making of the original &quot;Rocky&quot;, entitled &quot;40 Years of Rocky&quot; (2020). The documentary features Stallone narrating behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the film.

Stallone formed a film studio named Balboa Productions with Braden Aftergood in March 2018, where Stallone will serve as co-producer for each of their projects. The studio signed a multi-year collaboration deal with Starlight Culture Entertainment to develop projects for film and television. In May 2018, a fifth installment in the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise was announced, and in August 2018, Adrian Grünberg was confirmed as the director. &quot;&quot; began filming by September 2018, with a script co-written by Stallone, who also reprised his role as Vietnam War veteran John Rambo. The plot centers around Rambo infiltrating a Mexican drug cartel to rescue a family friend&#x27;s daughter. The film, which was released on September 20, 2019, in the United States, grossed $18.9 million in its opening weekend, the best debut of the franchise. The film grossed $91 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.

In late 2020, Stallone lent his voice as Rambo to the fighting video game &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, as part of the game&#x27;s 2nd Kombat Pack. In 2021, he voiced King Shark in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;. In 2022, Stallone starred in &quot;Samaritan&quot;, a dark interpretation of the superhero genre, from a script written by Bragi Schut. In November 2022, Stallone made his streaming television debut in &quot;Tulsa King&quot;, in which he plays a Mafia boss. The 9-episode series was created by Taylor Sheridan and Terence Winter and premiered on Paramount+. A second season continued thereafter.

In May 2023 Stallone and his immediate family (wife and three daughters) starred in a reality television series &quot;The Family Stallone&quot;. Seven days after launch, the series was renewed for a second season. That same month, Stallone reprised his role as Stakar Ogord in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. &quot;Sly&quot;, a documentary film about Stallone by Thom Zimny, premiered as the closing film of the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival. In October 2023, he reprised role as Barney Ross in &quot;Expend4bles&quot;, which was a critical and commercial failure, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the franchise.

==== Upcoming projects ====

Following the releases of &quot;Creed II&quot; and &quot;Rambo V: Last Blood&quot;, Balboa Productions has had an extensive production slate. A film depicting the history of Jack &quot;Galveston Giant&quot; Johnson, the first African-American boxing heavyweight champion, is in development. The project was announced after Stallone&#x27;s instrumental involvement in helping get Johnson a posthumous pardon from US President Donald Trump.

Stallone is also scheduled to star in the film adaptation of &quot;Hunter&quot;, a story which had originally been planned as the premise for &quot;Rambo V: Last Blood&quot;. The story centers around Nathaniel Hunter, a professional tracker who is hired to hunt a half-human beast created as an experiment of a secret agency. A feature-length adaptation of the biographical novel &quot;Ghost: My Thirty Years as an FBI Undercover Agent&quot; by Michael McGowan and Ralph Pezzullo about McGowan&#x27;s career of over 50 undercover missions will follow, though there is no screenwriter attached to the project. Additionally, a film centered around black ops troops, being written by retired Army Ranger Max Adams, is also in development. Stallone wrote &quot;A Working Man&quot; in collaboration with David Ayer from a book series created by Chuck Dixon, which was initially intended to be a television series, but later became a feature film starring Jason Statham. The television production slate includes a series adaptation of Charles Sailor&#x27;s &quot;Second Son&quot; being written by Rob Williams.

In May 2020, Stallone announced that a sequel to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is in the works: &quot;I think it&#x27;s coming. We&#x27;re working on it right now with Warner Brothers. It&#x27;s looking fantastic. So, that should come out, that&#x27;s going to happen&quot;. Stallone has continued to express his passion in directing a film based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s life, a script he has been preparing for years. He has also mentioned that he would like to adapt Nelson DeMille&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Game&quot;.

==Multiple tasks in media==
In 1977, for the first &quot;Rocky&quot;, Stallone became the third man in history to receive the two nominations for best actor and best screenplay, after Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles. Stallone is known for his recurring roles as Rocky Balboa, John Rambo, and Barney Ross. Stallone wrote and starred in all of six &quot;Rocky&quot; films, while directing four of the sequels. Stallone starred in and co-wrote the five films of the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise, and also directed the fourth one. Stallone wrote, directed, and took the lead role in the first installment of &quot;The Expendables&quot; films. Stallone directed, wrote, and starred in &quot;Paradise Alley&quot;. John Travolta starred in &quot;Staying Alive, &quot;a sequel of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which Stallone wrote and directed. Stallone wrote and starred in &quot;Cobra&quot;, and &quot;Driven&quot;. Stallone co-wrote and starred in &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, &quot;Rhinestone&quot;, &quot;Over the Top&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, and &quot;Creed II&quot;.

Asked in February 2008 which of the icons (Rocky or Rambo) he would rather be remembered for, Stallone said &quot;it&#x27;s a tough one, but &quot;Rocky&quot; is my first baby, so Rocky.&quot; He also stated that Rocky could be interpreted as the &quot;conscious&quot; and Rambo as the &quot;unconscious&quot; of the same character.

Stallone has occasionally sung in his films. He sang &quot;Too Close to Paradise&quot; for &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; (1978), with the music provided by Bill Conti (who also collaborated with Stallone in prior years, having recorded the famous &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; theme for his Academy Award-nominated film, &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) which was a U.S. No. 1 hit). In &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982), Stallone (as Rocky Balboa) sang &quot;Take Me Back&quot; to his on-screen wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), as they lay in bed. The song was first performed by singer and younger brother, Frank, who had a small role in the original &quot;Rocky&quot;. For &quot;Rhinestone&quot; (1984), Stallone sang such songs as &quot;Drinkenstein&quot; as well as duets with his co-star, and actual country music star, Dolly Parton. He also performed two songs when he guest-starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in the 1980s, at the height of his career. The last time Stallone sang in a film was in &quot;Grudge Match&quot; (2013) when he and Robert De Niro performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; together.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===

Stallone has been married three times. He has two sons from his first marriage and three daughters from his third marriage.

At age 28, on December 28, 1974, he married Sasha Czack. They had two sons, Sage Moonblood Stallone (1976–2012), who died of heart disease at age 36, and Seargeoh (b. 1979), who was diagnosed with autism at an early age. The couple divorced on February 14, 1985.

Stallone married model and actress Brigitte Nielsen on December 15, 1985, in Beverly Hills, California. Their marriage (which lasted two years) and their subsequent divorce were highly publicized by the tabloid press.

In 1988, Stallone met model Jennifer Flavin and they were in a relationship until 1994, when Stallone told her he was having a child with model Janice Dickinson. After the February 1994 birth, DNA tests confirmed he was not the father and Stallone ended his engagement to Dickinson. After a brief 1995 engagement with model Angie Everhart, he and Flavin rekindled their relationship.

In May 1997, Stallone and Jennifer Flavin married. The couple has three daughters, Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlet. His daughters were chosen to share the role of Golden Globe Ambassador at the 74th Golden Globe Awards. On August 19, 2022, Palm Beach County records showed that after 25 years of marriage, Jennifer Flavin had filed for &quot;dissolution of marriage and other relief&quot;. On September 23, 2022, the couple reconciled.

=== Family and friends ===
Stallone maintains a relationship with his brother Frank who contributed the theme songs to &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Staying Alive&quot;. In 1983, Frank&#x27;s song &quot;Far from Over&quot;, for &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, reached the #10 U.S. hit. Frank appears in minor roles, bit parts, and provides music in many films starring Sylvester, most notably in the &quot;Rocky&quot; films, where Frank played a street corner singer and contributed songs. Stallone&#x27;s 48-year-old half-sister, Toni Ann Filiti, died of lung cancer on August 26, 2012. Stallone was a close friend of Joe Spinell, but they had a falling out during the shooting of their final collaboration, &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, in 1981, and Spinell died in 1989.

===Injuries===
Known for physically demanding roles and his willingness to do the majority of his own stunts, Stallone has suffered various injuries during his acting career. During the filming of &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;, he broke a finger trying to save a penalty kick against Pelé. For a scene in &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, he told Dolph Lundgren, &quot;Punch me as hard as you can in the chest.&quot; He later said, &quot;Next thing I know, I was in intensive care at St. John&#x27;s Hospital for four days. It&#x27;s stupid!&quot; While filming a fight scene with &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin for &quot;The Expendables&quot;, he broke his neck and required the insertion of a metal plate.

===Legal issues===
In February 2001, an exotic dancer named Margie Carr filed a lawsuit against Stallone, accusing him of rape while at a Santa Monica fitness center where they both worked out on February 26, 2000. A lawyer for Stallone denied the claim, saying she sold the story to &quot;Globe&quot; the month before the lawsuit.

In 2007, customs officials in Australia discovered 48 vials of the synthetic human growth hormone Jintropin in Stallone&#x27;s luggage. In a court hearing on May 15, he pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a controlled substance.

In 2013, it was reported that Stallone paid a $2 million lump-sum settlement alongside a monthly amount and a trust for psychiatric and medical expenses to his half-sister Toni-Ann Filiti in 1987. Filiti threatened to file a lawsuit accusing him of abuse. Representatives for Stallone and Filiti&#x27;s mother Jacqueline Stallone denied the allegations, accusing Filiti of blackmailing him and being a drug addict. However, Filiti&#x27;s son, Edd Filiti, supported the claims, saying his mother &quot;screamed about&quot; abuse at the hands of her half-brother &quot;over and over,&quot; before her death in 2012.

In 2016, a report from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was published stating that Stallone was accused of sexual assault by a 16-year-old girl while he was shooting a film in Las Vegas in 1986. The teen reportedly said that Stallone, then 40, forced her into a threesome with his bodyguard. A representative for Stallone denied the allegation. Stallone&#x27;s ex-wife, Brigitte Nielsen, later came to his defense, saying that she was with him at the time of the alleged assault. Stallone&#x27;s &quot;Over the Top&quot; costar David Mendenhall also defended Stallone, denying claims that he introduced Stallone to the girl in question.

In November 2017, a woman accused Stallone of sexually assaulting her at his Santa Monica office in the early 1990s. Stallone denied the claim. His attorney revealed the accuser filed a report after an entertainment website declined to pick up the story. Stallone&#x27;s attorneys also stated that while the actor had a consensual relationship with the accuser in 1987, they had two witnesses who refuted the claims. In June 2018, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office confirmed an investigation, stating that the Santa Monica Police Department had presented a sex crimes case against Stallone to a special prosecution task force for review. In October 2018, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office made the decision not to charge Stallone for the alleged assault, as no witnesses corroborated the allegations. Stallone in turn filed a police report regarding her lying on an official document.

===Religious views===
Stallone was baptized and raised a devout Catholic but stopped going to church as his acting career progressed. He rediscovered his childhood faith when his daughter was born ill in 1996, and he again became a strict Catholic by late 2006. The same year, he was interviewed by Pat Robertson from the Christian Broadcasting Network&#x27;s &quot;700 Club&quot;. He stated that he spent much of his previous time in Hollywood &quot;losing his way&quot; because temptation abounded, but later put things &quot;in God&#x27;s hands&quot;. However, he told &quot;GQ&quot; magazine in 2010, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty spiritual; I believe a lot in the spirit of man. I&#x27;m certainly not an atheist... I was baptized Catholic, but I don&#x27;t belong to a structured church. I have no opposition to it. I think there&#x27;s great nuggets of knowledge in there, some wonderful rules to live by. Then the flip side is the amount of agony that&#x27;s caused.&quot;

===Politics===
Stallone has supported several Republican politicians, but does not identify as a member of the Republican Party. He has also donated to the Democratic National Committee and to Democrats such as Joe Biden and Chris Dodd. He is a staunch advocate of gun control despite his otherwise conservative views, and has been described as &quot;the most anti-gun celebrity in Hollywood&quot;. In 1994, Stallone contributed $1,000 to the campaign of then-Congressman Rick Santorum, who was then running for the Senate in Pennsylvania. In 2008, Stallone endorsed John McCain for that year&#x27;s presidential election. In 2015, upon the advice of a Vedic scholar, Stallone performed a Hindu &quot;Tithi Shradh&quot; ritual (done for those who died by accident or murder) at Haridwar for his son Sage.

In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Stallone described Donald Trump as a &quot;Dickensian character&quot; and &quot;larger than life&quot; but did not endorse Trump or anyone else in the Republican primaries. That same year, he declined an offer to become Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, citing a desire to work on issues related to veterans. In 2023, Stallone donated $11,600 to independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema&#x27;s re-election campaign in Arizona. Later that year, he and his family spent time with Pope Francis in a private meeting at the Vatican. After Trump&#x27;s win in the 2024 election, Stallone attended an event at Mar-a-Lago. During a speech, Stallone praised Trump as a &quot;mythical character&quot; and the &quot;second George Washington&quot;. He also compared him to his character Rocky Balboa.

On January 16, 2025, it was announced by Trump that Stallone would serve in a new role as a Special Ambassador to Hollywood, sharing the role with fellow actors Jon Voight and Mel Gibson. Trump stated that he wants these actors to make Hollywood &quot;stronger than ever before&quot; by bringing back business lost to &quot;foreign countries&quot;.

<text>The University of Girona ( (); ;) is located in the city of Girona, Catalonia, Spain.

Its real origin dates back to its creation in 1446, but it was reestablished as a new university in 1991. As of 2021, it consists of several campus and buildings across Girona: &quot;Montilivi&quot;, &quot;Barri Vell&quot;, &quot;Centre&quot;, and &quot;Parc Científic i Tecnològic.&quot; A fifth campus, &quot;Campus de Ciències de la Salut&quot;, was proposed some time ago. Since its founding, the university has had five presidents (): Josep Maria Nadal i Farreras, from 1991 to 2002, Joan Batlle i Grabulosa from 2002 to 2005, Anna Maria Geli from 2005 to 2013, Sergi Bonet Marull from 2013 to 2017 and Joaquim Salvi since 2017 (still in office).

==Organization==

=== Partnerships and strategic alliances ===
The UdG has partnered with other universities and research centers (including the University of the Balearic Islands and University of Perpignan Via Domitia) to create the Pyrenees-Mediterranean Cross-Border Research and Higher Education Group (PRES-PM).

The UdG has joined forces with the University of the Balearic Islands, the Catalan Institute for Water Research and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas to create the Campus d&#x27;Excel.lència Pirineus-Mediterrània (CEI-PM).

It is a member of the Florence Network for Nursing and Midwifery and the Vives Network.

=== Internal decision-making ===
The Universitat de Girona uses the open-source software &quot;Consul&quot; to let its members propose, debate and decide on issues in administration, teaching and budgeting.

==History==

The first modern reference of &quot;Universitat de Girona&quot; references to the &quot;Escola Normal de Mestres&quot; and, specially, the initiative during the 1960s decade to recover university level studies in Girona. In 1969, the &quot;Col·legi Universitari de Girona&quot; and the &quot;Escola Politècnica Universitària de Girona&quot; were created, which depended on the already founded universities UAB and UPC, respectively. Later, the &quot;Estudi General&quot; was restarted, with the available studies of Humanities, Sciences, Economics and Social science. Finally, on 12 December 1991, the Catalan Parliament created the new and current &quot;Universitat de Girona&quot;.

== Research ==

Research at the UdG mainly focuses on two strategic lines: (1) water science and management, and (2) tourism and sustainability. Furthermore, the UdG pursues research in a few important research and innovation programmes that have attained a prominent role at the university: scientific research, the dissemination of its results and its ensuing social influence are also focussed on computer simulation and applications, food and agriculture, biomedicine, the quality of life and cultural heritage.

The University of Girona has 12 research institutes and academic personnel in 24 departments and 107 research groups (58 in science, technology and health fields and 49 in the humanities and social sciences).

<text>The University of Barcelona (official name in ) is a public research university located in the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was established in 1450. With 76,000 students, it is one of the biggest universities in Spain and has also been ranked 1st in the country in most of the 2024 rankings. 

It has 106 departments and more than 5,000 full-time researchers, technicians and research assistants, most of whom work in the 243 research groups as recognized and supported by the Government of Catalonia. In 2010, the UB was awarded 175 national research grants and 17 European grants and participated in over 500 joint research projects with the business sector, generating an overall research income of 70 million euros. The work of these groups is overseen by the UB&#x27;s research centres and institutes which collaborate with leading research institutions and networks in Spain and abroad. The UB is also home to three large research foundations: the Barcelona Science Park Foundation (PCB), which includes the Institute of Biomedical Research of Barcelona (IRBB); the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS); and the Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (IDIBELL). The UB is also a degree-awarding body of the Institut Barcelona d&#x27;Estudis Internacionals (IBEI).

== History ==


The University was founded under the royal prerogative granted by King Alfons el Magnànim on 3 November 1450. For forty-nine years prior to this, however, the city had a fledgling medical school (or &quot;Estudi General&quot;, as the universities were known at that time), founded by King Martí of Aragon, but neither the &quot;Consell de Cent&quot; (Barcelona&#x27;s Council of One Hundred) nor the city&#x27;s other leading institutions had given it their official recognition, considering it an intrusion on their respective jurisdictions. Alfons el Magnànim’s prerogative, though, was granted at the petition of the &quot;Consell de Cent&quot;, and so the council was always to consider the &quot;Estudi General&quot; created in 1450 as the city&#x27;s true university, since it was very much under its control and patronage. 

The process that culminated in the foundation of the &quot;Estudi General&quot; of Barcelona can be traced back to the end of the fourteenth century, with the opening of a number of schools under the patronage of the City Hall, the cathedral schools and the Dominican convent of Santa Caterina, which established itself as a major cultural centre. It was King Martí the Humane who set in motion the process that would result in the foundation of the University of Barcelona. In his letter written 23 January 1398, and addressed to the councillors of Barcelona, he informed them that he had sought the Pope&#x27;s permission to found a university in the city.

Despite the &quot;Consell de Cent&#x27;s&quot; refusal to accept the concession issued by the King to found an &quot;Estudi General&quot;, on 10 January 1401, Martí founded the &quot;Estudi General of Medicine&quot; in Barcelona under his royal prerogative, granting it the same privileges as those enjoyed by the University of Montpellier. In another document, signed in Valencia on 9 May 1402, King Martí sought to promote the &quot;Estudi General of Medicine&quot; with the appointment of a number of teachers of the liberal arts, without which the study of medicine was virtually useless. From that day forth, the &quot;Estudi&quot; was known as the &quot;Estudi of Medicine and the Arts&quot;.

The prerogative granted by King Alphonse the Magnanimous in 1450, authorizing the &quot;Consell de Cent&quot; to found a university in Barcelona, was the culmination of the process initiated in 1398.

For a number of reasons, in particular the civil war that raged during the reign of John II and the subsequent conflicts involving the peasant farmers, the official &quot;Estudi General&quot; of Barcelona did not begin to develop until the reign of Fernando the Catholic; but it was under Charles I, in 1536, that the foundation stone was laid for the new university building at the top end of La Rambla. From that moment on the university began to carry out its work as normal despite financial difficulties and in-fighting between university teachers, though this was not to stop some illustrious professors from making their mark in their respective fields and creating their own schools of academic followers.

The 1596 Ordinances once more showed the need for reform. These followed hard on the heels of earlier Ordinances passed in 1539 and 1559, in which the competitive examination system for the appointment of professors had been introduced.

This period was brought to a close with the Decree issued on 23 October 1714, by the Royal High Commission for Justice and Government of Catalonia – created by the Duke of Berwick – ordering the immediate transfer of the Faculties of Philosophy, Law and Canon Law to Cervera as a punishment for the opposition to Bourbons’ rule. Barcelona was to keep its Faculty of Medicine and the Cordelles School of Humanities, governed by the Jesuits. Plans to open the University of Cervera did not get underway until 1715, and it did not start its academic work until 1717, as the successor to the six Catalan universities closed down by Philip V. The first statutes of the new University of Cervera were passed in 1725.

&quot;The University of Barcelona was closed by the Bourbon dynasty after the War of the Spanish Succession from 1714 until 1837.&quot; The university was restored to Barcelona during the liberal revolution during the reign of Isabella II. In 1837, the University of Cervera was transferred to Barcelona, the capital of the principality. From that moment forth it was recognized as the cultural home of the four Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.

On its return the University was housed initially in the Convent of Carme, which had been disestablished a few years earlier. Here the Faculties of Canon Law, Law and Theology were provisionally installed. The Faculty of Medicine took up residence in the Royal Academy of Medicine, next door to the Hospital of Santa Creu. Thus, all the Faculties were now located in just two streets – Hospital and del Carme.

The inadequate nature of these premises soon gave rise to the need to construct a larger home for the University, and in 1863, work began on Elies Rogent&#x27;s new building, though it would not be fully completed until 1882. Its construction was to have major repercussions for the city, since it was one of the first buildings to be raised outside the ancient city walls.

Work on the building lasted for more than twenty years, although by 1871 the first lectures were being given there. The clock and the iron bell housed in the tower in the &quot;Pati de Lletres&quot;— the &quot;Patio of the Arts&quot;— were installed in 1881. Complementing the building work, sculptures and paintings were commissioned either directly from artists of repute or awarded in open competition.

Medical sciences continued to be taught at the former Hospital of Santa Creu i Sant Pau. In 1879, the Faculty of Medicine was presented with a project for a new hospital, and after many changes in the plans and suggested locations, it was eventually installed in the Hospital Clinic on the eastern side of the city&#x27;s Eixample district in 1900. Today, Medicine is also taught on the Bellvitge Campus and at the Hospital of Sant Joan de Déu.

The natural growth of the University of Barcelona has given rise to the need to undertake large-scale building work to meet the growing demands made by student numbers that were unthinkable in the nineteenth century. In response to this growth, the university district of Pedralbes was begun in 1952. The first building to be completed on this new city campus was the Faculty of Pharmacy in 1956, alongside the Sant Raimond de Penyafort and the Verge de Montserrat Halls of Residence.

This was followed by the Faculty of Law in 1958, the University School of Business Studies in 1961, and the Faculty of Economics between 1957 and 1968. Today this district is known as the Pedralbes Campus, while in the nineties the university added the Campus Mundet, housed in some of the buildings of the Llars Mundet. In 2006, the Faculties of History and Geography and the Faculty of Philosophy were moved from the Pedralbes Campus to the historic centre of the city (Ciutat Vella district), in the El Raval neighborhood, and just a short walk from the Historic Building of the University.

The University of Barcelona was the only university in Catalonia until 1971, when the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, comprising the more technical Faculties and University Schools, became an independent entity. In 1968, the Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona became the first of several new universities to be set up in Catalonia.

<text>The Autonomous University of Barcelona (; Spanish: ; ; UAB) is a public university mostly located in Cerdanyola del Vallès, near the city of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.

, the university consists of 57 departments in the experimental, life, social and human sciences, spread among 13 faculties/schools. All these centers together award a total of 85 qualifications in the form of first degrees, diplomas, and engineering degrees. Moreover, almost 80 doctoral programmes, and more than 80 other postgraduate programs are offered. UAB has more than 40,000 students and more than 3,600 academic and research staff. UAB is a pioneering institution in terms of fostering research. There are many research institutes in the campus, as well as other research centres, technical support services, and service-providing laboratories, and the ALBA (synchrotron) located in the Barcelona Synchrotron Park is very close to UAB.

UAB is the best university in Spain according to the 2023 QS World University Rankings, which ranked the university 178th overall in the world. Its subject rankings were: 27th in Veterinary Science, 72nd in Education &amp; Training, 73rd in Linguistics, 78th in Sociology and 88th in Economics &amp; Econometrics. The UAB is also a degree-awarding body of the Institut Barcelona d&#x27;Estudis Internacionals (IBEI).

==Location==
Most UAB academic activity takes place on the main campus in Cerdanyola del Vallès. Several centres exist in Manresa, Sabadell, Terrassa, Sant Cugat del Vallès and Barcelona.

The UAB campus is about away from the centre of Barcelona. It is accessible by air (flights to Barcelona, Girona, or Reus), by train (Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat, Renfe), by bus (SARBUS) or by car (AP-7 and C-58 motorways).

==History==

The Autonomous University of Barcelona was officially created by legislative decree on 6 June 1968. Previously, during the Second Spanish Republic, there had been plans for constituting a second university in Barcelona, but the Civil War and the following years of poverty under the early dictatorship did not allow these plans to become a reality until that year.

On 27 July, a disposition to the decree was added, starting the creation of the Faculty of Literature, Language, Art and the Humanities, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Economical Sciences. Around ten weeks later, on 6 October, the first course of the Faculty of Literature, Language, Art and the Humanities was inaugurated at Sant Cugat del Vallès Monastery. During the same month, the Faculty of Medicine was created at the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona.

In 1969, an agreement was signed for the acquisition of the land where the university campus is currently located. During that year, the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Economical Sciences started running. During the following three years, several faculties and professional schools were created, and the construction works on the campus land took place. At the end of this period, most existing faculties and schools are settled in the campus.

At the end of the dictatorship in 1976, the university introduced a plan to create a model of a democratic, independent university, described in a document known as &quot;Bellaterra Manifesto&quot;, which included a declaration of principles. Two years later, after the approval of the Catalan Statute, the University Council agreed to recourse to the Generalitat de Catalunya.

During the period between 1985 and 1992, the university underwent several faculty reforms and the creation of several new faculties. In 1993, the University Ville was inaugurated as a student residence integrated inside the campus complex.

==Rankings==
Autonomous University of Barcelona has consistently been ranked in several academic rankings. The 2021 Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked the UAB 201–300 in the world and 2nd in Spain. The 2024 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 149th in the world and 1st in Spain. The 2023 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university 183th in the world, and 2nd in Spain. In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022 global university rankings, the university placed 144th in its world rankings, and 2nd in Spain. In U-Ranking 2021, the university was ranked 2nd in Spain based on their performance in teaching, research and innovations.

Autonomous University of Barcelona also placed in numerous rankings that evaluates the employment prospects of graduates. In QS&#x27;s 2022 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 151–160 in the world, and sixth in Spain. In the Times Higher Education&#x27;s 2021 global employability ranking, the university placed 132nd in the world, and 3rd in Spain.

A collaboration of IFAE (High Energy Physics Institute of the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona) and CIEMAT (Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas Medioambientales and Tecnológicas), it is supported by regional (Catalan) and national (Spanish) research governing authorities.

The main scientific project PIC is associated to, in terms of utilisation of computing resources, is the deployment, operations and maintenance of the Spanish Tier 1 site for the WLCG, supporting the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments of the LHC at CERN. PIC researchers and computing experts hence contribute to the development of Grid Computing technologies, as required by the computing needs of these experiments. Other projects in which PIC researchers are involved include computing support for Astrophysics and Cosmology experiments (such as MAGIC, PAU and DES) and computing techniques for medical imaging.

<text>Louis Braille ( ; ; 4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was a French educator and the inventor of a reading and writing system named after him, braille, intended for use by visually impaired people. His system is used worldwide and remains virtually unchanged to this day.

Braille was blinded in one eye at the age of three. This occurred as a result from an accident with a stitching awl in his father&#x27;s harness making shop. Consequently, an infection set in and spread to both eyes, resulting in total blindness. At that time, there were not many resources in place for the blind, but he nevertheless excelled in his education and received a scholarship to France&#x27;s Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by a system invented by Charles Barbier, Braille&#x27;s new method was more compact and lent itself to a range of uses, including music. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824, when he was fifteen years old.

In adulthood, Braille served as a professor at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.

==Early life==
Louis Braille was born in Coupvray, a small town about twenty miles east of Paris, on 4 January 1809. He and his three elder siblings – Monique Catherine (b. 1793), Louis-Simon (b. 1795), and Marie Céline (b. 1797) – lived with their parents, Simon-René and Monique, on three hectares of land and vineyard in the countryside. Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a leatherer and maker of horse tack.

As soon as he could walk, Braille&#x27;s time was spent playing in his father&#x27;s workshop. At the age of three, he was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and stabbed him in one of his eyes. A local physician bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected. He eventually lost sight in the other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.

Braille survived the torment of the infection, but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, he did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille&#x27;s bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.

== Blind education ==
Braille studied in Coupvray until the age of ten. Because of his intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. The last of his family&#x27;s children to leave the household, Braille departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.

===Haüy system===
The children were taught to read using a system devised by the school&#x27;s founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who devoted his life to helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children by embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.

Braille was helped by Haüy&#x27;s books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of information retained in such books was necessarily minor. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to &quot;write&quot; by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, but the boy could at least trace the letters&#x27; outlines and write his first sentences.

The handcrafted Haüy books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children. They were laboriously constructed, very fragile, and expensive to obtain: when Haüy&#x27;s school first opened, it had a total of three books. Nonetheless, Haüy promoted their use with zeal. To him, the books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed – at the time – to offer the best achievable results. Braille and his schoolmates, however, could detect all too well the books&#x27; crushing limitations. Nonetheless, Haüy&#x27;s efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement – the recognition of the sense of touch as a workable strategy for sightless reading. The Haüy system&#x27;s main drawback, in the opinion of at least one author, was that it was &quot;talking to the fingers with the language of the eye&quot;.

===Teacher and musician===
Braille read Haüy&#x27;s books repeatedly, and he was equally attentive to the oral instruction offered by the school. He proved to be a highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school&#x27;s curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain a teacher&#x27;s aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For much of the rest of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.

Braille&#x27;s ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues. Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France. A devout Catholic, Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.

==Braille system==

===Origins===
In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Charles Barbier. Barbier, aware of its potential for helping the blind to read and write, wrote to the school to introduce his method. Barbier&#x27;s invention was a code of up to twelve dots in two columns, impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers. Barbier&#x27;s code of raised dots inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.

Braille was determined to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge the gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: &quot;Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about.&quot;
===Design===
Braille reworked Barbier&#x27;s system by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and reduced the maximum of twelve raised dots to six. His first version used both dots and dashes. He published this version in 1829, but by the second edition in 1837 discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille&#x27;s smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.

Braille created his own raised-dot system using Barbier&#x27;s slate and stylus tools. Barbier had donated many sets of these tools to the school. By soldering metal strips across the slate, Braille created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.

By these modest means, Braille constructed a robust communication system. &quot;It bears the stamp of genius,&quot; wrote Dr. Richard Slating French, former director of the California School for the Blind, &quot;like the Roman alphabet itself&quot;.

===Musical adaptation===
The system was soon extended to include braille musical notation. Passionate about his own music, Braille took meticulous care in its planning to ensure that the musical code would be &quot;flexible enough to meet the unique requirements of any instrument&quot;. In 1829, he published the first book about his system, &quot;Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plainsong by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them&quot;. Ironically this book was first printed by the raised letter method of the Haüy system.

===Publications===
Braille produced several written works about braille and as general education for the blind. &quot;Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plainsong...&quot; (1829) was revised and republished in 1837; his mathematics guide, &quot;Little Synopsis of Arithmetic for Beginners&quot;, entered use in 1838; and his monograph &quot;New Method for Representing by Dots the Form of Letters, Maps, Geometric Figures, Musical Symbols, etc., for Use by the Blind&quot; was first published in 1839. Many of Braille&#x27;s original printed works remain available at the Braille birthplace museum in Coupvray.

===Decapoint===
&quot;New Method for Representing by Dots...&quot; (1839) put forth Braille&#x27;s plan for a new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called &quot;decapoint&quot;, the system combined his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.

After the introduction of decapoint, Braille assisted his friend Pierre-François-Victor Foucault, who invented the Raphigraphe, a device that allowed for more rapid creation of letters made with raised points. Foucault&#x27;s machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris in 1855.

==Later life==
Dr. Alexandre René Pignier, principal at the school, supported Braille&#x27;s work and allowed the teaching of Braille&#x27;s system. However, Pignier was forced out of his position in 1840 by an ambitious younger teacher, Pierre-Armand Dufau, who opposed the teaching of Braille at the school. Fortunately, another teacher, Joseph Guadet, supported Braille, and the system was reintroduced in 1844, at the time of the opening of a new school building on the Boulevard des Invalides.

Braille had always been a sickly child, and his condition worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. By the age of 40, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he turned 43.

==Legacy==
Because of the overwhelming insistence of the blind pupils, Braille&#x27;s system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death. The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, by the time of the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause of braille was championed by Dr. Thomas Rhodes Armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that &quot;There is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used except in some of those in North America.&quot; Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.

New variations in braille technology continue to grow, including such innovations as braille computer terminals; RoboBraille email delivery service; and Nemeth Braille, a comprehensive system for mathematical and scientific notation. Almost two centuries after its invention, braille remains a system of powerful and enduring utility.

===Honors and tributes===
The immense personal legacy of Louis Braille was described in a 1952 essay by T. S. Eliot:

Braille&#x27;s childhood home in Coupvray is a listed historic building and houses the Louis Braille Museum. A large monument to him was erected in the town square which was itself renamed Braille Square. On the centenary of his death, his remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris. In a symbolic gesture, Braille&#x27;s hands were left in Coupvray, reverently buried near his home.

Statues and other memorials to Louis Braille can be found around the world. He has been commemorated in postage stamps worldwide, and the asteroid 9969 Braille was named for him in 1992. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; lists him among the &quot;100 Most Influential Inventors Of All Time&quot;.

A Google Doodle for Louis Braille&#x27;s 197th birthday in 2006 was shown on Google&#x27;s homepage, spelling &quot;Google&quot; in braille.

The 200th anniversary of Braille&#x27;s birth in 2009 was celebrated throughout the world by exhibitions and symposiums about his life and achievements. Among the commemorations, Belgium and Italy struck 2-euro coins, India released a set of two commemorative coins (Rs 100 and Rs 2), and the USA struck a one dollar coin, all in Braille&#x27;s honor.

World Braille Day is celebrated every year on Braille&#x27;s birthday, 4 January, since 2019.

===In popular culture===
Because of his accomplishments as a young boy, Braille holds a special place as a hero for children, and he has been the subject of a large number of works of juvenile literature. Other appearances in the arts include the American TV special &quot;Young Heroes: Louis Braille&quot; (2010); the French TV movie &quot;Une lumière dans la nuit&quot; (2008) (released in English as &quot;The Secret of Braille&quot;); and the dramatic play &quot;Braille: The Early Life of Louis Braille&quot; (1989) by Lola and Coleman Jennings. In music, Braille&#x27;s life was subject of the song &quot;Merci, Louis&quot;, composed by the Halifax singer-songwriter Terry Kelly, chair of the Canadian Braille Literacy Foundation. &quot;The Braille Legacy&quot;, a musical which tells the story of Louis Braille, directed by Thom Southerland and starring Jérôme Pradon, debuted at the Charing Cross Theatre in April 2017.

==Notes==

* It remains uncertain which eye was actually struck first. Most accounts of Braille&#x27;s accident omit reference to left or right. Braille&#x27;s American biographer J. Alvin Kugelmass wrote that it was the left eye, but C. Michael Mellor and Lennard Bickel state definitively that it was the right.

<text>The Tomfoolery Show is a 1970–1971 American animated comedy television series, based on the works of Edward Lear which aired on NBC. The animation was done at the Halas and Batchelor Studios in London and Stroud. Though the works of other writers were also used, notably Lewis Carroll and Ogden Nash, Lear&#x27;s works were the main source, and characters like the Yongy-Bonghy-Bo and the Umbrageous Umbrella Maker were all Lear creations. Other characters included the Enthusiastic Elephant, the Fizzgiggious Fish, and the Scroobious Snake. The show&#x27;s writing was credited to Lear, Carroll, and Romeo Muller, the latter being responsible for the adaptations of the earlier writers&#x27; works. Some original material was also written based on characters created by Lear, although much of the material was a straight recital of poems and limericks or songs using Lear&#x27;s poems set to music. A recurring joke had a delivery boy running around, trying to deliver a large plant and shouting, &quot;Plant for Mrs Discobolus!&quot;

The show also included characters from Gelett Burgess&#x27; work, including &quot;The Purple Cow&quot; and the Goops.

Some of the gags were based on Abbott and Costello skits which involved one of the regular characters in troubling situations.

A cooking lesson for a silly recipe was also presented in each episode. Two memorable examples were:-
* &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; where a map of the US state of Alaska was cut out of an atlas and placed in the oven.
* &quot;Upside-down cake&quot; where the entire cartoon image was literally turned upside-down in order to carry out the cooking lesson.

The series was produced by Rankin/Bass, (formerly Videocraft International), who also made the &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; television specials.

17 episodes were broadcast from September 12, 1970 to September 4, 1971, featuring the voices of Peter Hawkins, Bernard Spear, and the Maury Laws Singers.

==Reception==
In &quot;Children&#x27;s Television: The First Thirty-five Years&quot;, George W. Woolery said, &quot;A bit too literary and lofty, &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; was a noble failure.&quot; David Perlmutter agreed in &quot;The Encyclopedia of American Animated TV Shows&quot;, saying that the show was &quot;a failed attempt... The problem was that the approach to the material did not do it justice — the program was structured in the style of a revue à la &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; rather than a proper narrative...The odd mélange lasted only a year on the air despite its noble intent.&quot;
