<text>USS &quot;Akron&quot; (ZRS-4) was a helium-filled rigid airship of the U.S. Navy, the lead ship of her class, which operated between September 1931 and April 1933. It was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built flying aircraft carrier, carrying F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes, which could be launched and recovered while it was in flight. With an overall length of , &quot;Akron&quot; and her sister ship were among the largest flying objects ever built. Although LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; were some longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with hydrogen, and so the two US Navy craft still hold the world record for the largest helium-filled airships.

&quot;Akron&quot; was destroyed in a thunderstorm off the coast of New Jersey on the morning of 4 April 1933, killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers. The accident involved the greatest loss of life in any airship crash.

==Technical description==
The airship&#x27;s skeleton was built of the new lightweight alloy duralumin 17-SRT. The frame introduced several novel features compared with traditional Zeppelin designs. Rather than being single-girder diamond trusses with radial wire bracing, the main rings of &quot;Akron&quot; were self-supporting deep frames: triangular Warren trusses &#x27;curled&#x27; round to form a ring. Though much heavier than conventional rings, the deep rings promised to be much stronger, a significant attraction to the navy after the in-flight break up of the earlier conventional airships R38/ZR-2 and ZR-1 &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. The inherent strength of these frames allowed the chief designer, Karl Arnstein, to dispense with the internal cruciform structure used by Zeppelin to support the fins of their ships. Instead, the fins of &quot;Akron&quot; were cantilevered: mounted entirely externally to the main structure. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot;, and &quot;Hindenburg&quot; used a supplementary axial keel along the hull centerline. However, the &quot;Akron&quot; used three keels, one running along the top of the hull and one each side, 45 degrees up from the lower centreline. Each keel provided a walkway running almost the entire length of the ship. The electric and telephone wiring, control cables, 110 fuel tanks, 44 water ballast bags, 8 engine rooms, engines, transmissions, and water-recovery devices were placed along the lower keels. The inert gas helium was used instead of flammable hydrogen, which improved streamlining by allowing the engines to be safely placed inside the hull. A generator room, with 2 Westinghouse d.c. generators powered by a 30-h.p. internal combustion engine, was forward of the No. 7 engine room.

The main rings were spaced at and between each pair were three intermediate rings of lighter construction. In keeping with conventional practice, &#x27;station numbers&#x27; on the airship were measured in meters from zero at the rudder post, positive forward and negative aft. Thus the tip of the tail was at station −23.75 and the nose mooring spindle was at station 210.75. Each ring frame formed a polygon with 36 corners and these (and their associated longitudinal girders) were numbered from 1 (at the bottom centre) to 18 (at the top centre) port and starboard. Thus a position on the hull could be referred to, for example, as &quot;6 port at station 102.5&quot; (the number 1 engine room).

While Germany, France and Britain used goldbeater&#x27;s skin to gas-proof their gasbags, &quot;Akron&quot; used Goodyear Tire and Rubber&#x27;s rubberised cotton, heavier but much cheaper and more durable. Half the gas cells used an experimental cotton-based fabric impregnated with a gelatin-latex compound. This was more expensive than the rubberised cotton but lighter than goldbeater&#x27;s skin. It was so successful that all the gasbags of &quot;Macon&quot; were made from it. There were 12 gas cells, numbered 0 to XI, using Roman numerals and starting from the tail. While the &#x27;air volume&#x27; of the hull was , the total volume of the gas cells at 100 percent fill was . At a normal 95 percent fill with helium of standard purity, the of gas would yield a gross lift of . Given a structure deadweight of , this gives a useful lift of available for fuel, lubricants, ballast, crew, supplies and military load (including the skyhook airplanes)

Eight Maybach VL II gasoline engines were mounted inside the hull. Each engine turned a two-bladed, diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and bevel gearing which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal. With the engines&#x27; ability to reverse, this allowed thrust to be applied forward, aft, up or down. It appears from photographs that the four propellers on each side were contra-rotating, each one turning the opposite way to the one ahead of it. Thus it would appear that the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the thrust lines to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in &quot;Akron&quot;″s propellers all being in line. This proved problematic in service, as it induced considerable vibration which was especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, &quot;Akron&quot; had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers. These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for &quot;Macon&quot;.

The outer cover was of cotton cloth, treated with four coats of clear and two coats of aluminum pigmented cellulose dope. The total area of the skin was and it weighed, after doping, .

The prominent dark vertical bands on the hull were condensers of the system designed to recover water from the engines&#x27; exhaust for buoyancy compensation. In-flight fuel consumption continuously reduces an airship&#x27;s weight and changes in the temperature of the lifting gas can do the same. Normally, expensive helium has to be released to compensate and any way of avoiding this is desirable. In theory, a water recovery system such as this can produce 1 lb of ballast water for every lb of fuel burned, though this is unlikely to be achieved in practice.

&quot;Akron&quot; could carry up to of gasoline () in 110 separate tanks which were distributed along the lower keels to preserve the ship&#x27;s trim, giving her a normal range of at cruising speed. Theoretical maximum ballast water capacity was in 44 bags, again distributed along her length, though normal ballast load at unmasting was . Maximum ballast was never an option, because a full fuel and ballast load would have left only lifting capacity for aircraft, crew, and supplies, and each fully loaded F9C fighter alone weighed .

The heart of the ship, and her sole reason for existing, was the airplane hangar and trapeze system. Aft of the control car, in bay VII, between frames 125 and 141.25, was a compartment large enough to accommodate up to five F9C Sparrowhawk airplanes. However, two structural girders partially obstructed &quot;Akron&quot;″s aftmost hangar bays, limiting its capacity to three airplanes (one in each forward corner of the hangar and one on the trapeze). A modification to remove this design flaw was pending at the time of the ship&#x27;s loss.

The F9C was not the ideal choice, being designed as a &#x27;conventional&#x27; carrier-borne fighter. It was heavily built to withstand carrier landings, downward visibility was not very good and it initially lacked an effective radio. But the primary role of &quot;Akron&quot;″s airplanes was long-range naval scouting. What was actually needed was a stable, fast, lightweight scouting airplane with a long range, but none existed capable of fitting between the structural members and into the airship&#x27;s hangar, as the F9C could.

The trapeze was lowered through the T-shaped door in the bottom of the ship and into the slipstream, with an airplane attached to the crossbar by the &#x27;skyhook&#x27; above its top wing, its pilot on board and its engine running. The pilot tripped the hook and the airplane fell away from the ship. On his return, he positioned himself beneath the trapeze and climbed up until he could fly his skyhook onto the crossbar, at which point it automatically latched shut. Now, with the engine idling, the trapeze and airplane were raised into the hangar, the pilot cutting his engine as he passed through the door. Once inside, the airplane was transferred from the trapeze to a trolley, running on an overhead &#x27;monorail&#x27; system by which it could be shunted into one of the four corners of the hangar to be refueled and re-armed. Having a single trapeze raised two problems: it limited the rate at which airplanes could be launched and recovered and any fault in the trapeze would leave any airborne scouts with nowhere to land. The solution was a second, fixed trapeze permanently rigged further aft along the bottom of the ship at station 102.5 and known as the &#x27;perch&#x27;. By 1933 a perch was fitted and in use. Three more perches were planned (at stations 57.5, 80 and 147.5) but these were never fitted.

&quot;Akron&quot; revived an idea used, and eventually rejected, by the German Navy zeppelins during World War I: the &quot;spähkorb&quot; or &#x27;spy basket&#x27;. The &quot;angel basket&quot; or &quot;sub-cloud observation car&quot;, allowed the airship to remain hidden in a cloud layer, while still observing the enemy below. The small car, rather like an airplane fuselage without wings, could be lowered on a 1000 foot long cable. The observer on board communicated with the ship by telephone. In practice, the device was unstable, almost looping over the airship during its only test flight.

During the design stage, in 1929, the navy requested an alteration to the fins. It was considered desirable for the bottom of the lower fin to be visible from the control car. Charles E. Rosendahl had witnessed, from the control room, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; almost snagging her fin on high-tension power lines during her heavy take off into an unsuspected but very marked temperature inversion from Mines Field, Los Angeles at the start of the last leg of her round-the-world flight earlier that year. The design change would also allow direct vision between the main control car and the emergency control position in the lower fin. The control car was moved aft and all the fins were shortened and deepened. The leading edge root of the fins no longer coincided with a main (deep) ring and instead the foremost attachment was now to an intermediate ring at frame 28.75. This achieved the required visibility, improved low-speed controllability, due to the increased span of the control surfaces, and simplified stress calculations, by reducing the number of fin attachment points. The designers and the navy&#x27;s inspectors, led by the very experienced Charles P Burgess, were entirely satisfied with the revised stress calculations. However, this alteration has been the subject of much criticism as an &quot;inherent defect&quot; in the design and is often alleged to have been a major factor in the loss of &quot;Akron&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Macon&quot;. Construction for both ships amounted to $8,800,000 (in 1931 dollars) with the &quot;Akron&quot; accounting $5,538,400 of the total.

==Construction and commissioning==
Construction of &quot;ZRS-4&quot; was begun on 31 October 1929 at the Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Ohio by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation. Because it was larger than any airship previously built in the US, a special hangar was constructed. Chief Designer Karl Arnstein and a team of experienced German airship engineers instructed and supported design and construction of both U.S. Navy airships USS &quot;Akron&quot; and USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

On 7 November 1929, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, the Chief of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics, drove the &quot;golden rivet&quot; into the main ring of &quot;ZRS4&quot;. Erection of the sections began in March 1930. Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams chose the name &quot;Akron&quot; (for the city near where it was being built), and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ernest Lee Jahncke announced it in May 1930.

On 8 August 1931, &quot;Akron&quot; was launched (floated free of the hangar floor) and christened by First Lady Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of the President of the United States, Herbert Clark Hoover. The maiden flight of &quot;Akron&quot; took place around Cleveland on the afternoon of 23 September with Secretary of the Navy Adams and Rear Admiral Moffett on board. The airship made ten trial flights, including a journey over a period of 48 hours to St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. On 21 October, &quot;Akron&quot; left the Goodyear Zeppelin Air Dock for the Lakehurst Naval Air Station (NAS), with Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Rosendahl in command, arriving the next day. On Navy Day, 27 October 1931, the &quot;Akron&quot; was commissioned as a Navy vessel.

==History of service==
===Maiden voyage===
On 2 November 1931, &quot;Akron&quot; departed on her first cruise down the eastern seaboard to Washington, D.C. On 3 November the &quot;Akron&quot; took to the air with 207 persons on board. This demonstration was to prove that in an emergency airships could provide limited but high speed airlift of troops to outlying possessions. Over the weeks that followed, some 300 hours aloft were logged in a series of flights, including a 46-hour endurance flight to Mobile, Alabama, and back. The return leg of the trip was made via the valleys of the Mississippi River and the Ohio River.

===Participation in a search exercise (January 1932)===
On the morning of 9 January 1932, &quot;Akron&quot; departed from Lakehurst to work with the Scouting Fleet on a search exercise. Proceeding to the coast of North Carolina, &quot;Akron&quot; headed out over the Atlantic where it was assigned to find a group of destroyers bound for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Once these were located, the airship was to shadow them and report their movements. Leaving the coast of North Carolina at about 7:21 on the morning of 10 January, the airship proceeded south, but bad weather prevented sighting the destroyers (contact with them was missed at 12:40 EST, although their crews had sighted &quot;Akron&quot;) and eventually shaped a course toward the Bahamas by late afternoon. Heading northwesterly into the night, &quot;Akron&quot; then changed course shortly before midnight and proceeded to the southeast. Ultimately, at 9:08 am on 11 January, the airship succeeded in spotting the light cruiser and 12 destroyers, positively identifying them on the eastern horizon two minutes later. Sighting a second group of destroyers shortly thereafter, &quot;Akron&quot; was released from the evaluation about 10:00 a.m., having achieved a &quot;qualified success&quot; in the initial test with the Scouting Fleet, but the performance could have been better with radio detection finding equipment, and scout planes.

As the U.S. naval aviation historian Richard K. Smith wrote in his definitive study, &quot;The Airships Akron &amp; Macon: Flying Aircraft Carriers of the United States Navy&quot;, with &quot;consideration given to the weather, duration of flight, a track of more than flown, her material deficiencies, and the rudimentary character of aerial navigation at that date, the &quot;Akron&quot; performance was remarkable. There was not a military airplane in the world in 1932 which could have given the same performance, operating from the same base.&quot;

===First accident (February 1932)===
&quot;Akron&quot; was to have taken part in Fleet Problem XIII, but an accident at Lakehurst on 22 February 1932 prevented her participation. While the airship was being taken from her hangar, the tail came loose from her moorings, was caught by the wind, and struck the ground. The heaviest damage was confined to the lower fin area, which required repair. Also, ground handling fittings had been torn from the main frame, necessitating further repairs. &quot;Akron&quot; was not certified as airworthy again until later in the spring. Her next operation took place on 28 April, when it made a nine-hour flight with Rear Admiral Moffett and Secretary of the Navy Adams aboard.

As a result of this accident, a turntable with a walking beam on tracks powered by electric mine locomotives was developed to secure the tail and turn the ship even in high winds so that it could be pulled into the massive hangar at Lakehurst.

===Testing of the &quot;spy basket&quot;===
Soon after returning to Lakehurst to disembark her distinguished passengers, &quot;Akron&quot; took off again to conduct a test of the &quot;spy basket&quot;—something like a small airplane fuselage suspended beneath the airship that would enable an observer to serve as the ship&#x27;s &quot;eyes&quot; below the clouds while the ship herself remained out of sight above them. The first time the basket was tried (with sandbags aboard instead of a man), it oscillated so violently that it put the whole ship in danger. The basket proved &quot;frighteningly unstable&quot;, swooping from one side of the airship to the other before the startled gaze of &quot;Akron&quot;″s officers and men and reaching as high as the ship&#x27;s equator. Though it was later improved by adding a ventral stabilizing fin, the spybasket was never used again.

===Experimental use as a &quot;flying aircraft carrier&quot;===
&quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Macon&quot; (which was still under construction) were regarded as potential &quot;flying aircraft carriers&quot;, carrying parasite fighters for reconnaissance. On 3 May 1932, &quot;Akron&quot; cruised over the coast of New Jersey with Rear Admiral George C. Day, and the Board of Inspection and Survey, on board, and for the first time tested the &quot;trapeze&quot; installation for in-flight handling of aircraft. The aviators who carried out those historic &quot;landings&quot;—first with a Consolidated N2Y trainer and then with the prototype Curtiss XF9C-1 Sparrowhawk—were Lieutenant D. Ward Harrigan and Lieutenant Howard L. Young. The following day, &quot;Akron&quot; carried out another demonstration flight, this time with members of the House Committee on Naval Affairs on board; this time, Lieutenants Harrigan and Young gave the lawmakers a demonstration of &quot;Akron&quot;″s aircraft hook-on ability.

===&quot;Coast-to-coast&quot; flight and second accident (May 1932)===
Following the conclusion of those trial flights, &quot;Akron&quot; departed from Lakehurst, New Jersey on 8 May 1932, for the American west coast. The airship proceeded down the eastern seaboard to Georgia and then across the southern gulf states, continuing over Texas and Arizona. En route to Sunnyvale, California, &quot;Akron&quot; reached Camp Kearny in San Diego on the morning of 11 May and attempted to moor. Since neither trained ground handlers nor specialized mooring equipment were present, the landing at Camp Kearny was fraught with danger. By the time the crew started the evaluation, the helium gas had been warmed by sunlight, increasing lift. Lightened by , the amount of fuel spent during the transcontinental trip, &quot;Akron&quot; was now uncontrollably light.
The mooring cable was cut to avert a catastrophic nose-stand by the errant airship which floated upwards. Most of the mooring crew—predominantly &quot;boot&quot; seamen from the Naval Training Station San Diego—released their lines although four did not. One let go at about and suffered a broken arm while the three others were carried further aloft. Of these, Aviation Carpenter&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class Robert H. Edsall and Apprentice Seaman Nigel M. Henton soon plunged to their deaths while Apprentice Seaman C. M. &quot;Bud&quot; Cowart held on to his line and then secured himself to it before being hoisted on board the airship an hour later. &quot;Akron&quot; moored at Camp Kearny later that day before proceeding to Sunnyvale, California. Footage from the accident appears in the film &quot;Encounters with Disaster&quot;, released in 1979 and produced by Sun Classic Pictures.

===West Coast flights===
Over the weeks that followed, &quot;Akron&quot; &quot;showed the flag&quot; on the West Coast of the United States, ranging as far north as the Canada–US border before returning south in time to exercise once more with the Scouting Fleet. Serving as part of the &quot;Green Force&quot;, the &quot;Akron&quot; attempted to locate the &quot;White Force&quot;. Although opposed by Vought O2U Corsair floatplanes from &quot;enemy&quot; warships, the airship located the opposing forces in just 22 hours, a fact not lost upon some of the participants in the exercise in subsequent critiques.

In need of repairs, &quot;Akron&quot; departed from Sunnyvale on 11 June 1932 bound for Lakehurst, New Jersey, on a return trip that was sprinkled with difficulties, mostly because of unfavorable weather, and having to fly at pressure height while crossing the mountains. &quot;Akron&quot; arrived on 15 June after a &quot;long and sometimes harrowing&quot; aerial voyage.

&quot;Akron&quot; next underwent a period of voyage repairs before taking part in July in a search for &quot;Curlew&quot;, a yacht which had failed to reach port at the end of a race to the island of Bermuda. The yacht was later discovered safe off Nantucket. It then resumed operations capturing aircraft on the &quot;trapeze&quot; equipment. Admiral Moffett again boarded &quot;Akron&quot; on 20 July, but the next day left the airship in one of her N2Y-1s which took him back to Lakehurst after a severe storm had delayed the airship&#x27;s own return to base.

===Further tests as &quot;flying aircraft carrier&quot;===
&quot;Akron&quot; entered a new phase of her career that summer of 1932, engaging in intense experimentation with the revolutionary &quot;trapeze&quot; and a full complement of F9C-2s. A key element of the entrance into that new phase was a new commanding officer, Commander Alger Dresel.

===Third accident (August 1932)===
Another accident hampered training on 22 August when &quot;Akron&quot;″s tail fin became fouled by a beam in Lakehurst&#x27;s massive Hangar No 1 after a premature order to commence towing the ship out of the mooring circle. Nevertheless, rapid repairs enabled eight more flights over the Atlantic during the last three months of 1932. These operations involved intensive work with the trapeze and the F9C-2s, as well as the drilling of lookouts and gun crews.

Among the tasks undertaken were the maintenance of two aircraft patrolling and scouting on &quot;Akron&quot;″s flanks. During a seven-hour period on 18 November 1932, the airship and a trio of planes searched a sector 100 mi wide.

===Return to the fleet===
After local operations out of Lakehurst for the remainder of 1932, &quot;Akron&quot; was ready to resume operations with the fleet. On the afternoon of 3 January 1933, Commander Frank C. McCord relieved Commander Dresel as commanding officer, the latter becoming the first commanding officer of &quot;Akron&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Macon&quot;, whose construction was almost complete. Within hours, &quot;Akron&quot; headed south down the eastern seaboard toward Florida where, after refueling at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Opa-locka, Florida, near Miami, the next day proceeded to Guantánamo Bay for an inspection of base sites. At this time the N2Y-1s were used to provide aerial &quot;taxi&quot; service to ferry members of the inspection party back and forth.

Soon thereafter, &quot;Akron&quot; returned to Lakehurst for local operations which were interrupted by a two-week overhaul and poor weather. In March, it carried out intensive training with an aviation unit of F9C-2s, honing hook-on skills. During the course of these operations, an overfly of Washington DC was made 4 March 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt first took the oath of office as President of the United States.

On 11 March, &quot;Akron&quot; departed Lakehurst bound for Panama stopping briefly &quot;en route&quot; at Opa-locka before proceeding on to Balboa where an inspection party looked over a potential air base site. While returning northward, the airship paused at Opa-locka again for local operations exercising gun crews, with the N2Y-1s serving as targets, before getting underway for Lakehurst on 22 March.

==Loss==

On the evening of 3 April 1933, &quot;Akron&quot; cast off from the mooring mast to operate along the coast of New England, assisting in the calibration of radio direction finder stations. Rear Admiral Moffett was again on board along with his aide, Commander Henry Barton Cecil, Commander Fred T. Berry, the commanding officer of NAS Lakehurst, and Lieutenant Colonel Alfred F. Masury, U.S. Army Reserve, a guest of the admiral, the vice-president of Mack Trucks, and a strong proponent of the potential civilian uses of rigid airships.

After casting off at 19:28, &quot;Akron&quot; soon encountered fog and then severe weather, which did not improve when the airship passed over Barnegat Light, New Jersey, at 22:00. According to Richard K. Smith, &quot;[u]nknown to the men on board the &quot;Akron&quot;, they were flying ahead of one of the most violent stormfronts to sweep the North Atlantic States in ten years. It would soon envelop them.&quot; Enveloped in fog, increased lightning and heavy rain, it became extremely turbulent at 00:15. The &quot;Akron&quot; began a rapid nose-down descent, reaching while still falling. Ballast was dumped, which stabilized the ship at , and climbed back to its cruising altitude. Then a second violent descent sent the &quot;Akron&quot; downwards at . &quot;Landing stations&quot; alerted the crew, as the ship descended tail-down. The lower fin struck the sea, water entered the fin, and the stern was dragged under. The engines pulled the ship into a nose-high attitude, then the &quot;Akron&quot; stalled, and crashed into the sea.
&quot;Akron&quot; broke up rapidly and sank in the stormy Atlantic. The crew of the nearby German merchant ship &quot;Phoebus&quot; saw lights descending toward the ocean at about 00:23 and altered course to starboard to investigate, with her captain believing that he was witnessing an airplane crash. At 00:55, executive officer Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley was pulled from the water while the ship&#x27;s boat picked up three more men: Chief Radioman Robert W. Copeland, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Second Class Richard E. Deal, and Aviation Metalsmith Second Class Moody E. Erwin. Despite artificial respiration, Copeland never regained consciousness, and he died aboard &quot;Phoebus&quot;.
Although the German sailors spotted four or five other men in the water, they did not know their ship had chanced upon the crash of &quot;Akron&quot; until Lt. Commander Wiley regained consciousness half an hour after being rescued. The crew of &quot;Phoebus&quot; combed the ocean in boats for over five hours in a fruitless search for more survivors. The Navy blimp &quot;J-3&quot;—sent out to join the search—also crashed, with the loss of two men.

The U.S. Coast Guard cutter —the first American vessel on the scene—arrived at 06:00, taking the airship&#x27;s survivors and the body of Copeland on board. Among the other ships combing the area for survivors were the heavy cruiser , the destroyer , the Coast Guard cutter , and the Coast Guard destroyers and , as well as two Coast Guard aircraft. The fishing vessel &quot;Grace F&quot; from Gloucester, Massachusetts, also assisted in the search, using her seining gear in an effort to recover bodies.
Most casualties had been caused by drowning and hypothermia, since the crew had not been issued life jackets, and there had not been time to deploy the single life raft. The accident left 73 dead, and only three survivors. Wiley, standing next to the two other survivors, gave a brief account on 6 April.

===Aftermath of loss===
&quot;Akron&quot;″s loss spelled the beginning of the end for the rigid airship in the U.S. Navy, especially since one of her leading proponents, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, was among the dead. President Roosevelt said, &quot;The loss of the &quot;Akron&quot; with her crew of gallant officers and men is a national disaster. I grieve with the Nation and especially with the wives and families of the men who were lost. Ships can be replaced, but the Nation can ill afford to lose such men as Rear Admiral William A. Moffett and his shipmates who died with him upholding to the end the finest traditions of the United States Navy.&quot; The loss of the &quot;Akron&quot; was the largest loss of life in any airship crash.

&quot;Macon&quot; and other airships received life jackets to avert a repetition of this tragedy. When &quot;Macon&quot; was damaged in a storm in 1935 and subsequently sank after landing in the sea, 70 of the 72 crew were saved.

The songwriter Bob Miller wrote and recorded a song, &quot;The Crash of the Akron&quot;, within one day of the disaster.

In 2003, the U.S. submarine surveyed the wreck site and performed sonar imaging of the &quot;Akron&quot;&#x27;s girders.

==Assessment==

For numerous reasons, in the opinion of Richard K. Smith, &quot;Akron&quot; never got the chance to show what it was capable of. Initially, the idea had been to use her as a scout for the fleet, just as the German Navy zeppelins had been used during World War I, with her airplanes being simply useful auxiliaries capable of extending her range of vision or of defending her against attacking enemy aircraft. Gradually, in the minds of the more forward-thinking officers familiar with airship and scouting fleet operations, that was reversed, it and &quot;Macon&quot; came to be regarded as aircraft carriers, whose sole job was to get the scouting airplanes to the search area and then to support them in their flights. The mothership herself should stay in the background, out of sight of enemy surface units, and act merely as a mobile advanced base for the airplanes, which should do all of the actual searching. Any aircraft carrier could do that, but only an airship could do it so quickly since her speed was at least twice that of a surface ship, enabling her to get to the scene or be switched from flank to flank quickly. However, it was an experimental ship, a prototype, and it took time for the doctrine and suitable tactics to evolve. It also took time to develop the techniques of navigating, controlling, and coordinating the scouts. At first, developments were hampered by inadequate radio equipment, as well as the difficulties encountered by the scout pilots in navigating, scouting, and communicating from their cramped open cockpits.

Some politicians, some senior officers, and some sections of the press seemed predisposed to judge the airship experiment a failure without regard to the evidence. Even within the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics, many opposed spending so much on a single asset. Smith also asserts that political pressure inside and outside the navy led to the ship being pushed too early to attempt too much. Little allowance seems to have been made for the fact that this was a prototype, an experimental system, and that tactics for her use were being developed &quot;on the hoof.&quot; As a result, the airship&#x27;s performance in fleet exercises was not all that some had hoped and gave an exaggerated impression of the ship&#x27;s vulnerability and failed to demonstrate her strengths.

<doc id="60948" wikidata="Q408536" url="?curid=60948" title="Airdrie, North Lanarkshire">
<text>Airdrie (; ; ) is a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It lies on a plateau 400 ft (130 m) above sea level, 12 miles (19 km) east of Glasgow. , it had a population of 37,130.

Airdrie developed as a market town in the late 17th century following an act of Parliament allowing it to hold a weekly market. It later grew in prominence as a centre for weaving and manufacturing, as well as being the settlement near several coalmines. In the mid 19th century, the town expanded greatly as a result of immigration and the development of iron works and railway links. The first public library in Scotland was established in Airdrie in 1853.
During the 20th century, industrial decline took place in Airdrie, with heavy industry closing down across much of the town. In the 21st century, Airdrie has continued as a regional centre for services and retail, as well as being a commuter settlement within the Central Belt. Historically part of Lanarkshire, Airdrie forms a conurbation with its neighbour Coatbridge, in what was formerly the Monklands district, with a population of approximately 90,000.

==Name==
Airdrie&#x27;s name first appeared in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland (Latin: &quot;Registrum Magni Sigilii Regum Scotorum&quot;) in 1373 as &#x27;Ardre&#x27;. By 1546 it had become &#x27;Ardry&#x27; and by 1587 it was known as &#x27;Ardrie&#x27;. In 1630 it finally appeared in the Register as &#x27;Airdrie&#x27;. Given the topography of the area, the most likely interpretation is that the name derives from the Gaelic &quot;An Àrd Ruigh&quot; meaning &#x27;a level height&#x27; or &#x27;high pasture land&#x27;. Another possibility is from the Gaelic &quot;An Àrd Àirighe&quot; meaning &#x27;a sheiling, a summer pasture/shepherd&#x27;s hut&#x27;. A third possibility is the Gaelic &quot;Ard Reidh&quot; meaning &#x27;a high plain&#x27;. A further, non-Gaelic alternative is the Brythonic, i.e. Cumbric or North Welsh, &quot;ard tref&quot; (becoming ardre by process of assimilation), meaning &#x27;a high steading or farmstead&#x27;, which would date back to the times of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, before the expansion of Gaelic or English speech into the region. Airthrey Castle in Stirlingshire may have a similar derivation.

==History==

===Early history===

There is no evidence to support the claim (George Chalmers, Caledonia) that Airdrie is the site of the ancient battle of Arderyth. Under the patronage of King Malcolm IV of Scotland Cistercian monks established an abbey at Melrose in 1136. Five years later a daughter house was founded at Newbattle Abbey in Lothian. In 1160, Malcolm granted lands in central Scotland to the monks of Newbattle. These became known as the &quot;Munklands&quot; (Register of the Great Seal 1323).

Malcolm&#x27;s Charter constitutes the oldest documentary record of place-names in the Monklands. The area of land granted by the Charter is clearly defined by direct reference to geographical and topographical features thus: &quot;Dunpeldre by its right boundaries, namely with Metheraugh and Mayeuth and Clarnephin as far as Dunduffes in the east.&quot; The name &quot;Dunpeldre&quot; is found in the modern name Drumpellier, &quot;Metheraugh&quot; is Medrox; &quot;Mayeuth&quot; is Myvot and &quot;Clarnephin&quot; refers to the North Calder Water in the east of the parish (from old Brittonic name &quot;claur n afon&quot; meaning plain of the river). &quot;Dunduffes&quot; has become directly translated into the modern Black Hill which, as the Charter states, lies at the eastern extremity of the parish. The Charter does not mention anything resembling Airdrie, although this is where Airdrie is located.

Airdrie owes its existence to its location on the &#x27;Hogs Back&#x27; – a ridge of land running from east to west. One very important aspect of the town&#x27;s history was the Cistercian monks of Newbattle Abbey, which is why the area is called the Monklands. The monks were farmers and some of their place names survive, e.g., Ryefield and Whifflet (the wheat flats). Much of the land they used is known today as &#x27;The Four Isles&#x27; (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands): Mull, Islay, Iona and Luing in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie. The monks of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a farm grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a court house at Kipps, a chapel in the area of Chapelhall and a number of corn mills. The Monks were also expert in the construction of roads. In the 12th century, they established the original Glasgow to Edinburgh road via Airdrie and Bathgate, to link up with their lands in Newbattle in East Lothian.
Definitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old monks&#x27; road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring Coatbridge), Airdrie House (now the site of Monklands Hospital), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig Street, Flowerhill Street and Colliertree Road. The first houses in Airdrie were built along this road. Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of inhabitants was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area. A large contingent of Airdrieonians fought at the Battle of Bothwell Brig during the Covenanter Rebellion of 1679; their banner can still be viewed at the local library.
A significant event in Airdrie&#x27;s history was the 1695 passing of a special act of Parliament, the &quot;&quot;&#x27; (c. 94) in the Scottish Parliament allowing Robert Hamilton of Airdrie to hold four fairs yearly and a weekly market in the town of &#x27;Airdry&#x27;. This helped develop Airdrie from a &#x27;farm town&#x27; into a thriving &#x27;market town&#x27;.

However, Airdrie really came to prominence through its weaving industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and flax was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the burgh. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, coal mining was in progress and around thirty colliers were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century.
Given its large number of weavers, its geographic location and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Airdrie became a major centre of support for the Radical War of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants. At this time, the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a local act of Parliament, the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. lx), Airdrie became a free and independent burgh of barony.

In 1821, the first election of a town council took place and by August it had appointed an assessor, procurator fiscal, master of police and a town crier. Anyone who had paid their 3 guineas was allowed to vote; there is even a record of a John Mackay voting despite being under 10 years old.

In 1824, it was decided to build the Airdrie Town House, originally designed by Alexander Baird and now a local landmark known as the &#x27;town clock&#x27;. In 1832, the Town House was used as a hospital due to the cholera outbreak of this year.

===1850 to 1920===

The enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the Highlands and predominantly Ireland. This followed the Highland potato famine of the mid-1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to heavy industry in the area. Most of the Irish immigrant population were involved with mining and labouring.
This led to an increase in ironwork foundries around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, railway links were established starting in 1826. By 1862, the Airdrie and Bathgate Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.

In August the Public Libraries Act (Scotland) 1853 was passed, and in November Airdrie Public Library became the first in Scotland.

The dramatic rise in population and industry prompted the need for more accessible water supplies. Until the mid-1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.

Journalism in Airdrie began with &quot;The Airdrie Literary Album&quot; in 1828. Several local newspapers began appearing around this time notably the Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser in 1855, which is still the most popular local paper today. The prison was legalised in 1859 and had 51 cells.

Airdrie Working Men&#x27;s Club was established in 1869. Also around this time, football and cricket began to emerge as popular sports. Following the codification of association football rules a local team called Excelsior was formed in 1878 which would later be renamed Airdrieonians. Horse race meetings were also held in the town (1851–1870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877.

Education posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. In the early 1830s there were about 800 pupils while the town had about 7,000 residents. Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until an act of Parliament of 1889 relieved some of the infant classes in schools of this burden. Airdrie Academy was built in 1849 and by 1919 all school boards were dissolved and Lanarkshire Education Authority took over responsibility for education throughout Lanarkshire.

Airdrie Public Observatory, one of only four public observatories in the UK (second oldest and smallest) – all in Scotland, was founded in the first library building in 1896, and is still operated in the present building by the Airdrie Astronomical Association a Scottish astronautic and astronomy society and registered charity.

By the turn of the 20th century variety shows were becoming popular in the area and by 1911 the Pavilion in Graham Street was built which after initially being used as a music hall started showing cinematographic pictures. Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 and finally closed in 1970. The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but it too has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following an offer of £10,000 from Sir John Wilson).

On 9 July 1918 nineteen miners died in the Stanrigg Pit Disaster. The pit was situated in boggy land and collapsed after being saturated by heavy rainfall.

===1920 onwards===

At the end of the First World War, Airdrie was hard hit with many casualties from the war. Unemployment reached 30% in the local area. After years of moving from one site to another, the first purpose built library in Airdrie was opened in Anderson Street in 1895. However, this only lasted 30 years until the current Airdrie Library building was erected in 1925.
Conditions in the town did not really improve until well after the Second World War but in 1949 the Boots pharmaceutical company and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 Pye opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time (Newhouse, Chapelhall, and Brownsburn). The Airdrie Arts Centre opened in 1967 in the former Airdrie Library building, and was a popular venue for concerts and plays, but was closed in 2012 by North Lanarkshire Council.

Between 1964 and 1991, the town was the location of a Royal Observer Corps monitoring bunker, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. No trace remains today.
The 1970s saw the opening of Monklands Hospital, which replaced an older hospital on the Airdrie House estate. Airdrie hosted the National Mòd in 1993.

In the 21st century, the town has continued to grow as a residential settlement, with development and conversion of some town centre buildings, such as the Historic Orrs Department Store into new homes. In 2024, permission was given for a significant expansion of the town, with the creation of up to 3,000 new homes in East Airdrie on former mining land.

==Governance==
Airdrie is represented by several tiers of elected government. North Lanarkshire Council, the unitary local authority for Airdrie, is based at Motherwell, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

===Westminster===
The town forms part of the burgh constituency of Airdrie and Shotts, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. In 2005, changes to the constituency boundaries saw part of its area transferred to Motherwell and Wishaw, offset by the addition of part of Hamilton North and Bellshill.

The location has been represented by several prominent Labour MPs in recent years:
*John Smith, MP for North Lanarkshire 1970–1983 and Monklands East 1983–1994 (Eastern Coatbridge and Airdrie area). Former Shadow Chancellor and then leader of the Labour Party until his untimely death in 1994.
*Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East 1994–1997, Airdrie and Shotts 1997–2005, Secretary of State for Scotland and subsequently Britain&#x27;s High Commissioner to Australia.
*John Reid, MP for Airdrie and Shotts 2005–2010, a high-profile minister including as the first Roman Catholic to be appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The current MP for the constituency is the Scottish National Party&#x27;s Anum Qaisar.

===Scottish Parliament===
For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Airdrie forms part of the Airdrie and Shotts constituency. This has slightly different boundaries from those of the UK Parliament constituency of the same name. The current Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Airdrie and Shotts is Neil Grey MSP (Scottish National Party), who won this seat in 2021.

In addition to this, Airdrie is represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region.

===European Parliament===
Before Brexit, it was part of the Scotland European Parliament constituency.

===Local government===
Up until 1975, Airdrie had its own Burgh Council. Between 1975 and 1996, Airdrie came under Monklands District Council operating in conjunction with Strathclyde Regional Council. Monklands District Council was headquartered in the Coatbridge Municipal Building. Many Airdrieonians felt short-changed by MDC&#x27;s actions and a significant political scandal known as Monklandsgate greatly tarnished the council&#x27;s reputation. After 1996, it came under the authority of the unitary North Lanarkshire Council. North Lanarkshire has many councillors; currently, the council is in control of the Labour group and the leader of the council is Jim Logue, councillor for Airdrie Central.

==Geography==
===Satellite villages===

==Economy==

===Overview===

As outlined in the history section, Airdrie&#x27;s traditional economic activities of weaving, coal mining, and heavy industry have ceased to exist. Although the Glenflagler Distillery is now closed, the town still retains a strong involvement in the whisky industry. Airdrie was also home to a Crimpy Crisps factory. Given its location near to Glasgow and other commercial or industrial areas, Airdrie might now be considered something of a commuter town. In fact, housing construction in Airdrie has been very prominent in recent years, with builders developing a number of brownfield sites following the closure of various factories such as Boots (who closed their factory in 2004). Nonetheless, it does retain significant economic activity.

<text>Cardamom (), sometimes cardamon or cardamum, is a spice made from the seeds of several plants in the genera &quot;Elettaria&quot; and &quot;Amomum&quot; in the family Zingiberaceae. Both genera are native to the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia. They are recognized by their small seed pods: triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery outer shell and small, black seeds; &quot;Elettaria&quot; pods are light green and smaller, while &quot;Amomum&quot; pods are larger and dark brown.

Species used for cardamom are native throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. The first references to cardamom are found in Sumer, and in Ayurveda. In the 21st century, it is cultivated mainly in India, Indonesia, and Guatemala. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cardamom&quot; is derived from the Latin , as a Latinisation of the Greek (), a compound of (, &quot;cress&quot;) and (), of unknown origin.

The earliest attested form of the word signifying &quot;cress&quot; is the Mycenaean Greek , written in Linear B syllabic script, in the list of flavorings on the spice tablets found among palace archives in the House of the Sphinxes in Mycenae.

The modern genus name &quot;Elettaria&quot; is derived from the root attested in Dravidian languages.

==Types and distribution==
The two main types of cardamom are:
* True or green cardamom (or white cardamom when bleached) comes from the species &quot;Elettaria cardamomum&quot; and is distributed from India to Malaysia.
* Black cardamom, also known as brown, greater, large, longer, or Nepal cardamom, comes from the species &quot;Amomum subulatum&quot; and is native to the eastern Himalayas and mostly cultivated in Eastern Nepal, Sikkim, and parts of Darjeeling district in West Bengal of India, and southern Bhutan.

Other related culinary plants known as cardamom are

* Siam cardamom, &quot;Wurfbania vera&quot;, often referred to as white cardamon.
* Ethiopian cardamom, &quot;Aframomum corrorima&quot;.
* Tavoy cardamom, &quot;Wurfbainia villosa&quot; var. &quot;xanthioides&quot;
* red cardamom, &quot;Lanxangia tsao-ko&quot;
* round or Java cardamom, &quot;Wurfbainia compacta&quot;

== Uses ==
Both forms of cardamom are used as flavorings and cooking spices in both food and drink. &quot;E. cardamomum&quot; (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a , or is smoked. 

===Food and beverage===
Cardamom has a strong taste, with an aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a more smoky – though not bitter – aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint.

Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight, but little is needed to impart flavor. It is best stored in the pod, as exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavor. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals teaspoons (7.4 ml) of ground cardamom.

Cardamom is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in baking in the Nordic countries, in particular in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Yule bread , the Swedish sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread . In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, and as a traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a , and cooked together in a skillet, a , over wood or gas, to produce mixtures with up to 40% cardamom.

In Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savoury dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in such spice mixes as Indian and Nepali masalas and Thai curry pastes. Green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in &quot;masala chai&quot; (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant Wrigley; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains &quot;cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors&quot;. It is also included in aromatic bitters, gin, and herbal teas.

In Korea, Tavoy cardamom (&quot;Wurfbainia villosa&quot; var. &quot;xanthioides&quot;) and red cardamom (&quot;Lanxangia tsao-ko&quot;) are used in tea called .

===Composition===
The essential oil content of cardamom seeds depends on storage conditions and may be as high as 8%. The oil is typically 45% α-terpineol, 27% myrcene, 8% limonene, 6% menthone, 3% β-phellandrene, 2% 1,8-cineol, 2% sabinene and 2% heptane. Other sources report the following contents: 1,8-cineol (20 to 50%), α-terpenylacetate (30%), sabinene, limonene (2 to 14%), and borneol.

In the seeds of round cardamom from Java (&quot;Wurfbainia compacta&quot;), the content of essential oil is lower (2 to 4%), and the oil contains mainly 1,8-cineol (up to 70%) plus β-pinene (16%); furthermore, α-pinene, α-terpineol and humulene are found.

==Production==

In 2022, world production of cardamom (included with nutmeg and mace for reporting to the United Nations) was 138,888 tonnes, led by India, Indonesia and Guatemala, which together accounted for 85% of the total (table).
=== Production practices ===
According to Nair (2011), in the years when India achieves a good crop, it is still less productive than Guatemala. Other notable producers include Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Much production of cardamom in India is cultivated on private property or in areas the government leases out to farmers. Traditionally, small plots of land within the forests (called &quot;eld-kandies&quot;) where the wild or acclimatised plant existed are cleared during February and March. Brushwood is cut and burned, and the roots of powerful weeds are torn up to free the soil. Soon after clearing, cardamom plants spring up. After two years the cardamom plants may have eight-to-ten leaves and reach in height. In the third year, they may be in height. In the following May or June the ground is again weeded, and by September to November a light crop is obtained. In the fourth year, weeding again occurs, and if the cardamoms grow less than apart a few are transplanted to new positions. The plants bear for three or four years; and historically the life of each plantation was about eight or nine years. In Malabar the seasons run a little later than in Mysore, and – according to some reports – a full crop may be obtained in the third year. Cardamoms grown above elevation are considered to be of higher quality than those grown below that altitude.

Plants may be raised from seed or by division of the rhizome. In about a year, the seedlings reach about in length, and are ready for transplantation. The flowering season is April to May, and after swelling in August and September, by the first half of October usually attain the desired degree of ripening. The crop is accordingly gathered in October and November, and in exceptionally moist weather, the harvest protracts into December. At the time of harvesting, the scapes or shoots bearing the clusters of fruits are broken off close to the stems and placed in baskets lined with fresh leaves. The fruits are spread out on carefully prepared floors, sometimes covered with mats, and are then exposed to the sun. Four or five days of careful drying and bleaching in the sun is usually enough. In rainy weather, drying with artificial heat is necessary, though the fruits suffer greatly in colour; they are consequently sometimes bleached with steam and sulphurous vapour or with ritha nuts.

The industry is highly labour-intensive, each hectare requiring considerable maintenance throughout the year. Production constraints include recurring climate vagaries, the absence of regular re-plantation, and ecological conditions associated with deforestation.

=== Cultivation ===
In 1873 and 1874, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) exported about each year. In 1877, Ceylon exported , in 1879, , and in the 1881–82 season, In 1903, of cardamom growing areas were owned by European planters. The produce of the Travancore plantations was given as , or just a little under that of Ceylon. The yield of the Mysore plantations was approximately , and the cultivation was mainly in Kadur district. The volume for 1903–04 stated the value of the cardamoms exported to have been Rs. 3,37,000 as compared with Rs. 4,16,000 the previous year. India, which ranks second in world production, recorded a decline of 6.7 percent in cardamom production for 2012–13, and projected a production decline of 30–40% in 2013–14, compared with the previous year due to unfavorable weather. In India, the state of Kerala is by far the most productive producer, with the districts of Idukki, Palakkad and Wynad being the principal producing areas. Given that a number of bureaucrats have personal interests in the industry, in India, several organisations have been set up to protect cardamom producers such as the Cardamom Growers Association (est. 1992) and the Kerala Cardamom Growers Association (est. 1974). Research in India&#x27;s cardamom plantations began in the 1970s while Kizhekethil Chandy held the office of Chairman of the Cardamom Board. The Kerala Land Reforms Act imposed restrictions on the size of certain agricultural holdings per household to the benefit of cardamom producers.

In 1979–1980, Guatemala surpassed India in worldwide production. Guatemala cultivates &quot;Elettaria cardamomum&quot;, which is native to the Malabar Coast of India. Alta Verapaz Department produces 70 percent of Guatemala&#x27;s cardamom. Cardamom was introduced to Guatemala before World War I by the German coffee planter Oscar Majus Kloeffer. After World War II, production was increased to 13,000 to 14,000 tons annually.

The average annual income for a plantation-owning household in 1998 was US$3,408. Although the typical harvest requires over 210 days of labor per year, most cardamom farmers are better off than many other agricultural workers, and there are a significant number of those from the upper strata of society involved in the cultivation process. Increased demand since the 1980s, principally from China, for both &quot;Wurfbainia villosa&quot; and &quot;Lanxangia tsao-ko&quot;, has provided a key source of income for poor farmers living at higher altitudes in localized areas of China, Laos, and Vietnam, people typically isolated from many other markets. Laos exports about 400 tonnes annually through Thailand according to the FAO.

=== Trade ===
Cardamom production&#x27;s demand and supply patterns of trade are influenced by price movements, nationally and internationally, in 5 to 6-year cycles. Importing leaders mentioned are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, while other significant importers include Germany, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the former USSR. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 80 percent of cardamom&#x27;s total consumption occurs in the Middle East.

In the 19th century, Bombay and Madras were among the principal distributing ports of cardamom. India&#x27;s exports to foreign countries increased during the early 20th century, particularly to the United Kingdom, followed by Arabia, Aden, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Persia and Egypt. However, some 95% of cardamom produced in India is for domestic purposes, and India is itself by far the most important consuming country for cardamoms in the world. India also imports cardamom from Sri Lanka. In 1903–1904, these imports came to , valued at Rs. 1,98,710. In contrast, Guatemala&#x27;s local consumption is negligible, which supports the exportation of most of the cardamom that is produced. In the mid-1800s, Ceylon&#x27;s cardamom was chiefly imported by Canada. After saffron and vanilla, cardamom is currently the third most expensive spice, and is used as a spice and flavouring for food and liqueurs.

== History ==
Cardamom has been used in flavorings and food over centuries. During the Middle Ages, cardamom dominated the trade industry. The Arab states played a significant role in the trade of Indian spices, including cardamom. It is now ranked the third most expensive spice following saffron and vanilla.

Cardamom production began in ancient times, and has been referred to in ancient Sanskrit texts as . The Babylonians and Assyrians used the spice early on, and trade in cardamom opened up along land routes and by the interlinked Persian Gulf route controlled from Dilmun as early as the third millennium BCE Early Bronze Age, into western Asia and the Mediterranean world.

The ancient Greeks thought highly of cardamom, and the Greek physicians Dioscorides and Hippocrates wrote about its therapeutic properties, identifying it as a digestive aid. Due to demand in ancient Greece and Rome, the cardamom trade developed into a handsome luxury business; cardamom was one of the spices eligible for import tax in Alexandria in 126 CE. In medieval times, Venice became the principal importer of cardamom into the west, along with pepper, cloves and cinnamon, which was traded with merchants from the Levant with salt and meat products.

In China, &quot;Amomum&quot; was an important part of the economy during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). In 1150, the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi noted that cardamom was being imported to Aden, in Yemen, from India and China.

The Portuguese became involved in the trade in the 16th century, and the industry gained wide-scale European interest in the 19th century.

<text>Amomum subulatum, also known as black cardamom, hill cardamom, Bengal cardamom, greater cardamom, Indian cardamom, Nepal cardamom, winged cardamom, big cardamon, or brown cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the family Zingiberaceae. Its seed pods have a strong, camphor-like flavour, with a smoky character derived from the method of drying.

==Characteristics==
The pods are used as a spice, in a similar manner to green cardamom pods but with a different flavour. Unlike green cardamom, this spice is rarely used in sweet dishes. Its smoky flavour and aroma derive from traditional methods of drying over open flames.

==Species==
At least two distinct species of black cardamom occur: &quot;Amomum subulatum&quot; (also known as Nepal cardamom) and &quot;Amomum tsao-ko&quot;. The pods of &quot;A. subulatum,&quot; used primarily in the cuisines of India and certain regional cuisines of Pakistan, are the smaller of the two, while the larger pods of &quot;A. tsao-ko&quot; (Chinese: ; pinyin: &quot;cǎoguǒ&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;thảo quả&quot;) are used in Vietnamese cuisine and Chinese cuisine, particularly that of Sichuan province.

==Agricultural production==
The largest producer of black cardamom is Nepal, followed by India and Bhutan.

==Medical use==
In traditional Chinese medicine, black cardamom is used for stomach disorders and malaria. In the traditional medicine of Nepal &amp; India, the decoction of &quot;Amomum subulatum&quot; rhizomes is used in the therapy of jaundice.

<text>Native Son (1940) is a novel written by the American author Richard Wright. It tells the story of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas, a black youth living in utter poverty in a poor area on Chicago&#x27;s South Side in the 1930s. Thomas accidentally kills a white woman at a time when racism is at its peak and he pays the price for it.

While not apologizing for Bigger&#x27;s crimes, Wright portrays a systemic causation behind them. Bigger&#x27;s lawyer, Boris Max, makes the case that there is no escape from this destiny for his client or any other black American, since they are the necessary product of the society that formed them and told them since birth who exactly they were supposed to be.

== Plot summary ==

=== Book One: Fear ===
Twenty-year-old Bigger Thomas lives in one room with his brother Buddy, his sister Vera, and their mother. Suddenly, a rat appears. The room turns into a maelstrom, and after a violent chase, Bigger kills the animal with an iron skillet and terrorizes his sister Vera with the dead rat. She faints, and Mrs. Thomas scolds Bigger, who hates his family because they suffer and he cannot do anything about it.

That evening, Bigger has to see Mr. Dalton, a white man, for a new job. Bigger&#x27;s family depends on him. He would like to leave his responsibilities forever, but when he thinks of what to do, he only sees a blank wall.

Bigger walks to a poolroom and meets his friend, Gus. Bigger tells him that every time he thinks about whites, he feels something terrible will happen to him. They meet other friends, G.H. and Jack, and plan a robbery. They are all afraid of attacking and stealing from a white man, but none of them wants to admit their concerns. Before the robbery, Bigger and Jack go to the movies. They are attracted to the world of wealthy whites in the newsreel and feel strangely moved by the tom-toms and the primitive black people in the film, yet also feel they are equal to those worlds. After the film, Bigger returns to the poolroom and attacks Gus violently, forcing him to lick his blade in a demeaning way to hide Bigger&#x27;s own cowardice. The fight ends any chance of the robbery occurring, and Bigger is vaguely aware that his actions were intentional.

When he finally gets the job, Bigger does not know how to behave in Dalton&#x27;s large, luxurious house. Mr. Dalton and his blind wife use strange words. They try to be kind to the young man, but actually make him uncomfortable; Bigger does not know what they expect of him.

Then their daughter, Mary, enters the room, asks Bigger why he is not in a union, and calls her father a &quot;capitalist&quot;. Bigger does not know the word and becomes even more confused and fearful that he may lose the job. After the conversation, Peggy, an Irish cook, takes Bigger to his room and tells him the Daltons are a nice family, but he must avoid Mary&#x27;s Communist friends. After she leaves, Bigger marvels that he has never had a room of his own before.

That night, he drives Mary around and meets her Communist boyfriend Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan and Mary talk to Bigger, oblige him to take them to a diner where their friends are eating, invite him to sit at their table, and tell him to call them by their first names. Bigger does not know how to respond to their requests and becomes frustrated, as he is simply their chauffeur for the night. At the diner, they buy a bottle of rum, then Bigger drives throughout Washington Park while Jan and Mary drink and make out in the back seat. Jan departs, but Mary is so drunk that Bigger has to carry her to her bedroom when they return home. He is terrified someone will see him with her in his arms; however, he still cannot resist the forbidden temptation and kisses her.

Just then, the bedroom door opens, and Mrs. Dalton enters. Bigger knows she is blind but is terrified she will sense him there. Frightened of the consequences if he, a black man, were to be found in Mary&#x27;s bedroom, he silences Mary by pressing a pillow into her face. Mary claws at Bigger&#x27;s hands while Mrs. Dalton is in the room, trying to alert Bigger that she cannot breathe. Mrs. Dalton approaches the bed, smells alcohol in the air, scolds her daughter, and leaves. As Bigger removes the pillow, he realizes that Mary has suffocated to death. Bigger starts thinking frantically, and decides he will tell everyone that her boyfriend Jan took Mary into the house that night. 

Thinking it will be better if Mary disappears as she was supposed to leave for Detroit in the morning, Bigger decides in desperation to burn her body in the house furnace. Her body initially will not fit through the furnace opening, but after decapitating it, Bigger finally manages to put the corpse inside. He adds extra coal to the furnace, leaves the corpse to burn, and goes home.

=== Book Two: Flight ===
Bigger&#x27;s current girlfriend Bessie Mears suspects him of having done something to Mary. Bigger goes back to work.

Mr. Dalton has hired a private detective, Mr. Britten, who interrogates Bigger accusingly, but Dalton vouches for Bigger. Bigger relates the events of the previous evening in a way calculated to throw suspicion on Jan, knowing Mr. Dalton dislikes Jan because he is a Communist. When Britten finds Jan, he puts the boy and Bigger in the same room and confronts them with their conflicting stories. Jan is surprised by Bigger&#x27;s story, but offers him help.

Bigger storms away from the Daltons&#x27;. He decides to write a false kidnapping note when he discovers that Mr. Dalton owns the rat-infested flat that Bigger&#x27;s family rents. Bigger slips the note under the Daltons&#x27; front door and then returns to his room.

When the Daltons receive the note, they contact the police, who take over the investigation from Britten, and journalists soon arrive at the house. Bigger is afraid, but does not want to leave. In the afternoon, he is ordered to remove the ashes from the furnace and make a new fire. He is terrified and starts poking the ashes with the shovel until the whole room is full of smoke. Furious, one of the journalists takes the shovel and pushes Bigger aside. He immediately finds the remains of Mary&#x27;s bones and an earring in the furnace, and Bigger flees.

Bigger goes directly to Bessie and tells her the whole story. Bessie realizes that white people will think he raped the girl before killing her. They leave together, but Bigger has to drag Bessie around because she is paralyzed by fear. When they lie down together in an abandoned building, Bigger rapes Bessie and falls asleep. In the morning, he decides he has to kill her in her sleep. He hits Bessie on the head with a brick before throwing her through a window and into an air shaft, then realizes that the money he had taken from Mary&#x27;s purse was in Bessie&#x27;s pocket.

Bigger flees through the city, during which he sees newspaper headlines and overhears various conversations about the crime. Whites hate him for the murder and blacks hate him even more for the shame he brought to the black community. After a frantic chase over the city rooftops, the police finally catch him.

=== Book Three: Fate ===
During his first few days in prison, Bigger does not eat, drink, or talk to anyone. Then Jan comes to visit him. He says Bigger has taught him a lot about black and white relationships, and offers him the help of a Communist lawyer named Boris Max. In the long hours that Max and Bigger spend talking, Bigger starts understanding his relationships with his family and with the world. He acknowledges his fury, his need for a future, and his wish for a meaningful life. He reconsiders his attitudes about white people, whether they are aggressive like Britten or accepting like Jan.

Throughout the trial, the prosecuting team focus primarily on Mary&#x27;s murder and pay significantly less attention to Bessie&#x27;s murder. It is also falsely argued that Bigger raped Mary before killing her. The novel finishes with Max&#x27;s lengthy closing argument. In it, he does not argue that Bigger is innocent. Rather he talks about how whites have intentionally blinded themselves to racial oppression, and that the ghettos, in turn, have fueled oppression and crime. He concludes with the statement that the court cannot sentence Bigger to death when they have not even acknowledged that as a human being he has the right to exist. Max urges for them to give him life in prison instead.

Bigger is found guilty and sentenced to death for murder. As his execution draws near, he appears to have come to terms with his fate.

== Development ==
The Book-of-the-Month Club exerted influence to have &quot;Native Son&quot; edited. Wright originally had a scene where Bigger and a friend illegally masturbate in a movie theater, and other lines showing that Mary sexually arouses Bigger. Library of America published a restored draft version of the book assembled by editor Arnold Rampersad.

== Characters ==

Bigger Thomas: The protagonist of the novel, Bigger, commits crimes and is put on trial for his life. He is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. His acts give the novel action but the real plot involves Bigger&#x27;s reactions to his environment and his crime. Through it all, Bigger struggles to discuss his feelings, but he can neither find the words to fully express himself nor does he have the time to say them. However, as they have been related through the narration, Bigger —typical of the &quot;outsider&quot; archetype — has finally discovered the only important and real thing: his life. Though too late, his realization that he is alive — and able to choose to befriend Mr. Max — creates some hope that men like him might be reached earlier.

Debatable as the final scene is, in which for the first time Bigger calls a white man by his first name, Bigger is never anything but a failed human. He represents a black man conscious of a system of racial oppression that leaves him no opportunity to exist but through crime. As he says to Gus, &quot;They don&#x27;t let us do nothing... [and] I can&#x27;t get used to it.&quot; A line goes, one cannot exist by simply reacting: a man must be more than the sum total of his brutalizations. Bigger admits to wanting to be an aviator and later, to Max, aspire to other positions esteemed in the American Dream. But here he can do nothing . . . just be one of many blacks in what was called the &quot;ghetto&quot; and maybe get a job serving whites; crime seems preferable, rather than accidental or inevitable. Not surprisingly, then, he already has a criminal history, and he has even been to reform school. Ultimately, the snap decisions which the law calls &quot;crimes&quot; arose from assaults to his dignity, and being trapped like the rat he killed with a pan, living a life where others held the skillet.

Mary Dalton: An only child, Mary is a rich white girl who has far leftist leanings. She is a Communist sympathizer recently understood to be frolicking with Jan, a known Communist party organizer. Consequently, she is trying to abide, for a time, by her parents&#x27; wishes and go to Detroit. She is to leave the morning after Bigger is hired as the family chauffeur. Under the ruse of a University meeting, she has Bigger take her to meet Jan. When they return to the house, she is too drunk to make it to her room unassisted and thus, Bigger helps her. Mrs. Dalton comes upon them in the room and Bigger smothers Mary for fear that Mrs. Dalton will discover him. Although she dies earlier in the story, she remains a significant plot element, as Bigger constantly has flashbacks during stressful times, in which he sees various scenes from her murder.

Henry Dalton: Father of Mary, owns a controlling amount of stock in a real estate firm that maintains the black ghetto. Blacks in the ghetto pay too much for rat-infested flats. As Max points out at the inquest, Mr. Dalton refuses to rent flats to black people outside of the designated ghetto area. He does this while donating money to the NAACP, buying ping-pong tables for the local black youth outreach program, and giving people like Bigger a chance at employment. Mr. Dalton&#x27;s philanthropy, however, only shows off his wealth while backing up the business practices that contain an already oppressed people. An example of this is when the reader learns that Mr. Dalton owns the real estate company that controls a lot of the South Side (where most of the black community lives), but instead of using his power to improve their situation, he does things such as donate ping-pong tables to them, or hire individual blacks to work in his house. Mr. Dalton is blind to the real plight of blacks in the ghetto, a plight that he maintains.

Mrs. Dalton: Mary Dalton&#x27;s mother. Her blindness serves to accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story. Both Bigger and Max comment on how people are blind to the reality of race in America. Mrs. Dalton betrays her metaphorical blindness when she meets Mrs. Thomas. Mrs. Dalton hides behind her philanthropy and claims there is nothing she can do for Bigger.

Jan Erlone: Jan is a member of the Communist Party as well as the boyfriend of Mary Dalton. Bigger attempts to frame him for the murder of Mary. Nonetheless, Jan uses this to try to prove that black people aren&#x27;t masters of their own destinies, but rather, a product of an oppressive white society. Jan had already been seeking a way to understand the &#x27;negro&#x27; so as to organize them along communist lines against the rich like Mr. Dalton. He is not able to fully do so, but he is able to put aside his personal trauma and persuade Max to help Bigger. He represents the idealistic young Marxist who hopes to save the world through revolution. However, before he can do that, he must understand the &#x27;negro&#x27; much more than he thinks he does.

Gus: Gus is a member of Bigger&#x27;s gang, but he has an uneasy relationship with Bigger. Both are aware of the other&#x27;s nervous anxiety concerning whites. Consequently, Bigger would rather brutalize Gus than admit he is scared to rob a white man.

Jack Harding: Jack is a member of Bigger&#x27;s gang and perhaps the only one Bigger ever views as a real friend.

G.H.: G.H. is another member of Bigger&#x27;s gang. He is the neutral member of the gang who will do what the gang does, but will not be too closely attached to any one member of the gang.

Mr. Boris Max: A lawyer from the Communist Party who represents Bigger against the State&#x27;s prosecuting attorney. As a Jewish American, he is in a position to understand Bigger. It is through his speech during the trial that Wright reveals the greater moral and political implications of Bigger Thomas&#x27; life. Even though Mr. Max is the only one who understands Bigger, Bigger still horrifies him by displaying just how damaged white society has made him. When Mr. Max finally leaves Bigger, he is aghast at the extent of the brutality of racism in America. The third part of the novel, called Fate, seems to focus on Max&#x27;s relationship with Bigger, and because of this Max becomes the main character of Fate.

Bessie Mears: Bigger&#x27;s girlfriend. She drinks often, saying that she is trying to forget her hard life. At the end of Book 2, Bigger takes her to an abandoned building and rapes her, then proceeds to kill her in haste to keep her from talking to the police. This is his second killing in the book.

Peggy: Peggy is the Daltons&#x27; Irish-American housekeeper and, like Max, can empathize with Bigger&#x27;s status as an outsider. However, she is more typical of poor whites who are sure to invest in racism if only to keep someone / anyone below themselves. Peggy hides her dislike for blacks and treats Bigger kindly.

Buddy Thomas: Buddy, Bigger&#x27;s younger brother, idolizes Bigger as a male role model. He defends him to the rest of the family and consistently asks if he can help Bigger.

Mrs. Thomas: Bigger&#x27;s mother. She struggles to keep her family alive on the meager wages earned by taking in laundry. She is a religious woman who believes she will be rewarded in an afterlife, but as a black woman accepts that nothing can be done to improve her people&#x27;s situation. Additionally, she knows Bigger will end up hanging from the &quot;gallows&quot; for his crime, but this is just another fact of life.

Vera Thomas: Vera is Bigger&#x27;s sister. In her, Bigger sees many similarities to his mother. Bigger fears Vera will grow up to either be like his mother, constantly exhausted with the strain of supporting a family, or like Bessie, a drunk trying to escape her troubles.

Buckley: The state prosecutor.

Britten: The Daltons&#x27; investigator. He seems quite prejudiced, first toward Bigger (because Bigger is black) and then toward Jan (because Jan is a Communist).

== True crime influence ==
Wright based aspects of the novel on the 1938 arrest and trial of Robert Nixon, executed in 1939 following a series of &quot;brick bat murders&quot; in Los Angeles and Chicago.

== Title ==
&quot;Native Son&quot; was the original title of Chicago writer Nelson Algren&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot;, based on a piece of doggerel about the first Texan. Algren and Wright had met at Chicago&#x27;s John Reed Club circa 1933 and later worked together at the Federal Writers&#x27; Project in Chicago. According to Bettina Drew&#x27;s 1989 biography &quot;Nelson Algren&quot;:
&quot;A Life on the Wild Side&quot;, he bequeathed the title &quot;Native Son&quot; to Wright.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
Wright&#x27;s protest novel was an immediate best-seller; it sold 250,000 hardcover copies within three weeks of its publication by the Book-of-the-Month Club on March 1, 1940. It was one of the earliest successful attempts to explain the racial divide in America in terms of the social conditions imposed on African Americans by the dominant white society. It also made Wright the wealthiest Black writer of his time and established him as a spokesperson for African American issues, and the &quot;father of Black American literature.&quot; As Irving Howe said in his 1963 essay &quot;Black Boys and Native Sons&quot;: &quot;The day &quot;Native Son&quot; appeared, American culture was changed forever. No matter how much qualifying the book might later need, it made impossible a repetition of the old lies ... [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear, and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.&quot;
The novel&#x27;s treatment of Bigger and his motivations is an example of literary naturalism.

The book also received criticism from some of Wright&#x27;s fellow African-American writers. James Baldwin&#x27;s 1948 essay, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel,&quot; dismissed &quot;Native Son&quot; as protest fiction, as well as limited in its understanding of human character and in artistic value. The essay was collected with nine others in Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; (1955).

In 1991, &quot;Native Son&quot; was published for the first time in its entirety by the Library of America, together with an introduction, a chronology, and notes by Arnold Rampersad, a well-regarded scholar of African American literary works. This edition also contains Richard Wright&#x27;s 1940 essay &quot;How &#x27;Bigger&#x27; Was Born.&quot; The original edition had a masturbation scene removed at the request of the Book-of-the-Month club.

&quot;Native Son&quot; is number 27 on &quot;Radcliffe&#x27;s Rival 100 Best Novels List&quot;. The Modern Library placed it number 20 on its list of the 100 best novels of the 20th Century. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; also included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.&quot;

=== Censorship in the United States ===
The novel has endured a series of challenges in public high schools and libraries all over the United States. Many of these challenges focus on the book&#x27;s being &quot;sexually graphic,&quot; &quot;unnecessarily violent,&quot; and &quot;profane.&quot; Despite complaints from parents, many schools have successfully fought to keep Wright&#x27;s work in the classroom. Some teachers believe the themes in &quot;Native Son&quot; and other challenged books &quot;foster dialogue and discussion in the classroom&quot; and &quot;guide students into the reality of the complex adult and social world.&quot; &quot;Native Son&quot; is number 27 on &quot;Radcliffe&#x27;s Rival 100 Best Novels List&quot;.

The book is number 71 on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000.

=== &quot;Native Son&quot; and the Bible ===
Biblical allusions appear frequently throughout &quot;Native Son,&quot; but they do not serve as an uplifting component of Bigger Thomas&#x27; life. Instead, Richard Wright seems to allude to the Bible with irony. Bigger is exposed to Christianity through his religious mother, Reverend Hammond, a Catholic priest, and his encounter with the church. However, Bigger&#x27;s constant rejection of Christianity and the church reveals Wright&#x27;s negative tone toward the religion. He views Christianity as an opiate of the black masses.

Bigger has several negative encounters with religion. In one instance, Bigger hears his mother singing a hymn when he sneaks into his flat to get his pistol to prepare for robbing Blum&#x27;s delicatessen. His mother is singing the words: &quot;Lord, I want to be a Christian, /In my heart, in my heart.&quot; Her hymns and prayers are wholly ineffective and do nothing to forestall his violence. Even toward the end of the novel, with her son facing a possible death sentence, Bigger&#x27;s mother pleads with him to pray to God for repentance. Reverend Hammond also preaches to Bigger, yet he does not understand the words of Reverend Hammond and does not pray for repentance. Instead, Bigger does the opposite and rejects Christianity. When he later sees the fiery cross that the Ku Klux Klan displays, he tears the cross which Reverend Hammond had given him from his neck and throws it to the ground. In yet another instance, Bigger overhears the church choir singing and ponders whether he should become Christian. However, his contemplation of changing his heart into a humble heart causes him to reject the idea because it meant, &quot;losing his hope of living in the world. And he would never do that.&quot;

Wright directly alludes to the Bible in the epigraph of &quot;Native Son&quot;. The epigraph states, &quot;Even today is my complaint rebellious; my stroke is heavier than my groaning&quot; (Job 23:2). This quotation is from the Book of Job. According to the Bible, Job was a faithful man of God. However, Job experienced immense suffering in his lifetime, losing his children and his great wealth. He was stricken with poverty and boils. In these afflictions, God was silent, leaving Job in a state of deep spiritual anguish. This tone of anguish and despair is established in the epigraph at the outset of &quot;Native Son&quot; and emphasizes Bigger&#x27;s suffering.

Job and Bigger are parallel characters in their dealings with suffering. That further suggests the aptness of Wright&#x27;s epigraph. Job suffered trials from an outside force that he could not control. Similar to Job, Bigger struggled with an outside force of the racial norms of society. The parallel is further strengthened by the freedom both characters display in their defiance.

Savory has mentioned two quotes in the book of Job and &quot;Native Son&quot; that suggest Bigger and Job&#x27;s parallel stories. The protagonist of the book of Job lifts himself proudly through his suffering. &quot;If the charges my opponent brings against me were written down so that I could have them, I would wear them proudly around my neck, and hold them up for everyone to see. I would tell God everything I have done, and hold my head high in his presence&quot;. During this point of the passage, Job has yet to confess his sins to God. Convinced of his innocence, Job asserts that he will stand proud and tall in God&#x27;s presence.

Bigger has a similar experience. He muses, &quot;He had done this. He had brought all this about. In all of his life these two murders were the most meaningful things that had ever happened to him. He was living, truly and deeply, no matter what others might think, looking at him with their blind eyes. Never had he had the chance to live out the consequences of his actions: never had his will been so free as in this night and day of fear and murder and flight.&quot; It is the first time in the novel where Bigger does not throw the blame on others but instead asserts that he was responsible for his actions. Through that, he finally experiences free will and finds freedom.

=== Influence on Wright by Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; ===
&quot;Native Son&quot; contains several allusions to other works that were significant during Wright&#x27;s time. One of the major works that influenced &quot;Native Son&quot; was Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), the best-selling novel of the 19th century which also played a major role in the abolitionist movement.

Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; (1940) contains multiple similarities to &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Like &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, &quot;Native Son&quot; can be interpreted as an illustration of the harsh reality of racial injustice in the United States. James Baldwin, writing in the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, boldly linked the two novels. In both books, racial injustice is a &quot;pre-ordained pattern set upon the living reality&quot;. There is little the characters can do to escape racial discrimination. Additionally, both of these novels are a form of social protest, seek to disprove the idea that society neatly analyzes and treats race, and portrays African Americans who emerge confused, dishonest, and panicked as they are trapped and immobilized as prisoners within the American dream.

The title and content of another book Wright published, the collection of short stories &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; (1938), suggest the inspiration Stowe&#x27;s work provided Wright in his own books. Both &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Children&quot; exploit the term &quot;Uncle Tom,&quot; attacking an African American who seems to act in a subservient manner toward white people. However, while these two titles are similar and contain similar themes, Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; can also be considered reactionary against &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; Bigger Thomas is the antithesis of Uncle Tom. Bigger is fearful of and angry toward white society. He also lacks the religious background and Christian faith that Uncle Tom possessed. This contrast between the characters of Bigger Thomas and Uncle Tom may be Wright&#x27;s attempt to show the contemporary racial conflicts that persisted long after the publication of Stowe&#x27;s novel in 1852.

=== Influence of Communism on &quot;Native Son&quot; ===
Wright was affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States both prior to and following his publishing of &quot;Native Son&quot;. The Communist ideas in &quot;Native Son&quot; are evident as Wright draws a parallel between the Scottsboro boys case and Bigger Thomas&#x27; case. One parallel is the court scene in &quot;Native Son&quot;, in which Max calls the &quot;hate and impatience&quot; of &quot;the mob congregated upon the streets beyond the window&quot; (Wright, p. 386) and the &quot;mob who surrounded the Scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene&quot; after the Scottsboro boys&#x27; initial conviction. Critics attacked Max&#x27;s final speech in the courtroom, claiming that it was an irrelevant elaboration on Wright&#x27;s own Communist beliefs and unrelated to Bigger&#x27;s case. 

There are many different interpretations concerning which group was the intended target of Max&#x27;s speech. James Baldwin, a renowned critic of Wright&#x27;s, presented his own interpretation of Max&#x27;s final speech in &quot;Notes by a Native Son&quot;; Baldwin says Max&#x27;s speech is &quot;addressed to those among us of good will and it seems to say that, though there are whites and blacks among us who hate each other, we will not; there are those who are betrayed by greed, by guilt, by blood, by blood lust, but not we; we will set our faces against them and join hands and walk together into that dazzling future when there will be no white or black&quot; (Baldwin, p. 47). However, other critics, such as Siegel, have argued that the original text in &quot;Native Son&quot; does not imply &quot;the dazzling future when there will be no white or black&quot;.

A line from the trial speech by Bigger Thomas&#x27; lawyer, Boris Max, is woven into the plot of Lemony Snicket&#x27;s book, &quot;The Penultimate Peril&quot; (2005): &quot;Richard Wright, an American novelist of the realist school, asks a famous unfathomable question... &#x27;Who knows when some slight shock,&#x27; he asks, &#x27;disturbing the delicate balance between social order and thirsty aspiration, shall send the skyscrapers in our cities toppling?&#x27; .. So when Mr. Wright asks his question, he might be wondering if a small event, such as a stone dropping into a pond, can cause ripples in the system of the world, and tremble the things that people want, until all this rippling and trembling brings down something enormous...&quot;

== Adaptations ==
=== On stage ===

&quot;Native Son&quot; was adapted for the stage by Wright and Paul Green, with some conflict between the authors affecting the project. The initial production, directed by Orson Welles and with Canada Lee as Bigger, opened at the St. James Theatre on March 24, 1941.

The book was newly adapted and directed again by Kent Gash (in conjunction with the Paul Green Foundation) for Intiman Theatre in Seattle, Washington, in 2006. The production, featuring Ato Essandoh as Bigger Thomas, was a more literal translation of the book than the 1941 version and was a critical success.

In 2014, a stage adaptation by Nambi E. Kelley played the Court Theatre in Chicago with Jerod Haynes starring as Bigger Thomas. Directed by Seret Scott, the show was the highest grossing straight play in the theatre&#x27;s 60-year history, went on to win multiple awards, and has had celebrated productions across the country, most notably at Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. The play can be purchased through Samuel French Publications.

=== In films ===
&quot;Native Son&quot; has been adapted into a film three times: once in 1951, again in 1986 and a third released in 2019. The first version was made in Argentina. Wright, aged 42, played the protagonist despite being twice the age of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas. The film was not well received; Wright&#x27;s performance was a particular target of critics.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reception remains mixed given disparities in the perception of Bigger Thomas: &quot;Is he a helpless victim of his environment? A symbol of the proletariat empowered by violence? Is the incompleteness of Bigger&#x27;s personality a realistic portrayal or an act of bad faith that succumbs to racist caricature?&quot; Audiences were also split along the divide of race and gender: they were forced to choose between sympathizing with a rapist, or condemn him and ignore that he was a victim of systemic racism. Said Ayana Mathis of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t imagine many black people would have embraced such a grotesque portrait of themselves. […] What future, what vision is reflected in such a miserable and incompletely realized creature?&quot;

James Baldwin wrote, &quot;No American Negro exists who does not have his private Bigger Thomas living in his skull.&quot; Frantz Fanon discussed the novel in his 1952 essay &quot;L&#x27;expérience vécue du noir&quot; (&quot;The Fact of Blackness&quot;). &quot;In the end&quot;, wrote Fanon, &quot;Bigger Thomas acts. To put an end to his tension, he acts, he responds to the world&#x27;s anticipation.&quot; The book was a successful and groundbreaking best seller. However, it was also criticized by Baldwin and others as ultimately advancing Bigger as a stereotype, and not a real character.

The novel was intended to educate its audience about the black experience in the ghetto. Thus, its intended audience was white people. Baldwin called it a &quot;pamphlet in literary disguise,&quot; exaggerating characters with the sole purpose of carrying his message. He went on to say that Wright failed because of his &quot;insistence that it is … categorization alone which is real and which cannot be transcended.&quot; Wright exaggerated his characters with the intention of gaining the sympathies of white people, but many of his audiences felt that it perpetuated stereotypes of African Americans with little to no benefit. One of the few successes noted was that the controversial, struggling Bigger Thomas was a strong attack on white people who wanted to be comforted by complacent black characters onstage.

==Analysis==
David Bradley wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, in his first reading of the novel, while he strongly disliked the work, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that Bigger failed as a character, exactly&quot; as Bradley knew of the author&#x27;s intentions to make Bigger unlikeable, but Bradley felt the author did not succeed in making Bigger symbolize ordinary black men. Upon reading an edition of the book with an introduction, Bradley stated &quot;Suddenly I realized that many readers of &quot;Native Son&quot; had seen Bigger Thomas as a symbol&quot;. Upon researching other writings from the author Bradley interpreted Bigger as Wright&#x27;s autobiographical view of himself, and Bradley changed his own view to see the work as a tragedy despite Wright initially not meaning for this.

Clyde Taylor, an associate professor of English at Tufts University, criticized Bradley&#x27;s view, claiming that the analysis failed to perceive how the work &quot;disrupted the accommodation to racism through polite conventions in American social discourse&quot;.

<doc id="60957" wikidata="Q1283316" url="?curid=60957" title="Greg Ginn">
<text>Gregory Regis Ginn ( , born June 8, 1954) is an American musician and songwriter, best known for being the leader, primary songwriter, and the only continuous member of the hardcore punk band Black Flag, which he founded and led from 1976 to 1986, and again in 2003. The band announced another reunion in 2013. Since the breakup of Black Flag, Ginn has recorded solo albums, and performed with such bands as October Faction, Gone, Confront James, Mojack, and others. He was 99th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Ginn was born June 8, 1954, in Tucson, Arizona. He began an electronics company in Hermosa Beach, California, called Solid State Tuners, when he was 12 years old. He was also an amateur radio operator. Ginn became a vegetarian at 17 years old in 1971 and has been a vegan since 1998. 

==Musical career==
===Black Flag===

Black Flag is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. The band was established by Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band. They are widely considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands. After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag briefly reunited in 2003 and again in 2013. Black Flag&#x27;s sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk rock bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and non-conformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band&#x27;s material was released on Ginn&#x27;s SST Records.

===Dale Nixon===

&quot;Dale Nixon&quot; is a pseudonym and multiple-use name originally used by Ginn to obfuscate the fact that he played bass on the later Black Flag albums, &quot;My War&quot; and &quot;What The...&quot; It has since been used by other artists (typically punk) to appear on albums without being in breach of record label contracts that stipulate label exclusivity. Other artists using the &quot;Dale Nixon&quot; moniker include Dave Grohl, who filled in on drums for the 1992 EP, &quot;King Buzzo&quot;, and Brian Baker, a founding member of Minor Threat, credited as Nixon on the 1992 Dag Nasty album &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;. The name appears once again, listed as a bass player, on the Ryan Adams album &quot;Orion&quot;; it is likely Adams himself, or his sound engineer, Charlie.

==Legacy==
Many artists have cited Ginn as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him, including Buzz Osborne of Melvins, Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta, John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers, William DuVall of Alice in Chains, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Kurt Ballou of Converge, Justin Sane of Anti-Flag, RM Hubbert, Bill Kelliher of Mastodon, Zach Blair of Rise Against, Weasel Walter, Andrew Williams of Every Time I Die, Laurent Barnard of Gallows, and Nick Reinhart of Tera Melos.

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
Ginn&#x27;s earliest guitar was a &quot;Ampeg Dan Armstrong&quot; electric guitar. He eventually started using an &quot;Westone Spectrum SX&quot; and &quot;Modulus Graphite Black Knife Stratocaster&quot; guitars in later albums.

===Amplification===
He would play both guitars through a head amp &quot;Peavey Series 260 Standard PA&quot; and &quot;Ampeg SVT-410HLF bass cabinet&quot;.

===Effects===
Ginn never uses any effects or distortion pedals, as depicted in the &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; EP.

==Personal life==
Ginn is the older brother of artist Raymond Ginn, who goes by the pseudonym of Raymond Pettibon.

Ginn owns the Texas-based independent record label SST Records (SST), an outgrowth of his original Solid State Tuners company.

On October 10, 2014, Ginn&#x27;s ex-wife Marina filed a motion in court to prevent Ginn from having access to their two daughters, claiming Ginn was &quot;routinely denying them food and threatening them,&quot; &quot;abusing alcohol and drugs in front of them,&quot; had &quot;forced [the children] to do cleaning chores until 2 a.m.&quot; &quot;locked [them] in a room alone with no contact with the outside world through cell phone or emails,&quot; and had &quot;throw[n] cups of water in their face.&quot; She also claimed he had told his daughters &quot;you&#x27;re hot&quot; and &quot;whistled at them,&quot; and told them &quot;they are getting fat and need to lose weight and that their diets will have to be more strenuous.&quot; Former Black Flag member Ron Reyes subsequently testified in court in support of Marina Ginn&#x27;s accusations. Ginn suffered no criminal charges.

<text>The Chicago Tribune is an American daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1847, it was formerly self-styled as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;, a slogan from which its once integrated WGN radio and WGN television received their call letters. As of 2023, it is the most-read daily newspaper in the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region and the sixth-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States.

In the 1850s, under Joseph Medill, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; became closely associated with the Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln, and the then new Republican Party&#x27;s progressive wing. In the 20th century, under Medill&#x27;s grandson &#x27;Colonel&#x27; Robert R. McCormick, its reputation was that of a crusading newspaper with an outlook that promoted American conservatism and opposed the New Deal. Its reporting and commentary reached markets outside Chicago through family and corporate relationships at the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;. Through much of the 20th century into the early 21st, it employed a network of overseas news bureaus and foreign correspondents. In the 1960s, its corporate parent owner, Tribune Company began expanding into new markets buying additional daily papers. For the first time in its over-a-century-and-a-half history, in 2008, its editorial page endorsed a Democrat, Barack Obama, a U.S. Senator from Illinois, for U.S. president.

Originally published solely as a broadsheet, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced on January 13, 2009, that it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. The change, however, proved unpopular with readers; in August 2011, the &quot;Tribune&quot; discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; was owned by parent company Tribune Publishing. In May 2021, Tribune Publishing was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media; since then, the newspaper&#x27;s coverage has evolved away from national and international news and toward coverage of Illinois and especially Chicago-area news.

==History==
===19th century===

The &quot;Tribune&quot; was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time, it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855, that the &quot;Tribune&quot; formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.

Around 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Charles H. Ray of Galena, Illinois, through Horace Greeley, convinced Joseph Medill of Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Leader&quot; to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Under their leadership, the &quot;Tribune&quot; distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party. However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive famine immigration from Ireland.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the &quot;Free West&quot; in 1855, the &quot;Democratic Press&quot; of William Bross in 1858, and the &quot;Chicago Democrat&quot; in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the &quot;Chicago Press &amp; Tribune&quot;. On October 25, 1860, it became the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot;. Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an abolitionist agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.

In 1861, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published new lyrics by William W. Patton for the song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. These rivaled the lyrics published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

===20th century===

In the 20th-century, Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto &quot;The American Paper for Americans&quot;. From the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the Democrats and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy.

When McCormick assumed the position of co-editor with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson in 1910, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago&#x27;s eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000. The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; and &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;. They promoted political crusades, and their first success came with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. William Lorimer. At the same time, the &quot;Tribune&quot; competed with the Hearst paper, the &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot;, in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out William Keeley, the newspaper&#x27;s managing editor. By 1918, the &quot;Examiner&quot; was forced to merge with the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;.

In 1919, Patterson left the &quot;Tribune&quot; and moved to New York City to launch his own newspaper, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. In a renewed circulation war with Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;, McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The &quot;Tribune&quot; won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. The same year, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood. 

The newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft. But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship CSS &quot;Acadia&quot;.

The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s reputation for innovation extended to radio; it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN, the station call letters standing for the paper&#x27;s self-description as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;. WGN Television was launched on April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remained &quot;Tribune&quot; properties for nine decades and were among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s East Coast sibling, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, later established WPIX television and FM radio.)

The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city&#x27;s Century of Progress exposition.

From 1940 to 1943, the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with &quot;The Chicago Tribune Comic Book&quot;, responding to the new success of comic books. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer-lasting &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;, which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.

Under McCormick&#x27;s stewardship, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity (such as spelling &quot;although&quot; as &quot;altho&quot;). McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time.

One of the great scoops in &quot;Tribune&quot; history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan&#x27;s naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret. The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

====1948 U.S. presidential election====
The paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day&#x27;s paper carried the headline &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot;, turning the paper into a collector&#x27;s item. Democrat Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.

In 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton Kirkpatrick (1915–2004), the &quot;Tribune&quot; began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2025}

On May 1, 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published the complete 246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes, in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24 hours after the transcripts&#x27; release by the Nixon White House. Not only was the &quot;Tribune&quot; the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the U.S. Government Printing Office&#x27;s published version, and made headlines doing so.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

A week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper&#x27;s editorial board observed that &quot;the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s editors concluded that &quot;nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,&quot; and called for Nixon&#x27;s resignation. The &quot;Tribune&quot; call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon&#x27;s hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly perceived the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon&#x27;s hopes to weather the scandal.

On December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a &quot;young and talented columnist&quot; for the paper, whose work had &quot;won a following among many &quot;Tribune&quot; readers over the last two years&quot;, had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975, column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll&#x27;s columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, &quot;Tribune&quot; editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.

After leaving, Soll married Pam Zekman, a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. {{anchor|Chicago Times (magazine)}}He worked for the short-lived &quot;Chicago Times&quot; magazine,&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=g1C5vwEACAAJ&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Times Magazine |date=1989 |publisher=Chicago Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1C5vwEACAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Small Newspaper Group Inc. of Kankakee, Illinois, in the late 1980s.
Soll was born in 1946, in Chicago, to Marjorie and Jules Soll. Soll graduated from New Trier High School, received a Bachelor of Arts in 1968 from Colgate University, and a master&#x27;s degree from Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy.suntimes/21263473&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Rick Soll Obituary (1946 - 2016) - Chicago, IL |url=https://legacy.suntimes.com/us/obituaries/chicagosuntimes/name/rick-soll-obituary?id=21263473 |access-date=January 31, 2023 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=Legacy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicago.suntimes/18395757&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Reporter, writer, editor Rick Soll dead at 69 |url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/4/29/18395757/reporter-writer-editor-rick-soll-dead-at-69 |access-date=January 31, 2023 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=April 29, 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1977, &quot;Tribune&quot; columnist Will Leonard died at age 64. In March 1978, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced that it hired columnist Bob Greene from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

Kirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon (1928–2004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the United Press International. James Squires served as the paper&#x27;s editor from July 1981 until December 1989.

Jack Fuller served as the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Howard Tyner served as the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s. Editorial cartoonist Dick Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.

In September 1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the &quot;Tribune&quot; after a 38-year career at the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;.

In September 1982, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opened a new $180 million printing facility, Freedom Center.

In November 1982, &quot;Tribune&quot; managing editor William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with leukemia.

In May 1983, &quot;Tribune&quot; columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from leukemia. Gold had coauthored the Tribune&#x27;s &quot;Inc.&quot; column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper&#x27;s &quot;Tower Ticker&quot; column.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival &quot;Sun-Times&quot;.

In 1986, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced that film critic Gene Siskel, the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s best-known writer, was no longer the paper&#x27;s film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper&#x27;s entertainment sections.

The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie review show, then known as &quot;At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert&quot; and later known as &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; The Movies&quot; from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Buena Vista Television unit. &quot;He has done a great job for us,&quot; editor James Squires said at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can&#x27;t do that.&quot; Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel&#x27;s &quot;Tribune&quot; bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that freelance position until he died in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.

In February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988, Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;.

In August 1988, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.

In November 1992, &quot;Tribune&quot; associate subject editor Searle &quot;Ed&quot; Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in Evanston, Illinois. Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

In October 1993, the &quot;Tribune&quot; fired its longtime military affairs writer, retired Marine David Evans, saying publicly that the position was being replaced by a national security writer.

In December 1993, the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was fired after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago. Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention to the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.

In December 1993, the &quot;Tribune&quot; hired Margaret Holt from the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation&#x27;s 10 largest newspapers. In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.

In 1994, reporter Brenda You was fired by the &quot;Tribune&quot; after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s photo library. She later worked for the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and as a producer for &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; before committing suicide in November 2005.

In April 1994, the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the &quot;Tribune&quot; later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement. Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.

In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly &quot;Newcity&quot; published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play &quot;The Front Page&quot;) but quickly identified by &quot;Tribune&quot; reporters as that of former &quot;Tribune&quot; reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper&#x27;s one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for &quot;Newcity&quot;.

In 1997, the &quot;Tribune&quot; celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book &quot;Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City&quot;.

On April 29, 1997, popular columnist Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the &quot;Tribune&quot; promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko&#x27;s place as the paper&#x27;s principal Page Two news columnist.

On June 1, 1997, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary Schmich called &quot;Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Wear Sunscreen&quot; or the &quot;Sunscreen Speech&quot;. The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann.

In 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the &quot;Tribune&quot; after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter Don King for &quot;Emerge&quot; magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas—and suspend his photographer on the &quot;Emerge&quot; story, Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Tribune&quot; photographer Ovie Carter for a month—because Thomas did not tell the &quot;Tribune&quot; about his outside work and also because the &quot;Emerge&quot; story wound up appearing in print first.

On June 6, 1999, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door. An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account &quot;totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline&quot; and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew, and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner &quot;now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.&quot;

The &quot;Tribune&quot; has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com (2008), and ChicagoNow (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as &quot;RedEye&quot;.

===21st century===
Ann Marie Lipinski was the paper&#x27;s editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper&#x27;s editor in July 2008. In early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned as well. Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s &quot;RedEye&quot; tabloid.

In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.

In July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63, just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.

Tribune&#x27;s Baltimore Community papers include &quot;Arbutus Times&quot;, &quot;Baltimore Messenger&quot;, &quot;Catonsville Times&quot;, &quot;Columbia Flier&quot;, &quot;Howard County Times&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, &quot;Laurel Leader&quot;, &quot;Lifetimes&quot;, &quot;North County News&quot;, &quot;Northeast Booster&quot;, &quot;Northeast Reporter&quot;, &quot;Owings Mills Times&quot;, and &quot;Towson Times&quot;.

The &quot;Howard County Times&quot; was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.

The &quot;Towson Times&quot; expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century. Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team—lead writers of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajac—won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system. In 2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial writing. In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois. And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted Gregory, Michael Oneal, Evan Osnos and photojournalist Scott Strazzante won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.

In late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving the &quot;Tribune&quot; after just two months because he was homesick. He ultimately returned to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, where he had been working immediately before the &quot;Tribune&quot; had hired him.

On September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper&#x27;s longtime columnist, Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging &quot;engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.&quot; The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. &quot;Greene&#x27;s behavior was a serious violation of &quot;Tribune&quot; ethics and standards for its journalists,&quot; Lipinski wrote. &quot;We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.&quot;

In January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was hired as new &quot;Tribune&quot; sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the &quot;In the Wake of the News Column&quot; originated by Ring Lardner.

In March 2004, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced that freelance reporter Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 2002 after 16 years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.

In May 2004, the &quot;Tribune&quot; revealed that freelance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. &quot;Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,&quot; the paper noted. After the correction, the &quot;Tribune&quot; stopped using Falanga.

In October 2004, &quot;Tribune&quot; editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper&#x27;s WomanNews section by freelance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli titled &quot;You c_nt say that (or can you?),&quot; about a noted vulgarism. The paper ordered every spare body to go to the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

In September 2008, the &quot;Tribune&quot; considered hiring controversial sports columnist Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from &quot;Tribune&quot; archrival &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; threatened to sue for violating Mariotti&#x27;s noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009. Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; in December 2009.

In April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper&#x27;s marketing department had solicited subscribers&#x27; opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. &quot;We&#x27;ll let the e-mail speak for itself,&quot; reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as &quot;a brief market research project&quot;.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the &quot;Tribune&quot; had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues:
* In December 2005, the &quot;Tribune&quot; eliminated 28 editorial positions through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, including what were believed to be the first layoffs in the paper&#x27;s history. Among the reporters who left the paper in that round were Carol Kleiman, Bill Jauss and Connie Lauerman.
* In June 2007, about 25 newsroom employees took buyouts, including well-known bylines like Charles Madigan, Michael Hirsley and Ronald Kotulak, along with noted photographer Pete Souza.
* In March 2008, the paper gave buyouts to about 25 newsroom employees, including sportswriter Sam Smith.
* On August 15, 2008, the &quot;Tribune&quot; laid-off more than 40 newsroom and other editorial employees, including reporters Rick Popely, Ray Quintanilla, Lew Freedman, Michael Martinez and Robert Manor.
* Also in August 2008, about 36 editorial employees took voluntary buyouts or resigned, including well-known bylines like Michael Tackett, Ron Silverman, Timothy McNulty, Ed Sherman, Evan Osnos, Steve Franklin, Maurice Possley, Hanke Gratteau, Chuck Osgood and Skip Myslenski.
* On November 12, 2008, five editorial employees in the paper&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau were laid off, including John Crewdson.
* On December 4, 2008, about 11 newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist, Mike Downey, having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed. Well-known bylines who were laid off included Neil Milbert, Stevenson Swanson, Lisa Anderson, Phil Marty, Charles Storch, Courtney Flynn and Deborah Horan.
* In February 2009, the &quot;Tribune&quot; laid off about 20 editorial employees, including several foreign correspondents, and some feature reporters and editors, although several, including Charles Leroux and Jeff Lyon, technically took buyouts. Among those who were let go were reporters Emily Nunn, Susan Chandler, Christine Spolar and Joel Greenberg.
* On April 22, 2009, the paper laid off 53 newsroom employees, including well-known bylines like Patrick Reardon, Melissa Isaacson, Russell Working, Jo Napolitano, Susan Diesenhouse, Beth Botts, Lou Carlozo, Jessica Reaves, Tom Hundley, Alan Artner, Eric Benderoff, James P. Miller, Bob Sakamoto, Terry Bannon and John Mullin. That number was less than the 90 newsroom jobs that Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business previously had reported were to be eliminated.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; broke the story on May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school&#x27;s Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called &quot;Category I&quot; admissions program, university President B. Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the &quot;Tribune&quot;, in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted. The &quot;Tribune&quot; has since filed suit against the university administration under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.

On February 8, 2010, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; shrank its newspaper&#x27;s width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes.

In July 2011, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters. Among those let go were DuPage County reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer Dave Pierini.

On March 15, 2012, the &quot;Tribune&quot; laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012). At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.

In June 2012, the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.

In September 2012, &quot;Tribune&quot; education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and the &quot;Tribune&quot; hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John J. Kim from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

In October 2012, the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm.

Also in October 2012, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced plans to create a paywall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.

In February 2013, the &quot;Tribune&quot; agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages. The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011. The paper&#x27;s TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.

On June 12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing moving tribute was posted again, which showed the words &quot;We are Chicago&quot; above the names of Boston sports teams. On the graphic on June 12, the word &quot;Bruins&quot; was ripped off and the comment was added, &quot;Yeah, not right now we&#x27;re not&quot;, in a reference to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against the Boston Bruins. Gerould Kern tweeted later that the &quot;Tribune&quot; &quot;still supports [Boston] after all you&#x27;ve been through. We regret any offense. Now let&#x27;s play hockey.&quot;

On November 20, 2013, the &quot;Tribune&quot; laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers.

On April 6, 2014, the &quot;Tribune&quot; increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50. By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99.

On January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor.

On February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper&#x27;s editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune&#x27;s editor.

On June 9, 2018, the Tribune ended their 93-year stint at Tribune Tower and moved to One Prudential Plaza. The tower was later converted to condos.

===2020s===
On February 27, 2020, the &quot;Tribune&quot; announced that publisher and editor Bruce Dold will leave the &quot;Tribune&quot; on April 30, 2020, and would step down immediately as editor in chief. His replacement as editor was Colin McMahon. Also, the paper announced that one of the two managing editors of the paper, Peter Kendall, would leave the &quot;Tribune&quot; on February 28, 2020.

In January 2021, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; moved out of One Prudential Plaza, and relocated their offices and newsroom to Freedom Center.

In May 2021, the paper was purchased by Alden Global Capital. Alden immediately launched a round of employee buyouts, reducing the newsroom staff by 25 percent, and the cuts continued. A former reporter said the paper is being &quot;snuffed out, quarter after quarter after quarter&quot;. A report in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said that Alden&#x27;s business model is simple: &quot;Gut the staff, sell the real estate, jack up subscription prices, and wring as much cash as possible out of the enterprise until eventually enough readers cancel their subscriptions that the paper folds, or is reduced to a desiccated husk of its former self.&quot;

Mitch Pugh was named the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s executive editor on August 20, 2021, after eight years in the same role at &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; in Charleston, South Carolina.

==Editorial==
{{Conservatism US|media}}

===Policy===
In a 2007 statement of principles published in the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s print and online editions, the paper&#x27;s editorial board described the newspaper&#x27;s philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The &quot;Tribune&quot; embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. It criticized the Bush administration&#x27;s record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal from office.

{{As of|2018}}, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; withdrew their website from European Union nations to avoid the purview of the General Data Protection Regulation.

===Election endorsements===
In 2004, the &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed President George W. Bush for reelection, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator Barack Obama—the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president. The &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012, and in 2020 would endorse another Democrat, Joe Biden, who had served as vice president under Obama.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; has occasionally backed candidates of other parties for president. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party newspaper editor, and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William Howard Taft. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, for president, over Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Even when it uniformly backed Republicans for president, the &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House of Representatives&#x27; longest-serving Republican. Although the &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.

==Tribune Company==
{{main|Tribune Media}}
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed &quot;Tribune Media&quot;), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owned the WGN radio station (720 AM) and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;—which displaced the Tribune as the company&#x27;s largest property—and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009;the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing.

Tribune Company owned the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder of the &quot;News&quot;Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson, was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of &quot;Tribune&quot; editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot;—founded in 1940 by Patterson&#x27;s daughter (and Medill&#x27;s great-granddaughter), Alicia Patterson—to Long Island cable TV company Cablevision.

From 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.

===Pulitzer Prizes===
Colonel McCormick prevented the &quot;Tribune&quot; for years from participating in the Pulitzer Prize competition. But it has won 28 of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 for reporting. A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979. In 2022, Cecilia Reyes, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and Madison Hopkins, Better Government Association, won a Pulitzer Prize in local reporting for a piercing examination of the city&#x27;s long history of failed building- and fire-safety code enforcement, which let scofflaw landlords commit serious violations that resulted in dozens of unnecessary deaths.

==2008 redesign==
The September 2008 redesign (discussed on the &quot;Tribune&quot;{{&#x27;}}s web site) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.

==Zell ownership and bankruptcy==
In December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion deal. Zell was the company&#x27;s new chairman. A year after going private, following a $124 million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13 billion and assets of $7.6 billion.

Sam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.

As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper&#x27;s financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.

In the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a &quot;fraudulent transfer&quot; of wealth.

The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock. Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company, the Tribune&#x27;s bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500 million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.

The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company&#x27;s plan included selling off many of its assets.

==Tribune Publishing divestment==
Tribune Publishing, owning the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed Tribune Media. Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.

Spinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%. Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.

On February 7, 2018 Tribune Publishing Company agreed to sell the Los Angeles Times to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong. The purchase, made through Soon-Shiong&#x27;s Nant Capital investment fund, was valued at $500 million, along with the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The deal, which also included the San Diego Union-Tribune and other assets, was finalized on June 16, 2018.

<text>Patricia Kathryn Helms Kidd (April 3, 1950 – December 14, 2015) was an American author. Many of her books concern the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). She co-wrote some of her works with her husband, Clark L. Kidd, and also co-wrote a novel with Orson Scott Card.

==Life and career==
Kidd was born in New Orleans and raised in Mandeville, Louisiana. She graduated from Brigham Young University and was baptized in the LDS Church. Raised a Protestant, Kidd is quoted as converting because she wanted a patriarchal blessing, but couldn&#x27;t receive one unless she was a baptized member of the LDS faith. Upon receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree, Kidd reported for the &quot;Deseret News&quot; in Salt Lake City. During this time, she became friends with Orson Scott Card, who was then an assistant editor for the official LDS magazine, &quot;The Ensign&quot;. After Kathryn married Clark Kidd, the two worked with Card on a project for Compute! Books. Clark programmed the games in a series while Kathy wrote the directions. The couple moved to Virginia in 1987. She was subsequently associate and managing editor of &quot;Meridian&quot; magazine until 2008, after which she continued writing for it and also for &quot;Nauvoo Times&quot;. She died on December 14, 2015.

==Publications==
Kidd wrote and co-wrote with her husband several non-fiction books of practical advice geared toward fellow members of the LDS Church. These include titles such as &quot;Ward Activities for the Clueless&quot;, &quot;Food Storage for the Clueless&quot;, &quot;On My Own and Clueless: An LDS Guide to Independent Life&quot;, and &quot;A Parent&#x27;s Survival Guide to the Internet&quot;. The Kidds jointly authored &quot;A Convert&#x27;s Guide to Mormon Life&quot;, which won an Association of Mormon Letters Award for devotional literature. They also collaborated on a large number of articles for &quot;Meridian&quot;.

Kidd also wrote a few comedic novels about life among members of the church, including &quot;Paradise Vue&quot; and &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, and children&#x27;s books such as &quot;The Innkeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Kidd was a longtime friend of Orson Scott Card. In 1989, Card started up a Mormon publishing company with his wife and brother, called &quot;Hatrack River Publications.&quot; Card approached Kidd to provide a novel that fit the company&#x27;s themes. Kidd&#x27;s novel &quot;Paradise Vue&quot; became its first publication. Other collaboration with Card included co-authoring &quot;Lovelock&quot;, the first part of a proposed trilogy.

=== Lovelock ===

&quot;Lovelock&quot; is a speculative science fiction novel co-written by both Kidd and Orson Scott Card. The novel is narrated by a scientist who takes the name of real scientist James Lovelock. The novel examines the Gaia Hypothesis through the lens of Lovelock, who is a genetically-enhanced capuchin monkey. Lovelock the monkey is assigned to examine the lives of several humans on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot; spacecraft, and in the process becomes more humanized and rebellious.

Kidd passed away before the second installment, &quot;Rasputin,&quot; could be published.

=== Paradise Vue ===
&quot;Paradise Vue&quot; takes place in an LDS ward congregation. Beneath their perfectionist façade, the Church members in Kidd&#x27;s novel exhibit cruel, dark, and obsessive tendencies. The novel is a comedic LDS fiction piece.

<text>Northstar (Jean-Paul Beaubier) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979) as a member of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight.

Northstar is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. The character possesses the ability to travel at superhuman speeds, fly, and project photonic energy blasts. His twin sister, Aurora, possesses similar abilities. Although the character was initially depicted as a member of Alpha Flight, he has appeared regularly as a member of the X-Men since joining the team of mutants in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #414 (December 2002).

The character is one of the first openly gay superheroes in American comic books, and the first openly gay character to come out in a book published by Marvel Comics. He married his husband, Kyle Jinadu, in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #51 (June 2012), which was the first depiction of a same-sex wedding in mainstream comics.

==Publication history==
===1979–1994===
Northstar debuted in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979) as part of the Canadian government sponsored team Alpha Flight, who sought to take Wolverine of the X-Men into custody. In 1983, Alpha Flight went on to star in its own comic, with Northstar as a charter member. In addition to the &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; comic and associated annuals, Northstar and other members of the team made numerous guest appearances in other titles, particularly &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;Wolverine&quot;. Northstar was also featured in miniseries including two &quot;X-Men and Alpha Flight&quot; series and &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;.

Creator John Byrne was reluctant to produce an initial run of the 1983 &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; comic series for lack of developed and compelling characters. They had no back-stories and were created as nothing more than a team to face the X-Men. So in order to make the team less two-dimensional and more developed, Northstar&#x27;s sexual orientation was subtly introduced into the start of the new &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; series. Although Byrne had intended the character to be gay, he was restricted to implied hints of this fact, due to Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter&#x27;s policy against openly homosexual characters, and by the Comics Code Authority. For example, in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #18, when Northstar&#x27;s residence is called by Heather Hudson, a half-naked man in swim trunks who had been swimming with Northstar answers the phone, while in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #41, Northstar&#x27;s sister Aurora says to her brother, &quot;Since when do you object to having attractively-dressed men about, my brother?&quot; Northstar&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in women was implied to be due to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion, and writer Bill Mantlo&#x27;s later attempt to reveal that Northstar had AIDS was squelched. In &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #106 (1992), writer Scott Lobdell was finally given permission to have Northstar state, &quot;I am gay.&quot;

As the first major, openly gay character created by Marvel Comics, Northstar generated significant publicity in the mainstream press, and &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #106 sold out in a week, although the series was not a very popular title. It is the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. The event was also controversial, and almost no mention was made of his sexual orientation for the remainder of the first &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; series, which ended with issue #130 in 1994. One exception was a subplot in which his sister Aurora—experiencing a split personality—accepted his homosexuality in one personality, while rejecting it in the other. After the cancellation of &quot;Alpha Flight,&quot; Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which uses his mutancy as allegory and sexuality as subtext. Interactions between Northstar and other gay characters have been depicted, such as in a &quot;Marvel Swimsuit Special&quot;, in which he is shown socializing with the gay Pantheon member Hector.

===1994–present===
After the 1994 cancellation of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, Northstar starred in an eponymous four issue limited series. In 1997, a second on-going series of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; was initiated. Northstar was not a member of this group, but appeared in later issues searching for his missing sister Aurora. He featured in eight issues before the series cancellation with issue #20.

In 2005, Marvel killed Northstar in three separate continuities within the space of one calendar month. Between February 16 and March 9, 2005, versions of Northstar were killed in the Earth-616-based &quot;Wolverine&quot; #25, and in &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; (a possible story of the X-Men&#x27;s final days; Northstar was one of many to die in the series), both of which were set in alternate timelines. Northstar did not stay dead long in Marvel&#x27;s primary continuity, as he is resurrected in &quot;Wolverine&quot; #26.

When Northstar rejoined the X-Men as a regular member in 2002, writers were less hesitant to address his sexual orientation. Northstar even experienced a crush on long-time X-Man Iceman, though it was unrequited. One of his students in the Alpha Squadron, Victor Borkowski, the gay mutant Anole, looks up to him as a role model. When Northstar rejoined the X-Men yet again in 2009, he was revealed to be in a relationship with his sports company&#x27;s events manager Kyle. Their relationship faces strain from the remaining mutants&#x27; exodus to the mutant island Utopia, though the two agree to work through their issues. It was later implied that he also had a sexual relationship with Hercules at an unspecified point in time.

Northstar and Kyle&#x27;s marriage in issue #51 of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, drew attention from the right-wing group One Million Moms.

== Fictional character biography ==

Jean-Paul Beaubier is born to a French Canadian family in Montreal. After his parents die in an automobile accident during his childhood, he and his twin sister, Jeanne-Marie, are separated. Jean-Paul is adopted, but his adopted parents are killed after only a couple of years. Before his debut as a superhero, Beaubier competes as a professional skier (reaching elite level skier as a teenager, prior to his mutation surfacing). Once he develops his mutant abilities he becomes virtually unbeatable and eventually bores of the sport due to the lack of competition. He becomes an angry and rebellious youth. In young adulthood he joins the Front de libération du Québec (a militant separatist movement for Quebec from Canada) but soon becomes disgusted with, and renounces, the group&#x27;s violent tactics. He learns of a superhero group financed by the Canadian government called: &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;.

===Alpha Flight===
Jean-Paul joins Alpha Flight, adopting the codename Northstar. There he is reunited with his sister Jeanne-Marie (&quot;Aurora&quot;). Northstar&#x27;s comic debut occurs in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120, as a member of Alpha Flight fighting the X-Men to capture former teammate Wolverine. When Northstar meets his old friend Raymond Belmonde (a man who took him in and mentored him) he introduces Aurora to Belmonde, only for the twins to be attacked by local crime boss Deadly Ernest, who kills Belmonde. The twins deal with the villain, though their relationship sours when Northstar offends Aurora by asking if she had &quot;romanced her way to safety&quot;. Aurora refuses to speak to him, and her lover and teammate Sasquatch assists in a power alteration, allowing her to generate light without Northstar. Her attempts to isolate him cause Northstar to quit Alpha Flight. Later, Aurora seeks him out &amp; the twins begin to reconcile, but Aurora rejects him again after discovering his FLQ history. Alpha Flight cross-examine him about his FLQ activities, but are interrupted by an emergency. When Sasquatch dies, the twins reconcile after Northstar comforts his grieving sister. However, during a confrontation with the Hulk, Aurora discovers that her power alterations cause the twins to negate one another&#x27;s abilities upon touching. After the battle, Northstar rejoins Alpha Flight.

While on a skiing vacation, Northstar must expose his mutant powers to save a woman&#x27;s life. Accused of using his powers to cheat in competition and realizing he could never know if he subconsciously had, he relinquishes his medals and bitterly turns his back on skiing.

The villain Pestilence senses decay in Northstar&#x27;s body and causes his sickness to grow serious to the point that his wounds no longer heal, slowly killing him. As his illness progresses, Aurora desperately uses her healing light to cure him. The Asgardian Loki fools the Beaubier twins into believing that their mother was an elf from Asgard. When Aurora is thought lost in action, Northstar travels to Asgard (seeking this heritage) but is trapped there. Loki had sent a depowered Aurora to a convent (in an attempt to appease &quot;Those Who Sit Above In Shadow&quot;). When a supernatural threat mobilizes Alpha Flight, the sorceress Talisman sends Aurora to Asgard to rescue Northstar. He shares the light with her, restoring their powers (allowing both to independently generate light).

During another battle, Northstar discovers an abandoned baby girl. Doctors discover that she is dying of AIDS, after HIV infection in the womb. Jean-Paul adopts her and names her Joanne Beaubier. Alpha Flight perform various events to remind the public of AIDS and the dangers of silence about it. Her death weeks later spurs Northstar to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, hoping that, as a gay celebrity, he can increase media attention on HIV/AIDS safety and prevention. Eventually Northstar leaves Alpha Flight and writes a memoir about his experience as a mutant and gay man entitled &quot;Born Normal&quot;.

===X-Men===
In the 2001 &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; story arc, Northstar is briefly recruited to an improvized team of X-Men by Jean Grey to rescue Professor X, who has been captured by Magneto and is being kept prisoner in Genosha. Jean meets Northstar at a book-signing appearance, where he is mobbed. One person in the crowd turns out to be carrying a gun. Northstar foils his own assassination attempt at super-speed. Later, he meets one of the new mutants, an invulnerable young man called &quot;Omerta&quot;, whose extreme homophobia leads to an actual fight between the two on X-Men&#x27;s mansion driveway.

At Professor Xavier&#x27;s request, Northstar then works with the X-Men to save the life of a mutant child who cannot stop exploding. Despite his speed, Northstar cannot save the boy, who perishes simply because of his powers. Soon afterwards, Northstar officially joins the X-Men, and becomes an instructor at the Xavier Institute, teaching business, economics, French, and superpowered flight classes. Northstar becomes a mentor to his own squad of young mutants, Alpha Squadron, and forms a close mentor relationship with student Anole. During his time at Xavier&#x27;s, he forms a close friendship with Annie Ghazikhanian, a former nurse at the Xavier Institute. Annie realizes that Northstar has developed an attraction to Bobby Drake. Bobby remains oblivious, despite Northstar, who was currently sick, saving him from the misguided anger of a jealous mutant.

When HYDRA forms an alliance with the cults the Dawn of the White Light and the Hand, the groups start recruiting new agents from the superhero community by killing, resurrecting, and brainwashing them. The X-Man Wolverine is one of their victims, brainwashed into becoming a HYDRA assassin. He eventually attacks the X-Men and kills Northstar. One of the New Mutants, Elixir, manages to heal Northstar&#x27;s wounds but is unable to revive him. A few days later a statue of Northstar is placed in a garden of statues of fallen X-Men on the campus grounds. S.H.I.E.L.D. requests that Northstar be decapitated (to prevent resurrection) but his corpse is stolen by Elektra, another brainwashed victim of HYDRA. A resurrected Northstar leads an attack with Elektra on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, crippling S.H.I.E.L.D. and putting Nick Fury in critical condition. Northstar also takes the time to kill racists and homophobes all across the country, and uses his regained &#x27;flash&#x27; ability to generate a brief blinding light. Wolverine meets Northstar, but is taken prisoner by the other Dawn of the White Light mutants, all of whom he kills except for Northstar. When Northstar refuses to tell Wolverine the location of HYDRA&#x27;s command center, Wolverine knocks him out asks S.H.I.E.L.D. to psychologically &quot;deprogram&quot; him.

Not long afterward, the mysterious Children of the Vault abduct Northstar from the S.H.I.E.L.D. holding facility, to use him to kill Sabretooth and the X-Men. They easily are able to control Northstar due to the Hand&#x27;s previous mental manipulations. Under their control he finds his sister about to commit suicide and stops her so that The Children can mentally control her too. Together they attack the school under The Children&#x27;s command and make quick work of several X-Men, notably Iceman and Anole, whose encounter with Northstar briefly shakes him from mind-control. Leaving Aurora to battle the X-Men, Northstar begins a search for Sabretooth but is stopped by Rogue and Cable. The X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier to try to fix their mental damage. Using their V.R. equipment the X-Men allow the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace. The process is interrupted near the end of the session by Exodus, creating a telepathic connection between the twins. Using each other&#x27;s emotional support they apparently manage to face their inner turmoils. This gives both more control of their powers.

=== X-Men split and reformation ===

Northstar is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole (who is in hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to PTSD from his X-Mansion experiences). Northstar discovers Anole in a tree, the teenager not too happy to see his former mentor. Jean-Paul thinks Victor is having a problem with fitting in, as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Victor explains that his town accepts him for who he is – his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for stealing the New X-Men&#x27;s innocence. Just before departing, he elbows Jean-Paul in the face – similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past – and says that the New X-Men shouldn&#x27;t look for him.

Northstar and his sister Aurora respond to Emma Frost&#x27;s telepathic APB and fight alongside the X-Men in San Francisco against the Skrulls when they invade Earth. However, Northstar also makes a life for himself outside of superheroics, having returned to being a star at extreme snowsports, as well as starting his own brand of snow sporting equipment and becoming involved in a relationship. Wolverine approaches Jean-Paul to rejoin the X-Men as its speedster. After confirming that he wouldn&#x27;t be a token gay member, he accepts. While training Surge in super-speed, Northstar stops to give an interview, where he learns of Simon Trask&#x27;s Proposition X (a Mutant Breeding Act Ballot Initiative). He runs back to the X-Men and threatens to quit and go back to Canada. However, he remains with the X-Men throughout several missions, including confrontations with Norman Osborn&#x27;s Dark X-Men and a rescue mission to retrieve Illyana Rasputin after she is banished to Limbo during the events of &quot;Second Coming&quot;.

A temporal copy of Northstar—from shortly before the apparent death of Guardian at the hands of Jerry Jaxon—was introduced near the end of the third &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; series, along with an entire team of early Alpha Flight members. This Northstar is last seen with a similarly time-displaced Aurora, still operating in the Earth-616 present.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Northstar alongside Aurora, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood, and they reform Alpha Flight.

== Powers and abilities ==
Northstar is a mutant who can move and fly at superhuman speed with the potential of reaching near light speeds. He also possesses superhuman stamina, endurance (both essential to maintain super-speed for any length of time), and reflexes. He can channel a portion of the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in his body&#x27;s molecules in a single direction, accelerating his body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy he has tapped. Northstar also has an advanced equilibrium, and exceptional agility, reaction time, and coordination which allows for him to make sharp turns, and run at such speeds without becoming sick. Northstar is also able to punch at great speeds, which grants him the ability to hurt even the Hulk. In an early issue of Alpha Flight Northstar reveals to readers that his sister Aurora has greater endurance and can fly longer, whereas he can fly faster in the same amount of time. Northstar can create cyclones by running in circles, can run up walls and across water, and can breathe while traveling at supersonic speeds. However, if Northstar wanted to travel with someone else at superhuman speeds, they would need a breathing apparatus to keep from asphyxiating.

As a side effect of partially robbing his molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules have increased, which enhances the sheer toughness of Northstar&#x27;s entire body. This effect gives his skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury, but the upper limit of this ability has not been measured. It had once been theorized that Northstar could fly at 99% of the speed of light: , although this has never been attempted because he would do irreparable damage to the environment. While Northstar can withstand Mach 10 speeds, traveling any faster would carry complications with breathing and damage caused by wind and air resistance to his body. When Aurora, his sister, and Northstar are in contact with each other, usually by holding hands, they can also vary the rate of acceleration of his molecules to release a cascade of photons creating a momentary burst of light equal to one million candela which they use to blind their opponents. The only other minor drawback to this ability, other than he and his sister having to be in contact with each other to utilize this gift, is that they are unable to adjust the brilliance of the flash. After being captured by the Children of the Vault in the Supernovas arc of Mike Carey&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot;, his and Aurora&#x27;s powers have been enhanced to the point where they can now move at light speed without harm and can generate explosive thermal energy in addition to light.

Northstar is a world-class professional skier, skilled trapeze artist, business man, and an accomplished novelist. A native French speaker, he is also fluent in English. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant using a style utilizing his superhuman speed, and received coaching from his teammate Puck. After his resurrection by the Hand, Northstar has been trained in the martial arts. Northstar also has peak human strength, but has superhuman strength in his legs.

Northstar wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric made of special materials for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Stacie Rook of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said, &quot;Northstar married his husband in the comics in 2012, in what was the first depiction of a same-sex wedding in Marvel Comics. His position as the first openly gay Marvel character is important for the history of representation, and an on-screen portrayal of him would be a great way to honor that milestone.&quot;

=== Volumes ===
The issue of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; in which Northstar came out was hugely popular. &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that a store on Bleecker Street in New York City resorted to making customers who wanted to buy a copy of it to purchase a second comic as well. Later, they changed the policy to require that everyone who bought a copy had to buy an issue of the series &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot; as well. The store claimed they did this to prevent hoarding of the comic. The policy was in effect for thirty minutes until the store was all sold out. In the end, they have received only one complaint.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Northstar and Aurora are part of Mr. Sinister&#x27;s Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, are assigned to patrolling the breeding pens.

When the E.M.F.&#x27;s leader, Cyclops, switches sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he is caught in the act by the speeding twins. However, both of them are defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happens to be Polaris.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the Marvel Zombies comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified Alpha Flight attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by Magneto. Northstar is seen in a panel of Marvel Zombies Dead Days attacking the X-Man Storm alongside his sister Aurora. The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, his features are similar to his original counterpart, although his ears are no longer pointed. He can also move at super-speed, though he has yet to demonstrate the ability to fly, or any abilities related to light emission.

A student at New York City&#x27;s Stuyvesant High School, Northstar is kicked off the school&#x27;s track team for suspected illegal steroid use. In fact, his unnatural levels of speed are actually due to his mutation. When the X-Men reveal to him he is a mutant and ask him to join them, he turns them down, saying that separating themselves from humans is segregation and noting how a student there (Beast) had been recently killed.

Soon after, Mister Sinister, a deranged man who is apparently under orders of Apocalypse to kill ten mutants, shoots Northstar. Thanks to his quick reflexes, Northstar manages to survive the attack but is left in a coma. After being hospitalized, he is awakened from his coma by the X-Man Jean Grey. Upon being told that Colossus had watched over him all night to protect him from any further attacks, Northstar asks if Colossus is single, startling Colossus so much that his body involuntarily turns to steel.

Northstar is later recruited by Emma Frost to join the Academy of Tomorrow, a magnet school for gifted children both mutant and human with a more pacifistic and integrationist philosophy than the X-Men. Along with fellow students Lorna Dane and Alex Summers, he completes Frost&#x27;s Advanced Leadership Workshop, allowing him to make use of his powers performing off-campus community service missions in conjunction with local authorities. When Lorna is framed for murder and imprisoned in the Triskelion (the headquarters of the Ultimates), in an elaborate scheme by Magneto to help him escape the prison, Northstar is part of the group of Frost&#x27;s students who try to break her out. During a battle with the Ultimates and the X-Men, he shows that he has improved his abilities enough to move faster than the human eye (allowing him to attack without being seen), run across water (though a direct hit from a super-powered person could cause him to sink), and resist gravity (he is able to run up the side of a tall building).

During the battle he shows romantic interest in Colossus, and a week later it is revealed that the two have kept in contact, having exchanged email addresses. Colossus is shown on the phone talking to Northstar, who asks Colossus to be his date to his school&#x27;s homecoming dance (which he accepts). But the dance is interrupted by the Brotherhood. After the supposed death of Charles Xavier, Colossus agrees to temporarily live with Northstar at his school.

During a softball game between the Academy of Tomorrow and the Xavier School, Ultimate Alpha Flight shows up to kidnap Northstar. Aurora makes her debut, revealing herself to be Northstar&#x27;s sister. She physically takes him against his will. Later, Colossus, Cyclops, Rogue, Angel, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler break into Alpha Flight&#x27;s base to rescue him. After they incapacitate Alpha Flight, Colossus finds Northstar overdosing on the mutant drug, Banshee, resulting in him being crippled from the waist down.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
In the alternate future of &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, Northstar is one of many members of the staff of the Xavier Institute. He briefly survives the destruction of it and several surrounding miles, only to die in Scott Summers&#x27; arms. As he passes on, he sees a vision of his Alpha Flight friends, leading is his sister, who encourages him to leave his body.

===House of M===
In the alternate reality created by the Scarlet Witch known as House of M, Northstar is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency&#x27;s junior training squad program. Much like the rest of the super-powered community in House of M, Northstar supported this reality&#x27;s Magneto and his mutant-supremacy platform.

===Age of X===
In the alternate timeline seen in the &quot;Age of X&quot; storyline, Jean-Paul was on the first team of Fortress X defenders to attack Kitty Pryde when she breached the barriers, while Jean-Paul wants revenge for his sister&#x27;s murder.

===What If?===

In &quot;What If Scott Summers and Jean Gray Got Married Sooner?&quot;, their leaving inspired the rest of the original X-Men to leave the X-Men as well and seek lives in the outside world. Professor X recruited Northstar as part of a new team, along with Aurora, Storm, Colossus and Catseye. This new team unfortunately died fighting the living island Krakoa. Sunfire and the Avengers defeated it, and found their bodies.

In &quot;What If Wolverine was Leader of Alpha Flight?&quot;, Northstar was responsible for Wolverine staying in Canada after his capture by government forces. This story diverged from the story in X-Men 120–121, where Alpha Flight was assigned to capture Wolverine and return him to the service of Canada. As in the mainstream reality, the X-Men (Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, Banshee and their associate Colleen Wing) flew off, but here, Wolverine did not escape custody and slip aboard the plane. They circled back to attempt a rescue. The Canadian government tried to call Alpha Flight to handle things before they were forced into military intervention, but Northstar was on monitor duty and refused to take the call (presumably in anger that Cyclops had just beaten him in combat before Wolverine surrendered). Left with no other alternative, the Canadian military shot the X-Men down. None of them survived the crash. James McDonald Hudson learned what Northstar did and concealed it from Wolverine. Left without his new family, Wolverine chose to return to his first one: Alpha Flight. He led the team well, but Northstar was constantly nervous around Wolverine, fearing his wrath if he ever learned the truth. Wolverine did in fact learn- the team battled the Hellfire Club, and Jean Gray as Dark Phoenix revealed the truth. She wanted Wolverine to kill Northstar, but he killed her instead to free her. He forgave Northstar&#x27;s role in the deaths of his friends and stayed on as leader of Alpha Flight. Northstar became a mainstay of the team once the threat of disembowelment no longer hung over him.

<text>The Serengeti National Park is a large national park in northern Tanzania that stretches over . It is located in eastern Mara Region and northeastern Simiyu Region and contains over of virgin savanna. The park was established in 1940.

The Serengeti is well known for the largest annual animal migration in the world of over 1.5 million blue wildebeest and 250,000 zebra along with smaller herds of Thomson&#x27;s gazelle and eland. The national park is also home to the largest lion population in Africa. It is under threat from deforestation, population growth, poaching, and ranching.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Serengeti&quot; is often attributed to a Maasai word &quot;siringet&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where the land runs on forever&quot; or &quot;endless plains&quot;. However, this word does not appear in dictionaries of the language. 

== History ==
In 1930, an area of was designated as a game reserve in southern and eastern Serengeti. In the 1930s, the government of Tanganyika established a system of national parks compliant with the Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State.

In 1930, major Richard Hingdston, visiting Tanganyika on a mission from the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire (SPFE), proposed that the Serengeti Game Reserve be designated as a national park to ensure its protection from the pressures of population growth and economic development. 

The area became a national park in 1940. It was granted strict protection in 1948 when the Serengeti National Park Board of Trustees was formed to administer the national park. The government restricted the movements of the resident Maasai people, and the park boundaries were finalized in 1951. In 1959, an area of was split off in the eastern part of the national park and re-established as Ngorongoro Conservation Area intended to accommodate the traditional land use interests of the Maasai people in a multiple land use area. 

In 1966 Serengeti Research Institute at Seronera was established to monitor and research the Great Migration. 

In 1981, the Serengeti National Park covered , which was less than half of the Serengeti.

The Serengeti gained fame after Bernhard Grzimek and his son Michael produced a book and documentary titled &quot;Serengeti Shall Not Die&quot; in 1959.

==Wildlife==
Serengeti National Park forms a Lion Conservation Unit since 2005 together with Maasai Mara National Reserve.
More than 3,000 lions live in this ecosystem. In 1994, an outbreak of canine distemper led to the deaths of approximately one-third of the lion population in the area. 

The population density of the African leopard is estimated at 5.41 individuals per 100 km2 (14.0 per 100 sq miles) in the dry season.

African bush elephant herds recovered from a population low in the 1980s caused by poaching, and numbered over 5,000 individuals by 2014. The African buffalo population declined between 1976 and 1996 due to poaching, but increased to 28,524 individuals by 2008. The Eastern black rhinoceros population was reduced to about 10 individuals in the 1980s due to poaching, and fewer than 70 individuals survive in the park today. Rhinos mostly browse on grasses, woody &quot;Indigofera&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Crotalaria&quot; forbs and shrubs.

Other mammal carnivores include the cheetah, about 3,500 spotted hyena, black-backed jackal, African golden wolf, honey badger, striped hyena, caracal, serval, banded mongoose, and two species of otters. The African wild dog was returned to the area in 2012 after disappearing in 1991. Other mammals include hippopotamus, common warthog, aardvark, aardwolf, African wildcat, African civet, common genet, zorilla, African striped weasel, bat-eared fox, ground pangolin, crested porcupine, three species of hyraxes and Cape hare. Primates such as yellow and olive baboons, vervet monkey, and mantled guereza are also seen in the gallery forests of the Grumeti River.

Reptiles include Nile crocodile, leopard tortoise, serrated hinged terrapin, rainbow agama, Nile monitor, Jackson&#x27;s chameleon, African python, black mamba, black-necked spitting cobra, and puff adder.

More than 500 bird species can be seen such as Masai ostrich, secretarybird, kori bustards, helmeted guineafowls, grey-breasted spurfowl, blacksmith lapwing, African collared dove, red-billed buffalo weaver, southern ground hornbill, crowned cranes, sacred ibis, cattle egrets, black herons, knob-billed ducks, saddle-billed storks, white stork, goliath herons, marabou storks, yellow-billed stork, spotted thick-knees, lesser flamingo, shoebills, abdim&#x27;s stork, hamerkops, hadada ibis, african fish eagles, pink-backed pelicans, tanzanian red-billed hornbill, martial eagles, egyptian geese, lovebirds, spur-winged geese, oxpeckers, and many species of vultures.

=== Great migration ===
The great migration is the world&#x27;s second longest overland migration. The complete migration route is around . South of this migration route covers the Ngorongoro Conservation Area where around half a million wildebeest are born between January and March. By March, at the beginning of the dry season, roughly 1.5 million wildebeest and 250,000 zebras start to migrate north towards Maasai Mara in Kenya. Common eland, plains zebra, and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle join the wildebeest. In April and May, the migrating herds pass through the Western Corridor. To get to the Maasai Mara, the herds have to cross the Grumeti and Mara Rivers, where around 3,000 crocodiles lie in wait. For every wildebeest captured by the crocodiles, 50 drown. When the dry season ends in late October, the migrating herds start to head back south. Around 250,000 wildebeests and 30,000 plains zebras die annually from drowning, predation, exhaustion, thirst, or disease.

==Geology==

The basement complex consists of Archaen Nyanzian System greenstones (2.81–2.63 Ga in age), Archaean granite-gneiss plutons (2.72–2.56 Ga in age), which were uplifted 180 Ma ago, forming koppies and elongated hills, the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt consisting of quartzite and granite, and the Neoproterozoic Ikorongo Group, consisting of sandstone, shale and siltstone that form linear ridges. The southeast portion of the park contains Neogene-aged volcanic rock and Oldoinyo Lengai Holocene-aged volcanic ash. The Grumeti, Mara, Mbalageti, and Orangi rivers flow westward to Lake Victoria, while the Oldupai River flows eastward into the Olbalbal Swamps.

In the eastern portion of the park lie the Serengeti volcanic grasslands which are a Tropical Grassland Ecozone. The grasslands grow on deposits of volcanic ash from the Kerimasi Volcano, which erupted 150,000 years ago, and also from the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcanic eruptions, which created layers of calcareous tuff and calcitic hard-pan soil (vertisols) from rapid weathering of the natrocarbonatite lava produced by the volcanoes.

==Geography==

The park covers of grassland plains, savanna, riverine forest, and woodlands. The park lies in northwestern Tanzania, bordered to the north by the Kenyan border, where it is continuous with the Maasai Mara National Reserve. To the southeast of the park is the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, to the southwest lies Maswa Game Reserve, to the west are the Ikorongo and Grumeti Game Reserves, and to the northeast and east lies the Loliondo Game Control Area.

The landscape of the Serengeti Plain is extremely varied, ranging from savannah to hilly woodlands to open grasslands. The region&#x27;s geographic diversity is due to the extreme weather conditions that plague the area, particularly the potent combination of heat and wind. The diverse habitats in the region may have originated from a series of volcanoes, whose activity shaped the basic geographic features of the plain by adding mountains and craters to the landscape.

The Mara River, which flows through Maasai Mara National Reserve from the Kenyan highlands to Lake Victoria, is the only permanently-flowing river in the Serengeti ecosystem.

The park is divided into three regions:
* Serengeti plains: The best-known feature of the Serengeti is the almost treeless grassland in the south. It has koppies, granite formations that serve as observation posts for predators. The Volcanic Grasslands is an edaphic plant community that grows on soils derived from volcanic ash from nearby volcanoes.
* Western corridor: The main geographic feature is the pair of rivers, Grumeti and Mbalageti. There are big groups of riverine forest and some small mountain ranges. The great migration passes through the corridor from May to July. It stretches to Lake Victoria. The area is flatter than the northern parts of the park and more densely covered with plants than the southern plains.
*Northern Serengeti: the landscape is dominated by open woodlands, predominantly Commiphora and hills, ranging from Seronera in the south to the Mara River on the Kenyan border. It is remote and relatively inaccessible. 

Human habitation is forbidden in the park except for the Tanzania National Parks Authority staff, researchers and staff of the various lodges, campsites, and hotels. The main settlement is Seronera with its primary Seronera airstrip. 

==Administration and protection==

The park is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a World Heritage Site. It is designated as a Category II protected area under the system developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which means that it should be managed to protect the ecosystem or ecological processes.

The administrative body for all parks in Tanzania is the Tanzania National Parks Authority. Myles Turner was one of the park&#x27;s first game wardens and is credited with bringing its rampant poaching under control.

== Threats ==
Deforestation in the Mau Forest region has changed the hydrology of the Mara River. There are invasive species of plants such as Siam weed, Prickly pear, Feverfew and Mexican sunflower. A study in 1996 estimated that the human population of the western side of the park is growing by four percent yearly. Livestock use is also growing which increased the amount of land turned over to farming and ranching. A study by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in 2001 estimated that roughly 200,000 animals are killed by poaching every year.

Between 2005 and 2012 the government considered building a 452-km highway through the park, a proposal revived in 2024. The idea sparked significant controversy. Advocates argued that the road would improve connectivity and alleviate poverty in northern Tanzania, while conservationists warn of severe ecological impacts, including disruption of the wildebeest migration and potential ecosystem collapse. Alternatives, such as southern routes bypassing the park, have been proposed as less harmful options that could benefit more people while preserving the park&#x27;s integrity.

<text>The ortolan (Emberiza hortulana), also called ortolan bunting, is a Eurasian bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a passerine family now separated by most modern scholars from the finches, Fringillidae. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Alemannic German , a bunting. The specific name &quot;hortulana&quot; is from the Italian name for this bird, . The English &quot;ortolan&quot; is derived from Middle French , &quot;gardener&quot;.

The ortolan is served in French cuisine, typically cooked and eaten whole. Traditionally diners cover their heads with their napkin or a towel while eating the delicacy. The bird is so widely used that its French populations dropped dangerously low, leading to laws restricting its use in 1999. In September 2007, the French government announced its intent to enforce long-ignored laws protecting the bird.

==Taxonomy==
The ortolan bunting was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and retains its original binomial name of &quot;Emberiza hortulana&quot;. The species is monotypic. A molecular phylogenetic study of the buntings published in 2008 found that the ortolan bunting is most closely related to Cretzschmar&#x27;s bunting (&quot;Emberiza caesia&quot;).

==Description==
The ortolan bunting is in length and has a wing-span of . In appearance and habits it much resembles its relative the yellowhammer, but lacks the bright colouring of that species; the ortolan&#x27;s head, for instance, is greenish-grey, instead of a bright yellow. The song of the male ortolan resembles that of the yellowhammer.

==Distribution and habitat==
A native of most European countries and West Asia, it reaches as far north as Scandinavia and beyond the Arctic Circle, frequenting cornfields and their neighbourhoods. It is an uncommon vagrant in spring, and particularly autumn, to the British Isles. Sightings in the UK are less common than they were, owing to the species&#x27; population decline due to overexploitation in France.

It was spotted at Kenjar Coastal Karnataka, India, in November 2018 and photographed by birdwatchers. Some birders commented that it is the first photographic record of an ortolan bunting in India.

==Behaviour==
Ortolan nests are placed on or near the ground.

The maximum age recorded is six years and ten months for a bird found dead in Switzerland.

Seeds are the natural diet, but beetles and other insects are taken when feeding their young.

==Culinary use==
The birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa. They are then kept in covered cages or boxes. They react to the dark by gorging themselves on grain, usually millet seed, until they double their bulk. They are then suspended upside down over a container of Armagnac, and by dipping, made to drown, and then marinated in the brandy.

The birds are then plucked, salted and peppered and cooked in their own fat for seven minutes. Many consumers of this dish then place the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird&#x27;s head. They eat the ortolan whole, with or without the head, and some may spit out the larger bones, while others eat the whole bird head, bones and all. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, while according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Tradition dictates that [the towel] is to shield – from God&#x27;s eyes – the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act&quot;, and others have suggested the towel simply hides the consumers spitting out bones. This use of the towel was begun by a priest, a friend of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.

At one time, the island of Cyprus formed a chief depot for the export of ortolans, which were pickled in spices and vinegar and packed in casks containing from 300 to 400 each. In the early 20th century, between 400 and 500 casks were annually exported from Cyprus.

===Noted meals===
* The Three Emperors Dinner in 1867 included ortolans on toast among its 16 courses. 
* The favourite dish of medicine Nobel laureate and inventor of the lobotomy procedure, António Egas Moniz, was ortolans as prepared at the restaurant Le Chapon Fin in Bordeaux.
* In the 1958 film &quot;Gigi&quot;, which begins in the year 1900, Gigi&#x27;s aunt instructs her in gourmet dining, including one particular scene of the consumption of ortolans.
* In 1975, food critic Craig Claiborne made a winning $300 bid in an auction for a dinner for two, courtesy of American Express, at any restaurant in the world that takes its credit card. Claiborne selected Chez Denis in Paris for a $4,000 meal ($20,665 in 2022) that included a course of ortolans.
* In 1995, former French President François Mitterrand&#x27;s last New Year&#x27;s Eve meal included this specially prepared bird.
* Bill Cosby describes eating ortolan in an Italian restaurant on his 1973 album &quot;Fat Albert&quot;.

==Legal status==
Ortolan hunting was banned in France in 1999, but the law was poorly enforced and it is thought that up to 50,000 ortolans were illegally killed each year during the autumn migration: mostly birds from breeding grounds in Finland and the Baltic area. According to France&#x27;s League for the Protection of Birds, France&#x27;s ortolan population fell 30% between 1997 and 2007. In 2007, the French government vowed to strictly enforce some existing rules about banning the practice, with the maximum fine set at €6,000 (£4,800 or $6,728). Killing and cooking ortolans is banned across the EU. In 2007, the pressure from France&#x27;s League for Protection of Birds and from the European Union resulted in the French government promising to enforce the EU directive protecting the ortolan. After several years of active citizen watch revealing little if any change in the field situation, the local representative of the government repeated this statement in 2016.

European Union member states prohibit:
* deliberate killing or capture of these birds by any method; 
* deliberate destruction of, or damage to, their nests and eggs or removal of their nests; 
* taking their eggs in the wild and keeping these eggs; 
* deliberate disturbance of these birds particularly during the period of breeding and rearing, insofar as this would have a significant negative effect on the birds; 
* keeping birds, the hunting and capture of which is prohibited; 
* sale, transport for sale, keeping for sale and the offering for sale of live or dead birds and of any readily recognizable parts or derivatives of these birds.

As of 2018, the overall ortolan bunting&#x27;s population is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern (LC). However, a 2019 study using stable isotopes, archival light geologgers, and population genetics suggests the species is in decline.

<doc id="60972" wikidata="Q577094" url="?curid=60972" title="Simple API for XML">
<text>SAX (Simple API for XML) is an event-driven online algorithm for lexing and parsing XML documents, with an API developed by the XML-DEV mailing list. SAX provides a mechanism for reading data from an XML document that is an alternative to that provided by the Document Object Model (DOM). Where the DOM operates on the document as a whole—building the full abstract syntax tree of an XML document for convenience of the user—SAX parsers operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially, issuing parsing events while making a single pass through the input stream.

== Definition ==
Unlike DOM, there is no formal specification for SAX. The Java implementation of SAX is considered to be normative. SAX processes documents state-independently, in contrast to DOM which is used for state-dependent processing of XML documents.

== Benefits ==
A SAX parser only needs to report each parsing event as it happens, and normally discards almost all of that information once reported (it does, however, keep some things, for example a list of all elements that have not been closed yet, in order to catch later errors such as end-tags in the wrong order). Thus, the minimum memory required for a SAX parser is proportional to the maximum depth of the XML file (i.e., of the XML tree) and the maximum data involved in a single XML event (such as the name and attributes of a single start-tag, or the content of a processing instruction, etc.).

This much memory is usually considered negligible. A DOM parser, in contrast, has to build a tree representation of the entire document in memory to begin with, thus using memory that increases with the entire document length. This takes considerable time and space for large documents (memory allocation and data-structure construction take time). The compensating advantage, of course, is that once loaded &quot;any&quot; part of the document can be accessed in any order.

Because of the event-driven nature of SAX, processing documents is generally far faster than DOM-style parsers, &quot;so long as&quot; the processing can be done in a start-to-end pass. Many tasks, such as indexing, conversion to other formats, very simple formatting and the like can be done that way. Other tasks, such as sorting, rearranging sections, getting from a link to its target, looking up information on one element to help process a later one and the like require accessing the document structure in complex orders and will be much faster with DOM than with multiple SAX passes.

Some implementations do not neatly fit either category: a DOM approach can keep its persistent data on disk, cleverly organized for speed (editors such as SoftQuad Author/Editor and large-document browser/indexers such as DynaText do this); while a SAX approach can cleverly cache information for later use (any validating SAX parser keeps more information than described above). Such implementations blur the DOM/SAX tradeoffs, but are often very effective in practice.

Due to the nature of DOM, streamed reading from disk requires techniques such as lazy evaluation, caches, virtual memory, persistent data structures, or other techniques (one such technique is disclosed in US patent 5557722). Processing XML documents larger than main memory is sometimes thought impossible because some DOM parsers do not allow it. However, it is no less possible than sorting a dataset larger than main memory using disk space as memory to sidestep this limitation.

== Drawbacks ==
The event-driven model of SAX is useful for XML parsing, but it does have certain drawbacks.

Virtually any kind of XML validation requires access to the document in full. The most trivial example is that an attribute declared in the DTD to be of type IDREF, requires that there be only one element in the document that uses the same value for an ID attribute. To validate this in a SAX parser, one must keep track of all ID attributes (any one of them &quot;might&quot; end up being referenced by an IDREF attribute at the very end); as well as every IDREF attribute until it is resolved. Similarly, to validate that each element has an acceptable sequence of child elements, information about what child elements have been seen for each parent must be kept until the parent closes.

Additionally, some kinds of XML processing simply require having access to the entire document. XSLT and XPath, for example, need to be able to access any node at any time in the parsed XML tree. Editors and browsers likewise need to be able to display, modify, and perhaps re-validate at any time. While a SAX parser may well be used to construct such a tree initially, SAX provides no help for such processing as a whole.

== XML processing with SAX ==

A parser that implements SAX (i.e., &quot;a SAX Parser&quot;) functions as a stream parser, with an event-driven API. The user defines a number of callback methods that will be called when events occur during parsing. The SAX events include (among others):

* XML Text nodes
* XML Element Starts and Ends
* XML Processing Instructions
* XML Comments

Some events correspond to XML objects that are easily returned all at once, such as comments. However, XML &quot;elements&quot; can contain many other XML objects, and so SAX represents them as does XML itself: by one event at the beginning, and another at the end. Properly speaking, the SAX interface does not deal in &quot;elements&quot;, but in &quot;events&quot; that largely correspond to &quot;tags&quot;. SAX parsing is unidirectional; previously parsed data cannot be re-read without starting the parsing operation again.

There are many SAX-like implementations in existence. In practice, details vary, but the overall model is the same. For example, XML attributes are typically provided as name and value arguments passed to element events, but can also be provided as separate events, or via a hash table or similar collection of all the attributes. For another, some implementations provide &quot;Init&quot; and &quot;Fin&quot; callbacks for the very start and end of parsing; others do not. The exact names for given event types also vary slightly between implementations.

== Example ==
Given the following XML document:
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;DocumentElement param=&quot;value&quot;&gt;
 &lt;FirstElement&gt;
 &amp;#xb6; Some Text
 &lt;/FirstElement&gt;
 &lt;?some_pi some_attr=&quot;some_value&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;SecondElement param2=&quot;something&quot;&gt;
 Pre-Text &lt;Inline&gt;Inlined text&lt;/Inline&gt; Post-text.
 &lt;/SecondElement&gt;
&lt;/DocumentElement&gt;
This XML document, when passed through a SAX parser, will generate a sequence of events like the following:
* XML Element start, named &quot;DocumentElement&quot;, with an attribute &quot;param&quot; equal to &quot;value&quot;
* XML Element start, named &quot;FirstElement&quot;
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot;&amp;#xb6; Some Text&quot; (note: certain white spaces can be changed)
* XML Element end, named &quot;FirstElement&quot;
* Processing Instruction event, with the target &quot;some_pi&quot; and data &quot;some_attr=&quot;some_value&quot;&quot; (the content after the target is just text; however, it is very common to imitate the syntax of XML attributes, as in this example)
* XML Element start, named &quot;SecondElement&quot;, with an attribute &quot;param2&quot; equal to &quot;something&quot;
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot;Pre-Text&quot;
* XML Element start, named &quot;Inline&quot;
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot;Inlined text&quot;
* XML Element end, named &quot;Inline&quot;
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot;Post-text.&quot;
* XML Element end, named &quot;SecondElement&quot;
* XML Element end, named &quot;DocumentElement&quot;
Note that the first line of the sample above is the XML Declaration and not a processing instruction; as such it will not be reported as a processing instruction event (although some SAX implementations provide a separate event just for the XML declaration).

The result above may vary: the SAX specification deliberately states that a given section of text may be reported as multiple sequential text events. Many parsers, for example, return separate text events for numeric character references. Thus in the example above, a SAX parser may generate a different series of events, part of which might include:
* XML Element start, named &quot;FirstElement&quot;
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot;&amp;#xb6;&quot; (the Unicode character U+00b6)
* XML Text node, with data equal to &quot; Some Text&quot;
* XML Element end, named &quot;FirstElement&quot;

<doc id="60976" wikidata="Q11000047" url="?curid=60976" title="Health system">
<text>A health system, health care system or healthcare system is an organization of people, institutions, and resources that delivers health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.

There is a wide variety of health systems around the world, with as many histories and organizational structures as there are countries. Implicitly, countries must design and develop health systems in accordance with their needs and resources, although common elements in virtually all health systems are primary healthcare and public health measures.

In certain countries, the orchestration of health system planning is decentralized, with various stakeholders in the market assuming responsibilities. In contrast, in other regions, a collaborative endeavor exists among governmental entities, labor unions, philanthropic organizations, religious institutions, or other organized bodies, aimed at the meticulous provision of healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of their respective populations. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the process of healthcare planning is frequently characterized as an evolutionary progression rather than a revolutionary transformation.

As with other social institutional structures, health systems are likely to reflect the history, culture and economics of the states in which they evolve. These peculiarities bedevil and complicate international comparisons and preclude any universal standard of performance.

==Goals==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system, healthcare systems&#x27; goals are good health for the citizens, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair means of funding operations. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: provision of health care services, resource generation, financing, and stewardship. Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and equity. They have also been described in the United States as &quot;the five C&#x27;s&quot;: Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and Chronic Illness. Also, continuity of health care is a major goal.

==Definitions==
Often health system has been defined with a reductionist perspective. Some authors have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:
* Health systems should not be expressed in terms of their components only, but also of their interrelationships;
* Health systems should include not only the institutional or supply side of the health system but also the population;
* Health systems must be seen in terms of their goals, which include not only health improvement, but also equity, responsiveness to legitimate expectations, respect of dignity, and fair financing, among others;
* Health systems must also be defined in terms of their functions, including the direct provision of services, whether they are medical or public health services, but also &quot;other enabling functions, such as stewardship, financing, and resource generation, including what is probably the most complex of all challenges, the health workforce.&quot;

===World Health Organization ===
The World Health Organization defines health systems as follows:
==Financial resources==

There are generally five primary methods of funding health systems:

# general taxation to the state, county or municipality
# national health insurance
# voluntary or private health insurance
# out-of-pocket payments
# donations to charities
Most countries&#x27; systems feature a mix of all five models. One study based on data from the OECD concluded that all types of health care finance &quot;are compatible with&quot; an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control. Another study examining single payer and multi payer systems in OECD countries found that single payer systems have significantly less hospital beds per 100,000 people than in multi payer systems.

The term health insurance is generally used to describe a form of insurance that pays for medical expenses. It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering disability or long-term nursing or custodial care needs. It may be provided through a social insurance program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.

Through the calculation of the comprehensive cost of healthcare expenditures, it becomes feasible to construct a standard financial framework, which may involve mechanisms like monthly premiums or annual taxes. This ensures the availability of funds to cover the healthcare benefits delineated in the insurance agreement. Typically, the administration of these benefits is overseen by a government agency, a nonprofit health fund, or a commercial corporation.

Many commercial health insurers control their costs by restricting the benefits provided, by such means as deductibles, copayments, co-insurance, policy exclusions, and total coverage limits. They will also severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government systems also have co-payment arrangements but express exclusions are rare or limited because of political pressure. The larger insurance systems may also negotiate fees with providers.

Many forms of social insurance systems control their costs by using the bargaining power of the community they are intended to serve to control costs in the health care delivery system. They may attempt to do so by, for example, negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, negotiating standard fees with the medical profession, or reducing unnecessary health care costs. Social systems sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a system to deliver universal health care, which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the wealthier users pay proportionately more into the system to cover the needs of the poorer users who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).

In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or innovative financing mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care, such as micro-contributions, public-private partnerships, and market-based financial transaction taxes. For example, as of June 2011, Unitaid had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.

===Payment models===
In most countries, wage costs for healthcare practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures. There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.

====Fee-for-service====
Fee-for-service arrangements pay general practitioners (GPs) based on the service. They are even more widely used for specialists working in ambulatory care.

There are two ways to set fee levels:&lt;ref name=&quot;docteur/oxley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* By individual practitioners.
* Central negotiations (as in Japan, Germany, Canada and in France) or hybrid model (such as in Australia, France&#x27;s sector 2, and New Zealand) where GPs can charge extra fees on top of standardized patient reimbursement rates.

====Capitation====
In capitation payment systems, GPs are paid for each patient on their &quot;list&quot;, usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender. According to OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), &quot;these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in &quot;managed care&quot; environments in the United States.&quot;

According to OECD, &quot;capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations&quot;. However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of &quot;money following the patient&quot; may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements.&#x27;

====Salary arrangements====
In several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on &quot;salaries&quot; for the government. According to OECD, &quot;Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients.&quot; There has been movement away from this system.

====Value-based care====
In recent years, providers have been switching from fee-for-service payment models to a value-based care payment system, where they are compensated for providing value to patients. In this system, providers are given incentives to close gaps in care and provide better quality care for patients.
==Information resources==

Sound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics – the intersection of information science, medicine and healthcare – deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and computers and other information and communication technologies. The kinds of health data processed may include patients&#x27; medical records, hospital administration and clinical functions, and human resources information.

The use of health information lies at the root of evidence-based policy and evidence-based management in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.

==Management==

The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of policies and plans adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, pharmaceuticals, health human resources, and public health.

Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and health inequities, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a vaccination policy, supporting public health programs in providing vaccinations to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.

The rapid emergence of many chronic diseases, which require costly long-term care and treatment, is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Another major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide had diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of tobacco smoking, linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.

Antibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as tuberculosis. The World Health Organization, for its World Health Day 2011 campaign, called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines for future generations.

==Health systems performance==

Since 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the global health system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progress in global health. The elaboration and the selection of performance indicators are indeed both highly dependent on the conceptual framework adopted for the evaluation of the health systems performance. Like most social systems, health systems are complex adaptive systems where change does not necessarily follow rigid management models. In complex systems path dependency, emergent properties and other non-linear patterns are seen, which can lead to the development of inappropriate guidelines for developing responsive health systems.

Quality frameworks are essential tools for understanding and improving health systems. They help define, prioritize, and implement health system goals and functions. Among the key frameworks is the World Health Organization&#x27;s building blocks model, which enhances health quality by focusing on elements like financing, workforce, information, medical products, governance, and service delivery. This model influences global health evaluation and contributes to indicator development and research.

The Lancet Global Health Commission&#x27;s 2018 framework builds upon earlier models by emphasizing system foundations, processes, and outcomes, guided by principles of efficiency, resilience, equity, and people-centeredness. This comprehensive approach addresses challenges associated with chronic and complex conditions and is particularly influential in health services research in developing countries. Importantly, recent developments also highlight the need to integrate environmental sustainability into these frameworks, suggesting its inclusion as a guiding principle to enhance the environmental responsiveness of health systems.

An increasing number of tools and guidelines are being published by international agencies and development partners to assist health system decision-makers to monitor and assess health systems strengthening including human resources development using standard definitions, indicators and measures. In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization&#x27;s Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the &#x27;policy implementation gap&#x27;. Recognizing the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of health systems is crucial to ensure that evidence-based guidelines are tested with requisite humility and without a rigid adherence to models dominated by a limited number of disciplines. Healthcare services often implement Quality Improvement Initiatives to overcome this policy implementation gap. Although many of these initiatives deliver improved healthcare, a large proportion fail to be sustained. Numerous tools and frameworks have been created to respond to this challenge and increase improvement longevity. One tool highlighted the need for these tools to respond to user preferences and settings to optimize impact.

Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that challenges &#x27;disciplinary capture&#x27; by dominant health research traditions, arguing that these traditions generate premature and inappropriately narrow definitions that impede rather than enhance health systems strengthening. HPSR focuses on low- and middle-income countries and draws on the relativist social science paradigm which recognises that all phenomena are constructed through human behaviour and interpretation. In using this approach, HPSR offers insight into health systems by generating a complex understanding of context in order to enhance health policy learning. HPSR calls for greater involvement of local actors, including policy makers, civil society and researchers, in decisions that are made around funding health policy research and health systems strengthening.


==Spending==

Expand the OECD charts below to see the breakdown:
* &quot;Government/compulsory&quot;: Government spending and compulsory health insurance.
* &quot;Voluntary&quot;: Voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households&#x27; out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations.
* They are represented by columns starting at zero. They are not stacked. The 2 are combined to get the total.

==International comparisons==

Health systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The World Health Organization, in its &quot;World Health Report 2000&quot;, provided a ranking of health systems around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of health in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services. The goals for health systems, according to the WHO&#x27;s &quot;World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance&quot; (WHO, 2000), are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise, and especially based on the country ranking linked to it, insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained indicators.

Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations are complex. The Commonwealth Fund, in its annual survey, &quot;Mirror, Mirror on the Wall&quot;, compares the performance of the health systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the United States. Its 2007 study found that, although the United States system is the most expensive, it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries. A major difference between the United States and the other countries in the study is that the United States is the only country without universal health care. The OECD also collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles. Health Consumer Powerhouse makes comparisons between both national health care systems in the Euro health consumer index and specific areas of health care such as diabetes or hepatitis.

Ipsos MORI produces an annual study of public perceptions of healthcare services across 30 countries.

Physicians and hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants vs Health Care Spending in 2008 for OECD Countries. The data source is OECD.org - OECD. Since 2008, the US experienced big deviations from 16% GDP. In 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was enacted, health care spending accounted for approximately 17.2% of the U.S. GDP. By 2019, before the pandemic, it had risen to 17.7%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this percentage jumped to 18.8% in 2020, largely due to increased health care costs and economic contraction. Post-pandemic, health care spending relative to GDP declined to 16.6% by 2022.

<text>Khamis Mushayt or Khamis Mushait (, &quot;&quot; , ) is a city in south-west Saudi Arabia, located east of Abha, the provincial seat of the &#x27;Asir Province from the national capital of Riyadh. It is the capital of the Shahran tribe in the Asir region.
It is the fifth-largest city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, with an estimated metro population of 1,353,000 as of 2017. Khamis Mushayt is noted for being the fourth largest trading centre in Saudi Arabia, and is famous for its world-class military airbase.

==History==

Until the 1970s, Khamis Mushayt was a small town of less than 50,000 servicing the surrounding mild-climate agricultural region. Since then its population has grown dramatically to reach over 1,200,000. The city is surrounded by farms producing agricultural crops.

King Khalid Air Base (KMX) has a paved runway without customs facilities. The base was designed and built by US Army and Air Force engineers in the 1960s and 70s and has F-15 service facilities. During the Gulf War in 1991, the US Airforce had a base here from which they launched bombers on Baghdad.

Khamis Mushayt was known by that name since the 1760s, it has been named after the family name of Al-Mushayt referring a man called Mushayt who protected this city and like deem Mushayt, Mushayt it has been referred to MushaYt Ibn Salem the head of Shahran tribe and the guardian of the market.

==Climate==
Khamis Mushayt has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) bordering closely on a hot semi-desert climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). 

==Notable landmarks==
Khamis Mushayt has several souks, including Khamis Souk and Silver Souq, both of which are noted for their silver jewellery, and Spice Souk. Notable hotels include Mushayt Palace Hotel and Trident Hotel. Also of note is Al-Hayat Hospital and Khamis Mushayt Mosque.

<doc id="60980" wikidata="Q337765" url="?curid=60980" title="Digital Visual Interface">
<text>Digital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video display interface developed by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG). The digital interface is used to connect a video source, such as a video display controller, to a display device, such as a computer monitor. It was developed with the intention of creating an industry standard for the transfer of uncompressed digital video content.

DVI devices manufactured as DVI-I have support for analog connections, and are compatible with the analog VGA interface by including VGA pins, while DVI-D devices are digital-only. This compatibility, along with other advantages, led to its widespread acceptance over competing digital display standards Plug and Display (P&amp;D) and Digital Flat Panel (DFP). Although DVI is predominantly associated with computers, it is sometimes used in other consumer electronics such as television sets and DVD players.

==History==
An earlier attempt to promulgate an updated standard to the analog VGA connector was made by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) in 1994 and 1995, with the Enhanced Video Connector (EVC), which was intended to consolidate cables between the computer and monitor. EVC used a 35-pin Molex MicroCross connector and carried analog video (input and output), analog stereo audio (input and output), and data (via USB and FireWire). At the same time, with the increasing availability of digital flat-panel displays, the priority shifted to digital video transmission, which would remove the extra analog/digital conversion steps required for VGA and EVC; the EVC connector was reused by VESA, which released the Plug &amp; Display (P&amp;D) standard in 1997. P&amp;D offered single-link TMDS digital video with, as an option, analog video output and data (USB and FireWire), using a 35-pin MicroCross connector similar to EVC; the analog audio and video input lines from EVC were repurposed to carry digital video for P&amp;D.

Because P&amp;D was a physically large, expensive connector, a consortium of companies developed the DFP standard (1999), which was focused solely on digital video transmission using a 20-pin micro ribbon connector and omitted the analog video and data capabilities of P&amp;D. DVI instead chose to strip just the data functions from P&amp;D, using a 29-pin MicroCross connector to carry digital and analog video. Critically, DVI allows dual-link TMDS signals, meaning it supports higher resolutions than the single-link P&amp;D and DFP connectors, which led to its successful adoption as an industry standard. Compatibility of DVI with P&amp;D and DFP is accomplished typically through passive adapters that provide appropriate physical interfaces, as all three standards use the same DDC/EDID handshaking protocols and TMDS digital video signals.

DVI made its way into products starting in 1999. One of the first DVI monitors was Apple&#x27;s original Cinema Display, which launched in 1999.

==Technical overview==
DVI&#x27;s digital video transmission format is based on panelLink, a serial format developed by Silicon Image that utilizes a high-speed serial link called transition minimized differential signaling (TMDS).

===TMDS===
Digital video pixel data is transported using multiple TMDS twisted pairs. At the electrical level, these pairs are highly resistant to electrical noise and other forms of analog distortion.

====Single link====
A &quot;single link&quot; DVI connection has four TMDS pairs. Three data pairs carry their designated 8-bit RGB component (red, green, or blue) of the video signal for a total of 24 bits per pixel. The fourth pair carries the TMDS clock. The binary data is encoded using 8b/10b encoding. DVI does not use packetization, but rather transmits the pixel data as if it were a rasterized analog video signal. As such, the complete frame is &quot;drawn&quot; during each vertical refresh period. The full active area of each frame is always transmitted without compression. Video modes typically use horizontal and vertical refresh timings that are compatible with cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays, though this is not a requirement. In single link mode, the maximum TMDS clock frequency is 165 MHz, which supports a maximum resolution of 2.75 megapixels (including blanking interval) at 60 Hz refresh. For practical purposes, this allows a maximum 16:10 screen resolution of 1920 × 1200 at 60 Hz.

====Dual link====
To support higher-resolution display devices, the DVI specification contains a provision for &quot;dual link&quot;. Dual link DVI doubles the number of TMDS data pairs, effectively doubling the video bandwidth, which allows higher resolutions up to 2560 × 1600 at 60 Hz or higher refresh rates for lower resolutions.

===Compatibility===
For backward compatibility with displays using analog VGA signals, some of the contacts in the DVI connector carry the analog VGA signals.

To ensure a basic level of interoperability, DVI compliant devices are required to support one baseline display mode, &quot;low pixel format&quot; (640 × 480 at 60 Hz).

===DDC===
Like modern analog VGA connectors, the DVI connector includes pins for the display data channel (DDC), which allows the graphics adapter to read the monitor&#x27;s extended display identification data (EDID). When a source and display using the DDC2 revision are connected, the source first queries the display&#x27;s capabilities by reading the monitor EDID block over an I²C link. The EDID block contains the display&#x27;s identification, color characteristics (such as gamma value), and table of supported video modes. The table can designate a preferred mode or native resolution. Each mode is a set of timing values that define the duration and frequency of the horizontal/vertical sync, the positioning of the active display area, the horizontal resolution, vertical resolution, and refresh rate.

===Cable length===
The maximum length recommended for DVI cables is not included in the specification, since it is dependent on the TMDS clock frequency. In general, cable lengths up to will work for display resolutions up to 1920 × 1200. Longer cables up to in length can be used with display resolutions 1280 × 1024 or lower. For greater distances, the use of a DVI booster—a signal repeater which may use an external power supply—is recommended to help mitigate signal degradation.

==Connector==

The DVI connector on a device is given one of three names, depending on which signals it implements:
*&quot;DVI-I&quot; (integrated, combines digital and analog in the same connector; digital may be single or dual link)
*&quot;DVI-D&quot; (digital only, single link or dual link)
*&quot;DVI-A&quot; (analog only)

Most DVI connector types—the exception is DVI-A—have pins that pass digital video signals. These come in two varieties: single link and dual link. Single link DVI employs a single transmitter with a TMDS clock up to 165 MHz that supports resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 at 60 Hz. Dual link DVI adds six pins, at the center of the connector, for a second transmitter increasing the bandwidth and supporting resolutions up to 2560 × 1600 at 60 Hz. A connector with these additional pins is sometimes referred to as DVI-DL (dual link). Dual link should not be confused with &quot;dual display&quot; (also known as &quot;dual head&quot;), which is a configuration consisting of a single computer connected to two monitors, sometimes using a DMS-59 connector for two single link DVI connections.

In addition to digital, some DVI connectors also have pins that pass an analog signal, which can be used to connect an analog monitor. The analog pins are the four that surround the flat blade on a DVI-I or DVI-A connector. A VGA monitor, for example, can be connected to a video source with DVI-I through the use of a passive adapter. Since the analog pins are directly compatible with VGA signaling, passive adapters are simple and cheap to produce, providing a cost-effective solution to support VGA on DVI. The long flat pin on a DVI-I connector is wider than the same pin on a DVI-D connector, so even if the four analog pins were manually removed, it still wouldn&#x27;t be possible to connect a male DVI-I to a female DVI-D. It is possible, however, to join a male DVI-D connector with a female DVI-I connector.

DVI is the only widespread video standard that includes analog and digital transmission in the same connector. Competing standards are exclusively digital: these include a system using low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS), known by its proprietary names FPD-Link (flat-panel display) and FLATLINK; and its successors, the LVDS Display Interface (LDI) and OpenLDI.

Some DVD players, HDTV sets, and video projectors have DVI connectors that transmit an encrypted signal for copy protection using the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) protocol. Computers can be connected to HDTV sets over DVI, but the graphics card must support HDCP to play content protected by digital rights management (DRM).

Generalized Timing Formula (GTF) is a VESA standard which can easily be calculated with the Linux gtf utility. Coordinated Video Timings-Reduced Blanking (CVT-RB) is a VESA standard which offers reduced horizontal and vertical blanking for non-CRT based displays.

====Digital data encoding====
One of the purposes of DVI stream encoding is to provide a DC-balanced output that reduces decoding errors. This goal is achieved by using 10-bit symbols for 8-bit or less characters and using the extra bits for the DC balancing.

Like other ways of transmitting video, there are two different regions: the active region, where pixel data is sent, and the control region, where synchronization signals are sent. The active region is encoded using transition-minimized differential signaling, where the control region is encoded with a fixed 8b/10b encoding. As the two schemes yield different 10-bit symbols, a receiver can fully differentiate between active and control regions.

When DVI was designed, most computer monitors were still of the cathode-ray tube type that require analog video synchronization signals. The timing of the digital synchronization signals matches the equivalent analog ones, so the process of transforming DVI to and from an analog signal does not require extra (high-speed) memory, expensive at the time.

HDCP is an extra layer that transforms the 10-bit symbols before transmitting. Only after correct authorization can the receiver undo the HDCP encryption. Control regions are not encrypted in order to let the receiver know when the active region starts.

====Clock and data relationship====
DVI provide one TMDS clock pair and 3 TMDS data pairs in single link mode or 6 TMDS data pairs in dual link mode. TMDS data pairs operate at a gross bit rate that is 10 times the frequency of the TMDS clock. In each TMDS clock period there is a 10-bit symbol per TMDS data pair representing 8-bits of pixel color. In single link mode each set of three 10-bit symbols represents one 24-bit pixel, while in dual link mode each set of six 10-bit symbols either represents two 24-bit pixels or one pixel of up to 48-bit color depth.

The specification document allows the data and the clock to not be aligned. However, as the ratio between the TMDS clock and gross bit rate per TMDS pair is fixed at 1:10, the unknown alignment is kept over time. The receiver must recover the bits on the stream using any of the techniques of clock/data recovery to find the correct symbol boundary. The DVI specification allows the TMDS clock to vary between 25 MHz and 165 MHz. This 1:6.6 ratio can make clock recovery difficult, as phase-locked loops, if used, need to work over a large frequency range. One benefit of DVI over other interfaces is that it is relatively straightforward to transform the signal from the digital domain into the analog domain using a video DAC, as both clock and synchronization signals are transmitted. Fixed frequency interfaces, like DisplayPort, need to reconstruct the clock from the transmitted data.

====Display power management====
The DVI specification includes signaling for reducing power consumption. Similar to the analog VESA display power management signaling (DPMS) standard, a connected device can turn a monitor off when the connected device is powered down, or programmatically if the display controller of the device supports it. Devices with this capability can also attain Energy Star certification.

===Analog===
The analog section of the DVI specification document is brief and points to other specifications like VESA VSIS for electrical characteristics and GTFS for timing information. The motivation for including analog is to keep compatibility with the previous VGA cables and connectors. VGA pins for HSync, Vsync and three video channels are available in both DVI-I or DVI-A (but not DVI-D) connectors and are electrically compatible, while pins for DDC (clock and data) and 5 V power and ground are kept in all DVI connectors. Thus, a passive adapter can interface between DVI-I or DVI-A (but not DVI-D) and VGA connectors.

==DVI and HDMI compatibility==
HDMI is a newer digital audio/video interface developed and promoted by the consumer electronics industry. DVI and HDMI have the same electrical specifications for their TMDS and VESA/DDC twisted pairs. However HDMI and DVI differ in several key ways.

* HDMI lacks VGA compatibility and does not include analog signals.
* DVI is limited to the RGB color model while HDMI also supports YCbCr 4:4:4 and YCbCr 4:2:2 color spaces, which are generally not used for computer graphics.
* In addition to digital video, HDMI supports the transport of packets used for digital audio.
* HDMI sources differentiate between legacy DVI displays and HDMI-capable displays by reading the display&#x27;s EDID block.

To promote interoperability between DVI-D and HDMI devices, HDMI source components and displays support DVI-D signaling. For example, an HDMI display can be driven by a DVI-D source because HDMI and DVI-D both define an overlapping minimum set of supported resolutions and frame buffer formats.

Some DVI-D sources use non-standard extensions to output HDMI signals including audio (e.g. ATI 3000-series and NVIDIA GTX 200-series). Some multimedia displays use a DVI to HDMI adapter to input the HDMI signal with audio. Exact capabilities vary by video card specifications.

In the reverse scenario, a DVI display that lacks optional support for HDCP might be unable to display protected content even though it is otherwise compatible with the HDMI source. Features specific to HDMI such as remote control, audio transport, xvYCC and deep color are not usable in devices that support only DVI signals. HDCP compatibility between source and destination devices is subject to manufacturer specifications for each device.

==Proposed successors==
* IEEE 1394 was proposed by High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance (HANA Alliance) for all cabling needs, including video, over coaxial or 1394 cable as a combined data stream. However, this interface does not have enough throughput to handle uncompressed HD video, so it is unsuitable for applications such as video games and interactive program guides.
* High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), a forward-compatible standard that also includes digital audio transmission
* Unified Display Interface (UDI) was proposed by Intel to replace both DVI and HDMI, but was deprecated in favor of DisplayPort.
* DisplayPort (a license-free standard proposed by VESA to succeed DVI that has optional DRM mechanisms) / Mini DisplayPort 
* Thunderbolt: an interface that uses the USB-C connector (from Thunderbolt 3 and onward; the Mini DisplayPort connector was used for Thunderbolt 1 and 2) but combines PCI Express (PCIe) and DisplayPort (DP) into one serial signal, permitting the connection of PCIe devices in addition to video displays. It provides DC power as well.

In December 2010, Intel, AMD, and several computer and display manufacturers announced they would stop supporting DVI-I, VGA and LVDS-technologies from 2013/2015, and instead speed up adoption of DisplayPort and HDMI. They also stated: &quot;Legacy interfaces such as VGA, DVI and LVDS have not kept pace, and newer standards such as DisplayPort and HDMI clearly provide the best connectivity options moving forward. In our opinion, DisplayPort 1.2 is the future interface for PC monitors, along with HDMI 1.4a for TV connectivity&quot;.

<doc id="60981" wikidata="Q207645" url="?curid=60981" title="Military tactics">
<text>Military tactics encompasses the art of organizing and employing fighting forces on or near the battlefield. They involve the application of four battlefield functions which are closely related – kinetic or firepower, mobility, protection or security, and shock action. Tactics are a separate function from command and control and logistics. In contemporary military science, tactics are the lowest of three levels of warfighting, the higher levels being the strategic and operational levels. Throughout history, there has been a shifting balance between the four tactical functions, generally based on the application of military technology, which has led to one or more of the tactical functions being dominant for a period of time, usually accompanied by the dominance of an associated fighting arm deployed on the battlefield, such as infantry, artillery, cavalry or tanks.

==Tactical functions==
===Kinetic or firepower===
Beginning with the use of melee and missile weapons such as clubs and spears, the kinetic or firepower function of tactics has developed along with technological advances so that the emphasis has shifted over time from the close-range melee and missile weapons to longer-range projectile weapons. Kinetic effects were generally delivered by the sword, spear, javelin and bow until the introduction of artillery by the Romans. Until the mid 19th century, the value of infantry-delivered missile firepower was not high, meaning that the result of a given battle was rarely decided by infantry firepower alone, often relying on artillery to deliver significant kinetic effects. The development of disciplined volley fire, delivered at close range, began to improve the hitting power of infantry, and compensated in part for the limited range, poor accuracy and low rate of fire of early muskets. Advances in technology, particularly the introduction of the rifled musket, used in the Crimean War and American Civil War, meant flatter trajectories and improved accuracy at greater ranges, along with higher casualties. The resulting increase in defensive firepower meant infantry attacks without artillery support became increasingly difficult. Firepower also became crucial to fixing an enemy in place to allow a decisive strike. Machine guns added significantly to infantry firepower at the turn of the 20th century, and the mobile firepower provided by tanks, self-propelled artillery and military aircraft rose significantly in the century that followed. Along with infantry weapons, tanks and other armoured vehicles, self-propelled artillery, guided weapons and aircraft provide the firepower of modern armies.

===Mobility===
Mobility, which determines how quickly a fighting force can move, was for most of human history limited by the speed of a soldier on foot, even when supplies were carried by beasts of burden. With this restriction, most armies could not travel more than per day, unless travelling on rivers. Only small elements of a force such as cavalry or specially trained light troops could exceed this limit. This restriction on tactical mobility remained until the latter years of World War I when the advent of the tank improved mobility sufficiently to allow decisive tactical manoeuvre. Despite this advance, full tactical mobility was not achieved until World War II when armoured and motorised formations achieved remarkable successes. However, large elements of the armies of World War II remained reliant on horse-drawn transport, which limited tactical mobility within the overall force. Tactical mobility can be limited by the use of field obstacles, often created by military engineers.

===Protection and security===
Personal armour has been worn since the classical period to provide a measure of individual protection, which was also extended to include barding of the mount. The limitations of armour have always been weight and bulk, and its consequent effects on mobility as well as human and animal endurance. By the 18th and 19th centuries, personal armour had been largely discarded, until the re-introduction of helmets during World War I in response to the firepower of artillery. Armoured fighting vehicles proliferated during World War II, and after that war, body armour returned for the infantry, particularly in Western armies. Fortifications, which have been used since ancient times, provide collective protection, and modern examples include entrenchments, roadblocks, barbed wire and minefields. Like obstacles, fortifications are often created by military engineers.

===Shock action===
Shock action is as much a psychological function of tactics as a physical one, and can be significantly enhanced by the use of surprise. It has been provided by charging infantry, and as well as by chariots, war elephants, cavalry and armoured vehicles which provide momentum to an assault. It has also been used in a defensive way, for example by the drenching flights of arrows from English longbowmen at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 which caused the horses of the French knights to panic. During early modern warfare, the use of the tactical formations of columns and lines had a greater effect than the firepower of the formations alone. During the early stages of World War II, the combined effects of German machine gun and tank gun firepower, enhanced by accurate indirect fire and air attack, often broke up Allied units before their assault commenced, or caused them to falter due to casualties among key unit leaders. In both the early modern and World War II examples, the cumulative psychological shock effect on the enemy was often greater than the actual casualties incurred.

==Development over time==
The development of tactics has involved a shifting balance between the four tactical functions since ancient times, and changes in firepower and mobility have been fundamental to these changes. Various models have been proposed to explain the interaction between the tactical functions and the dominance of individual fighting arms during different periods. J. F. C. Fuller proposed three &quot;tactical cycles&quot; in each of the classical and Christian eras. For the latter epoch, he proposed a &quot;shock&quot; cycle between 650 and 1450, a &quot;shock and projectile&quot; cycle 1450–1850, and a &quot;projectile&quot; cycle from 1850, with respect to the Western and North American warfare. During World War II, Tom Wintringham proposed six chronological periods, which alternate the dominance between unarmoured and armoured forces and highlight tactical trends in each period.

Massed volley fire by archers brought infantry firepower to the fore in Japanese warfare in the second half of the 13th century, preceding the rise of the English longbowman. The mobility and shock action of the Oirat Mongol army at the Battle of Tumu in 1449 demonstrated that cavalry could still defeat a large infantry force. In both the European and Oriental traditions of warfare, the advent of gunpowder during the late Medieval and Early Modern periods created a relentless shift to infantry firepower becoming &quot;a decisive, if not dominant&quot; arm on the battlefield, exemplified by the significant impact of massed arquebusiers at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575.

==Combined arms tactics==
The synchronisation of the various fighting arms to achieve the tactical mission is known as combined arms tactics. One method of measuring tactical effectiveness is the extent to which the arms, including military aviation, are integrated on the battlefield. A key principle of effective combined arms tactics is that for maximum potential to be achieved, all elements of combined arms teams need the same level of mobility, and sufficient firepower and protection. The history of the development of combined arms tactics has been dogged by costly and painful lessons. For example, while German commanders in World War II clearly understood from the outset the key principle of combined arms tactics outlined above, British commanders were late to this realisation. Successful combined arms tactics require the fighting arms to train alongside each other and to be familiar with each other&#x27;s capabilities.

==Impact of air power==

Beginning in the latter stages of World War I, airpower has brought a significant change to military tactics. World War II saw the development of close air support which greatly enhanced the effect of ground forces with the use of aerial firepower and improved tactical reconnaissance and the interdiction of hostile air power. It also made possible the supply of ground forces by air, achieved by the British during the Burma Campaign but unsuccessful for the Germans at the Battle of Stalingrad. Following World War II, rotary-wing aircraft had a significant impact on firepower and mobility, comprising a fighting arm in its own right in many armies. Aircraft, particularly those operating at low or medium altitudes, remain vulnerable to ground-based air defence systems as well as other aircraft.

Parachute and glider operations and rotary-wing aircraft have provided significant mobility to ground forces but the reduced mobility, protection and firepower of troops delivered by air once landed has limited the tactical utility of such vertical envelopment or air assault operations. This was demonstrated during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, and during the Vietnam War, in the latter case despite the additional firepower provided by helicopter gunships and the ability quickly to remove casualties, provided by aeromedical evacuation.

==Concept==
Military tactics answer the questions of how best to deploy and employ forces on a small scale. Some practices have not changed since the dawn of warfare: assault, ambushes, skirmishing, turning flanks, reconnaissance, creating and using obstacles and defenses, etc. Using ground to best advantage has not changed much either. Heights, rivers, swamps, passes, choke points, and natural cover, can all be used in multiple ways. Before the nineteenth century, many military tactics were confined to battlefield concerns: how to maneuver units during combat in open terrain. Nowadays, specialized tactics exist for many situations, for example for securing a room in a building.

Technological changes can render existing tactics obsolete, and sociological changes can shift the goals and methods of warfare, requiring new tactics. Tactics define how soldiers are armed and trained. Thus technology and society influence the development of types of soldiers or warriors through history: Greek hoplite, Roman legionary, medieval knight, Turk-Mongol horse archer, Chinese crossbowman, or an air cavalry trooper. Each – constrained by his weaponry, logistics and social conditioning – would use a battlefield differently, but would usually seek the same outcomes from their use of tactics. The First World War forced great changes in tactics as advances in technology rendered prior tactics useless.

&quot;Gray-zone&quot; tactics are also becoming more widely used. These include &quot;everything from strong-arm diplomacy and economic coercion, to media manipulation and cyberattacks, to use of paramilitaries and proxy forces&quot;. The title &quot;gray-zone&quot; comes from the ambiguity between defense vs. offense, as well as the ambiguity between peace-keeping vs. war effort.

<doc id="60982" wikidata="Q1646209" url="?curid=60982" title="List of aircraft carriers">
<text>This list of aircraft carriers contains aircraft carriers listed alphabetically by name. An aircraft carrier is a warship with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft, that serves as a seagoing airbase.

Included in this list are ships which meet the above definition and had an official name (&quot;italicized&quot;) or designation (non-italicized), regardless of whether they were or were not ordered, laid down, completed, or commissioned.

Not included in this list are the following:

* Aircraft cruisers, also known as aviation cruisers, cruiser-carriers, flight deck cruisers, and hybrid battleship-carriers, which combine the characteristics of aircraft carriers and surface warfare ships, because they primarily operated helicopters or floatplanes and did not act as a floating airbase. Examples include the British s, Japanese s, French cruiser , Soviet s, and Italian s. Vessels which meet the criteria of an aircraft carrier but are named as cruisers (or destroyers, etc.) for political or treaty reasons such as the Russian s or British s &quot;are&quot; included however.
* Amphibious assault ships, also known as commando carriers, assault carriers, helicopter carriers, landing helicopter assault ships, landing helicopter docks, landing platform docks, and landing platform helicopters. Although they have flight decks and look like aircraft carriers, they primarily operate helicopters and do not act as a floating airbase. Examples include the US &quot;Wasp&quot;-class assault ships, Brazilian NAM &quot;Atlântico&quot; (A140), Japanese escort carrier, and French .
* Drone carrier
* Catapult aircraft merchantmen, merchant ships which carried cargo and an aircraft catapult (no flight deck).
* Escort carriers, usually converted merchant ships, see separate List of escort carriers by country.
* &quot;Landing craft carriers&quot; such as , which were modified amphibious landing ships, because they could not recover their aircraft.
* Merchant aircraft carriers, cargo-carrying merchant ships with a full flight deck.
* Seaplane tenders and seaplane carriers, because they could not land aircraft.
* Submarine aircraft carriers, because they had no flight deck and could not land their aircraft.

&quot;In commission&quot; denotes the period that the ship was officially in commission with the given name for the given country as an aircraft carrier as defined above.

*German aircraft carrier II: was a proposed conversion project for the incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany&#x27;s Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship&#x27;s design, a severe shortage of material and labor, and the threat of Allied bombing raids. In 1945, the ship was returned to France and was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy

===United States===
The United States Navy is a blue-water navy that is the world&#x27;s largest navy by tonnage and has the world&#x27;s largest fleet of nuclear powered aircraft carriers. The carrier fleet currently comprises the (CATOBAR) and (CATOBAR/ EMALS) supercarriers. These carriers serve as the centerpieces and flagships for the Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Groups, with their embarked carrier air wings and accompanying ships and submarines, which strongly contribute to the US ability to project force around the globe. The following is a complete list of all the US Navy&#x27;s carriers and classes to date, and their status:

Escort aircraft carrier
The United States Navy also had a sizable fleet of escort aircraft carriers during World War II and the era that followed. These ships were both quicker and cheaper to build than larger fleet carriers and were built in great numbers to serve as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were too few. However, they were usually too slow to keep up with naval task forces and would typically be assigned to amphibious operations, often seen in the Pacific War&#x27;s island hopping campaign, or to convoy protection in the war in the Atlantic. To that end, many of these ships were transferred to the Royal Navy as part of the US-UK lend-lease program. While some of these ships were kept for a time in reserve after the war, none survive today, as they have all since been sunk or retired and scrapped. The following are the classes and stand-alone ships of the US Navy&#x27;s escort carriers;
* (45 ships, 33 went to the RN)
* (4 ships)
* (50 ships)
* (19 ships went into service, 4 were cancelled)
* Stand-alone ships;
** No USN name given (AVG-1/BAVG-1) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Archer&quot; (D78) 
** No USN name given (AVG-2/BAVG-2) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Avenger&quot; (D14) 
** No USN name given (AVG-3/BAVG-3) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Biter&quot; (D97), then later to the French Navy as &quot;Dixmude&quot; 
** No USN name given (AVG-4/BAVG-4) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Charger&quot; (D27), later returned to USN as 
** No USN name given (AVG-5/BAVG-5) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; (D37) 
** No USN name given (BAVG-6) – went to the RN as HMS &quot;Tracker&quot; (D24) 

Amphibious assault ship
The United States Navy also has several full-deck, amphibious assault ships, which are larger than many of the aircraft carriers of other navies today. These ships are STOVL-capable and can carry full squadrons of fixed-wing aircraft, such as the V/STOL AV-8B Harrier II and the STOVL F-35 Lightning II, along with numerous rotary-wing aircraft. Their primary purpose though, is usually to serve as the centerpiece and flagship for an Expeditionary Strike Group or Amphibious Ready Group, carrying US Marine Corps Expeditionary Units and their equipment close to shore for amphibious landings and departures. The following are ships and classes of US Navy amphibious assault ships;

Active
* (LHD) (843 ft, 40,500 tons)

<text>The siege of Orléans (12 October 1428 – 8 May 1429) marked a turning point of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between France and England. The siege took place at the pinnacle of English power during the later stages of the war, but was repulsed by French forces inspired by the arrival of Joan of Arc. The French would then regain the initiative in the conflict and began to recapture territories previously occupied by the English.

The city held strategic and symbolic significance to both sides of the conflict. The consensus among contemporaries was that the English regent, John of Lancaster, would have succeeded in realising his brother the English king Henry V&#x27;s dream of conquering all of France if Orléans fell. For half a year the English and their French allies appeared to be on the verge of capturing the city, but the siege collapsed nine days after Joan of Arc arrived.

==Background==

===Hundred Years&#x27; War===
The siege of Orléans occurred during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, an inheritance dispute over the French throne between the ruling houses of France and England. The conflict had begun in 1337 when England&#x27;s King Edward III decided to press his claim to the French throne, a claim based on his status as the son of Isabella of France and thus of the contested French royal line.

Following a decisive victory at Agincourt in 1415, the English gained the upper hand in the conflict, occupying much of northern France. Under the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, England&#x27;s Henry V became regent of France. By this treaty, Henry married Catherine, the daughter of the current French king, Charles VI, and would then succeed to the French throne upon Charles&#x27;s death. The Dauphin of France (title given to the French heir apparent), Charles, the son of the French king, was then disinherited.

===Geography===
Orléans is located on the river Loire in north-central France. During the time of this siege, it was the northernmost city that remained loyal to the Valois French crown. The English and their Burgundian allies controlled the rest of northern France, including Paris. Orléans&#x27;s position on a major river made it the last obstacle to a campaign into central France. England already controlled France&#x27;s southwestern coast.

===Armagnac party===

As the capital of the duchy of Orléans, this city held symbolic significance in early 15th century politics. The dukes of Orléans were at the head of a political faction known as the Armagnacs, who rejected the Treaty of Troyes and supported the claims of the disinherited and banished Dauphin Charles to the French throne. This faction had been in existence for two generations. Its leader, the Duke of Orléans, also in line for the throne, was one of the very few combatants from Agincourt who remained a prisoner of the English fourteen years after the battle.

Under the customs of chivalry, a city that surrendered to an invading army without a struggle was entitled to lenient treatment from its new ruler. A city that resisted could expect a harsh occupation. Mass executions were common in this type of situation. Reasoning of the late medieval established that since the city of Orléans had escalated the conflict, it forced the use of violence upon the English, justifying a conquering lord in exacting vengeance upon the citizens. The city&#x27;s association with the Armagnac party made it unlikely to be spared if it fell.

==Preparations==

===State of the conflict===
After the brief fallout over Hainaut in 1425–26, English and Burgundian forces renewed their alliance and offensive on the Dauphin&#x27;s France in 1427. The Orléanais region southwest of Paris was of key importance, not only for controlling the river Loire, but also to smoothly connect the English area of operations in the west and the Burgundian area of operations in the east. French forces had been largely ineffective before the Anglo-Burgundian onslaught until the siege of Montargis in late 1427, when they managed to successfully force it to be lifted. The relief of Montargis, the first effective French action in years, emboldened sporadic uprisings in the thinly-garrisoned English-occupied region of Maine to the west, threatening to undo recent English gains.

However, the French failed to capitalize on the aftermath of Montargis, in large part because the French court was embroiled in an internal power struggle between the constable Arthur de Richemont and the chamberlain Georges de la Trémoille, a new favourite of the Dauphin Charles. Of the French military leaders, John, the &quot;Bastard of Orléans&quot; (later called &quot;Dunois&quot;), La Hire and Jean de Xaintrailles were partisans of La Trémoille, while Charles of Bourbon, Count of Clermont, the marshal Jean de Brosse and John Stewart of Darnley (head of the Scottish auxiliary forces), were lined up with the constable. The inner French conflict had reached such a point that their partisans were fighting each other in the open field by mid-1428.

The English took advantage of French paralysis to raise fresh reinforcements in England in early 1428, gathering a new force of 2,700 men (450 men-at-arms and 2,250 longbowmen), brought over by Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury, who was regarded as the most effective English commander of the time. These were bolstered by new levies raised in Normandy and Paris, and joined by auxiliaries from Burgundy and vassal domains in Picardie and Champagne, to a total strength possibly as great as 10,000.

At the council of war in the spring of 1428, the English regent John, Duke of Bedford determined the main thrust of English military campaigns would be towards the west, to stomp out the remaining Armagnac forces in the Maine and lay siege to Angers. The city of Orléans was not originally in this plan. Indeed, Bedford had secured a private deal with Dunois, whose attentions were focused on the Richemont-La Trémoille conflict, then raging violently in the Berri. As Charles, Duke of Orléans was at the time in English captivity, it would have been contrary to the customs of knightly war to seize the possessions of a prisoner. Bedford agreed to leave Orléans alone, but, for some reason, changed his mind shortly after the arrival of English reinforcements under Salisbury in July 1428. In a memorandum written in later years, Bedford expressed that the siege of Orléans &quot;was taken in hand, God knoweth by what advice&quot;, suggesting it was probably Salisbury&#x27;s idea, not his.

===Salisbury&#x27;s approach===
Between July and October, the Earl of Salisbury swept through the countryside southwest of Paris – recovering Nogent-le-Roi, Rambouillet and the area around Chartres. Then, rather than continuing southwest to Angers, Salisbury turned abruptly southeast towards Orléans instead. Pressing towards the Loire, Salisbury seized Le Puiset and Janville (with some difficulty) in August. From there, rather than descending directly on Orléans from the north, Salisbury skipped over the city to seize the countryside west of it. He reached the river Loire at Meung-sur-Loire, which he promptly seized (a detachment of his men crossed the river then to plunder the abbey of Cléry). He pressed a little downriver, in the direction of Blois, to take the bridge and castle of Beaugency. Salisbury crossed the Loire at the point, and turned up to approach Orléans from the south. He arrived at Olivet, just one mile south of Orléans, on 7 October. In the meantime, an English detachment, under John de la Pole, brother of the Earl of Suffolk, had been sent to seize the regions upriver, east of Orléans: Jargeau fell on 5 October, Châteauneuf-sur-Loire immediately after, while further upriver, the Burgundians took Sully-sur-Loire. Orléans was cut off and surrounded.

Manning the defenses of Orléans, John of Dunois had watched the tightening English noose and took care to prepare the city for siege. Dunois correctly anticipated that the English would aim for the bridge, nearly one quarter mile (400 m) long, that led from the south shore of the Loire into the centre of the city of Orléans on the north shore. The bridge passed over the riverine island of St. Antoine, an optimal location for Salisbury to position English cannon within range of Orléans city centre. At the southern end of the bridge was a turreted gatehouse, &quot;Les Tourelles&quot;, which stood in the river, connected by a drawbridge to the southern bank. Dunois rapidly erected a large earthwork bulwark (&quot;Boulevart&quot;) on the south shore itself, which he packed with the bulk of his troops, thus creating a large fortified complex to protect the bridge. Just across from the Boulevart was an Augustinian friary, which could be used as a flanking firing position on any approach to the bridge, although it seems Dunois decided not to make use of it. On his orders, the southern suburbs of Orléans were evacuated and all structures leveled to prevent giving the English cover.

==Early stages of the siege==

===Assault on the Tourelles===

The siege of Orléans formally began on 12 October 1428, and initiated with an artillery bombardment that began on 17 October. The English assaulted the Boulevart on 21 October, but the assaulters were held back by French missile fire, rope nets, scalding oil, hot coals and quicklime. The English decided against a new frontal attack, and set about mining the bulwark. The French countermined, fired the pit props and fell back to the Tourelles on 23 October. But the Tourelles itself was taken by storm the next day, 24 October. The departing French blew up some of the bridge arches to prevent a direct pursuit.

With the fall of the Tourelles, Orléans seemed doomed. But the timely arrival of the Marshal de Boussac with sizeable French reinforcements prevented the English from repairing and crossing the bridge and seizing Orléans immediately. The English suffered another setback two days later, when the Earl of Salisbury was struck in the face by debris kicked up in cannon fire while supervising the installation of the Tourelles. English operations were suspended while Salisbury was carried off to Meung to recover, but after lingering for about a week, he died of his injuries.

===The investment===
The lull in English operations following Salisbury&#x27;s injury and death gave the citizens of Orléans time to knock out the remaining arches of the bridge on their end, disabling the possibility of a quick repair and direct assault. The new siege commander appointed by Bedford in mid-November, William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk resolved on surrounding the city and starving it into submission. He did not have enough men to invest the city with continuous trenchlines, so he set up a series of outworks, (&quot;bastides&quot;). Over the next few months, seven strongholds were set up on the north bank, and four on the south bank, with the small riverine isle of Charlemagne (west of Orléans) commanding the bridges connecting the two banks.

In the winter, a Burgundian force numbering about 1,500 men arrived to support the English besiegers.

The establishment of the outworks was not without difficulty. The French garrison sallied out repeatedly to harass the builders, and systematically destroyed other buildings (notably, all the churches) in the suburbs to prevent them serving as shelter for the English during the winter months. By the Spring of 1429, the English outworks covered only the south and west of the city, with the northeast basically left open (nonetheless swarming with English patrols). Sizeable contingents of French men-at-arms could push aside the patrols and move in and out of the city, but the entry of any lighter-escorted provisions and supplies was firmly blocked, there and further afield.

On the south bank, the English center was the bridge complex, composed of the Tourelles-Boulevart and the now-fortified Augustines. Guarding the approach to the bridge from the east was the bastille of St. Jean-le-Blanc, while to the west of the bridge complex was the bastille of Champ de St. Privé. St. Privé also guarded the bridge to the island of Charlemagne (which had another bastille). On the north bank of the Loire, on the other side of Charlemagne bridge, was the bastille of St. Laurent, the largest English bulwark and the nerve center of English operations. Above that were a series of smaller outworks, in order: the bastille de la Croiz Boisse, the bastille des Douze Pierres (nicknamed &quot;London&quot;), the bastille de Pressoir Aps (nicknamed &quot;Rouen&quot;) and, just north of the city, the bastille de St. Pouair (nicknamed &quot;Paris&quot;), all on top of the main roads. Then came the great northeastern gap, although its back was mostly covered by thick forest of the Bois d&#x27;Orléans. Finally, some 2 km east of the city, on the north bank, there was the isolated bastille of St. Loup.

Orléans&#x27;s position seemed gloomy. Although the French still held isolated citadels like Montargis to the northeast and Gien upriver, any relief would have to come from Blois, to the southwest, exactly where the English had concentrated their forces. Provisions convoys had to follow dangerous circuitous routes swinging around to reach the city from the northeast. Few made it through, and the city soon began to feel the pinch. Should Orléans fall, it would effectively make the recovery of the northern half of France all but impossible, and prove fatal to the Dauphin Charles&#x27;s bid for the crown. When the French Estates met at Chinon in September 1428, they pressed the Dauphin to make peace with Philip III of Burgundy &quot;at any price&quot;.

==Battle of the Herrings==


The threat to Orléans had prompted the partisans of Richemont and La Trémoille to make a quick temporary truce in October 1428. In early 1429, Charles de Bourbon, Count of Clermont assembled a French-Scottish force in Blois for the relief of Orléans. Hearing of the dispatch of an English supply convoy from Paris, under the command of Sir John Fastolf for the English siege troops, Clermont decided to take a detour to intercept it. He was joined by a force from Orléans under John of Dunois, which had managed to slip past the English lines. The forces made junction at Janville and attacked the English convoy at Rouvray on 12 February, in an encounter known as the Battle of the Herrings, on account of the convoy being laden with a large supply of fish for the forthcoming Lenten season.

The English, aware of their approach, formed a &quot;laager&quot; with the supply wagons, lining the circumference with bowmen. Clermont ordered the French to hold back, and let their cannon do the damage. But the Scottish regiments, led by John Stewart of Darnley, dissatisfied with the missile duel, decided to move in. The French lines hesitated, uncertain of whether to follow or remain back as ordered. Seeing the French immobilized or only timidly following, the English sensed an opportunity. The English cavalry burst out of the wagon fort, overwhelmed the isolated Scots, and threw back the hesitant French. Disorder and panic set in, and the French fell into retreat. Stewart of Darnley was killed, John of Dunois wounded. Fastolf brought the supplies in triumph to the English soldiers at Orléans three days later.

The defeat at Rouvray was disastrous for French morale. Bickering and recriminations immediately followed as Clermont and Dunois blamed each other for the disaster, reopening the fissures between the Richemont and La Tremoille parties. Clermont, disgusted, quit the field and retired to his estates, refusing to participate further. Once again, the Dauphin Charles was advised to sue for peace with Burgundy and should that fail, to consider abdicating and retiring to the Dauphiné, perhaps even going into exile in Scotland.

==Surrender proposal==
In March, John of Dunois made what he hoped was an irresistible offer to Philip III of Burgundy, offering to turn Orléans over to him, to hold as a neutral territory on behalf of his captive half-brother Charles, Duke of Orléans. A group of nobles and bourgeois from the city went to Philip to try to make him persuade the Duke of Bedford to lift the siege so that Orléans could surrender to Burgundy instead. The specific terms of the offer made are outlined in the letter by a contemporary merchant. Burgundy would be able to appoint the city&#x27;s governors on behalf of the Duke of Orléans, half the city&#x27;s taxes would go to the English, the other half would go for the ransom of the imprisoned duke. A contribution of 10,000 gold crowns was to be made to Bedford for war expenses, and the English would gain military access through Orléans, all in return for lifting the siege and handing the city to the Burgundians.

The agreement would have given the English the chance to pass through Orléans and strike into Bourges, the administrative capital of the Dauphin, which had been the primary motivator for the siege itself. Burgundy hurried to Paris in early April to persuade the English regent John of Bedford to take the offer. But Bedford, certain Orléans was on the verge of falling, refused to surrender his prize. The disappointed Philip withdrew his Burgundian auxiliaries from the English siege in a huff. The Burgundian contingent left on 17 April 1429, which left the English with an extremely small army to prosecute the siege. The decision proved to be a lost opportunity, and a terrible mistake in the long run for the English.

==Joan&#x27;s arrival at Orléans==
It was on the very day of the Battle of the Herrings that a young French peasant girl, Joan of Arc, was meeting with Robert de Baudricourt, the &quot;Dauphinois&quot; captain of Vaucouleurs, trying to explain to the skeptical captain her divinely-ordained mission to rescue the Dauphin Charles and deliver him to his royal coronation at Reims. She had met and been rebuffed by Baudricourt twice before, but apparently this time he assented and arranged to escort her to the Dauphin&#x27;s court in Chinon. According to the &quot;Chronique de la Pucelle&quot;, at this meeting with Baudricourt, Joan disclosed that the Dauphin&#x27;s forces had suffered a great reversal near Orléans that day, and if she were not sent to him soon, there would be others. Accordingly, when news of the defeat at Rouvray reached Vaucouleurs, Baudricourt became convinced of the girl&#x27;s prescience and agreed to escort her. Whatever the truth of the story – and it is not accepted by all authorities – Joan left Vaucouleurs on 23 February for Chinon.

For years, vague prophecies had been circulating in France concerning an armored maiden who would rescue France. Many of these prophecies foretold that the armored maiden would come from the borders of Lorraine, where Domrémy, Joan&#x27;s birthplace, is located. As a result, when word reached the besieged citizens of Orléans concerning Joan&#x27;s journey to see the Dauphin, expectations and hopes were high.

Escorted by several of Baudricourt&#x27;s soldiers, Joan arrived in Chinon on 6 March 1429 and met with the skeptical La Trémoille. On 9 March she finally met the Dauphin Charles, although it would be a few days more before she had a private meeting where the Dauphin was finally convinced of her &quot;powers&quot; (or at least, her usefulness). Nonetheless, he insisted she first proceed to Poitiers to be examined by church authorities. With the clerical verdict that she posed no harm and could be safely taken on, Dauphin Charles finally accepted her services on 22 March. She was provided with a suit of plate armor, a banner, a pageboy and heralds.

Joan&#x27;s first mission was to join a convoy assembling at Blois, under the command of Marshal Jean de La Brosse, Lord of Boussac bringing supplies to Orléans. It was from Blois that Joan dispatched her famous missives to the English siege commanders, calling herself &quot;the Maiden&quot; (&quot;La Pucelle&quot;), and ordering them, in the name of God, to &quot;Begone, or I will make you go&quot;.

The relief convoy, escorted by some 400–500 soldiers, finally left Blois on 27 or 28 April, in nearly religious processional array. Joan had insisted on approaching Orléans from the north (through the Beauce region), where English forces were concentrated, intent on fighting them immediately. But the commanders decided to take the convoy in a circuitous route around the south (through the Sologne region) without telling Joan, reaching the south bank of the Loire at Rully (near Chécy), some four miles east of the city. Orléans&#x27; commander, Jean de Dunois, came out to meet them across the river. Joan was indignant at the deception and ordered an immediate attack on St. Jean-le-Blanc, the nearest English bastille on the south bank. But Dunois, supported by the Marshals, protested and with some effort, finally prevailed on her to allow the city to be resupplied before any assaults on anything. The provisions convoy approached the landing of Port Saint-Loup, across the river from the English bastille of Saint-Loup on the north bank. While French skirmishers kept the English garrison of Saint-Loup contained, a fleet of boats from Orléans sailed down to the landing to pick up the supplies, Joan and 200 soldiers. One of Joan&#x27;s reputed miracles was said to have taken place here: the wind which had brought the boats upriver suddenly reversed itself, allowing them to sail back to Orléans smoothly under the cover of darkness. Joan of Arc entered Orléans in triumph on 29 April around 8:00 PM, to much rejoicing. The rest of the convoy returned to Blois.

==Lifting the siege==
Over the next couple of days, to boost morale, Joan periodically toured the streets of Orléans, distributing food to the people and salaries to the garrison. Joan of Arc also sent out messengers to the English bastions demanding their departure, which the English commanders greeted with jeers. Some even threatened to kill the messengers as &quot;emissaries of a witch&quot;.

The &quot;Journal du siege d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, as quoted in Pernoud, reports several discussions during the course of the following week between Joan and Jean de Dunois, the illegitimate half-brother of the Duke of Orléans and the chief leader directing the city&#x27;s defense on behalf of the captive duke.

Believing the garrison too small for any action, on 1 May Dunois left the city in the hands of La Hire and made his way personally to Blois to arrange for reinforcements. During this interlude, Joan went outside the city walls and surveyed all of the English fortifications personally, at one point exchanging words with the English commander William Glasdale.

On 3 May Dunois&#x27;s reinforcement convoy left Blois to head for Orléans. At the same time, other troop convoys set out from Montargis and Gien in the direction of Orléans. Dunois&#x27;s military convoy arrived via the Beauce district, on the north bank of the river, in the early morning of 4 May, in full view of the English garrison at St. Laurent. The English declined to challenge the convoy&#x27;s entry on account of its strength. Joan rode out to escort it in.

===Assault on St. Loup===
At noon that day, 4 May 1429, apparently to secure the entry of more provisions convoys, which had taken the usual circuitous route via the east, Dunois launched an attack on the easterly English bastille of St. Loup together with the Montargis-Gien troops. Joan nearly missed out on it, having been napping when the assault began, but she hurried to join in. The English garrison of 400 was heavily outnumbered by the 1,500 French attackers. Hoping to divert the French away, the English commander, Lord John Talbot, launched an attack from St. Pouair, on the northern end of Orléans, but it was held back by a French sortie. After a few hours, St. Loup fell, with some 140 English killed and 40 prisoners taken. Some of the English defenders of St. Loup were captured in the ruins of a nearby church, their lives spared at Joan&#x27;s request. Hearing that St. Loup had fallen, Talbot retired the northern assault.

===Assault on the Augustines===
The next day, 5 May, was Ascension Day, and Joan urged an attack on the largest English outwork, the bastille of St. Laurent to the west. But the French captains, knowing its strength and that their men needed rest, prevailed on her to allow them to honor the feast-day in peace. Overnight, in a war council, it was decided that the best course of action was to clear the English bastions on the south bank, where the English were weakest.

The operation began in the early morning of 6 May. The citizens of Orléans, inspired by Joan of Arc, raised urban militias on her behalf and showed up at the gates, much to the distress of the professional commanders. Nonetheless, Joan prevailed upon the professionals to allow the militia to join. The French crossed the river from Orléans on boats and barges and landed on the island of St. Aignan, crossing over to the south bank via a makeshift pontoon bridge, landing on the stretch between the bridge complex and the bastille of St. Jean-le-Blanc. That plan had been to cut off and take St. Jean-le-Blanc from the west, but the English garrison commander, William Glasdale, sensing the intent of the French operation, had already hurriedly destroyed the St. Jean-le-Blanc outwork and concentrated his troops in the central Boulevart-Tourelles-Augustines complex.

Before the French had properly disembarked on the south bank, La Hire reportedly launched a precipitous attack on the strongpoint of the Boulevart (an outlying fortification to the south of Les Tourelles). This nearly turned into a disaster, as the assault was exposed on the flanks to English fire from the Augustines. The assault broke off when there were cries that the English garrison of the bastille of St. Privé further west was rushing upriver to reinforce Glasdale and cut them off. Panic set in, and the French attackers retreated from the Boulevart back to the landing grounds, dragging Joan back with them. Seeing the &quot;witch&quot; on the run and the &quot;spell&quot; broken, Glasdale&#x27;s garrison burst out to give chase, but according to legend, Joan turned around on them alone, raised her holy standard and cried out &quot;Au Nom De Dieu&quot; (&quot;In the name of God&quot;), which reportedly was sufficient to impress the English to halt their pursuit and return to the Boulevart. The fleeing French troops turned around and rallied to her.

French commanders then launched an assault against the fortified monastery of &quot;Les Augustins&quot;, which was finally taken just before nightfall.

With the Augustins in French hands, Glasdale&#x27;s garrison was blockaded in the Tourelles complex. That same night, what remained of the English garrison at St. Privé evacuated their outwork and went north of the river to join their comrades in St. Laurent. Glasdale was isolated, but he could count on a strong and well-ensconced English garrison of 700–800 troops.

===Assault on the Tourelles===

Joan had been wounded in the foot by stepping on a metal spike during the assault on the Augustins, and was taken back to Orléans overnight to recover. As a result, she did not participate in the evening war council. The next morning, 7 May, she was asked to sit out the final assault on the Boulevart-Tourelles, but she refused and roused to join the French camp on the south bank, much to the joy of the people of Orléans. The citizens raised more levies on her behalf and set about repairing the bridge with beams to enable a two-sided attack on the complex. Artillery was positioned on the island of Saint-Antoine.

Early in the morning, Joan was struck down while standing in the trench to the south of Les Tourelles, by a longbow arrow between the neck and left shoulder and was hurriedly taken away. Rumors of her death bolstered the English defenders and faltered French morale. But, according to eyewitnesses, she returned later during the evening and told the soldiers that a final assault would carry the fortress. Joan&#x27;s confessor/chaplain, Jean Pasquerel, later stated that Joan herself had some type of premonition or foreknowledge of her wound, stating the day before the attack that &quot;tomorrow blood will flow from my body above my breast.&quot; Further assaults against Les Tourelles during the day were beaten back. As evening was approaching, Jean de Dunois had decided to leave the final assault for the next day. Informed of the decision, Joan went off for a period of quiet prayer, then returned to the area south of Les Tourelles, telling the troops that when her banner touched the fortress wall the place would be theirs. When one soldier shouted &quot;It&#x27;s touching! (the wall)&quot;, Joan replied &quot;Tout est vostre – et y entrez!&quot; (&quot;All is yours, – go in!&quot;). The French soldiery rushed in, swarming up the ladders into the fortification. 

The French carried the day and forced the English out of the boulevart and back into the last redoubt of the Tourelles. But the drawbridge connecting them gave way, and Glasdale fell into the river and perished. The French pressed on to storm the Tourelles itself, from both sides (the bridge now repaired). The Tourelles, half-burning, was finally taken in the evening.

English losses were heavy. Counting other actions on the day (notably the interception of reinforcements rushed to the defense), the English had suffered nearly a thousand killed, and 600 prisoners. 200 French prisoners were found in the complex and released.

==End of the siege==
With the Tourelles complex taken, the English had lost the south bank of the Loire. There was little point of continuing the siege, as Orléans could now be easily re-supplied indefinitely.

On the morning of 8 May the English troops on the north bank, under the command of the Earl of Suffolk and Lord John Talbot, demolished their outworks and assembled in battle array in the field near St. Laurent. The French army under Dunois lined up before them. They stood facing each other immobile for about an hour, before the English withdrew from the field and marched off to join other English units in Meung, Beaugency and Jargeau. Some of the French commanders urged an attack to destroy the English army then and there. Joan of Arc reportedly forbade it, on account of it being Sunday.

==Aftermath==
The English did not consider themselves beaten. Although they had suffered a setback and immense losses at Orléans itself, the surrounding perimeter of the Orleanais region – Beaugency, Meung, Janville, Jargeau – was still in their hands. Indeed, it was possible for the English to reorganize and resume the siege of Orléans itself soon after, this time perhaps with more success, as the bridge was now repaired, and thus more susceptible to being taken by assault. Suffolk&#x27;s priority that day (8 May) was to salvage what remained of the English forces.

The French commanders realized as much, Joan less so. Leaving Orléans, she met the Dauphin Charles outside of Tours on 13 May to report her victory. She immediately called for a march northeast into Champagne, towards Reims, but the French commanders knew they had to first clear the English out of their dangerous positions on the Loire.

The Loire Campaign began a couple of weeks later, after a period of rest and reinforcement. Volunteers of men and supplies swelled the French army, eager to serve under Joan of Arc&#x27;s banner. Even the ostracized constable Arthur de Richemont was eventually permitted to join the campaign. After a series of brief sieges and battles at Jargeau (12 June), Meung (15 June) and Beaugency (17 June), the Loire was back in French hands. An English reinforcement army rushing from Paris under John Talbot was defeated at the Battle of Patay shortly after (18 June), the first significant field victory for French forces in years. The English commanders, the Earl of Suffolk and Lord Talbot, were taken prisoner in this campaign. Only thereafter did the French feel safe enough to accede to Joan&#x27;s request for a march on Reims.

After some preparation, the march on Reims began from Gien on 29 June, the Dauphin Charles following Joan and the French army through the dangerous Burgundian-occupied territory of Champagne. Although Auxerre (1 July) closed its gates and refused them entry, Saint-Florentin (3 July) yielded, as did, after some resistance, Troyes (11 July) and Châlons-sur-Marne (15 July). They reached Reims the next day and the Dauphin Charles, with Joan at his side, was finally consecrated as King Charles VII of France on 17 July 1429.

==Legacy==
The city of Orléans commemorates the lifting of the siege with an annual festival, including both modern and medieval elements and a woman representing Joan of Arc in full armor atop a horse. On 8 May Orléans simultaneously celebrates the lifting of the siege and V-E Day (Victory in Europe, the day that Nazi Germany surrendered to the Allies to end World War II in Europe.)

<text>The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the 6th FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial football tournament for men&#x27;s senior national teams. It was played in Sweden from 8 to 29 June 1958. It was the first and only FIFA World Cup to be played in a Nordic country.

Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in the final in Solna, Stockholm, to claim their first title, having beaten France in the semi-final and Wales in the quarter-final. The tournament also marked the arrival of a then 17-year-old Pelé on the world stage, who scored in all three of Brazil&#x27;s knockout games.

This was the first appearance of Wales at the FIFA World Cup. They would not qualify for another until 64 years later. This tournament also marked the debuts of fellow British side Northern Ireland, as well as the Soviet Union. Defending champions West Germany were eliminated by runners-up Sweden and would lose to France in a third place match.

== Host selection ==

Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden expressed interest in hosting the tournament. Swedish delegates lobbied other countries at the FIFA Congress held in Rio de Janeiro around the opening of the 1950 World Cup finals. Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.

== Qualification ==

The hosts (Sweden) and the defending champions (West Germany) qualified automatically. Of the remaining 14 places, nine were allocated to Europe, three to South America, one to North/Central America, and one to Asia/Africa.

Aside from the main European zone matches, Wales, which finished second in its group behind Czechoslovakia, was drawn into a play-off with Israel after Israel won its group by default because its three opponents, Turkey, Indonesia and Sudan, refused to play. FIFA had imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match, something that had happened in several previous World Cups. Wales won the play-off and qualified for the first time (something they would not do again until 2022). With Northern Ireland making its debut, and England and Scotland also qualifying, this World Cup was the only one to date to feature all four of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Home Nations.

This World Cup also saw the entry and qualification of the Soviet Union for the first time, while Argentina appeared for the first time since 1934. It was also the first one for which Italy failed to qualify (Italy did not take part in the 1930 tournament but there was no qualification for that competition). Other teams that failed to qualify included two-time champions and 1954 semifinalists Uruguay, as well as Spain and Belgium.

On 8 February 1958, in Solna, Lennart Hyland and Sven Jerring presented the results of the draw where the qualified teams were divided into four groups. Seeding was geographical rather than by team strength, with each group containing one western European team, one eastern European team, one of the four British teams that had qualified, and one from the Americas.

== Format ==

The format of the competition changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played each of the other teams in its group at least once, without extra time in the event of a draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points, then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third-placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal, then lots would have been drawn. By the time the competition began, these arrangements were still in discussion. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches, FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, stating that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.

This was the first time that goal average was available to separate teams in a World Cup. It was used to separate the teams finishing first and second in one of the groups. However, all three playoffs finished with decisive results and so it was not needed to separate the teams involved in a tied playoff.

Almost all the matches kicked off simultaneously in each of the three rounds of the group phase, as did the quarter-finals and semi-finals. The exceptions were Sweden&#x27;s three group matches, all of which were televised by Sveriges Radio; these started at other times so Swedes could attend other matches without missing their own team&#x27;s. Apart from these, one match per round was televised, and relayed across Europe by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Many Swedes bought their first television for the World Cup.

The official ball was the &quot;Top-Star VM-bollen 1958&quot; model made by Sydsvenska Läder &amp; Remfabriks AB (aka &quot;Remmen&quot; or &quot;Sydläder&quot;) in Ängelholm. Four FIFA officials conducted a blind test to choose it from 102 candidates.

== Summary ==

In Group 4, Pelé and Garrincha did not play until the last of Brazil&#x27;s group games, against the Soviet Union. Pelé failed to score, but provided the assist to Vavá&#x27;s second goal. Brazil won the game 2–0 (also thanks to an impressive exhibition of dribbling prowess by Garrincha) and the group by two points. Previously, they had drawn 0–0 with England in what was the first ever goalless game in World Cup history. Eventually, the Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game, in which Anatoli Ilyin scored in the 67th minute to knock England out, while Austria had already been eliminated. The English side had been weakened by the Munich air disaster earlier in the year, which killed three internationals on the books of Manchester United, including England&#x27;s young star Duncan Edwards.

Playoffs were also needed in Group 1 (Northern Ireland beat Czechoslovakia to join the defending champions West Germany in the quarter-finals) and Group 3 (Wales topped Hungary to advance with hosts Sweden). Hungary had become a spent force after their appearance in the final of the previous tournament. They had lost their best players two years before, when they fled in the wake of the failed uprising against the communist regime. In a rather restrictive sense, from the 1954 team, only goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, defender Jozsef Bozsik and forward Nándor Hidegkuti remained.

In Group 2, Scotland faced Yugoslavia, Paraguay, and France. France topped the group, with Just Fontaine netting six goals. Yugoslavia finished second, while Scotland came in last.

The quarter-finals saw France&#x27;s Just Fontaine continue in similar form as in the group stage, managing another two goals as France triumphed over Northern Ireland. West Germany&#x27;s Helmut Rahn put them into the semi-finals with a single goal against Yugoslavia, while Sweden went through at the expense of USSR. The other game in the quarter-finals saw Pelé score the only goal for Brazil against Wales.

In the semi-finals, Sweden continued their strong run as they defeated West Germany 3–1 in a vicious game that saw the German player Erich Juskowiak sent off (the first ever German player to be sent off in an international game) and German veteran forward Fritz Walter injured, which further weakened the German team (substitutes were first allowed in the 1970 FIFA World Cup).

In the other semi-final, Brazil and France were tied 1–1 for much of the first half. However, 36 minutes into the game, French captain and most experienced defender Robert Jonquet suffered a broken leg in a clash with Vavá, and France was down to ten men for the rest of the game, (substitutions were not allowed back then). Brazil dominated the rest of the match, as a Pelé hat-trick gave them a 5–2 victory. Fontaine of France added one goal to his impressive tally.

The third-place match saw Fontaine score four more goals as France defeated West Germany 6–3. This brought his total to 13 goals in one competition, a record that still stands.

=== Final ===
The final was played in Solna, in the Råsunda Stadium; 50,000 people watched as the Brazilians went a goal down after four minutes. However, Vavá equalised shortly afterwards and then put them a goal ahead before half time. In the second half, Pelé outshone everyone, notching two goals, including the first one where he lobbed the ball over Bengt Gustavsson then followed it with a precise volley shot. Zagallo added a goal in between, and Sweden managed a consolation goal.

The Final saw many records made in World Cup history that still stand . At age 17, Pelé simultaneously became the youngest player to participate in, score, and win a World Cup final. Conversely, Nils Liedholm became the oldest player to score in a World Cup Final at 35 years 263 days. This final had the highest number of goals scored by a winning team (5), the highest number of total goals scored (7), and together with the 1970 and 1998 finals shares the highest goal margin of difference (3); Brazil played in all those three finals.

The game is also notable for many firsts in FIFA World Cup. With the exception of the 1950 FIFA World Cup final group stage, this marked the first time that a World Cup host reached the final without winning it. Additionally, the match marked the first time two nations from different continents (Europe and South America) met in a World Cup final. It also marks the first and only World Cup hosted in Europe not won by a European team, a feat mirrored in 2014 where a World Cup hosted in the Americas was not won by a team from the Americas for the first time, with Germany beating Argentina 1–0 at the final.

== Venues ==
A total of twelve cities throughout the central and southern parts of Sweden hosted the tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000. If Denmark had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the Idrætsparken in Copenhagen for Denmark&#x27;s group matches. The Idrætsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification. When doubts arose about whether funding would be forthcoming for rebuilding the Ullevi and Malmö Stadion, the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and Oslo as contingency measures.

The Råsunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands. Organising committee chairman Holger Bergérus mortgaged his house to pay for this. The new Malmö Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malmö Stadion at a new site. The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup. The Social Democratic municipal government refused to pay for this until the organisers threatened to select Folkungavallen in Linköping instead. At the Rimnersvallen, a stand from the smaller Oddevallen stadium was moved to Rimnersvallen for the World Cup. The crowd at Brazil v. Austria was estimated at 21,000, with more looking in from the adjoining hillside. The most used stadium was the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, which hosted 8 matches, including the final, followed by the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg (the biggest stadium used during the tournament), which hosted 7 matches. The Malmö Stadium hosted 4 matches, Norrköping hosted 3 matches; Borås, Halmstad, Helsingborg, Västerås, and Sandviken hosted 2 matches each, and Örebro, Eskilstuna, and Uddevalla each hosted 1 match.

== Seeding ==
There was no seeding for this World Cup; the teams were instead allocated geographically into four pots chosen by the FIFA Organising Committee. Teams were drawn from each pot into Groups 1–4 in numerical order.

Preventing the defending champions from meeting the hosts in the group stage, either by seeding or predetermined group positions, was a practiced tradition throughout the history of the FIFA World Cup, with 1934 and 1954 being the only two exceptions. This tradition continued in 1958, with West Germany as defending champion and host nation Sweden both being allocated into the same &quot;Western European Pot&quot;, which kept them from meeting in the group stage.

The geographical basis of the seeding attracted criticism, especially from Austria, who were drawn against the teams considered strongest in each of the other three pots.

== Squads ==
For a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see &quot;1958 FIFA World Cup squads&quot;.

==Group stage==

===Group 1===
The West Germans, surprise world champions four years before, were still very strong, and fielded an exciting young forward in Uwe Seeler. The Germans had to contend with a real powerhouse in Argentina&#x27;s team, competing for the first time since 1934. In fact, some experts thought Argentina had a very realistic chance of reaching the semi-finals or even winning the World Cup this time.
Czechoslovakia was a fairly strong team with a rich football tradition, and was considered to be no walkover for the West Germans or the Argentinians. 

Nobody expected much from tiny newcomers Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish had already shown that they could be a danger by knocking out double world champions Italy in World Cup qualifying.
In the end, the Northern Irish pulled off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup Finals history by qualifying for the quarter-finals, beating Czechoslovakia in a play-off. 

Argentina experienced a horrible blow finishing last in the group with a −5 goal differential. Arriving home, the Argentinian team met the wrath of several thousand angry football fans at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires.

====Play-off====
===Group 2===
The second group saw the largest number of goals scored in a single group in the 1958 World Cup, with 31 goals in total (~5.16 goals per game). Just Fontaine of France scored 6 of his 13 goals in the tournament, making him the tournament&#x27;s top scorer going into the quarter-finals.

The teams in this group had not seen significant success in past World Cups. France, even as hosts in 1938, did not secure notable achievements; Yugoslavia failed to match their 1930 semi-final run, and both Paraguay and Scotland entered the tournament as underdogs.

France won the group ahead of Yugoslavia and would go on to finish third.

* France finished ahead of Yugoslavia on goal average



===Group 3===
The Swedish hosts could count themselves lucky in ending up in a rather weak group, which they proceeded to win fairly easily with their powerful, workmanlike football. The group included Hungary which had been considered by far the best team in the world some years ago, although the Hungarians could not beat West Germany in the final of the World Cup in 1954. But the Hungarian team had been dealt a blow by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 after which star players like Sándor Kocsis and Ferenc Puskás left their homeland. Striker Nándor Hidegkuti was still playing, but he was by now 36 years old and nowhere near his peak form.

In spite of Hungary&#x27;s recent travails, they were still considered a strong side and were expected to advance from their group. The success of Wales was a surprise but they drew all their group games and beat the Hungarians in a play-off match to follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Wales played Brazil in the quarterfinals and became the recipient of young Pelé&#x27;s first World Cup goal.

The 1–1 draw between Wales and Mexico was the first point scored by Mexico in a World Cup, having lost all eight matches in their previous three appearances in the World Cup, as well as their first match in this group against Sweden. To date, no other team has ever lost nine consecutive games in the World Cup.

The match between Hungary and Wales in Sandviken became the northernmost World Cup match in history.

* Wales finished ahead of Hungary by winning a play-off



====Play-off====
===Group 4===
Despite setbacks in earlier tournaments, Brazil was still regarded as a formidable force, a reputation they would go on to justify. The Soviet Union, having clinched the Olympic gold in 1956, and Austria, securing the bronze medal at the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, were also strong contenders. England, despite being weakened by the tragic Munich air disaster that claimed several players, remained a team of considerable strength.

In the end, this group had the highest average attendance (31,320 per game), even higher than Group 3 with the host nation, Sweden.

The quality of the football in this group did not quite live up to expectations, however. Only 15 goals were scored in the whole group, only one more than Group 3. And when England and Brazil drew 0–0, it was the first time in World Cup history that a game ended goalless. It was also the first time Brazil had failed to score in a World Cup finals match.

Brazil won the group without conceding a single goal. The teenage Pelé played Brazil&#x27;s last game against the Soviet Union. He did not score but drew wild reviews for his play. The Soviet Union, in their first World Cup, took second place.

* The Soviet Union finished ahead of England by winning a play-off

<text>The University of Bristol is a public research university in Bristol, England. It received its royal charter in 1909, although it can trace its roots to a Merchant Venturers&#x27; school founded in 1595 and University College, Bristol, which had been in existence since 1876. Bristol Medical School, founded in 1833, was merged with the University College in 1893, and later became the university&#x27;s school of medicine.

The university is organised into six academic faculties composed of multiple schools and departments running over 200 undergraduate courses, largely in the Tyndalls Park area of the city. It had a total income of £1.06 billion in 2023–24, of which £294.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £768.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol Financial Statement 23/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest independent employer in Bristol. Current academics include 23 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 13 fellows of the British Academy, 43 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 48 fellows of the Royal Society. The University of Bristol&#x27;s alumni and faculty include 13 Nobel laureates.

Bristol is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities, the European-wide Coimbra Group and the Worldwide Universities Network, of which the university&#x27;s previous vice-chancellor, Eric Thomas, was chairman from 2005 to 2007. In addition, the university holds an Erasmus Charter, sending more than 500 students per year to partner institutions in Europe. It has an average of 6.4 (Sciences faculty) to 13.1 (Medicine &amp; Dentistry Faculty) applicants for each undergraduate place.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
The earliest antecedent of the university was the engineering department of the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College (founded as a school as early as 1595) which became the engineering faculty of Bristol University. The university was also preceded by Bristol Medical School (1833) and University College, Bristol, founded in 1876, where its first lecture was attended by only 99 students. 

The university was able to apply for a royal charter due to the financial support of the Wills and Fry families, who made their fortunes in tobacco plantations and chocolate respectively (while there was no funding from Edward Colston). A 2018 study commissioned by the university estimated 85% of the philanthropic funds used for the institution&#x27;s foundation &quot;depended on the labour of enslaved people&quot;. 

The royal charter was gained in May 1909, with 288 undergraduates and 400 other students entering the university in October 1909. Henry Overton Wills III became its first chancellor. The University College was the first such institution in the country to admit women on the same basis as men. However, women were forbidden to take examinations in medicine until 1906.
Since the founding of the university itself in 1909, it has grown considerably and is now one of the largest employers in the local area, although it is smaller by student numbers than the nearby University of the West of England. 

=== Early years ===

After the founding of the university college in 1876, government support began in 1889. Funding from mergers with the Bristol Medical School in 1893 and the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College in 1909, allowed the opening of a new medical school and an engineering school — two subjects that remain among the university&#x27;s greatest strengths. 

In 1908, gifts from the Fry and Wills families, particularly £100,000 from Henry Overton Wills III (£6m in today&#x27;s money), were provided to endow a university for Bristol and the West of England, provided that a royal charter could be obtained within two years. In December 1909, the king granted such a charter and erected the University of Bristol. Henry Wills became its first chancellor and Conwy Lloyd Morgan the first vice-chancellor. Wills died in 1911 and in tribute his sons George and Harry built the Wills Memorial Building, starting in 1913 and finally finishing in 1925. Today, it houses parts of the academic provision for earth sciences and law, and graduation ceremonies are held in its Great Hall. The Wills Memorial Building is a Grade II* listed building.

In 1920, George Wills bought the Victoria Rooms and endowed them to the university as a students&#x27; union.
The building now houses the Department of Music and is a Grade II* listed building.
At the point of foundation, the university was required to provide for the local community. This mission was behind the creation of the Department of Extra-Mural Adult Education in 1924 to provide courses to the local community. This mission continues today; a new admissions policy specifically caters to the &quot;BS&quot; postcode area of Bristol.

Among the famous names associated with Bristol in this early period is Paul Dirac, who graduated in 1921 with a degree in engineering, before obtaining a second degree in mathematics in 1923 from Cambridge. For his subsequent pioneering work on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by Ernest Rutherford. It has since housed several Nobel Prize winners: Cecil Frank Powell (1950); Hans Albrecht Bethe (1967); and Sir Nevill Francis Mott (1977). The laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the Bristol Grammar School and the city museum.

Sir Winston Churchill became the university&#x27;s third chancellor in 1929, serving the university in that capacity until 1965. He succeeded Richard Haldane who had held the office from 1912 following the death of Henry Wills.

During World War II, the Wills Memorial was bombed, destroying the Great Hall and the organ it housed, along with 7,000 books removed from King&#x27;s College London for safe keeping. It has since been restored, complete with oak panelled walls and a new organ.

=== Post-war development ===

In 1946, the university established the first drama department in the country. In the same year, Bristol began offering special entrance exams and grants to aid the resettlement of servicemen returning home. Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen&#x27;s Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university&#x27;s engineers until 1996, when the electrical engineering and computer science departments moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers&#x27; Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen&#x27;s Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the faculty and provides academic space for the &quot;heavy&quot; engineering subjects (civil, mechanical, and aerospace).

With unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students&#x27; Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the Clifton area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The University of Bristol Union provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100, the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought by many to be ugly and out of character compared to the architecture of the rest of the Clifton area, having been mentioned in a BBC poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development &#x27;masterplan&#x27;. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.

The 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the Anderson Report, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university). A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.

As the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.
One of the few centres for deaf studies in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties. Also in 1988, and again in 2004, the Students&#x27; Union AGM voted to disaffiliate from the National Union of Students (NUS). On both occasions, however, the subsequent referendum of all students reversed that decision and Bristol remains affiliated to the NUS.

In 1988, Sir Jeremy Morse, then chairman of Lloyds Bank, became chancellor.

=== 21st century ===

As the number of postgraduate students has grown (particularly the numbers pursuing taught master&#x27;s degrees), there eventually became a need for separate representation on university bodies and the Postgraduate Union (PGU) was established in 2000.
Universities are increasingly expected to exploit the intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses). In 2001, the university signed a 25-year research funding deal with IP2IPO, an intellectual property commercialisation company. In 2007, research activities were expanded further with the opening of the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) and The Bristol Institute for Public Affairs (BIPA).

In 2002, the university was involved in an argument over press intrusion after details of then-prime minister Tony Blair&#x27;s son&#x27;s application to university were published in national newspapers. In the same year, the university opened the new Centre for Sports, Exercise and Health in the heart of the university precinct. At a cost, local residents are also able to use the facilities.
Brenda Hale, the first female Law Lord, became chancellor of the university in 2003. Sir Paul Nurse succeeded Lady Hale as chancellor on 1 January 2017.

Expansion of teaching and research activities continues. In 2004, the Faculty of Engineering completed work on the Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering (BLADE). This £18.5m project is intended to further the study of dynamics and is the most advanced such facility in Europe. It was built as an extension to the Queen&#x27;s Building and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2005.

In January 2005, the School of Chemistry was awarded £4.5m by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to create Bristol ChemLabS: a Centre for Excellence in Teaching &amp; Learning (CETL), with an additional £350k announced for the capital part of the project in February 2006. Bristol ChemLabS stands for Bristol Chemical Laboratory Sciences; it is the only chemistry CETL in the UK.

September 2009 saw the opening of the university&#x27;s Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information. This £11 million building is known as the quietest building in the world and has other technologically sophisticated features such as self-cleaning glass. Advanced research into quantum computing, nanotechnology, materials and other disciplines are being undertaken in the building.

There is also a plan to significantly redevelop the centre of the University Precinct in the coming years. The first step began in September 2011, with the start of construction of a state-of-the-art Life Sciences building.

In 2018 while building work was underway in the Fry Building, the building caught fire.

In 2024 the university revised their emblem, removing the dolphin emblem because of its connection to the slave-trader Edward Colston and adding an image of moving pages and a bookmark.

== Campus ==


=== Buildings and sites ===

The university does not have a main campus but is spread over a considerable geographic area. Most of its activities, however, are concentrated in the area of the city centre, referred to as the &quot;University Precinct&quot;.

Some of the University of Bristol&#x27;s buildings date to its pre-charter days when it was University College Bristol. These buildings were designed by Charles Hansom, and suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building. The armorials on the Founder&#x27;s Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. Other notable buildings and sites include Royal Fort House, the University of Bristol Botanic Garden, many large Victorian houses which were converted for teaching in the Faculty of Arts, and the Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department and were designed by Charles Dyer. The tympanum of the building depicts a scene from &quot;The Advent of Morning&quot; designed by Jabez Tyley.

Goldney gardens entered the property of the University of Bristol through George Wills who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hill House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor Conwy Lloyd Morgan. Eventually land was purchased in Stoke Bishop, allowing the building of what has been described as a &quot;quasi-Oxbridge&quot; hall, Wills Hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills&#x27; widow after his death. When Goldney did become student accommodation in 1956, the flats were designed by Michael Grice who received an award from the Civic Trust for their design.

Burwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the Avon Gorge, was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of Sir George Oatley. The building is now used to house the Centre for Continuing Education.

Many of the more modern buildings, including Senate House and the newer parts of the HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall using funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building.

In May 2022, the university announced the opening of the Gambling Harms and Research Centre (GHRC). The centre worth £4 million aims to increase awareness and understanding of the dangers of gambling. The project was funded by the GambleAware charity, which chose the university for its history in researching gambling issues, and will integrate research from six facilities.

=== Planned expansion ===

In November 2016, the university announced that it plans to build a £300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, next to Bristol Temple Meads railway station within Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone. The new campus, which will include a business school, digital research facilities and a student village, is expected to open in 2021. For the existing campus, there are plans to remodel Tyndall Avenue, pedestrianise the surrounding area and build a new library and resource hub.

== Organisation and governance ==
In common with most UK universities, Bristol is headed formally by the chancellor, currently Sir Paul Nurse and led on a day-to-day basis by the vice-chancellor, currently Professor Evelyn Welch, who is the academic leader and chief executive. There are four pro vice-chancellors and three ceremonial pro-chancellors. The chancellor may hold office for up to ten years and the pro-chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellors have no term limits. The vice-chancellor is supported by a deputy vice-chancellor.

Responsibility for running the university is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university&#x27;s statutes and charter, with the exception of academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay in touch with the university.

The university is made up of a number of schools and departments organised into six faculties:

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Bristol had a total income of £1.060 billion (2022/23 – £902.2 million) and total expenditure of £768.7 million (2022/23 – £807.5 million). Key sources of income included £459.9 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £416.4 million), £119 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £127.7 million), £294.1 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £203.3 million), £16.5 million from investment income (2022/23 – £13.6 million) and £8.9 million from endowment donations (2022/23 – £0.6 million).

At year end, Bristol had endowments of £98.7 million (2023 – £86.1 million) and total net assets of £1.581 billion (2023 – £1.256 billion). It holds the fifteenth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

=== Logo and arms ===
In 2004, the university unveiled its new logo. The icons in the logo are the sun for the Wills family, the dolphin for Colston, the horse for Fry and the ship-and-castle from the medieval seal of the City of Bristol, as also used in the coat of arms. The shape of the whole logo represents the open book of learning. This logo has replaced the university arms shown, but the arms continue to be used where there is a specific historical or ceremonial requirement. The arms comprise:

The inscription on the book is the Latin opening of the 124th Psalm, &quot;If the Lord Himself had not (been on our side...)&quot;. The latin motto granted with the Arms below the shields is Vim promovet insitam, from the fourth Ode of Horace&#x27;s fourth book meaning &#x27;[Learning] promotes one&#x27;s innate power&#x27;.

==Academics==

===Admissions===

Bristol had the 8th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 485 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAaa in A-level grades. Competition for places is high with an average 7.7 applications per place according to the 2014 Sunday Times League Tables, making it the joint 11th most competitive university in the UK.

=== Degrees ===
Bristol awards a range of academic degrees spanning bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees as well as junior doctorates and higher doctorates. The postnominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities. The university is part of the Engineering Doctorate scheme, and awards the Eng. D. in systems engineering, engineering management, aerospace engineering and non-destructive evaluation.

Bristol notably does not award by title any bachelor&#x27;s degrees in music, which is available for study but awarded BA (although it does award MMus and DMus), nor any degree in divinity, since divinity is not available for study (students of theology are awarded a BA). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.

The degrees of DLitt, DSc, DEng, LLD and DMus, whilst having regulations specifying the grounds for award, are most often conferred as honorary degrees (&quot;in honoris causa&quot;). Those used most commonly are the DLitt, DSc and LLD, with the MA (and occasionally the MLitt) also sometimes conferred honorarily for distinction in the local area or within the university.

== Publishing and commercial activities ==

=== Bristol University Press ===
Bristol University Press is scholarly press based at University of Bristol.

It is for delivering research contributing to the development of a Smart City and deploying a city-scale open and programmable testbed for experimentation and digital innovation. The collaboration of two organisations started in April 2015 and ended in December 2019 with Bristol City Council taking full control of BiO&#x27;s operations. It has completed many technical trials and experiments including open access to Wi-Fi as a reduction of the digital divide and development for Smart City technology.

== Student life ==

=== Students&#x27; Union ===

The University of Bristol Students&#x27; Union (Bristol SU) located on Queen&#x27;s Road in the Richmond Building is a founding member of the National Union of Students and is amongst the oldest students&#x27; unions in England. The union oversees three media outlets: UBTV, the Bristol University Radio Station (BURST) and the student newspaper &quot;Epigram&quot;. There is also a local branch of &quot;The Tab&quot;. The Union is responsible for representing students&#x27; academic interests through elections of student representatives and democratic events. The Union is also responsible for the organisation of the annual Welcome Fair, the co-ordination of Bristol Student Community Action, which organises volunteering projects in the local community, and the organisation of entertainment events and over 400 student groups, societies and clubs. Previous presidents have included Sue Lawley and former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. There is a separate union for postgraduate students, as well as an athletic union, which is a member of the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport. In distinction to the &quot;blues&quot; awarded for sporting excellence at Oxford and Cambridge, Bristol&#x27;s most successful athletes are awarded &quot;reds&quot;.

=== Halls of residence ===


Accommodation for students is primarily in the central precinct of the university and two areas of Bristol: Clifton and Stoke Bishop, known respectively as the West and North Villages.

In Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall on the edge of the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall&#x27;s establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992.
In Clifton, Goldney Hall was built first in the early 18th century by the wealthy merchant Goldney family and eventually became part of the university in 1956. It is a popular location for filming, with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; and &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot;, as well as episodes of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;, being filmed there. The Grotto in the grounds is a Grade I listed building. Clifton Hill House is another Grade I listed building now used as student accommodation in Clifton. The original building was constructed between 1745 and 1750 by Isaac Ware, and has been used by the university since its earliest days in 1909. Manor Hall comprises five separate buildings, the principal of which was erected from 1927 to 1932 to the design of George Oatley following a donation from Henry Herbert Wills. Manor Hall houses the largest and most dated rooms, some dating back to the early 20th century. One of its annexes, Manor House, has recently been refurbished and officially &#x27;reopened&#x27; in 1999. 
On the central precinct sits The Hawthorns, a student house accommodating 115 undergraduate students. The house started life as a collection of villas built somewhere between 1888 and 1924 that were later converted, bit by bit, into a hotel by John Dingle. The Hawthorns also houses conferencing facilities, the staff refectory and bar, the Accommodation Office and the Student Houses Office. 33 Colston Street was opened in the city centre in October 2011 after the university acquired the property in 2009. 

Several of the residences in the central precinct are more recent and have been built and are managed by third-party organisations under exclusivity arrangements with the university. New Bridewell House, opened in 2016, is in the former police HQ, and is operated by Fresh Student Housing. Unite House and Chantry Court, were opened in 2000 and 2003 respectively by the UNITE Group. Dean&#x27;s Court (2001, postgraduates only) and Woodland Court (2005), are both run by the Dominion Housing Group.

All of the main halls elect groups of students to the Junior Common Room to organise the halls social calendar for the next year. Residents of student houses, private accommodation and students living at home become members of Orbital – a society organising social events for students throughout the year.

===Sport===
Sports membership at Bristol University totals up to 4,000 students across a wide range of unique team and individual pursuits. Its network of over 70 sports clubs and four sites are run by the university&#x27;s Student Union and its Sport,Exercise and Health Department.

<text>Georges Carpentier (; 12 January 1894 – 28 October 1975) was a French boxer, actor and World War I pilot.
A precocious pugilist, Carpentier fought in numerous categories. He fought mainly as a light heavyweight and heavyweight in a career lasting from 1908 to 1926. A French professional champion on several occasions, he became the European heavyweight champion before the First World War. A sergeant aviator during the Great War, he was wounded before returning to civilian life. He then discovered rugby union, playing as a winger.

On his return to the ring in 1919, &quot;le grand Georges&quot; (&quot;the great Georges&quot; in English) he was celebrated as a symbol of a sporting powerhouse France, via performances in Great Britain and the United States of America. His knockout victory over Battling Levinsky on 12 October 1920 in Jersey City in the United States earned him the title of world champion. A defeat by Jack Dempsey the following year nevertheless strengthened his legend and brought him worldwide fame. This defeat marked the decline of his career, punctuated by the controversial loss of his titles to Battling Siki.

Nicknamed the &quot;Orchid Man&quot;, he stood and his fighting weight ranged from .

Later notable performances included a defeat by Gene Tunney. Carpentier ended his career in 1926, but remained a leading figure in French boxing. Appointed ambassador for French sport abroad after the Second World War, in which he took part in the French Air Force, Carpentier died of a heart attack in 1975. A decade after his death, the Parisian Sports Arena in the 13th arrondissement of Paris was renamed Halle Georges-Carpentier after him. Along with Marcel Cerdan, he remains one of France&#x27;s best boxers.

== Biography ==

Born in Liévin in Pas-de-Calais, Carpentier began his career by progressing up through the weight divisions, fighting in every division from welterweight upwards. After making his first professional bout at age 14, he was welterweight champion of France and of Europe in 1911, middleweight champion of Europe in 1912, and light heavyweight champion of Europe in 1913. On 1 June 1913, he beat &quot;Bombardier&quot; Billy Wells in Ghent, Belgium to become heavyweight champion of Europe. He defended his title in December against Wells, in January 1914 against Pat O&#x27;Keeffe and in London on 16 July he beat Ed &quot;Gunboat&quot; Smith to add the &quot;White Heavyweight Champion of the World&quot; to his European title. The white heavyweight title bout sported a purse worth £9,000 (equivalent to approximately £ today).

Carpentier was also a referee during the early stages of his career, supervising a number of fights including the world title bout between Jack Johnson and Frank Moran in June 1914. Carpentier was a French Air Force aviator during World War I and was awarded two of the highest French military honors, the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille Militaire. This served to heighten his already exceptional popularity, not only in France but also in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Carpentier defended his title twice again in 1919 before dropping down a weight class to challenge Battling Levinsky for the light heavyweight championship of the world. The fight took place on 12 October 1920, in Jersey City and Levinsky was knocked out in the fourth. Carpentier&#x27;s attempt at the heavyweight Championship of the world came on 2 July 1921, again in Jersey City, when he faced Jack Dempsey in front of boxing&#x27;s first million dollar gate (approximately $ today). Carpentier was badly beaten around before suffering a knockout in the second minute of the fourth round and never fought again for that title. He lost his world light heavyweight title and his European heavyweight and light heavyweight titles the following year, on 24 September 1922, in a controversial bout with Senegalese fighter Battling Siki. His last truly noteworthy fight was on 24 July 1924, with Gene Tunney at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, New York City. Carpentier lost the bout by TKO after fifteen rounds. He retired from the ring after a final exhibition bout in 1927.

Following his retirement from boxing, Carpentier spent a number of years as a vaudeville song-and-dance man, mostly in the UK and the US. As a singer he cut two sides on a gramophone record in 1927 for Pathé, in the style of French singer Maurice Chevalier. He is the author of a boxing novel, &quot;Brothers of the Brown Owl: A Story of the Boxing Ring&quot; published c. 1920 by Cassell and Company (being a volume in the uniform Cassell&#x27;s Empire Library). He also appeared in half a dozen motion pictures, starring in both silent films and talkies. He made three films in Hollywood, US, one for director J. Stuart Blackton in England and two in his native France. His last screen appearance was in 1934. Soon after, he became proprietor of an upmarket bar, &quot;Chez Georges Carpentier&quot;, in a chic Paris neighbourhood. In several different locations, this is the profession he would exercise until shortly before his death.

From the time they boxed together in 1921, Carpentier remained close friends with Jack Dempsey. They visited each other in New York and Paris, got together to commemorate the anniversary of their famous bout and exchanged birthday greetings.

== Death ==
Carpentier died in Paris at age 81 in 1975 of a heart attack, and was buried in the cimetière de Vaires-sur-Marne, Seine-et-Marne, France.

== Legacy ==
He was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

<text>: &quot;For the common use of RF induction process of heating a metal object by electromagnetic induction, see induction heating&quot;

Radio-frequency induction (RF induction) is the use of a radio frequency magnetic field to transfer energy by means of electromagnetic induction in the near field. A radio-frequency alternating current is passed through a coil of wire that acts as the transmitter, and a second coil or conducting object, magnetically coupled to the first coil, acts as the receiver.

<doc id="60995" wikidata="Q1482143" url="?curid=60995" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">
<text>The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was the police force in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 2001. It was founded on 1 June 1922 as a successor to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) following the partition of Ireland. At its peak the force had around 8,500 officers, with a further 4,500 who were members of the RUC Reserve. 

The RUC policed Northern Ireland from the aftermath of the Irish War of Independence until after the turn of the 21st century and played a major role in the Troubles between the 1960s and the 1990s. Due to the threat from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who saw the RUC as enforcing British rule, the force was heavily armed and militarised. Officers routinely carried submachine guns and assault rifles, travelled in armoured vehicles, and were based in heavily fortified police stations. It was the first police force to use rubber and plastic bullets for riot control. 

The RUC&#x27;s membership was overwhelmingly Protestant, leading to accusations by sections of the Catholic and Irish nationalist minority of one-sided policing and sectarianism. Officers were also accused of police brutality as well as collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Conversely, it was praised as one of the most professional police forces in the world by British security forces. During the Troubles, 319 RUC officers were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the IRA, which made the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve by 1983. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians. In 2000, the RUC was awarded the George Cross for bravery.

The RUC was superseded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001, as mandated by the final version of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Allegations regarding collusion prompted several inquiries, the most recent of which was authored by Police Ombudsman Nuala O&#x27;Loan in 2007. The report identified police, CID and Special Branch collusion with loyalist terrorists, but no member of the RUC has been charged or convicted of any criminal acts as a result of these inquiries. O&#x27;Loan stated in her conclusions that there was no reason to believe the findings of the investigation were isolated incidents.

==History==
===Establishment===
Under section 60 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Northern Ireland was placed under the jurisdiction of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). On 31 January 1921, Richard Dawson Bates, the first Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland, appointed a committee of inquiry on police organisation in the region. It was asked to advise on any alterations to the existing police necessary for the formation of a new force (i.e. recruitment and conditions of service, composition, strength and cost).

An interim report was published on 28 March 1922, the first official report of the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, and was subsequently accepted by the Northern Ireland Government. On 29 April 1922, King George V granted to the force the name Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In May, the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed the Constabulary Act 1922, and the RUC officially came into existence on 1 June. The headquarters of the force was established at Atlantic Buildings, Waring Street, Belfast. The uniform remained essentially the same as that of the RIC – a dark green, as opposed to the dark blue worn by the other British police forces and the . A new badge of the Red Hand of Ulster on a St George&#x27;s Cross surrounded by a chain was designed but proved unpopular and was never uniformly adopted. Eventually the harp and crown insignia of the Order of St Patrick, as worn by the RIC, was adopted.

From the beginning the RUC had a dual role, unique among British police forces, of providing a normal law enforcement service while enforcing the new Northern Ireland entity in the face of considerable opposition, both armed and unarmed. To this end, its members were armed, as the RIC had been. The RUC was limited by statute to a 3,000-strong force. Initially, a third of positions within the force were reserved for Catholics, a reflection of the denominational proportions of the population of Northern Ireland at that time. The first two thousand places were filled quickly and those reserved for Catholics were filled mainly by ex-RIC members fleeing north. Due to reluctance by the political establishment to employ too many Catholics (who were seen as potentially disloyal to the Protestant and unionist ethos of the new government) the force abandoned this policy. As a result, representation of Catholics in the RUC never exceeded 20%. In addition, many Catholics who joined the force, particularly during the Troubles, were targeted for murder or ostracised by their own community. By the 1960s, representation of Catholics in the RUC had fallen to 12%.

The RUC were supported by the Ulster Special Constabulary, a volunteer body of part-time auxiliary police established before the Northern Ireland government was set up, who had already been given uniforms and training. The RUC&#x27;s senior officer, the Inspector General, was appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland and was responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs in the Northern Ireland government for the maintenance of law and order.

===Early years===
The polarised political climate in Northern Ireland resulted in violence from both sides of the political and sectarian divide. The lawlessness that affected the region during the early 1920s, and the problems it caused for the RUC, are indicated in a police report drawn up by District Inspector R.R. Spears in February 1923. Referring to the situation in Belfast after July 1921 he stated:For twelve months after that, the city was in a state of turmoil. The IRA (Irish Republican Army) was responsible for an enormous number of murders, bombings, shootings and incendiary fires. The work of the police against them was, however, greatly hampered by the fact that the rough element on the Protestant side entered thoroughly into the disturbances, met murder with murder and adopted in many respects the tactics of the rebel gunmen. In the endeavour to cope simultaneously with the warring factions the police efforts were practically nullified. They were quite unable to rely on the restraint of one party while they dealt with the other.

About ninety police officers were killed between 1920 and 1922 in what would become Northern Ireland (see The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1920–1922)). The security forces were implicated in reprisal killings of Catholics but no convictions ever rendered. Most notable of these incidents were the McMahon killings on 26 March 1922, in which six Catholics were killed; and the Arnon Street killings several days later on 1 April 1922, in which six more Catholics were shot dead in retaliation for the IRA killing of a policeman. By the mid-1920s the situation had calmed down; for the next forty-five years the murder rate in Northern Ireland would be lower than in the rest of the UK and the crime detection rate higher.

The 1920s and 1930s were years of economic austerity. Many of Northern Ireland&#x27;s traditional industries, notably linen and shipbuilding, were in recession, which contributed to the already high level of unemployment. Serious rioting broke out in 1932 in Belfast in protest at inadequate relief for the unemployed. In response to the growth of motorised transport, the RUC Traffic Branch was formed on 1 January 1930. In 1936 the police depot at Enniskillen was formally opened and an £800,000 scheme to create a network of 196 police barracks throughout Northern Ireland by rationalizing or repairing the 224 premises inherited from the RIC was underway. In May 1937 a new white glass lamp with the RUC crest went up for the first time to replace the RIC crest still on many stations. About the same time the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Belfast was significantly expanded, with a detective head constable being appointed to head the CID force in each of the five Belfast police districts. There was sporadic IRA activity in the 1930s.

In 1937, on the occasion of the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the province, the IRA blew up a number of customs posts. In 1939 the IRA launched its Sabotage Campaign in England, which would end a few days before the outbreak of the Second World War. The war brought additional responsibilities for the police: the security of the land border with the Republic of Ireland, which remained neutral during the war, was one important consideration; smuggling greatly increased due to rationing, to the point where police virtually became revenue officers; and many wartime regulations had to be enforced, including &quot;black-out&quot; requirements on house and vehicle lights, the arrest of striking workers, port security, and restrictions on the movement of vehicles and use of petrol.

The RUC was a &quot;reserved occupation&quot;, i.e. the police force was deemed essential to the domestic war effort and its members were forbidden to leave to join the other services. The wartime situation gave a new urgency to discussions regarding the appointment of women police. The Ministry of Home Affairs finally gave approval to the enrolment of women as members of the RUC on 16 April 1943, with the first six recruits starting on 15 November, headed by Marion Paterson Macmillan, who transferred from the Metropolitan Police. Post-war policies brought about a gradual improvement in the lot of the RUC, interrupted only by a return to hostilities by the IRA border campaign from 1957 to 1962, in which seven RUC officers were killed. The force was streamlined in the 1960s, a new headquarters was opened at Knock, Belfast and a number of rural barracks were closed.

===&quot;The Troubles&quot;===
The civil rights protests during the 1960s, and the reaction to them, marked the beginning of the conflict that became known as &quot;the Troubles&quot;. The RUC found itself confronting marchers protesting against gerrymandering of local electoral wards and discrimination in local housing allocation. Many of these Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association protests were banned or truncated by the government of Northern Ireland. The Ulster Special Constabulary were controversial, with the unit seen by some nationalists as more anti-Catholic and anti-nationalist than the RUC, which, unlike the B Specials, did attract some Catholic recruits. The severe pressure on the RUC and the perceived partiality of the B-Specials led, during the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969, to the British Army being called in to support the civil administration under Operation Banner. Catholics largely turned away from the British Army, who they saw as treating Protestants differently, especially after the Falls Curfew.

===Reform===
The high level of civil unrest led to an exhaustive inquiry into the disturbances in Northern Ireland carried out by Lord Scarman, which produced a report in 1972. James Callaghan, Home Secretary in 1969, called on Brigadier John Hunt (Lord Hunt) to assess, advise and report on the policing situation. He was assisted in this task by Sir Robert Mark, who later became Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, and Sir James Robertson, then-Chief Constable of Glasgow. The Hunt Report was published on 3 October 1969, and most of its recommendations were subsequently accepted and implemented. The aim was to completely reorganise the RUC, both modernizing the force and bringing it into line with the other police forces in the UK. This meant the introduction of the British rank and promotion structure, the creation of 12 Police Divisions and 39 Sub-Divisions, the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary, and the creation of a Police Authority designed to be representative of all segments of the community.

Callaghan, later elected Prime Minister, asked Sir Arthur Young, Commissioner of the City of London Police, to be seconded for a year. Young&#x27;s appointment began the long process of turning the RUC into a British police service. The RUC Reserve was formed as an auxiliary police force, and all military-style duties were handed over to the newly formed Ulster Defence Regiment, which was under military command and replaced the B Specials. Callaghan selected Young, a career policeman, because no other British policeman could match his direct experience of policing acutely unstable societies and of reforming gendarmeries. from 1943 to 1945, he was Director of Public Safety and Director of Security in the military government of Allied-occupied Italy. Later, he had been seconded to the Federation of Malaya at the height of the Malayan Emergency (1952–53) and to the crown colony of Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion (1954).

===First deaths===
The first deaths of the Troubles occurred in July 1969. Francis McCloskey, a 67-year-old Catholic civilian, had been found unconscious on 13 July near the Dungiven Orange Hall following a police baton charge against a crowd who had been throwing stones at the hall. Witnesses later said they had seen police batoning a figure in the doorway where McCloskey was found, although police claimed that he had been unconscious before the baton charge and may have been hit with a stone. He was taken to hospital and died the following day.

On 11 October 1969, Constable Victor Arbuckle was shot dead by loyalists on Belfast&#x27;s Shankill Road during serious rioting in protest at the recommendations of the Hunt Report. Arbuckle was the first police fatality of the Troubles. In August 1970, two young constables, Donaldson and Millar, died when an abandoned car they were examining near the strongly republican town of Crossmaglen exploded. They became the first security forces victims of the Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign. This campaign involved the targeting of police officers, and continued until the final ceasefire in 1997, as the peace process gained momentum. The last RUC officer killed, Constable Francis O&#x27;Reilly (a Catholic), was also killed by loyalists, in a September 1998 bombing during the Drumcree conflict.

===Later years===
In March 1972, the Government of Northern Ireland resigned and the parliament was prorogued. Northern Ireland subsequently came under direct rule from Westminster with its own Secretary of State, who had overall responsibility for security policy. From the mid-1970s onward, the British policy of Ulsterisation meant RUC officers taking a more prominent role in the conflict than previously, which increased their casualty rate. Starting in late 1982, a number of IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) men were shot dead by the RUC. This led to accusations of a shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC. In September 1983, four officers were charged with murder in connection with the deaths. Although all were subsequently found not guilty, the British government set up the Stalker Inquiry to investigate further. In May 1986, Sir John Hermon, then Chief Constable, publicly accused unionist politicians of &quot;consorting with paramilitary elements&quot;.

Anger over the Anglo-Irish Agreement led to loyalist assaults on more than 500 homes belonging to Catholics and RUC officers during the mid-1980s. At least 150 RUC families were forced to move as a result. In 1998 Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan stated in an interview on television that he was unhappy with any RUC officers belonging to the Orange Order or any of the other loyal orders. While the RUC refused to give any details on how many officers were members of the Order, thirty-nine RUC officers are listed on the Order&#x27;s Roll of Honour (of &#x27;Orangemen&#x27; killed in the conflict). The size of the RUC was increased on several occasions. At its height, there were 8,500 regular police officers supported by about 5,000 full-time and part-time reserve officers, making it the second largest force in the United Kingdom after the Metropolitan Police in London. The direction and control of the RUC was in the hands in the Chief Constable, who was assisted by two Deputy Chief Constables and nine Assistant Chief Constables. For operational purposes, Northern Ireland was divided into twelve Divisions and thirty-nine Sub-Divisions. RUC ranks, duties, conditions of service and pay were generally in line with those of police forces in Great Britain. 

==Policing in a divided society==
Policing Northern Ireland&#x27;s divided society proved to be difficult, as each of the main religious blocs (Protestant and Roman Catholic) had different attitudes towards the institutions of the state. To most Ulster Protestants, the state had full legitimacy, as did its institutions, its parliament, its police force and the Crown. Many of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Catholics, along with their political leaders, believed that partition would only be temporary. Many abstained from and/or refused to take part Northern Ireland&#x27;s institutions for a variety of reasons, including the treatment of Catholic civilians by the Ulster Special Constabulary during the recent conflict and the mistaken belief that Northern Ireland would be ceded to the Free State in the not too distant future. Protestant fears of strategically important government services being infiltrated by Catholics disloyal to the new state polarised society and made most Catholics unwilling and/or unable to join either the police or the civil service.

This mindset was referenced by David Trimble:Ulster Unionists, fearful of being isolated on the island, built a solid house, but it was a cold house for Catholics. And northern nationalists, although they had a roof over their heads, seemed to us as if they meant to burn the house down

In August 1922, Dawson Bates gave the Orange Order special permission for an Orange Lodge to be formed in the RUC. In April 1923 he spoke at its first reunion. In 1924 John William Nixon, a District Inspector suspected of involvement in the murder of Catholic civilians, would be dismissed after widespread complaints that he had made a &quot;fiercely Unionist&quot; speech at an Orange Order function. An inquiry by the British National Council for Civil Liberties in 1936 concluded that:[I]t is difficult to escape the conclusion that the attitude of the government renders the police chary of interference with the activities of the Orange Order and its sympathisers.

On 4 April 1922, the RIC was disbanded. Three days later, the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 came into force, and the Belfast government, although prohibited from raising or controlling a military force, appointed Major General Frederick Solly-Flood as a military advisor. The RUC was to be 3,000-strong, recruiting 2,000 ex-RIC and 1,000 &quot;A Specials&quot;. It was intended that half of the RIC men recruited were to be Catholic, making up a third of positions within the force. However, fewer than half the expected number of Catholics came forward and the balance was made up with more A Specials, who continued to exist as a separate force.

Throughout its existence, republican political leaders and most Roman Catholic clerics discouraged Catholics from joining the RUC. Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) and critic of the force, who later served as Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, stated that the RUC was &quot;97% Protestant and 100% unionist&quot;. The RUC did attract some Roman Catholics, mostly former members of the RIC, who came north from the Irish Free State after the bitterness of the fighting during the Anglo-Irish War largely precluded them from remaining in territory now controlled by their enemies. The percentage of Catholics in the RUC dropped as these men retired over time. 

Notable Catholics in the RUC include RUC Chief Constable Sir James Flanagan, who survived an IRA assassination attempt; Deputy Chief Constable Michael McAtamney; Assistant Chief Constable Cathal Ramsey; Chief Superintendent Frank Lagan, and Superintendents Kevin Benedict Sheehy and Brendan McGuigan. In December 1997, &quot;The Independent&quot; (London) published a leaked internal RUC document which reported that a third of all Catholic RUC officers had reported suffering religious discrimination and/or harassment from Protestant fellow officers.

==Casualties==
According to &quot;The Thin Green Line – The History of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC&quot;, written by RUC reservist Richard Doherty, 314 officers were killed and over 9,000 were injured during the existence of the RUC. All but 12 of the dead were killed during the Troubles (1969 to 1998), of whom 277 were killed in attacks by Irish republicans. According to the CAIN project at the University of Ulster, however, 301 RUC officers and 18 former or retired RUC officers were killed, totaling 319 fatalities.

The Newry mortar attack by the Provisional IRA on an RUC station in 1985, which killed nine officers (including two Catholics), resulted in the highest number of deaths inflicted on the RUC in one incident. The two highest-ranking RUC officers to be killed during &quot;the Troubles&quot; were Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan, who were ambushed by the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade outside Jonesborough, County Armagh, on 20 March 1989. On 4 December 2013, in a report by judge Peter Smithwick in the Smithwick Tribunal (a public inquiry), it was alleged that members of the Republic&#x27;s police force (Garda Síochána) had colluded in the killing of the two policemen. The last RUC officer killed as a direct result of the conflict, Francis O&#x27;Reilly (a Catholic constable), died on 6 October 1998, a month after he had been injured in a Red Hand Defenders pipe-bomb attack in Portadown during the Drumcree conflict.

==Criticism==

===Ill-treatment of children===

On 1 July 1992, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a detailed report, alleging RUC and paramilitary violations against children&#x27;s rights during the Troubles. Both Catholic and Protestant children alleged regular and severe physical assault and mental harassment at the hands of RUC officers, usually conducted to force a false confession of a crime. In an accompanying statement, HRW cited allegations that:Police officers and soldiers harass young people on the street hitting, kicking and insulting them. Police officers in interrogation centres insult, trick and threaten youngsters and sometimes physically assault them. Children are locked up in adult detention centres and prisons in shameful conditions. Helsinki Watch heard dozens of stories from children, their parents, lawyers, youth workers and political leaders of children being stopped on the street and hit, kicked and abused again and again by police and soldiers. And seventeen-year-olds told Human Rights Watch Helsinki of severe beatings in detention during interrogations by police.

===Patten report===

The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998 produced a wholesale reorganisation of inter-community, governmental and policing systems, including a power-sharing executive. The bias, and the under-representation of Catholics and nationalists in the RUC led to, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, a fundamental policing review, headed by Chris Patten, a former British Governor of Hong Kong and Conservative Minister under Margaret Thatcher. The review was published in September 1999. It recommended a wholesale reorganisation of policing, with the Royal Ulster Constabulary being replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), and a drive to recruit Catholics and the adoption of a new crest and cap badge. The PSNI was introduced in November 2001. As part of the change, the police service dropped the word &quot;Royal&quot; from and adopted a new badge that included the crown, harp, and shamrock, an attempt at representation of the major ideologies. 

===Loyalist collusion===

====Special Patrol Group====

The Special Patrol Group was formed in the late 1960s as the Police Reserve Force. The name was changed to avoid confusion with the newly formed part-time Police Reserve in 1970, and was renamed &quot;Divisional Mobile Support Unit&quot; in 1980 after two of its members were convicted of kidnap and murder. The two, John Weir and Billy McCaughey, implicated some of their colleagues in a range of crimes including giving weapons, information and transport to loyalist paramilitaries as well as carrying out shooting and bombing attacks of their own. Weir alleged that senior officers, including Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, were aware of and approved of their activity.
====The Stevens Inquiries====

On 18 April 2003 as part of the third report into collusion between Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, RUC, and British Army, Sir John Stevens published an Overview and Recommendations document (Stevens 3). Stevens&#x27; intention was to make recommendations which arose from serious shortcomings he had identified in all three Inquiries. In his autobiography, Stevens was at pains to point out the high regard in which he held many RUC officers, including Detective Superintendent Maurice Neilly, who was killed in the 1994 Chinook air crash.

The third Stevens Inquiry began in 1999, and referred to his previous reports when making his recommendations. Stevens&#x27; third inquiry focused in detail on only two of the killings in which collusion was alleged; that of Brian Adam Lambert in 1987 and of Pat Finucane in 1989. Stevens used the following criteria as a definition of collusion while conducting his investigation:
*The failure to keep records or the existence of contradictory accounts which could limit the opportunity to rebut serious allegations.
*The absence of accountability which could allow acts or omissions by individuals to go undetected.
*The withholding of information which could impede the prevention of crime and the arrest of suspects.
*The unlawful involvement of agents in murder which could imply that the security forces sanction killings.
On 12 December 2012 the British Prime minister David Cameron admitted a statement to the House of Commons that &quot;shocking levels of collusion occurred in the murder of Finucane.&quot;

====Police Ombudsman====

In a report released on 22 January 2007, the Police Ombudsman Dame Nuala O&#x27;Loan stated Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) informers committed serious crimes, including murder, with the full knowledge of their handlers. The report stated that RUC Special Branch officers created false statements, blocked evidence searches and &quot;baby-sat&quot; suspects during interviews.

==Awards==
Awards for gallantry for individual officers since 1969 included 16 George Medals, 103 Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medals, 111 Queen&#x27;s Commendations for Bravery and 69 Queen&#x27;s Police Medals.
On 12 April 2000, the RUC was awarded the George Cross for bravery, a rare honour which had been awarded collectively only once before, to the island nation of Malta. The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a sustained and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting both sides of the community from danger – 302 officers have been killed in the line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of all of those who have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this has brought to them and to their families.

==Chief officers==
The chief officer of the Royal Irish Constabulary was its Inspector-General (the last of whom, Sir Thomas J. Smith served from 11 March 1920 until partition in 1922). Between 1922 and 1969 the position of Inspector-General of the RUC was held by five officers, the last being Sir Arthur Young, who was seconded for a year from the City of London Police to implement the Hunt Report. Under Young, the title was changed to Chief Constable in line with the recommendations of the Hunt Report. Young and six others held the job until the RUC was incorporated to the PSNI. The final incumbent, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, became the first Chief Constable of the PSNI.
*Inspector-General Sir Charles Wickham, from June 1922.
*Inspector-General Sir Richard Pim, from August 1945.
*Inspector-General Sir Albert Kennedy, from January 1961.
*Inspector-General Sir Anthony Peacocke, from February 1969.

<text>The Lampyridae are a family of elateroid beetles with more than 2,000 described species, many of which are light-emitting. They are soft-bodied beetles commonly called fireflies, lightning bugs, or [[glowworm]]s for their conspicuous production of light, mainly during twilight, to attract mates. The type species is &quot;Lampyris noctiluca&quot;, the common glow-worm of Europe. Light production in the Lampyridae is thought to have originated as a warning signal that the larvae were distasteful. This ability to create light was then co-opted as a mating signal and, in a further development, adult female fireflies of the genus &quot;Photuris&quot; mimic the flash pattern of the &quot;Photinus&quot; beetle to trap their males as prey. 

Fireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates. Many live in marshes or in wet, wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food. While all known fireflies glow as larvae, only some species produce light in their adult stage, and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species. Fireflies have attracted human attention since classical antiquity; their presence has been taken to signify a wide variety of conditions in different cultures and is especially appreciated aesthetically in Japan, where parks are set aside for this specific purpose.

==Biology==

Fireflies are beetles and in many aspects resemble other beetles at all stages of their life cycle, undergoing complete metamorphosis. A few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later. In certain firefly species with aquatic larvae, such as &quot;Aquatica leii&quot;, the female oviposits on emergent portions of aquatic plants, and the larvae descend into the water after hatching.

The larvae feed until the end of the summer. Most fireflies hibernate as larvae. Some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. At least one species, &quot;Ellychnia corrusca&quot;, overwinters as an adult. The larvae of most species are specialized predators and feed on other larvae, terrestrial snails, and slugs. Some are so specialized that they have grooved mandibles that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey. The larval stage lasts from several weeks up to, in certain species, two or more years. The larvae pupate for one to two and a half weeks and emerge as adults. 

Adult diet varies among firefly species: some are predatory, while others feed on plant pollen or nectar. Some adults, like the European glow-worm, have no mouth, emerging only to mate and lay eggs before dying. In most species, adults live for a few weeks in summer.

Fireflies vary widely in their general appearance, with differences in color, shape, size, and features such as antennae. Adults differ in size depending on the species, with the largest up to long. Many species have non-flying larviform females. These can often be distinguished from the larvae only because the adult females have compound eyes, unlike the simple eyes of larvae, though the females have much smaller (and often highly regressed) eyes than those of their males. The most commonly known fireflies are nocturnal, although numerous species are diurnal and usually not luminescent; however, some species that remain in shadowy areas may produce light.

Most fireflies are distasteful to vertebrate predators, as they contain the steroid pyrones lucibufagins, similar to the cardiotonic bufadienolides found in some poisonous toads. All fireflies glow as larvae, where bioluminescence is an aposematic warning signal to predators.

=== Light and chemical production ===


Light production in fireflies is due to the chemical process of bioluminescence. This occurs in specialized light-emitting organs, usually on a female firefly&#x27;s lower abdomen. The enzyme luciferase acts on luciferin, in the presence of magnesium ions, ATP, and oxygen to produce light. Oxygen is supplied via an abdominal trachea or breathing tube. Gene coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms. Firefly luciferase is used in forensics, and the enzyme has medical uses – in particular, for detecting the presence of ATP or magnesium. Fireflies produce a &quot;cold light&quot;, with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. The light may be yellow, green, or pale red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers. Some species such as the dimly glowing &quot;blue ghost&quot; of the Eastern US may seem to emit blueish-white light from a distance and in low light conditions, but their glow is bright green when observed up close. Their perceived blue tint may be due to the Purkinje effect. During a study on the genome of &quot;Aquatica leii&quot;, scientists discovered two key genes are responsible for the formation, activation, and positioning of this firefly&#x27;s light organ: Alabd-B and AlUnc-4.

Adults emit light primarily for mate selection. Early larval bioluminescence was adopted in the phylogeny of adult fireflies, and was repeatedly gained and lost before becoming fixed and retained as a mechanism of sexual communication in many species. Adult lampyrids have a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships: steady glows, flashing, and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems. Chemical signals, or pheromones, are the ancestral form of sexual communication; this pre-dates the evolution of flash signaling in the lineage, and is retained today in diurnally-active species. Some species, especially lightning bugs of the genera &quot;Photinus&quot;, &quot;Photuris&quot;, and &quot;Pyractomena&quot;, are distinguished by the unique courtship flash patterns emitted by flying males in search of females. In general, females of the genus &quot;Photinus&quot; do not fly, but do give a flash response to males of their own species. Signals, whether photic or chemical, allow fireflies to identify mates of their own species. Flash signaling characteristics include differences in duration, timing, color, number and rate of repetitions, height of flight, and direction of flight (e.g. climbing or diving) and vary interspecifically and geographically. When flash signals are not sufficiently distinguished between species in a population, sexual selection encourages divergence of signaling patterns. 

Synchronization of flashing occurs in several species; it is explained as phase synchronization and spontaneous order. Tropical fireflies routinely synchronise their flashes among large groups, particularly in Southeast Asia. At night along river banks in the Malaysian jungles, fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely. Current hypotheses about the causes of this behavior involve diet, social interaction, and altitude. In the Philippines, thousands of fireflies can be seen all year-round in the town of Donsol. In the United States, one of the most famous sightings of fireflies blinking in unison occurs annually near Elkmont, Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains during the first weeks of June. Congaree National Park in South Carolina is another host to this phenomenon.

Female &quot;femme fatale&quot; &quot;Photuris&quot; fireflies mimic the photic signaling patterns of the smaller &quot;Photinus&quot;, attracting males to what appears to be a suitable mate, then eating them. This provides the females with a supply of the toxic defensive lucibufagin chemicals.

Many fireflies do not produce light. Usually these species are diurnal, or day-flying, such as those in the genus &quot;Ellychnia&quot;. A few diurnal fireflies that inhabit primarily shadowy places, such as beneath tall plants or trees, are luminescent. One such genus is &quot;Lucidota&quot;.

Non-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones to signal mates. Some basal groups lack bioluminescence and use chemical signaling instead. &quot;Phosphaenus hemipterus&quot; has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits suggest that pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating that males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males can find females without the use of visual cues, so sexual communication in &quot;P. hemipterus&quot; appears to be mediated entirely by pheromones.

=== Fossil history ===

The oldest known fossils of the Lampyridae family are &quot;Protoluciola&quot; and &quot;Flammarionella&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian ~ 99 million years ago) Burmese amber of Myanmar, which belong to the subfamily Luciolinae. The light producing organs are clearly present. The ancestral glow colour for the last common ancestor of all living fireflies has been inferred to be green, based on genomic analysis. 

=== Taxonomy ===

The fireflies (including the lightning bugs) are a family, Lampyridae, of some 2,000 species within the Coleoptera. The family forms a single clade, a natural phylogenetic group. The term glowworm is used for both adults and larvae of firefly species such as &quot;Lampyris noctiluca&quot;, the common European glowworm, in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly; the flying males glow weakly and intermittently. In the Americas, &quot;glow worms&quot; are the closely related Coleopteran family Phengodidae, while in New Zealand and Australia, a &quot;glow worm&quot; is a luminescent larva of the fungus gnat &quot;Arachnocampa&quot;, within the true flies, Diptera.

=== Phylogeny ===

The phylogeny of the Lampyridae family, based on both phylogenetic and morphological evidence by Martin et al. 2019, is:

== Interaction with humans ==

=== Conservation ===

Firefly populations are thought to be declining worldwide. While monitoring data for many regions are scarce, a growing number of anecdotal reports, coupled with several published studies from Europe and Asia, suggest that fireflies are endangered. Recent IUCN Red List assessments for North American fireflies have identified species with heightened extinction risk in the US, with 18 taxa categorized as threatened with extinction. 

Fireflies face threats including habitat loss and degradation, light pollution, pesticide use, poor water quality, invasive species, over-collection, and climate change. Firefly tourism, a quickly growing sector of the travel and tourism industry, has also been identified as a potential threat to fireflies and their habitats when not managed appropriately. Like many other organisms, fireflies are directly affected by land-use change (e.g., loss of habitat area and connectivity), which is identified as the main driver of biodiversity changes in terrestrial ecosystems. Pesticides, including insecticides and herbicides, have also been indicated as a likely cause of firefly decline. These chemicals can not only harm fireflies directly but also potentially reduce prey populations and degrade habitat. Light pollution is an especially concerning threat to fireflies. Since the majority of firefly species use bioluminescent courtship signals, they are also sensitive to environmental levels of light and consequently to light pollution. A growing number of studies investigating the effects of artificial light at night on fireflies has shown that light pollution can disrupt fireflies&#x27; courtship signals and even interfere with larval dispersal. Researchers agree that protecting and enhancing firefly habitat is necessary to conserve their populations. Recommendations include reducing or limiting artificial light at night, restoring habitats where threatened species occur, and eliminating unnecessary pesticide use, among many others.

Sundarbans Firefly Sanctuary in Bangladesh was established in 2019.

=== In culture ===

Fireflies have featured in human culture around the world for centuries. In Japan, the emergence of fireflies (Japanese: ) signifies the anticipated changing of the seasons; firefly viewing is a special aesthetic pleasure of midsummer, celebrated in parks that exist for that one purpose. The Japanese sword Hotarumaru, made in the 14th century, is so named for a legend that its flaws were repaired by fireflies.

In Italy, the firefly (Italian: ) appears in Canto XXVI of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, written in the 14th century:

<text>Portable Distributed Objects (PDO) is an application programming interface (API) for creating object-oriented code that can be executed remotely on a network of computers. It was created by NeXT Computer, Inc. using their OpenStep system, whose use of Objective-C made the package very easy to write. It was characterized by its very light weight and high speed in comparison to similar systems such as CORBA.

Versions of PDO were available for Solaris, HP-UX and all versions of the OPENSTEP system, although an agreement was also announced for a version to be made for Digital Unix, then still known as OSF/1, with delivery anticipated after versions for SunOS and Solaris had been released. Product licence pricing for these platforms varied from $2,500 for use on a &quot;small server&quot; up to $10,000 for use on a &quot;large server&quot;. A version that worked with Microsoft OLE was also available called &quot;D&#x27;OLE&quot;, allowing distributed code written using PDO on any platform to be presented on Microsoft systems as if they were local OLE objects.

PDO, on the other hand, relied on a small number of features in the Objective-C runtime to handle both portability as well as distribution. The key feature was the language&#x27;s support for a &quot;second chance&quot; method in all classes; if a method call on an object failed because the object didn&#x27;t support it (normally not allowed in most languages due to strong typing), the runtime would then bundle the message into a compact format and pass it back into the object&#x27;s codice_1 method.

The normal behavior for codice_1 was to return an error, including details taken from the message (the &quot;invocation&quot;). PDO instead supplied a number of new objects with codice_1 methods that passed the invocation object to another machine on the network, with various versions to support different networks and platforms. Calling methods on remote objects was almost invisible; after some network setup (a few lines typically) PDO objects were instantiated locally and called the same way as any other object on the system. The PDO object then forwarded the invocation to the remote computer for processing and unbundled the results when they were returned.

In comparison with CORBA, PDO programs were typically 1/10 or less in size; it was common for NeXT staffers to write into magazines showing how to re-implement a multi-page CORBA article in perhaps 15 lines of code. From a programming standpoint, there was nearly nothing as easy to use as PDO.

However, PDO was also reliant entirely on Objective-C to function. This was a price most were unwilling to pay, as at the time C++ was more widely used and the effort to shift codebases to an entirely new language and paradigm was considered too onerous. PDO never saw much use, and NeXT&#x27;s emphasis shifted to its new WebObjects framework in 1995.

The ability to instantiate any object known to the local process from any other process is a known security vulnerability, and Apple strongly discourages use of PDO for that reason.

In addition to the OS X platform, there is GNUstep, which has its own implementation of Distributed Objects.

<text>Gerardus Mercator (; 5 March 1512 – 2 December 1594) was a Flemish geographer, cosmographer and cartographer. He is most renowned for creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (rhumb lines) as straight lines—an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts.

Mercator was a notable maker of globes and scientific instruments. In addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics, and geomagnetism. He was also an accomplished engraver and calligrapher. Unlike other great scholars of the age, he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over a thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator&#x27;s early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but in the second half of his life, he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in reference to a book of maps. However, Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (&quot;Cosmologia&quot;) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of the Titan Atlas, &quot;King of Mauretania&quot;, whom he considered to be the first great geographer.

A large part of Mercator&#x27;s income came from sales of terrestrial and celestial globes. For sixty years they were considered the finest in the world, and were sold in such numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving the manufacture of the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing them all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.

Mercator wrote on geography, philosophy, chronology and theology. All of the wall maps were engraved with copious text on the region concerned. As an example, the famous world map of 1569 is inscribed with over five thousand words in fifteen legends. The 1595 Atlas has about 120 pages of maps and illustrated title pages, but a greater number of pages are devoted to his account of the creation of the universe and descriptions of all the countries portrayed. His table of chronology ran to some 400 pages fixing the dates (from the time of creation) of earthly dynasties, major political and military events, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and eclipses. He also wrote on the gospels and the Old Testament.

Mercator was a devout Christian born into a Catholic family at a time when Martin Luther&#x27;s Protestantism was gaining ground. He never declared himself as a Lutheran but was clearly sympathetic, and he was accused of heresy by Catholic authorities; after six months in prison he was released unscathed. This period of persecution is probably the major factor in his move from Catholic Leuven (Louvain) to a more tolerant Duisburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, where he lived for the last thirty years of his life. Walter Ghim, Mercator&#x27;s friend and first biographer, describes him as sober in his behaviour, yet cheerful and witty in company, and never more happy than in debate with other scholars. 

==Life==
===Early years===

Gerardus Mercator was born Geert or Gerard (De) Kremer (or Cremer) in Rupelmonde, Flanders, a small village to the southwest of Antwerp, which was in the fiefdom of Habsburg Netherlands. The seventh child of Hubert (De) Kremer and his wife Emerance, his parents came from Gangelt in the Duchy of Jülich (present-day Germany). At the time of the birth they were visiting Hubert&#x27;s brother (or uncle) Gisbert De Kremer. Hubert was a poor artisan, a shoemaker by trade, but Gisbert, a priest, was a man of some importance in the community. Their stay in Rupelmonde was brief and within six months they returned to Gangelt and there Mercator spent his earliest childhood until the age of six. In 1518, the Kremer family moved back to Rupelmonde, possibly motivated by the deteriorating conditions in Gangelt—famine, plague and lawlessness. Mercator would have attended the local school in Rupelmonde from the age of seven, when he arrived from Gangelt, and there he would have been taught the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and Latin.

===School at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch 1526–1530===

After Hubert&#x27;s death in 1526, Gisbert became the 15-year-old Geert&#x27;s guardian. Hoping that Geert might follow him into the priesthood, he sent him to the famous school of the Brethren of the Common Life at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in the Duchy of Brabant. The Brotherhood and the school was founded by the charismatic Geert Groote who placed great emphasis on study of the Bible and, at the same time, expressed disapproval of the dogmas of the church, both facets of the new &quot;heresies&quot; of Martin Luther propounded only a few years earlier in 1517. Mercator would follow similar precepts later in life, with problematic outcomes.

During his time at the school the headmaster was Georgius Macropedius, and under his guidance Geert would study the Bible, the trivium (Latin, logic and rhetoric) and classics such as the philosophy of Aristotle, the natural history of Pliny and the geography of Ptolemy. All teaching at the school was in Latin and he would read, write and converse in Latin, and give himself a new Latin name, Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus, Mercator being the Latin translation of Kremer, which means &quot;merchant&quot;. The Brethren were renowned for their scriptorium, and here Mercator might have encountered the italic script which he employed in his later work. The brethren were also renowned for their thoroughness and discipline, well attested by Erasmus who had attended the school forty years before Mercator.

===University of Leuven 1530–1532===
From a famous school, Mercator moved to the famous University of Leuven, where his full Latin name appears in the matriculation records for 1530. He lived in one of the teaching colleges, the Castle College, and, although he was classified as a pauper, he rubbed shoulders with richer students, amongst whom were the anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the statesman Antoine Perrenot, and the theologian George Cassander, all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of Mercator.

The general first degree (for Magister) centred on the teaching of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place to the authority of Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music), their coverage was neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would have to resort to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.

===Antwerp 1532–1534===
The normal progress for an able magister was to go on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the university and it is quite possible that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but succeeded only in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.

During this period Mercator was in contact with the Franciscan friar Franciscus Monachus who lived in the monastery of Mechelen. He was a controversial figure who, from time to time, was in conflict with the church authorities because of his humanist outlook and his break from Aristotelian views of the world: his own views of geography were based on investigation and observation. Mercator must have been impressed by Monachus, his map collection and the famous globe that he had prepared for Jean Carondelet, the principal advisor of Charles V. The globe was constructed by the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden (Gaspar a Myrica –) with whom Mercator would be apprenticed. These encounters may well have provided the stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography. Later he would say, &quot;Since my youth, geography has been for me the primary subject of study. I liked not only the description of the Earth but the structure of the whole machinery of the world.&quot;

===Leuven 1534–1543===

Towards the end of 1534, the twenty-two-year-old Mercator arrived back in Leuven and threw himself into the study of geography, mathematics and astronomy under the guidance of Gemma Frisius. Mercator was completely out of his depth but, with the help and friendship of Gemma, who was only four years older, he succeeded in mastering the elements of mathematics within two years and the university granted him permission to tutor private students. Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon became adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.
Gemma and Gaspar Van der Heyden had completed a terrestrial globe in 1529 but by 1535 they were planning a new globe embodying the latest geographical discoveries. The gores were to be engraved on copper, instead of wood, and the text was to be in an elegant italic script instead of the heavy Roman lettering of the early globes. The globe was a combined effort: Gemma researched the content, Van der Heyden engraved the geography and Mercator engraved the text, including the cartouche which exhibited his own name in public for the first time. Interestingly the text of the cartouche attributes the production copyrights to mercator.The globe was finished in 1536 and its celestial counterpart appeared one year later. These widely admired globes were costly and their wide sales provided Mercator an income which, together with that from mathematical instruments and from teaching, allowed him to marry and establish a home. His marriage to Barbara Schellekens was in September 1536 and Arnold, the first of their six children, was born a year later.

The arrival of Mercator on the cartographic scene would have been noted by the cognoscenti who purchased Gemma&#x27;s globe – the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide an important source of income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine&#x27;s father, Nicholas Perrenot, the chancellor of Charles V.

Working alongside Gemma whilst they were producing the globes, Mercator would have witnessed the process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents to work in a burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.

A year later, in 1538, he produced his first map of the world, usually referred to as &quot;Orbis Imago&quot;. In 1539/40 he made a map of Flanders and in 1541 a terrestrial globe. All four works were received with acclaim and they sold in large numbers. The dedications of three of these works witness Mercator&#x27;s access to influential patrons: the Holy Land was dedicated to Franciscus van Cranevelt who sat on the Great Council of Mechelen, the map of Flanders was dedicated to the emperor himself and the globe was dedicated to Nicholas Perrenot, the emperor&#x27;s chief advisor. The dedicatee of the world map was more surprising: Johannes Drosius, a fellow student who, as an unorthodox priest, may well have been suspected of Lutheran heresy. Given that the symbolism of the Orbis Imago map also reflected a Lutheran view point, Mercator was exposing himself to criticism by the hardline theologians of Leuven .
In between these works he found time to write &quot;Literarum latinarum&quot;, a small instruction manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.

In 1542, the thirty-year-old must have been feeling confident about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. This was the same Duke to whom Mercator turned ten years later. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were great. The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.

===Persecution, 1543===
At no time in his life did Mercator claim to be a Lutheran, but there are many hints that he had sympathies in that direction. As a child, called Geert, he was surrounded by adults who were possibly followers of Geert Groote, who placed meditation, contemplation, and biblical study over ritual and liturgy—and who also founded the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. As an adult Mercator had family connections to Molanus, a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also, he was a close friend and correspondent of Philip Melanchthon, one of the principal Lutheran reformers. Study of the Bible was something that was central to Mercator&#x27;s life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days, doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the theologians at the university, amongst whom were two senior figures of the Inquisition, Jacobus Latomus and Ruard Tapper. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time:
 
It may well have been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed. His name appeared on a list of 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse, for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.

Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde and imprisoned in the castle. He was accused of suspicious correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well-placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perrenot was helpful is unknown: Perrenot, as a bishop, would have to support the activities of the Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.

===Leuven 1543–1552===
Mercator never committed any of his prison experiences to paper; all he would say was that he had suffered an &quot;unjust persecution&quot;. For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. They were soon destroyed in the course of the emperor&#x27;s military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.
In 1547 Mercator was visited by the young (nineteen year old) John Dee who, on completion of his undergraduate studies in Cambridge (1547), &quot;went beyond the seas to speak and confer with some learned men&quot;. Dee and Mercator were both passionately interested in the same topics and they quickly established a close rapport which lasted throughout their lives. In 1548 Dee returned to Leuven (Louvain in Dee&#x27;s text) and registered as a student: for three years he was constantly in Mercator&#x27;s company. Apart from a possible short visit to Duisburg in 1562 the two men did not meet but they corresponded frequently and by good fortune a number of their letters are preserved. Dee took maps, globes and astronomical instruments back to England and in return furnished Mercator with the latest English texts and new geographical knowledge arising from the English explorations of the world. Forty years later they were still co-operating, Dee using Mercator&#x27;s maps to convince the English court to finance Martin Frobisher&#x27;s expeditions and Mercator still avidly seeking information of new territories.

The final success in Leuven was the 1551 celestial globe, the partner of his terrestrial globe of 1541. The records of the Plantin Press show that several hundred pairs of globes were sold before the end of the century despite their high price—in 1570 they sold at 25 carolus guilders for a pair. Celestial globes were a necessary adjunct to the intellectual life of rich patrons and academics alike, for both astronomical and astrological studies, two subjects which were strongly entwined in the sixteenth century. Twenty-two pairs are still in existence.
===Duisburg 1552–1594===
In 1552 Mercator, aged 40, moved from Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves (in modern-day Germany), where he spent the rest of his life. He never gave his reasons for the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic intolerance of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; there was to be a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.

The peaceful town of Duisburg, untroubled by political and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly established himself as a man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator&#x27;s future biographer.

Mercator was welcomed by Duke Wilhelm who appointed him as court cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term other than that it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy but at that time it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator&#x27;s accomplishments but his patron&#x27;s first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke&#x27;s territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.
Around this time Mercator also received and executed a very special order for the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V: a pair of small globes, the inner (&quot;fist-size&quot;) Earth was made of wood and the outer celestial sphere was made of blown crystal glass engraved with diamond and inlaid with gold. He presented them to the emperor in Brussels who awarded him the title &quot;Imperatoris domesticus&quot; (a member of the Imperial household). The globes are lost but Mercator describes them in to Philip Melanchthon in which he declares that the globes were rotated on the top of an astronomical clock made for Charles V by Juanelo Turriano (Janellus). The clock was provided with eight dials which showed the positions of the moon, stars and planets. The illustration shows a similar clock made by the German craftsman at roughly the same time.
Earlier, Mercator had also presented Charles V with an important pamphlet on the use of globes and instruments and his latest (incorrect) ideas on magnetism: &quot;Declaratio insigniorum utilitatum quae sunt in globo terrestri : coelesti, et annulo astronomico&quot; (A description of the most important applications of the terrestrial and celestial globes and the astronomical ring). The first section is prefaced by Mercator&#x27;s ideas on magnetism, the central thesis being that magnetic compasses are attracted to a single pole (not a dipole) along great circles through that pole. He then shows how to calculate the position of the pole if the deviation is known at two known positions (Leuven and Corvo in the Azores): he finds that it must be at latitude 73°2&#x27; and longitude 169°34&#x27;. Remarkably, he also calculates the longitude difference between the pole and an arbitrary position: he had solved the longitude problem—if his theory had been correct. Further comments on magnetism may be found in an earlier letter to Perrenot and on the later world map. In the Hogenberg portrait (at the head of the article) his dividers are set on the position of the magnetic pole.
In 1554 Mercator published the long-awaited wall map of Europe, dedicating it to his friend, now Cardinal, Antoine Perrenot. He had worked at it for more than twelve years, collecting, comparing, collating and rationalising a vast amount of data and the result was a map of unprecedented detail and accuracy. It &quot;attracted more praise from scholars everywhere than any similar geographical work which has ever been brought out.&quot; It also sold in large quantities for much of the rest of the century with a second edition in 1572 and a third edition in the atlas of 1595.

The proposed university in Duisburg failed to materialise because the papal licence to found the university was delayed twelve years and by then Duke Wilhelm had lost interest. It was another 90 years before Duisburg had its university. On the other hand, no papal permit was required to establish the Akademisches Gymnasium where, in 1559 Mercator was invited to teach mathematics with cosmography. One year later, in 1560, he secured the appointment of his friend Jan Vermeulen (Molanus) as rector and then blessed Vermeulen&#x27;s marriage to his daughter Emerantia. His sons were now growing to manhood and he encouraged them to embark on his own profession. Arnold, the eldest, had produced his first map (of Iceland) in 1558 and would later take over the day-to-day running of Mercator&#x27;s enterprises. Bartholemew, his second son, showed great academic promise and in 1562 (aged 22) he took over the teaching of his father&#x27;s three-year-long lecture course—after Mercator had taught it once only! Much to Mercator&#x27;s grief, Bartholemew died young, in 1568 (aged 28). Rumold, the third son, would spend a large part of his life in London&#x27;s publishing houses providing for Mercator a vital link to the new discoveries of the Elizabethan age. In 1587 Rumold returned to Duisburg and later, in 1594, it fell to his lot to publish Mercator&#x27;s works posthumously.
In 1564 Mercator published his map of Britain, a map of greatly improved accuracy which far surpassed any of his previous representations. The circumstances were unusual. It is the only map without a dedicatee and in the text engraved on the map he pointedly denies responsibility for the map&#x27;s authorship and claims that he is merely engraving and printing it for a &quot;very good friend&quot;. The identity of neither the author nor the friend has been established but it has been suggested that the map was created by a Scottish Catholic priest called John Elder who smuggled it to French clergy known to Antoine Perrenot, Mercator&#x27;s friend. Mercator&#x27;s reticence shows that he was clearly aware of the political nature of the pro-Catholic map which showed all the Catholic religious foundations and omitted those created by Protestant Henry VIII; moreover, it was engraved with text demeaning the history of England and praising that of Catholic Ireland and Scotland. It was invaluable as an accurate guide for the planned Catholic invasion of England by Philip II of Spain.
As soon as the map of Britain was published Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture for him in the sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: &quot;The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement as a result of his terrifying experiences.&quot; Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map was published at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.
The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a set-back for his health but he soon recovered and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the &quot;Chronologia&quot;, a list of all significant events since the beginning of the world compiled from his literal reading of the Bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3,965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.

The Chronologia developed into an even wider project, the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, a description of the whole Universe. Mercator&#x27;s outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.
As the Chronologia was going to press in 1569, Mercator also published what was to become his most famous map: &quot;Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata&quot; (&#x27;A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation&#x27;). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a rhumb line) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator&#x27;s solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. On the other hand, the projection is clearly unsuitable as a description of the land masses on account of its manifest distortion at high latitudes and its use is now deprecated: other projections are more suitable. Although several hundred copies of the map were produced it soon became out of date as new discoveries showed the extent of Mercator&#x27;s inaccuracies (of poorly known lands) and speculations (for example, on the arctic and the southern continent).

Around this time the marshall of Jülich approached Mercator and asked him to prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron&#x27;s son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; of Abraham Ortelius.
Apart from a revision of the map of Europe in 1572 there would be no more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia. The first of these was a new definitive version of Ptolemy&#x27;s maps. That he should wish to do so may seem strange given that, at the same time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend Abraham Ortelius, had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator&#x27;s love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy&#x27;s written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years. It was accepted by scholars as the &quot;last word&quot;, literally and metaphorically, in a chapter of geography which was closed for good.

 Mercator now turned to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of production of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, the time he had available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.

In 1589, at the age of 77, Mercator had a new lease of life. He took a new wife, Gertrude Vierlings, the wealthy widow of a former mayor of Duisburg (and at the same time he arranged the marriage of Rumold to her daughter). A second collection of 22 maps was published covering Italy, Greece and the Balkans. This volume has a noteworthy preface for it includes mention of Atlas as a mythical king of Mauretania. &quot;I have set this man Atlas,&quot; explained Mercator, &quot;so notable for his erudition, humaneness, and wisdom as a model for my imitation.&quot; A year later, Mercator had a stroke which left him greatly incapacitated. He struggled with the assistance of his family trying to complete the remaining maps, the ongoing theological publications and a new treatise on the Creation of the World. This last work, which he did succeed in finishing, was the climax of his life&#x27;s activities, the work which, in his own opinion, surpassed all his other endeavours and provided a framework and rationale for the complete atlas. It was also his last work in a literal sense for he died after two further strokes in 1594.

===Epitaph and legacy===

Mercator was buried in the church of St. Salvatore in Duisburg where a memorial was erected about fifty years after his death. The of the epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as &quot;the foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing the heaven from the inside and the Earth from the outside ... greatly respected for his wide erudition, particularly in theology, and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life.&quot; In addition, on the base of the memorial, there is an epigram:

Following Mercator&#x27;s death, his family prepared the Atlas for publication—in four months. They hoped for it to become a source of the income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of the 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator&#x27;s account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim&#x27;s biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator&#x27;s definition of a new meaning for the word &quot;Atlas&quot;: &quot;Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura&quot; which may be translated as &quot;Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the fabric of the world and the figure of the fabrick&#x27;d&quot;, or, more colloquially, as &quot;Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.&quot; Over the years Mercator&#x27;s definition of &quot;atlas&quot; has become simply &quot;A collection of maps in a volume.&quot;

The atlas was not an immediate success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps. Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; by Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator&#x27;s un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.

The family was clearly in some financial difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator&#x27;s library of some 1,000 books was sold at a public auction in Leiden (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue perished in the Second World War but fortunately a manuscript copy had been made by Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987. Of the titles identified there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on history and geography, 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books. The contents of the library provide an insight into Mercator&#x27;s intellectual studies but the mathematics books are the only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis: they cover arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, architecture, fortification, astronomy, astrology, time measurement, calendar calculation, scientific instruments, cartography and applications. Only one of his own copies has been found—a first edition of Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; annotated in Mercator&#x27;s hand: this is held by Glasgow University.

The sale catalogue doesn&#x27;t mention any maps but it is known that the family sold the copper plates to Jodocus Hondius in 1604. He transformed the atlas. Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor, which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator&#x27;s theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the atlas became out-of-date and by the middle of the seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as Joan Blaeu and Frederik de Wit took over.
Mercator&#x27;s editions of Ptolemy and his theological writings were in print for many years after the demise of the atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book &quot;Certaine Errors&quot; (1599)—the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright&#x27;s solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout the first half of the seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently Mercator&#x27;s projection has been rejected for representations of the world but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.

Many cities have a statue of Mercator. His name has been attached to ships, buildings, universities, insurance companies, small businesses, pizzerias, streets, schools and more. There is a Belgian bank note. There is a German coin and incorrect postage stamp (showing a construction which is not the Mercator Projection). He has been modelled in sand and giant figures. There is a venomous snail and a beetle. An asteroid is named for him. On 5 March 2015, Google celebrated his 503rd birthday with a Google Doodle.

There are two museums dedicated primarily to Mercator:
* Kultur- und Stadthistorisches Museum, Duisburg, Germany. See also German Wikipedia.
* Mercator Museum (Stedelijke musea), Sint-Niklaas, Belgium.

==Works==
===Globes and instruments===
The globes by Gemma Frisius and Mercator are discussed in Volume 3 of the History of Cartography (Cartography in the European Renaissance). Chapter 6: &quot;Globes in Renaissance Europe&quot; by Elly Dekker. Chapter 44: &quot;Commercial Cartography and Map Production in the Low Countries, 1500–ca. 1672&quot; by Cornelis Koeman, Günter Schilder, Marco van Egmond, and Peter van der Krogt. The definitive work is &quot;Globi neerlandici: the production of globes in the Low Countries&quot; by Peter van der Krogt.

*1536 Gemma Frisius terrestrial globe.

::Wholly devised by Frisius who invited Mercator to engrave the text. The only extant example is part of the Schmidt collection held by the Globe Museum (website) of the Austrian National Library. Another example held at the Gymnasium Francisceum of Zerbst in eastern Germany was destroyed in the Second World War, but there is a full description in Stevenson.
*1537 Gemma Frisius celestial globe. Image 
::The only known example is held by the Royal Museums Greenwich (formerly the National Maritime Museum). On this globe Mercator&#x27;s name appears on equal footing with that of Frisius. The globe is also described in Stevenson.

*1541/1551 Terrestrial and celestial globes
::Over twenty pairs of large (420mm) globes are still in existence. Both of the globes and their un-pasted gores may be examined in high resolution. A full description of the globes may be found online in Stevenson. 
::The terrestrial globe is significant in conjecturing that North America is separated from Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus. Another feature, the shape Mercator ascribed to &quot;Beach&quot; and &quot;Maletur&quot;, later gave rise to speculation that the north coast of Australia had been visited in the early sixteenth century. An inscription on the globe promises: &quot;Where and for what reasons we have departed from the editions of others, Oh Reader, will be pointed out in our booklet&quot;.
::Mercator also added a feature of special value to seamen: from the numerous compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured in great numbers but it was never updated. The celestial globe was up to date in using the information provided by Copernicus.

===Maps===

*1537 Holy land View online.

::&quot;Amplissima Terrae Sanctae descriptio ad utriusque Testamenti intelligentiam.&quot; (A description of the Holy Land for understanding both testaments). Dedicated to Franciscus van Cranevelt. Size; in 6 sheets. Two copies are extant: one at the library of Perugia and another at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France (link above). Based on a map by the lutheran Jacob Ziegler. Mercator&#x27;s map shows the route of the Israelites from Egypt to the Promised Land. The title discloses a hope of helping people in their Bible studies, a Lutheran notion that would have aroused the suspicions of the inquisition.

*1538 World Map View online.

:: This wall map has no title but it is normally referred to as &quot;Orbis Imago&quot; (from the first sentence of the central legend, below). Size: . Dedicated to Johannes Drosius. Two copies extant: one at the American Geographical Society Library (link above), and another at the New York Public Library. The first map identifying North American and South America. The map was a slightly modified copy of a 1531 world map (and its text) by Oronce Fine. The double cordiform projection, may well have been chosen because of its relationship to aspects of Lutheran beliefs. A notice to the reader (Latin text) at the top of the map says: &quot;Let America, Sarmatia and India bear witness, Dear Reader, that the image of the world you see here is newer and more correct than those that have been circulated hitherto. We propose with regard to the different parts of the world to treat, successively, particular regions more broadly, as we are already doing with Europe, and you may soon expect a universal map, which will not be inferior to that of Ptolemy. Farewell. 1538&quot;.
*1540 Flanders (Flandria). Original, copy by Ortelius, 1595 atlas, 1613 atlas .
:: Wall map in 9 sheets. Dedicated to Charles V. This map was commissioned by merchants of Ghent who intended that it should be presented to Charles V in the forlorn hope that it might divert the wrath of the Emperor after their rebellion. It would be a more respectful replacement of a 1538 map by Pieter Van der Beke which had stressed the defiant independence of the Flemish cities. The map is remarkably accurate and it is presumed to be based on a triangulation of Flanders by Jacob van Deventer. A single original is extant and may be inspected in the Plantin-Moretus Museum: it also appeared in the atlas of 1585 and in the &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; of Abraham Ortelius.
*1554 Europe 1554 version. 1595 version.
:: &quot;Europae descriptio.&quot; Wall map on 15 sheets. Dedicated to Antoine Perrenot. No known copy of the whole map has been discovered but several copies of the map were cut and re-assembled (by Mercator) for inclusion in the unique Atlas of Europe from 1570–72, for example the map of Spain on pages 7 and 8 but not the map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 which is taken from the 1569 world map. They are available in facsimile. The map used a cordiform projection. It was revised by Mercator in 1572 and again by Rumold for the 1595 atlas. The 1995 map uses a different projection.
*1564 British Isles, 1570 atlas Individual sheets , Ortelius copy, de Jode copy.
:: &quot;Anglia &amp; Scotiae &amp; Hibernie nova descriptio.&quot; Wall map on 8 sheets. Mercator states that a friend, possibly Antoine Perrenot, had requested that he engrave this map from a manuscript copy, possibly by John Elder, a disaffected Scottish Catholic priest. Several copies of this map were cut and re-assembled for the atlas of Europe. The map is oriented with west at the top. 4 copies known.
*1564 Lorraine (Lotharingia)
:: A map commissioned by Duke René of Lorraine. The single copy of the map was never published but two detailed maps of Lorraine (north and south) appear in the Atlas of 1585.
*1569 world map Full details
*1570–1572 Atlas of Europe. View online version 1 and version 2 .
::A unique collection of maps assembled in the early 1570s, many of which are assembled from portions of Mercator&#x27;s earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 maps are from the &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; of Abraham Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this collection of maps an atlas.
*1578 Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia View online.
:: &quot;Tabulae geographicae Cl. Ptolemaei ad mentem auctoris restitutis ac emendatis.&quot; (Geographic maps according to Claudius Ptolemy, drawn in the spirit of the author and expanded by Gerard Mercator) Mercator&#x27;s definitive version of Ptolemy&#x27;s 28 maps. A second edition including the revised text of &quot;Geographia&quot; was published in 1584. &quot;Geographiae Libri Octo : recogniti iam et diligenter emendati.&quot; Example map: Britain
*1585 Atlas Galliae, Belgii Inferioris, Germaniae. (To view see 1595 Atlas).
::The first collection of 51 modern maps: 16 of France (with Switzerland), 9 corresponding to Belgium and the Netherlands and 26 of Germany. The three sections, each with a title page, dedication and supporting text, were sold together and separately. (Mercator did not term this collection of maps as an atlas.)
*1589 Atlas Italiae, Sclavoniae, Grecia. (To view see 1595 Atlas).
::A second collection of 23 modern maps: 16 of Italy (including Corsica), 3 of Styria and the other Balkan countries, 4 of Greece. (Once again Mercator did not term this collection of maps as an atlas but in the preface he introduces Atlas as a mythical King of Mauretania—a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with the making of the first globe.) This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.

*1595 Atlas (published posthumously by Rumold Mercator) View online.Translation online.

::&quot;Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura.&quot; (Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.) This is the first time that the name Atlas is used as a title of a collection of maps. Many library copies are available worldwide. There are also a number of freely available digital volumes such as those at the Library of Congress and Darlington Library (University of Pittsburgh). High resolution facsimiles were made available by Octavo Publications (now defunct) but their CD is still available from retailers; the CD is accompanied by an introduction to the atlas by and a translation of all the text and both of these are freely available in an archived version from the New York Society Library.

::The atlas includes further 28 maps: 16 of Britain, 4 of Denmark and one each of the polar regions, Iceland, Norway with Sweden, Prussia, Livonia, Russia, Lithuania, Transylvania and Crimea. This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who had spent much of his working life in London. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.

::Less than half the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not supporting it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two &#x27;testimonial&#x27; letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans for the rest of the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, &quot;De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber&quot; (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.

::The second part of the Atlas contains the maps but each section has its own title page, dedication and preface, and every country is succinctly supplemented by text describing a mixture of history, royal genealogy, ecclesiastical hierarchies, list of universities and occasionally facets of contemporary economy. Every place mentioned in the text is given its geographic coordinates to the nearest minute.

::As an example of the textual content the section on the British Isles mentions (amongst other things): alternative names; the etymology of &quot;British&quot; and its relation to woad painted tribes; climate; lack of snakes; the seemly manners of the populace; coroners and ecclesiastical courts; lists of counties, bishoprics and universities; the structure of aristocracy; and much more, even a list of recommended reading.

==Frans Hogenberg portrait text==
Frans Hogenberg was a close friend of Mercator. His portrait features prominently at the beginning of the Atlas. The text around the portrait is&lt;br&gt; 
:&quot;Magna Pelusiacis debetur gratia chartis// Magna tibi priscum tandem superasse laborem// Mercator, tractusque novos, terraeque, marisque// Monstrasse, et magnum quod continent omnia caelum. I. Vivian. ludeb&quot; (Great thanks are owed to the Ptolemaic charts, and great thanks to you, Mercator, for having at last surpassed that ancient labour, and for having shown new stretches of the earth and sea, and the great, all-containing heavens. By J. Vivian) &lt;br&gt;
The text below the image reads is &lt;br&gt;
 (Gerardus Mercator of Rupelmonde at the age of 62—Frans Hogenburg made this portrait out of affection for him. 1574)&lt;br&gt;

<text>Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behavior reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as &quot;prototypal&quot;, &quot;prototype-oriented,&quot; &quot;classless&quot;, or &quot;instance-based&quot; programming.

Prototype-based programming uses the process generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended. Using fruit as an example, a &quot;fruit&quot; object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general. A &quot;banana&quot; object would be cloned from the &quot;fruit&quot; object and general properties specific to bananas would be appended. Each individual &quot;banana&quot; object would be cloned from the generic &quot;banana&quot; object. Compare to the class-based paradigm, where a &quot;fruit&quot; &quot;class&quot; would be extended by a &quot;banana&quot; &quot;class&quot;.

The first prototype-based programming languages were Director a.k.a. Ani (on top of MacLisp) (1976-1979), and contemporaneously and not independently, ThingLab (on top of Smalltalk) (1977-1981), respective PhD projects by Kenneth Michael Kahn at MIT and Alan Hamilton Borning at Stanford (but working with Alan Kay at Xerox PARC). Borning introduced the word &quot;prototype&quot; in his TOPLAS 1981 paper. The first prototype-based programming language with more than one implementer or user was probably Yale T Scheme (1981-1984), though like Director and ThingLab initially, it just speaks of objects without classes. The language that made the name and notion of prototypes popular was Self (1985-1995), developed by David Ungar and Randall Smith to research topics in object-oriented language design.

Since the late 1990s, the classless paradigm has grown increasingly popular. Some current prototype-oriented languages are JavaScript (and other ECMAScript implementations such as JScript and Flash&#x27;s ActionScript 1.0), Lua, Cecil, NewtonScript, Io, Ioke, MOO, REBOL and AHK.

Since the 2010s, a new generation of languages with pure functional prototypes has appeared, that reduce OOP to its very core: Jsonnet is a dynamic lazy pure functional language with a builtin prototype object system using mixin inheritance; Nix is a dynamic lazy pure functional language that builds an equivalent object system (Nix &quot;extensions&quot;) in just two short function definitions (plus many other convenience functions). Both languages are used to define large distributed software configurations (Jsonnet being directly inspired by GCL, the Google Configuration Language, with which Google defines all its deployments, and has similar semantics though with dynamic binding of variables). Since then, other languages like Gerbil Scheme have implemented pure functional lazy prototype systems based on similar principles.

==Design and implementation==
Etymologically, a &quot;prototype&quot; means &quot;first cast&quot; (&quot;cast&quot; in the sense of being manufactured). A prototype is a concrete thing, from which other objects can be created by copying and modifying. For example, the International Prototype of the Kilogram is an actual object that really exists, from which new kilogram-objects can be created by copying. In comparison, a &quot;class&quot; is an abstract thing, in which objects can belong. For example, all kilogram-objects are in the class of KilogramObject, which might be a subclass of MetricObject, and so on.

Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as 
Advocates of prototype-based programming argue that it encourages the programmer to focus on the behavior of some set of examples and only later worry about classifying these objects into archetypal objects that are later used in a fashion similar to classes. Many prototype-based systems encourage the alteration of prototypes during run-time, whereas only very few class-based object-oriented systems (such as the dynamic object-oriented system, Common Lisp, Dylan, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Ruby, or Smalltalk) allow classes to be altered during the execution of a program.

Almost all prototype-based systems are based on interpreted and dynamically typed languages. Systems based on statically typed languages are technically feasible, however. The Omega language discussed in &quot;Prototype-Based Programming&quot; is an example of such a system, though according to Omega&#x27;s website even Omega is not exclusively static, but rather its &quot;compiler may choose to use static binding where this is possible and may improve the efficiency of a program.&quot;

==Object construction==
In prototype-based languages there are no explicit classes. Objects inherit directly from other objects through a prototype property. The prototype property is called codice_1 in Self and JavaScript, or codice_2 in Io. There are two methods of constructing new objects: &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (&quot;from nothing&quot;) object creation or through &quot;cloning&quot; an existing object. The former is supported through some form of object literal, declarations where objects can be defined at runtime through special syntax such as codice_3 and passed directly to a variable. While most systems support a variety of cloning, &quot;ex nihilo&quot; object creation is not as prominent.

In class-based languages, a new instance is constructed through a class&#x27;s constructor function, a special function that reserves a block of memory for the object&#x27;s members (properties and methods) and returns a reference to that block. An optional set of constructor arguments can be passed to the function and are usually held in properties. The resulting instance will inherit all the methods and properties that were defined in the class, which acts as a kind of template from which similarly typed objects can be constructed.

Systems that support &quot;ex nihilo&quot; object creation allow new objects to be created from scratch without cloning from an existing prototype. Such systems provide a special syntax for specifying the properties and behaviors of new objects without referencing existing objects. In many prototype languages there exists a root object, often called &quot;Object&quot;, which is set as the default prototype for all other objects created in run-time and which carries commonly needed methods such as a codice_4 function to return a description of the object as a string. One useful aspect of &quot;ex nihilo&quot; object creation is to ensure that a new object&#x27;s slot (properties and methods) names do not have namespace conflicts with the top-level &quot;Object&quot; object. (In the JavaScript language, one can do this by using a null prototype, i.e. codice_5.)

&quot;Cloning&quot; refers to a process whereby a new object is constructed by copying the behavior of an existing object (its prototype). The new object then carries all the qualities of the original. From this point on, the new object can be modified. In some systems the resulting child object maintains an explicit link (via &quot;delegation&quot; or &quot;resemblance&quot;) to its prototype, and changes in the prototype cause corresponding changes to be apparent in its clone. Other systems, such as the Forth-like programming language Kevo, do not propagate change from the prototype in this fashion and instead follow a more &quot;concatenative&quot; model where changes in cloned objects do not automatically propagate across descendants.
// Example of true prototypal inheritance style in JavaScript.

// Object creation using the literal object notation {}.
const foo = { name: &quot;foo&quot;, one: 1, two: 2 };

// Another object.
const bar = { two: &quot;two&quot;, three: 3 };

// Object.setPrototypeOf() is a method introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
// For the sake of simplicity, let us pretend that the following
// line works regardless of the engine used:
Object.setPrototypeOf(bar, foo); // foo is now the prototype of bar.

// If we try to access foo&#x27;s properties from bar from now on, 
// we&#x27;ll succeed. 
bar.one; // Resolves to 1.

// The child object&#x27;s properties are also accessible.
bar.three; // Resolves to 3.

// Own properties shadow prototype properties.
bar.two; // Resolves to &quot;two&quot;.
bar.name; // Unaffected, resolves to &quot;foo&quot;.
foo.name; // Resolves to &quot;foo&quot;.
For another example:

const foo = { one: 1, two: 2 };

// bar.prototype = foo
const bar = Object.create(foo);

bar.three = 3;

bar.one; // 1
bar.two; // 2
bar.three; // 3
==Delegation==
In prototype-based languages that use &quot;delegation&quot;, the language runtime is capable of dispatching the correct method or finding the right piece of data simply by following a series of delegation pointers (from object to its prototype) until a match is found. All that is required to establish this behavior-sharing between objects is the delegation pointer. Unlike the relationship between class and instance in class-based object-oriented languages, the relationship between the prototype and its offshoots does not require that the child object have a memory or structural similarity to the prototype beyond this link. As such, the child object can continue to be modified and amended over time without rearranging the structure of its associated prototype as in class-based systems. It is also important to note that not only data, but also methods can be added or changed. For this reason, some prototype-based languages refer to both data and methods as &quot;slots&quot; or &quot;members&quot;.

==Concatenation==
In &quot;concatenative&quot; prototyping - the approach implemented by the Kevo programming language - there are no visible pointers or links to the original prototype from which an object is cloned. The prototype (parent) object is copied rather than linked to and there is no delegation. As a result, changes to the prototype will not be reflected in cloned objects. Incidentally, the Cosmos programming language achieves the same through the use of persistent data structures.

The main conceptual difference under this arrangement is that changes made to a prototype object are not automatically propagated to clones. This may be seen as an advantage or disadvantage. (However, Kevo does provide additional primitives for publishing changes across sets of objects based on their similarity — so-called &quot;family resemblances&quot; or &quot;clone family&quot; mechanism — rather than through taxonomic origin, as is typical in the delegation model.) It is also sometimes claimed that delegation-based prototyping has an additional disadvantage in that changes to a child object may affect the later operation of the parent. However, this problem is not inherent to the delegation-based model and does not exist in delegation-based languages such as JavaScript, which ensure that changes to a child object are always recorded in the child object itself and never in parents (i.e. the child&#x27;s value shadows the parent&#x27;s value rather than changing the parent&#x27;s value).

In simplistic implementations, concatenative prototyping will have faster member lookup than delegation-based prototyping (because there is no need to follow the chain of parent objects), but will conversely use more memory (because all slots are copied, rather than there being a single slot pointing to the parent object). More sophisticated implementations can avoid this problem, however, although trade-offs between speed and memory are required. For example, systems with concatenative prototyping can use a copy-on-write implementation to allow for behind-the-scenes data sharing — and such an approach is indeed followed by Kevo. Conversely, systems with delegation-based prototyping can use caching to speed up data lookup.

==Criticism==
Advocates of class-based object models who criticize prototype-based systems often have concerns similar to the concerns that proponents of static type systems for programming languages have of dynamic type systems (see datatype). Usually, such concerns involve correctness, safety, predictability, efficiency and programmer unfamiliarity.

On the first three points, classes are often seen as analogous to types (in most statically typed object-oriented languages they serve that role) and are proposed to provide contractual guarantees to their instances, and to users of their instances, that they will behave in some given fashion.

Regarding efficiency, declaring classes simplifies many compiler optimizations that allow developing efficient method and instance-variable lookup. For the Self language, much development time was spent on developing, compiling, and interpreting techniques to improve the performance of prototype-based systems versus class-based systems.

A common criticism made against prototype-based languages is that the community of software developers is unfamiliar with them, despite the popularity and market permeation of JavaScript. However, knowledge about prototype-based systems is increasing with the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks and the complex use of JavaScript as the World Wide Web (Web) matures. ECMAScript 6 introduced classes as syntactic sugar over JavaScript&#x27;s existing prototype-based inheritance, providing an alternative way to create objects and manage inheritance.

<text>Robert Edwin Peary Sr. (; May 6, 1856 – February 20, 1920) was an American explorer and officer in the United States Navy who made several expeditions to the Arctic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was long credited as being the discoverer of the geographic North Pole in April 1909, having led the first expedition to have claimed this achievement, although it is now considered unlikely that he actually reached the Pole.

Peary was born in Cresson, Pennsylvania, but, following his father&#x27;s death at a young age, was raised in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. He attended Bowdoin College, then joined the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey as a draftsman. He enlisted in the navy in 1881 as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the Nicaragua Canal, which was never built. He visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross Greenland by dogsled. In the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–1892, he was much better prepared, and by reaching Independence Fjord in what is now known as Peary Land, he proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques. During an expedition in 1894, he was the first Western explorer to reach the Cape York meteorite and its fragments, which were then taken from the native Inuit population who had relied on it for creating tools. During that expedition, Peary deceived six indigenous individuals, including Minik Wallace, into traveling to America with him by promising they would be able to return with tools, weapons and gifts within the year. This promise was unfulfilled and four of the six Inuit died of illnesses within a few months.

On his 1898–1902 expedition, Peary set a new &quot;Farthest North&quot; record by reaching Greenland&#x27;s northernmost point, Cape Morris Jesup. Peary made two more expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905–1906 and in 1908–1909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received several learned society awards during his lifetime, and, in 1911, received the Thanks of Congress and was promoted to rear admiral. He served two terms as president of The Explorers Club before retiring in 1911.

Peary&#x27;s claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated along with a competing claim made by Frederick Cook, but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer Wally Herbert concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have come within .

==Early life, education, and career==

Robert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in Cresson, Pennsylvania, to Charles N. and Mary P. Peary. After his father died in 1859, Peary and his mother moved to Portland, Maine. Peary attended Portland High School (Maine) where he graduated in 1873. Peary made his way to Bowdoin College, some to the north, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. He was also part of the rowing team. He graduated in 1877 with a civil engineering degree.

From 1878 to 1879, Peary lived in Fryeburg, Maine. During that time, he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg&#x27;s Jockey Cap Rock. The 360-degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. After Peary&#x27;s death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. It was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder and erected to his memory by the Peary family in 1938.

After college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings at the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey office in Washington, D.C. He joined the United States Navy and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned in the Civil Engineer Corps, with the relative rank of lieutenant. From 1884 to 1885, he was an assistant engineer on the surveys for the Nicaragua Canal and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the North Pole.

In April 1886, he wrote a paper for the National Academy of Sciences proposing two methods for crossing Greenland&#x27;s ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about to the east coast. The second, more difficult path, was to start from Whale Sound at the top of the known portion of Baffin Bay and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic. Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.

==Initial Arctic expeditions==
Peary made his first expedition to the Arctic in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by dog sled, taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months&#x27; leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a whaler to Greenland, arriving in Godhavn on June 6, 1886. Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but Christian Maigaard, a young Danish official, convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland&#x27;s ice sheet at the time. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.
Back in Washington attending with the US Navy, in November 1887 Peary was ordered to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat. He went to a men&#x27;s clothing store where he met 21-year-old Matthew Henson, a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a cabin boy, Peary immediately hired him as a personal valet.

On assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and &quot;first man&quot;, a critical member of his team.

==Second Greenland expedition==
In the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–1892, Peary took the second, more difficult route that he laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the American Geographic Society, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences (now the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University), and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Members of this expedition included Peary&#x27;s aide Henson, Frederick A. Cook, who served as the group&#x27;s surgeon; the expedition&#x27;s ethnologist, Norwegian skier Eivind Astrup; bird expert and marksman Langdon Gibson, and John M. Verhoeff, who was a weatherman and mineralogist. Peary also took his wife along as dietitian, though she had no formal training. Newspaper reports criticized Peary for bringing his wife.
On June 6, 1891, the party left Brooklyn, New York, in the seal hunting ship SS &quot;Kite&quot;. In July, as &quot;Kite&quot; was ramming through sheets of surface ice, the ship&#x27;s iron tiller suddenly spun around and broke Peary&#x27;s lower leg; both bones snapped between the knee and ankle. Peary was unloaded with the rest of the supplies at a camp they called Red Cliff, at the mouth of MacCormick Fjord at the north west end of Inglefield Gulf. A dwelling was built for his recuperation during the next six months. Josephine Peary stayed with Peary. Gibson, Cook, Verhoeff, and Astrup hunted game by boat and became familiar with the area and the Inuit.
Unlike most previous explorers, Peary had studied Inuit survival techniques; he built igloos during the expedition and dressed in practical furs in the native fashion. By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march. Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel, which he called the &quot;Peary system&quot;. The Inuit were curious about the Americans and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by the Inuit body odor from not bathing, their flea infestations, and their food. She studied the people and kept a journal of her experiences. In September 1891, Peary&#x27;s men and dog sled teams pushed inland onto the ice sheet to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than from Red Cliff.

In 1891, Peary shattered his leg in a shipyard accident but it healed by February 1892. By April 1892, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuit dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook, and Astrup. After , Peary continued on with Astrup. They found the high view from Navy Cliff, saw Independence Fjord, and concluded that Greenland was an island. They trekked back to Red Cliff and arrived on August 6, having traveled a total of .

In 1896, Peary, a Master Mason, received his degrees in Kane Lodge No. 454, New York City.

==1898–1902 expeditions==

As a result of Peary&#x27;s 1898–1902 expedition, he claimed an 1899 visual discovery of &quot;Jesup Land&quot; west of Ellesmere Island. He claimed that this sighting of Axel Heiberg Island was prior to its discovery by Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s expedition around the same time. This contention has been universally rejected by exploration societies and historians. However, the American Geographical Society and the Royal Geographical Society of London honored Peary for tenacity, mapping of previously uncharted areas, and his discovery in 1900 of Cape Morris Jesup at the north tip of Greenland. Peary also achieved a &quot;farthest north&quot; for the western hemisphere in 1902 north of Canada&#x27;s Ellesmere Island. Peary was promoted to lieutenant commander in the Navy in 1901 and to commander in 1902.

==1905–1906 expedition==
Peary&#x27;s next expedition was supported by fundraising through the Peary Arctic Club, with gifts of $50,000 from George Crocker, the youngest son of banker Charles Crocker, and $25,000 from Morris K. Jesup, to buy Peary a new ship. The navigated through the ice between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, establishing an American hemisphere &quot;farthest north by ship&quot;. The 1906 &quot;Peary System&quot; dogsled drive for the pole across the rough sea ice of the Arctic Ocean started from the north tip of Ellesmere at 83° north latitude. The parties made well under a day until they became separated by a storm.
As a result, Peary was without a companion sufficiently trained in navigation to verify his account from that point northward. With insufficient food, and uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86°30&#x27; latitude. This latitude was never published by Peary. It is in a typescript of his April 1906 diary, discovered by Wally Herbert in his assessment commissioned by the National Geographic Society. The typescript suddenly stopped there, one day before Peary&#x27;s April 21 purported &quot;farthest&quot;. The original of the April 1906 record is the only missing diary of Peary&#x27;s exploration career. He claimed the next day to have achieved a Farthest North world record at 87°06&#x27; and returned to 86°30&#x27; without camping. This implied a trip of at least between sleeping, even assuming direct travel with no detours.

After returning to &quot;Roosevelt&quot; in May, Peary began weeks of difficult travel in June heading west along the shore of Ellesmere. He discovered Cape Colgate, from whose summit he claimed in his 1907 book that he had seen a previously undiscovered far-north &quot;Crocker Land&quot; to the northwest on June 24, 1906. A later review of his diary for this time and place found that he had written, &quot;No land visible.&quot; On December 15, 1906, the National Geographic Society of the United States, certified Peary&#x27;s 1905–1906 expedition and &quot;Farthest&quot; with its highest honor, the Hubbard Medal. No major professional geographical society followed suit. In 1914, Donald Baxter MacMillan and Fitzhugh Green&#x27;s expedition found that Crocker Land did not exist.

==Claiming to reach the North Pole==

On July 6, 1908, the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; departed New York City with Peary&#x27;s eighth Arctic expedition of 22 men. Besides Peary as expedition commander, it included master of the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; Robert Bartlett, surgeon Dr. J.W. Goodsell, along with Ross Gilmore Marvin, Donald Baxter MacMillan, George Borup, and Matthew Henson. After recruiting several Inuit and their families at Cape York (Greenland), the expedition wintered near Cape Sheridan on Ellesmere Island. The expedition used the &quot;Peary system&quot; for the sledge journey, with Bartlett and the Inuit, Poodloonah, &quot;Harrigan,&quot; and Ooqueah, composing the pioneer division. Borup, with three Inuit, Keshunghaw, Seegloo, and Karko, composed the advance supporting party. On February 15, Bartlett&#x27;s pioneer division departed the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; for Cape Columbia, followed by 5 advance divisions. Peary, with the two Inuit, Arco and Kudlooktoo, departed on February 22, bringing to the total effort 7 expedition members, 19 Inuit, 140 dogs, and 28 sledges. On February 28, Bartlett, with three Inuit, Ooqueah, Pooadloonah, and Harrigan, accompanied by Borup, with three Inuit, Karko, Seegloo, and Keshungwah, headed North.

On March 14, the first supporting party, composed of Dr. Goodsell and the two Inuit, Arco and Wesharkoupsi, turned back towards the ship. Peary states this was at a latitude of 84°29&#x27;. On March 20, Borup&#x27;s third supporting party, with three Inuit, started back to the ship. Peary states this was at a latitude of 85°23&#x27;. On March 26, Marvin, with Kudlooktoo and Harrigan, headed back to the ship, from a latitude estimated by Marvin as 86°38&#x27;. Marvin died on this return trip south. On 1 April, Bartlett&#x27;s party started their return to the ship, after Bartlett estimated a latitude of 87°46&#x27;49&quot;. Peary, with two Inuit, Egingwah and Seeglo, and Henson, with two Inuit, Ootah and Ooqueah, using 5 sledges and 40 dogs, planned 5 marches over the estimated 130 nautical miles to the pole. On 2 April, Peary led the way north.

On the final stage of the journey toward the North Pole, Peary told Bartlett to stay behind. He continued with five others: Henson, Ootah, Egigingwah, Seegloo, and Ooqueah. No one except Henson, who had served on the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–1892, had experience of naval-type observations. On April 6, 1909, Peary established Camp Jesup within of the pole, according to his own readings. Peary estimated the latitude as 89°57&#x27;, after making an observation at approximate local noon using the Columbia meridian. Peary used a sextant, with a mercury trough and glass roof for an artificial horizon, to make measurements of the Sun. Peary claims, &quot;I had now taken in all thirteen single, or six and one-half double, altitudes of the sun, at two different stations, in three different directions, at four different times.&quot; Peary states some of these observations were &quot;beyond the Pole,&quot; and &quot;...at some moment during these marches and counter-marches, I had passed over or very near the point where north and south and east and west blend into one.&quot; Henson scouted ahead to what was thought to be the North Pole site; he returned with the greeting, &quot;I think I&#x27;m the first man to sit on top of the world,&quot; much to Peary&#x27;s chagrin.

On April 7, 1909, Peary&#x27;s group started their return journey, reaching Cape Columbia on April 23, and the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; on April 26. MacMillan and the doctor&#x27;s party had reached the ship earlier, on March 21, Borup&#x27;s party on April 11, Marvin&#x27;s Inuit on April 17, and Bartlett&#x27;s party on April 24. On July 18, the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; departed for home.

Upon returning, Peary learned that Dr. Frederick A. Cook, a surgeon and ethnographer on the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891–1892, claimed to have reached the North pole in 1908. Despite remaining doubts, a committee of the National Geographic Society, as well as the Naval Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, credited Peary with reaching the North Pole.

A reassessment of Peary&#x27;s notebook in 1988 by polar explorer Wally Herbert found it &quot;lacking in essential data&quot;, thus renewing doubts about Peary&#x27;s discovery.

==Later life and death==
Peary was promoted to the rank of captain in the Navy in October 1910. By his lobbying, Peary headed off a move among some U.S. Congressmen to have his claim to the pole evaluated by other explorers. Eventually recognized by Congress for &quot;reaching&quot; the pole, Peary was given the Thanks of Congress by a special act in March 1911. By the same Act of Congress, Peary was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps, retroactive to April 6, 1909. He retired from the Navy the same day, to Eagle Island on the coast of Maine, in the town of Harpswell. His home there has been designated a Maine State Historic Site.

After retiring, Peary received many honors from scientific societies for his Arctic explorations and discoveries. He served twice as president of The Explorers Club, from 1909 to 1911, and from 1913 to 1916.

In early 1916, Peary became chairman of the National Aerial Coast Patrol Commission, a private organization created by the Aero Club of America. It advocated the use of aircraft to detect warships and submarines off the U.S. coast. Peary used his celebrity to promote the use of military and naval aviation, which led directly to the formation of United States Navy Reserve aerial coastal patrol units during World War I. After the war, Peary proposed a system of eight airmail routes, which became the genesis of the U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s airmail system.

In 1914, Peary bought the house at 1831 Wyoming Avenue NW in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where he lived until his death on February 20, 1920. He began renovating the house in 1920, shortly before his death, after which the renovation was taken over by Josephine. She sold the house in 1927, receiving a $12,000 promissory note.

He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Matthew Henson was honored by being re-interred nearby on April 6, 1988.

==Marriage and family==

On August 11, 1888, Peary married Josephine Diebitsch, a business school valedictorian who thought that women should be more than just mothers. Diebitsch had started working at the Smithsonian Institution when she was 19 or 20 years old, replacing her father after he became ill and filling his position as a linguist. In 1886, she resigned from the Smithsonian upon becoming engaged to Peary.

The newlyweds honeymooned in Atlantic City, New Jersey, then moved to Philadelphia, where Peary was assigned. Peary&#x27;s mother accompanied them on their honeymoon, and she moved into their Philadelphia apartment, which caused friction between the two women. Josephine told Peary that his mother should return to live in Maine.
They had two children together, Marie Ahnighito (born 1893) and Robert Peary, Jr. His daughter wrote several books, including &quot;The Red Caboose&quot; (1932) a children&#x27;s book about the Arctic adventures published by William Morrow and Company. As an explorer, Peary was frequently gone for years at a time. In their first 23 years of marriage, he spent only three with his wife and family.

Peary and his aide, Henson, both had relationships with Inuit women outside of marriage and fathered children with them. Peary appears to have started a relationship with Aleqasina (&quot;Alakahsingwah&quot;) when she was about 14 years old. They had at least two children, including a son called Kaala, Karree, or Kali. French explorer and ethnologist Jean Malaurie was the first to report on Peary&#x27;s descendants after spending a year in Greenland in 1951–52.

S. Allen Counter, a Harvard neuroscience professor interested in Henson&#x27;s role in the Arctic expeditions, went to Greenland in 1986. He found Peary&#x27;s son Kali and Henson&#x27;s son Anaukaq, then octogenarians, and some of their descendants. Counter arranged to bring the men and their families to the United States to meet their American relatives and see their fathers&#x27; gravesites. In 1991, Counter wrote about the episode in his book, &quot;North Pole Legacy: Black, White, and Eskimo&quot; (1991). He also gained national recognition of Henson&#x27;s role in the expeditions. A documentary by the same name was also released. Wally Herbert also noted the relationship and children in his book &quot;The Noose of Laurels&quot;, published in 1989.

==Treatment of the Inuit==

Peary has received criticism for his treatment of the Inuit, including fathering children with Aleqasina. Renée Hulan and Lyle Dick have both reported that Peary and his crew sexually exploited Inuit women on his 1908–1909 expedition. Peary has also been harshly criticized for bringing back a group of Inughuit Greenlandic Inuit to the United States along with the Cape York meteorite. The meteorite was of significant local economic importance: Although the Greenlanders had been obtaining the iron they needed from whalers, the Cape York meteorite was the only source of iron for tools. Peary sold it for $40,000 in 1897.

Working at the American Museum of Natural History, anthropologist Franz Boas had requested that Peary bring back an Inuit for study. During his expedition to retrieve the meteorite, Peary convinced six people, including a man named Qisuk and his child Minik, to travel to America with him by promising they would be able to return with tools, weapons and gifts within the year. Peary left the people at the museum when he returned with the meteorite in 1897, where they were kept in damp, humid conditions unlike their homeland. Within a few months, four died of tuberculosis; their remains were dissected and the bones of Qisuk were put on display after Minik was shown a fake burial.

Speaking as a teenager to the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; about Peary, Minik said:

Peary eventually helped Minik travel home in 1909, though it is speculated that this was to avoid any bad press surrounding his anticipated celebratory return after reaching the North Pole. In 1986, Kenn Harper wrote a book about Minik, entitled &quot;Give Me My Father&#x27;s Body&quot;. Convinced that the remains of Qisuk and the three adult Inuit should be returned to Greenland, he tried to persuade the Museum of Natural History to do this, as well as working through the &quot;red tape&quot; of the US and Canadian governments. In 1993, Harper succeeded in having the Inuit remains returned. In Qaanaaq, he witnessed the Inuit funeral ceremony for the remains of Qisuk and the three tribesmen [Shaman Atangana (ca. 1840–1898) with her husband, renowned hunter Nuktaq (ca. 1848–1898), their adoptive daughter Aviaq (ca. 1885–1898)] that had been taken to New York.

Peary had employed the Inughuit in his expeditions for more than a decade, paying them in firearms, ammunition and other Western goods on which they had come to rely, and leaving them in a dire situation in 1909. The demands of the American expeditions had also resulted in the caribou of North Greenland being hunted to near extinction.

==Controversy surrounding North Pole claim==

Peary&#x27;s claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt. Some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole. Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary&#x27;s account has been newly criticized by Pierre Berton (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).

===Lack of independent validation===
Peary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers. Peary&#x27;s claim was certified by the National Geographic Society (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary&#x27;s records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition. This was a few weeks before Cook&#x27;s Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.

The National Geographic Society limited access to Peary&#x27;s records. At the time, his proofs were not made available for scrutiny by other professionals, as had been done by the Danish panel. Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor persuaded the United States National Academy of Sciences not to get involved. The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London gave Peary a one-off medal (created by sculptor Kathleen Scott, later widow of Robert Falcon Scott), in 1910, despite internal council splits which only became known in the 1970s. The RGS based their decision on the belief that the NGS had performed a serious scrutiny of the &quot;proofs&quot;, which was not the case. Neither the American Geographical Society nor any of the geographical societies of semi-Arctic Scandinavia has recognized Peary&#x27;s North Pole claim.

===Criticisms===

====Omissions in navigational documentation====
The party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey did not include anyone trained in navigation who could either confirm or contradict Peary&#x27;s own navigational work. This was further exacerbated by Peary&#x27;s failure to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (&quot;variation&quot;) of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.

====Inconsistent speeds====

The last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than marching north. But once the last support party turned back at &quot;Camp Bartlett&quot;, where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least from the pole, Peary&#x27;s claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup. The recorded speeds quadrupled during the two and a half-day return to Camp Bartlett – at which point his speed slowed drastically. Peary&#x27;s account of a beeline journey to the pole and back—which would have assisted his claim of such speed—is contradicted by his companion Henson&#x27;s account of tortured detours to avoid &quot;pressure ridges&quot; (ice floes&#x27; rough edges, often a few meters high) and &quot;leads&quot; (open water between those floes).

In his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of 304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett&#x27;s last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), to the pole, the same distance back, and in the vicinity of the pole. These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed. Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).

The conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which—like Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s a month later in 1912—was supported by the sextant, theodolite, and compass observations of several other navigators.

====Review of Peary&#x27;s diary====

The diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian Larry Schweikart examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), there were consistent pemmican and other stains on all pages, and all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary&#x27;s observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer Naomi Uemura, who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent. However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words &quot;The Pole at Last!&quot;, allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.

====1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies====
In 1984, the National Geographic Society (NGS), a major sponsor of Peary&#x27;s expeditions, commissioned Wally Herbert, an Arctic explorer himself, to write an assessment of Peary&#x27;s original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the North Pole. His book, &quot;The Noose of Laurels&quot;, caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.

In 1989, the NGS also conducted a two-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of the shadows in photographs and a review of ocean depth measures taken by Peary; its staff concluded that he was no more than away from the pole. Peary&#x27;s original camera, a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak, did not survive. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens, and hence the shadow analysis based on it, must be considered uncertain at best. The NGS has never released Peary&#x27;s photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the conclusions of the NGS. The NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue, which concluded that Peary had indeed reached the North Pole.

====Review of depth soundings====
Supporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed. Since only the first few of the Peary party&#x27;s soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water. Peary&#x27;s expedition possessed 4,000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2,000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions. Peary stated in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the &quot;Columbia meridian&quot; all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian. The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.

===Re-creation of expedition in 2005===
In 2005, British explorer Tom Avery and four companions re-created the outward portion of Peary&#x27;s journey using replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary&#x27;s sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours—nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery&#x27;s fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles (170 km), significantly short of the 135 nautical miles (250 km) claimed by Peary. 

After reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.

==Legacy==

Several United States Navy ships have been named . The Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum at Bowdoin College is named for Peary and fellow Arctic explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan. Robert E. Peary Middle School, Gardena,CA. In 1986, the United States Postal Service issued a 22-cent postage stamp in honor of Peary and Henson;

Peary Land, Peary Glacier, Peary Nunatak and Cape Peary in Greenland, Peary Bay and Peary Channel in Canada, as well as Mount Peary in Antarctica, are named in his honor. The lunar crater Peary, located at the Moon&#x27;s north pole, is also named after him.

Camp Peary in York County, Virginia is named for Admiral Peary. Originally established as a Navy Seabee training center during World War II, it was repurposed in the 1950s as a Central Intelligence Agency training facility. It is commonly called &quot;The Farm&quot;.

Admiral Peary Vocational Technical School, located in a neighboring community very close to his birthplace of Cresson, PA, was named for him and was opened in 1972. Today the school educates over 600 students each year in numerous technical education disciplines.

A section of U.S. Route 22 in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, is named the Admiral Peary Highway

Major General Adolphus Greely, leader of the ill-fated Lady Franklin Bay Expedition from 1881 to 1884, noted that no Arctic expert questioned that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. After initial acceptance of Peary&#x27;s claim, he later came to doubt Peary&#x27;s having reached 90°.

In his book &quot;Ninety Degrees North&quot;, polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as &quot;undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration&quot;.

In 1932, an expedition was made by Robert Bartlett and Marie Ahnighito Peary Stafford, Peary&#x27;s daughter, on the &quot;Effie M. Morrissey&quot; to erect a monument to Peary at Cape York, Greenland.

<text>A bend is a type of knot used to join two lengths of rope. Bends are used in a variety of situations, including climbing, sailing, and securing loads. They are classified based on their ability to be tightened or released, their resistance to slipping, and their strength. Some common types include the sheet bend, the double fisherman&#x27;s knot, and the double figure-eight bend. Bends allow two ropes to be securely joined together, enabling the combined ropes to support weight or transmit force. It is important to choose the appropriate bend for the specific task at hand, as some may be stronger or more secure than others.

== Misuse of reef knot as a bend ==
The common reef knot (square knot) is sometimes mistakenly tied as a bend. When used as a bend rather than a binding knot, the reef knot will capsize under sufficient tension. For this reason, the reef knot is insecure as a bend and as such is not listed as one.
