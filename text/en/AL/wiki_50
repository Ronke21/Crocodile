<text>The Gay Divorcee is a 1934 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Mark Sandrich and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. It also features Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes, and Eric Blore. The screenplay was written by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost, and Edward Kaufman. It is based on the Broadway musical &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;, written by Dwight Taylor, with Kenneth Webb and Samuel Hoffenstein adapting an unproduced play by J. Hartley Manners.

The stage version included many songs by Cole Porter that were left out of the film, except for &quot;Night and Day&quot;. Although most of the songs were replaced, the screenplay kept the original plot of the stage version. Three members of the play&#x27;s original cast repeated their stage roles: Astaire, Rhodes and Blore.

&quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; was the second (after &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;) of ten pairings of Astaire and Rogers on film and their first one as a duo in leading roles.

==Plot==

Guy Holden, a famous American dancer, is at a Paris nightclub with his friend, scatterbrained English lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, when they both realize that they have forgotten their wallets. After Guy dances for the audience to avoid washing dishes to work off the bill, Egbert discovers his wallet in a different pocket.

Traveling to England by ship, Guy encounters Mimi Glossop, whose dress has been caught when closing a trunk, asking Guy to call a porter to open the trunk to free her. Taking advantage of the situation, Guy teases her and attempts to free her dress, but ends up tearing the skirt at thigh level, angering Mimi. Chastised, Guy apologizes and gives Mimi his coat to cover up, and asks for her address to retrieve his coat, but Mimi insists that she will mail it back at the address he provides.

Mimi returns the coat, paying the courier not to disclose her contact information. After searching for Mimi in London for two weeks, Guy ends up serendipitously rear-ending her car in traffic. As Mimi drives away and races to evade him, he chases her into the country. Taking a shortcut, Guy sets up a fake roadblock, trapping her, offering her an impromptu picnic and casually proposing marriage. Convinced that he is insane, she rebuffs his attempts to charm her and attempts to tear up notes with his phone number (but keeps one), but he learns that her name is Mimi.

Coincidentally, Mimi seeks a divorce from her geologist husband, Cyril Glossop, who she has not seen for some time. Under the guidance of her domineering and much-married Aunt Hortense, she consults bumbling lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, once a fiancé of her aunt. He arranges for Mimi to spend a night at a seaside hotel in Brightbourne and to be caught &quot;flagrante delicto&quot; in a staged &quot;adulterous relationship&quot;, a purpose for which he hires a professional co-respondent, Rodolfo Tonetti. In an unrelated previous conversation with Guy, Egbert had been impressed when Guy philosophically used the phrase, &quot;Chance is the fool&#x27;s name for fate&quot;. Without Guy&#x27;s knowledge and without intending any connection, Egbert gives Mimi the expression as a code phrase to identify her co-respondent.

Accompanying his friend Egbert to the hotel, the besotted and unaware Guy encounters Mimi, who has warmed up to him, and admits that she attempted to contact the phone number that he gave her. He sings Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; to her, and they fall under a spell while dancing together. Wanting to impress Mimi, Guy waxes philosophical, inadvertently using the code phrase that Egbert has given Mimi to identify the co-respondent. Appalled, Mimi mistakes him for the co-respondent who she has been expecting, considering him not much more than a gigolo.

When Mimi gives Guy her room number and makes it clear that she expects him &quot;at midnight&quot;, Guy is astonished by her seemingly brazen attitude. Guy keeps the &quot;appointment&quot; in Mimi&#x27;s bedroom, and Tonetti arrives, revealing the truth and clearing up the misunderstandings. Not trusting Tonetti alone with Mimi, Guy insists on staying, potentially thwarting the point of a co-respondent for Mimi&#x27;s divorce case. Tonetti insists that Mimi and Guy not foil the plan by being seen together outside of the bedroom. While Tonetti is busy playing solitaire in another room, Guy and Mimi contrive to escape and dance the night away. An elaborate 16-minute dance sequence, &quot;The Continental&quot;, follows, with Mimi singing the introduction, another singer and ensembles of dancers doing routines, and Guy and Mimi joining in.

In the morning, after several mistakes with the waiter, Guy hides in the next room when Cyril arrives at the door, while Mimi and Tonetti pretend that they are lovers. When Cyril does not believe that Mimi would fall for Tonetti, Guy comes out and embraces Mimi in an attempt to convince Cyril that he is her lover, but to no avail. Cyril does not want a divorce from a wealthy wife. The unwitting waiter ultimately reveals that Cyril is an adulterer, having come to another hotel on previous occasions with another woman, thus clearing the way for Mimi to obtain a divorce and marry Guy.

==Songs and dance numbers==
New songs introduced in the film
* &quot;The Continental&quot; (lyrics: Herb Magidson; music: Con Conrad) won the first Academy Award for Best Original Song for its elaboration in the more-than-16-minute song-and-dance sequence toward the end of the film, as sung by Rogers, Erik Rhodes and Lillian Miles, and danced by Rogers, Astaire and ensemble performers. Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the music in their first RCA Victor recording session, in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall, July 1, 1935.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bother You&quot; (lyrics: Mack Gordon; music: Harry Revel), the film&#x27;s opening number, sung by chorus, danced by Astaire.
* &quot;Let&#x27;s K-nock K-nees&quot; (lyrics: Mack Gordon; music: Harry Revel) at the beach resort, sung by Betty Grable, with talking verses vocalized by Edward Everett Horton, danced by Grable, Horton and chorus.
* &quot;A Needle in a Haystack&quot; (lyrics: Herb Magidson; music: Con Conrad), sung and danced by Astaire.

Other songs
* &quot;Night and Day&quot; (Cole Porter), sung by Astaire, danced by Rogers and Astaire in a hotel suite overlooking an English Channel beach at night. It was their first romantic dance duet in film. Dance critic Alastair Macaulay wrote that this movie, and this dance number in particular, created one of the archetypes of romance, and that cinema &quot;has never had another couple who enshrined romantic love so definitively in terms of dance.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
After the success of Astaire and Rogers&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933), RKO&#x27;s head of production, Pandro S. Berman, purchased the screen rights to Dwight Taylor&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;, with another Astaire and Rogers matchup in mind. According to Astaire&#x27;s autobiography, director Mark Sandrich claimed that RKO altered the title to insinuate that the film concerned the amorous adventures of a recently divorced woman (divorcée). In addition to the credited screenwriters, Robert Benchley, H. W. Hanemann, and Stanley Rauh made uncredited contributions to the dialogue.

Dance routines from the film, specifically &quot;Night and Day&quot; and the scene in which Astaire dances on the table, were taken from Astaire&#x27;s performances in the original play, &quot;Gay Divorce&quot;. The choreography to &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bother You&quot; came from foolhardy antics during rehearsals, and became an in-joke in future Astaire–Rogers films.

===Filming===
Exteriors set in what was supposed to be the English countryside were shot in Clear Lake, California. Additional exteriors were filmed in Santa Monica and Santa Barbara, California.

The car driven by Rogers was her own, a 1929 Duesenberg Model J. It still exists, and has been displayed at least once at the Amelia Island Car Show, Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

===Censorship concerns===
James Wingate, Director of Studio Relations for RKO, warned: &quot;Considering the delicate nature of the subject upon which this script is based... great care should be taken in the scenes dealing with Mimi&#x27;s lingerie, and... no intimate article should be used.&quot; Wingate also insisted that no actor or actress appear in only pajamas.

There are differing accounts of why the film&#x27;s name was changed from the play&#x27;s &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; to &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot;. In one, the Hays Office insisted that RKO change the name, finding it &quot;too frivolous toward marriage&quot;: while a divorcée could be gay or lighthearted, it would be unseemly to allow a divorce to appear so. According to Astaire, however, the change was made proactively by RKO. Sandrich told him that &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; was selected as the new name because the studio &quot;thought it was a more attractive-sounding title, centered around a girl&quot;. RKO even offered $50 to any employee who could come up with a better title. In the United Kingdom, the film was released under the title &quot;The Gay Divorce&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to RKO records, the film earned $1,077,000 in the United States and Canada, and $697,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $584,000.

===Critical response===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Andre Sennwald said of the film on November 16, 1934: &quot;Like the carefree team of Rogers and Astaire, &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; is gay in its mood and smart in its approach. For subsidiary humor, there are Alice Brady as the talkative aunt; Edward Everett Horton as the confused lawyer ... and Erik Rhodes ... as the excitable co-respondent, who takes the correct pride in his craftsmanship and objects to outside interference. All of them plus the Continental, help to make the new Music Hall show the source of a good deal of innocent merriment.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for the following Academy Awards, winning in the category Music (Song):

* Best Picture (Nominated)
* Art Direction (Van Nest Polglase, Carroll Clark) (Nominated)
* Music (Scoring) (Max Steiner) (Nominated)
* Music (Song) – &quot;The Continental&quot; (Won) – the first winner of this award; it won against &quot;Carioca&quot;, from the previous Astaire–Rogers film, &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;
* Sound Recording (Carl Dreher) (Nominated)

<text>Here Comes the Navy (also known as Hey, Sailor) is a 1934 American romantic comedy film written by Earl Baldwin and Ben Markson and directed by Lloyd Bacon. The film stars James Cagney, Pat O&#x27;Brien, Gloria Stuart and Frank McHugh.
==Plot==
Riveter &quot;Chesty&quot; O&#x27;Connor and his best friend &quot;Droopy&quot; join the US Navy to annoy O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s nemesis, Chief Petty Officer &quot;Biff&quot; Martin. O&#x27;Connor gets himself court-martialed for being AWOL while visiting Martin&#x27;s sister Dorothy. Disgruntled at his treatment, O&#x27;Connor angrily derides the Navy and finds himself ostracized by his fellow sailors in the USS &quot;Arizona&quot;.

During gunnery practice, O&#x27;Connor puts out a fire in a 14 inch gun turret and receives the Navy Cross medal, but is still determined to get out of the Navy. Later, O&#x27;Connor transfers to the US Naval Air Service and is assigned to the rigid airship . When the &quot;Macon&quot; tries to dock, Chief Martin is accidentally caught on a guide rope and is hoisted into the air. Despite orders, O&#x27;Connor climbs down the rope and saves Martin&#x27;s life by parachuting both of them to the ground.

Later, at the wedding of O&#x27;Connor to Dorothy, Martin finds out that O&#x27;Connor has been promoted to warrant boatswain and now outranks him.

==Cast==
==Production==

With the full cooperation of the US Navy, principal photography, which ended early May 1934, took place at a number of naval facilities, including the Bremerton Navy yard, Washington, Naval Training Station, San Diego, California, as well as other locations in San Pedro and Sunnyvale, California. Naval personnel made up many of the extras on the film. Of historical interest is that a portion of the filming of &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; took place aboard the battleship , which was sunk by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor. Further, portions of the film also include shots of the dirigible , a year before the accident that destroyed the airship with the loss of two crew.

==Reception==
In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Frank Nugent described &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; as another of the films in &quot;traditional Cagneyesque manner.&quot; &quot;Some of the heartiest laughs of the current cinema season were recorded last night in the Strand Theatre, where &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; had its metropolitan première. A fast-moving comedy enriched by an authentic naval setting, this Warner production has the added advantage, in these parlous times, of being beyond censorial reproach.&quot;

&quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

===Box office===
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,183,000 domestically and $575,000 internationally.

<text>The House of Rothschild is a 1934 American pre-Code historical drama film directed by Alfred L. Werker and starring George Arliss, Loretta Young and Boris Karloff. It was adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the play by George Hembert Westley, and chronicles the rise of the Rothschild family of European bankers.

==Plot==
In 1780 in Frankfurt youngster Nathan Rothschild warns his parents Mayer and Guttle that the taxman is coming. They hurriedly hide their wealth. The taxman demands 20,000 gulden, an exorbitant sum, but accepts a bribe of 5,000 in exchange for assessing them 2,000 in taxes. Mayer&#x27;s satisfaction is short-lived, however; a courier bringing him 10,000 guldens is intercepted and the money confiscated by the taxmen. Mayer tells his sons that he tries to be as honest as possible, but the authorities will not let him; he admonishes his children to acquire money, for &quot;money is power&quot; and can protect their people.

Later, as Mayer is lying on his deathbed, he instructs his five sons to start banks in different countries across Europe: Amschel in Frankfurt am Main, Salomon in Vienna, Nathan in London, Carl in Naples, and James in Paris. That way, they can avoid having to send gold back and forth when the need arises, for in war they are in danger of being robbed by the enemy and in peace by their own countrymen. Instead, they can draw on each other&#x27;s banks.

Thirty-two years later, the sons have established banking houses. Then France overruns Europe in the Napoleonic Wars. Austrian Prince Metternich asks Salomon to raise 15 million florins to help defeat Napoleon. The other brothers are approached with similar requests. Even in France itself, Talleyrand asks for 50 million francs. Nathan refuses to loan the British Government five million pounds (on top of previous loans) to hold off the enemy, but offers the Duke of Wellington twice that amount to smash him.

After the war is won, Wellington is disappointed to find that Nathan Rothschild has not even been invited to a party in the duke&#x27;s honour. He insists on going to see Nathan. His aide, Captain Fitzroy, knows the address, as he and Nathan&#x27;s daughter Julie are in love. While there, Wellington tells Nathan that the victorious powers are going to make a very large loan to France to help it recover from the war. The winning underwriter will become the most powerful and prestigious bank in Europe.

Nathan&#x27;s bid is the best, but is rejected primarily in favor of Barings Bank. When Nathan demands to know the reason, Prussian Count Ledrantz (despite having himself sought a war loan from the Rothschilds) explains it was discarded on a &quot;technicality&quot;, because Nathan is a Jew. Nathan learns that the quarter of the loan not awarded to Barings will fall to Ledrantz, Metternich and Talleyrand, who stand to make enormous profits. Nathan outmanoeuvres them financially, bringing them to the brink of ruin and dishonour; they capitulate and surrender to him the entire loan. However, this has somewhat embittered him. Where once he accepted Julie&#x27;s choice, he now tells the non-Jewish Fitzroy to stay away from her.

Anti-Jewish riots break out all over Germany, instigated by Ledrantz. Nathan returns to Frankfurt and, under pressure from his own people, agrees to submit to Ledrantz. However, before he can, he receives word that Napoleon has escaped from exile. Nathan&#x27;s brothers, fearful of their positions, want to support the restored French Emperor. However, Nathan refuses to do so. With Ledrantz and others once again desperately in need of financial support, he extracts a treaty from them granting Jews rights, freedoms and dignity long denied them. He also tells Fitzroy that he can once again see Julie. With Napoleon seemingly invincible, Nathan determines to risk all in support of the allies. Just before he is bankrupted, he receives word that Wellington has won the Battle of Waterloo, and he is not only saved, he becomes the richest man in the world and a baron.

==Background==
The movie was produced by Zanuck (who was not Jewish), as an attack on Nazism and anti-semitism following Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany in 1933. The story was suggested to him by George Arliss (also non-Jewish) who had made successful film appearances as Jewish characters like Shylock and Benjamin Disraeli. Arliss was given the dual role of Amschel Rothschild and one of Rothschild&#x27;s sons, Nathan Mayer, the one who settled in England. Zanuck faced behind-the-scenes opposition from Jewish concerns such as the Anti-Defamation League but the screenplay passed the muster of the Hays Office, one of whose officials, James Wingate, found no cause for objection and even suggested it be shown to a representative of the German government, a step Zanuck refused to take. In December 1933 the project was endorsed in one major Jewish journal, &quot;The B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Messenger&quot;.

==Cinematography==
While nearly all of the film is in black and white, its final sequence was one of the first shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, along with the MGM musical &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot;, released in February 1934.

==Reception==
The movie had positive reviews from various American journals; although the film made no reference to then-current events in Germany, some critics noticed similarities to the Nazi regime&#x27;s treatment of German Jews—such as the columnist of &quot;Time&quot;, who considered it &quot;shrewdly timed to touch obliquely on current Jew-baiting in Germany&quot;. It was also publicly endorsed by the National Council of Jewish Women, which helped make it acceptable.

The film was the biggest hit of the year for Twentieth Century Pictures, which had only been formed in June 1933. It was one of United Artists&#x27; most popular films of the year. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In a close contest &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; was voted the second best picture of 1934 in &quot;Film Daily&quot;″s annual poll of critics, narrowly edged out by &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;.

Two scenes from &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; were used in the German antisemitic propaganda film &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot; (1940) without the permission of the copyright holders.

==Historical accuracy==
The film takes several creative liberties with Rothschild family history. Amschel Rothschild did not die until 1812, during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars he is portrayed as not having lived to see. Only two of his five sons were actually present at his death bed; the rest were already established in other European countries.

Nathan Rothschild (born 1777) would have been only three years old in 1780, when the film begins. The relationship between Captain Fitzroy and Julie Rothschild is fictional; Nathan Rothschild had no daughter named Julie. The Captain Fitzroy who did become his son-in-law (albeit after Nathan died in 1836) was born in 1807, therefore a child at the time of Waterloo, and married in 1839 Hannah Rothschild, Nathan&#x27;s second daughter (born 1815).

Also, in the 18th century Frankfurt was a Free City in the Holy Roman Empire. It did not belong to Prussia until 1866.

The Prussian Count Ledrantz, Nathan Mayer&#x27;s antagonist, was a purely fictional character written into the story by Nunally Johnson.

<text>Imitation of Life is a popular 1933 novel by Fannie Hurst that was adapted into two successful films for Universal Pictures: a 1934 film, and a 1959 remake. The novel, which deals with issues of race, class and gender, was originally serialized in 1932 in the magazine &quot;Pictorial Review&quot; under the title &quot;Sugar House&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Set in the 1910s at &quot;the Shore&quot; of New Jersey, the novel explores issues of race and class in early 20th-century United States. Bea Chipley is a quiet, mousy Atlantic City teenage girl whose mother dies, leaving her to keep house for her father (Mr. Chipley) and Benjamin Pullman, a boarder who peddles ketchup and relish on the boardwalk and sells maple syrup door-to-door. Within a year, her father and Pullman decide that she should marry Pullman; she soon becomes pregnant and has a daughter named Jessie. Her father suffers an incapacitating stroke, confining him to a wheelchair, and Pullman is killed in a train accident. Bea is left to fend for her father and Jessie by herself.

She takes in boarders to defray expenses as well as peddles Pullman&#x27;s maple syrup door-to-door, using his &quot;B. Pullman&quot; business cards to avoid the ubiquitous sexism of the 1910s. To care for her infant daughter and disabled father, Bea Pullman hires Delilah, an African-American mammy figure, who has an infant daughter Peola. The girl has &quot;light skin&quot; (as described then).

As Delilah is a master waffle-maker, Bea capitalizes on Delilah&#x27;s skills to open a &quot;B. Pullman&quot; waffle restaurant. It attracts many of the tourists at the Shore. She eventually builds a nationwide and then international chain of highly successful restaurants. Frank Flake, a young man intent on entering medical school, becomes Bea&#x27;s business manager.

Jessie and Peola have grown up side by side. Peola is painfully aware of the tension between her white appearance and black racial identity. She continually attempts to pass as white to gain wider advantages. Disturbed by her daughter&#x27;s unhappiness, Delilah encourages the girl to take pride in her black &quot;race.&quot; Eventually, after living in Seattle for several years as a white woman, Peola severs all ties with her family. She marries a white man and moves to Bolivia to pass permanently. Heartbroken, Delilah dies.

Bea falls in love with Flake, who is eight years her junior. Jessie, by now in her late teens, comes home for a visit just as Bea is planning on selling the &quot;B. Pullman&quot; chain and marrying Flake. The three are mired in a love triangle, resulting in a tragic ending that leaves Bea alone.

==Historical context==
From the turn of the 20th century until the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967), numerous Southern states passed laws enforcing a &quot;one-drop rule&quot;, requiring that persons of any known African ancestry had to be classified in records as black. Only black and white were recognized as racial categories, and blacks were restricted by racial segregation laws. Virginia enacted a law regarding &quot;passing&quot; in 1924.

Hurst stated that her novel was written because of a &quot;consciousness&quot; that came from how African-American soldiers had fought for their country in World War I even though they were discriminated against at home.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Hurst was a Jewish woman and supporter of feminist causes. She also supported African Americans in their struggle for greater equality. She was deeply involved in the Harlem Renaissance, especially with Zora Neale Hurston. Hurst helped sponsor Hurston in her first year at Barnard College and employed Hurston briefly as an executive secretary. The two traveled together on road trips that may have contributed to Hurst&#x27;s understanding of racial discrimination. Both Hurston and Langston Hughes claimed to like &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, though both reversed their opinion after Sterling Allen Brown lambasted both the book and the 1934 film adaptation in a review entitled &quot;Imitation of Life: Once a Pancake&quot;, a reference to a line in the first film.

The novel &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; continues to provoke controversy, as some read it as heavy-handed stereotyping, while others see it as a more subtle and subversive satire of and commentary on race, sex, and class in early 20th-century America. The book was adapted twice as film, in 1934 and 1959. Both the novel and films have remained deeply embedded in the American consciousness. In 1970, Toni Morrison named one of her characters &quot;Pecola&quot; in her novel &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;.

The novel version has Peola leave for good, while in both films, the Peola character (named Sarah Jane in the second film) returns, attends her mother&#x27;s funeral, and shows remorse. Molly Hiro contends the &quot;premature removal of Peola&quot; from the novel version of the story &quot;not only allows her successfully to escape the “blackness” she has resisted, but also keeps the character at a distance from readers, thereby rendering her incapable of representing a legible message about racial authenticity.&quot;

<text>One Night of Love is a 1934 American Columbia Pictures romantic musical film set in the opera world, starring Grace Moore and Tullio Carminati. The film was directed by Victor Schertzinger and adapted from the story &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love&quot;, by Charles Beahan and Dorothy Speare.

In the relatively new use of sound recordings for film, &quot;One Night of Love&quot; was noted at the time for its innovative use of vertical cut recording, for which Columbia Pictures received an Academy Scientific and Technical Award. It also won the Academy&#x27;s first Award for Best Original Score.

==Plot==
Opera singer Mary Barrett (Grace Moore) leaves to study music in Milan, Italy to the disappointment of her family in New York City. Mary gets a job at the Cafe Roma, where Giulio Monteverdi (Tullio Carminati), a famous vocal coach, hears her sing. Giulio promises to make Mary a star if she will allow him to control her life. He also tells her that there cannot be any romance between the two of them, as that would distract from the process of growing her talent. Mary discovers she has stagefright as she prepares for a tour of provincial opera houses, however Giulio helps her overcome it.

Years later, still under Giulio&#x27;s tutelage, Mary begins to tire of his dominance and discipline. The two meet one of Giulio&#x27;s old pupils, Lally (Mona Barrie), while in Vienna. Lally once tried to be romantic with Giulio, but was rejected. This past history renders Mary jealous and she pretends to have laryngitis. Mary thinks Giulio has gone to Lally to rekindle a romance, and so visits Bill Houston (Lyle Talbot), a longtime friend who has proposed marriage. In a jealous huff, Mary decides not to sing that night in order to punish Giulio. Giulio realizes what is going on and tells Mary that Lally will replace her on stage, but then proposes to Mary.

She decides to go on, and Mary&#x27;s performance of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; wins her an invitation to the Metropolitan Opera, her dream venue. Giulio, however, still does not believe that she is ready for such a venue. Later at dinner, Lally lies to Mary by telling her that she is still involved with Giulio. On the night of her debut in &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, Mary is too nervous to go on stage until she sees Giulio in his usual place in the prompter&#x27;s box.

*Luis Alberni – Giovanni

==Production==
The complete proscenium and part of the wings and seating plan of the Metropolitan Opera House were duplicated for this production and occupied the whole of Columbia&#x27;s largest sound stage.

Moore&#x27;s recording and performance of the &quot;Un bel di&quot; aria from &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; did not go smoothly, as she had trouble hitting the high notes. According to a later biography, she flew into a rage and blamed the orchestra. However, when studio boss Harry Cohn asked Columbia music director, Morris Stoloff, what the problem was, Stoloff replied, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the orchestra. These are the original Puccini orchestrations.&quot; Moore was then told that either she went back to the recording stage or she would be responsible for paying the day&#x27;s salary for the entire orchestra, and she returned and recorded the aria.

==Featured music==
Grace Moore&#x27;s title song &quot;One Night of Love&quot; was composed by Victor Schertzinger himself, with lyrics by Gus Kahn. The lyrics began &quot;One Night Of Love, When two hearts are one&quot;. It was later recorded by Anna Moffo as the title track of a 1965 crossover album.

<text>Jeanne Florentine Bourgeois (5 April 1873 – 5 January 1956), known professionally as Mistinguett (), was a French actress and singer. She was at one time the highest-paid female entertainer in the world.

==Early life==

The daughter of Antoine Bourgeois, a 31-year-old day-labourer, and Jeannette Debrée, a 21-year-old seamstress, Jeanne Bourgeois was born at 5 Rue du Chemin-de-Fer (today Rue Gaston-Israël), in Enghien-les-Bains, Val-d&#x27;Oise, Île-de-France, France. The family moved to Soisy-sous-Montmorency where she spent her childhood; her parents later worked as mattress-makers.

At an early age Bourgeois aspired to be an entertainer. She began as a flower seller in a restaurant in her hometown, singing popular ballads as she sold blossoms. 

== Entertainer ==
After taking classes in theatre and singing, she began her career as an entertainer in 1885. One day on the train to Paris for a violin lesson, she met Saint-Marcel, who directed the revue at the Casino de Paris. He engaged her first as a stage-hand, and here she began to pursue her goal to become an entertainer, experimenting with various stage-names, being successively Miss Helyett, Miss Tinguette, Mistinguette and, finally, Mistinguett. In the 1880s Mistinguett visited her neighbour Anna Thibaud to ask for advice. Thibaud told her, &quot;To succeed in the theatre ... you must be pretty. You must excite men.&quot; Mistinguett asked if she meant that she had to excite the crowds. Thibaud repeated, &quot;No, the men!&quot;

Bourgeois made her debut as Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris in 1895 and went on to appear in venues such as the Folies Bergère, Moulin Rouge and Eldorado. Her risqué routines captivated Paris, and she went on to become the most popular French entertainer of her time and the highest-paid female entertainer in the world, known for her flamboyance and a zest for the theatrical. In 1919, her legs were insured for 500,000 Francs.

Though Mistinguett never married, she had a son, Leopoldo João de Lima e Silva, born in 1901, from a liaison she had with a Brazilian diplomat, Leopoldo José de Lima e Silva (1872–1931). She also had a long relationship with Maurice Chevalier, 15 years her junior. It is claimed that she and Chevalier informed the police in 1940 that singer-songwriter Charles Trenet was gay and consorting with youths.

She first recorded her signature song, &quot;Mon Homme&quot;, in 1916. It was popularised under its English title &quot;My Man&quot; by Fanny Brice and has become a standard in the of numerous pop and jazz singers.

During a tour of the United States, Mistinguett was asked by &quot;Time&quot; magazine to explain her popularity. Her answer was, &quot;It is a kind of magnetism. I say &#x27;Come closer&#x27; and draw them to me.&quot;

==Death==

Mistinguett died in Bougival, France, at the age of 82, attended by her son, a doctor. She is buried in the Cimetière Enghien-les-Bains, Île-de-France, France.

Jean Cocteau said in an obituary Her voice, slightly off-key, was that of the Parisian street hawkers—the husky, trailing voice of the Paris people. She was of the animal race that owes nothing to intellectualism. She incarnated herself. She flattered a French patriotism that was not shameful. It is normal now that she should crumble, like the other caryatids of that great and marvelous epoch that was ours.

<doc id="61175" wikidata="Q1198497" url="?curid=61175" title="The Thin Man (film)">
<text>The Thin Man is a 1934 American pre-Code comedy-mystery film directed by W. S. Van Dyke and based on the 1934 novel by Dashiell Hammett. The film stars William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a leisure-class couple who enjoy copious drinking and flirtatious banter. Nick is a retired private detective who left his very successful career when he married Nora, a wealthy heiress accustomed to high society. Their wire-haired fox terrier Asta was played by canine actor Skippy. In 1997, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, a married couple. In 1934, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The eponymous &quot;Thin Man&quot; is not Nick Charles, but the man Charles is initially hired to find – Clyde Wynant (part way through the film, Charles describes Wynant as a &quot;thin man with white hair&quot;). The &quot;Thin Man&quot; moniker was thought by many viewers to refer to Nick Charles and, after a time, it was used in the titles of sequels as if referring to Charles. It was followed by five sequels.

==Plot==

Dorothy Wynant discusses her upcoming wedding with her father Clyde. She is surprised that her fiancé knows all about her family yet still wants to marry her. Later, her father discovers that bonds worth $50,000, intended as a wedding present for his daughter, are missing. The only other person who knows the combination of the safe in which they were kept is his secretary, Julia. When he confronts Julia about the missing bonds, she confesses that she cashed them in and has only $25,000 left. He threatens to call the police unless she comes up with the other $25,000.

Nick Charles is a retired detective and he once did a job for Clyde. Nick and his wealthy wife, Nora, live in San Francisco but are visiting New York City for Christmas, staying in a glamorous apartment-like suite at the Hotel Normandie. While in New York, Nick is pressed back into service by Dorothy, as her father, the &quot;Thin Man&quot; of the movie title, was supposed to have left on a secret business trip with a promise to return home before his daughter&#x27;s wedding, but he has mysteriously disappeared. She convinces Nick to take the case, with the assistance of his socialite wife, who is eager to see him in action. What appears to be a missing person situation rapidly turns into a murder case, when Julia Wolf, Clyde&#x27;s former secretary and girlfriend, is found dead, and evidence points to Clyde as the prime suspect. Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty. Nick and Police Lieutenant Guild visit Nunheim, a petty criminal who regularly provides information to the lieutenant. After being pressed for information, Nunheim excuses himself momentarily, only to slip away down the fire escape. He arranges a meeting with the yet-unidentified murderer (someone whose face is not yet shown) to collect $5,000 from him. When Nunheim arrives, however, he is immediately shot four times and killed.

On a hunch, Nick soon visits Wynant&#x27;s closed shop in the dead of night and unearths a skeletonized, but fully dressed, body, buried under the floor. In the dark shop, Wynant&#x27;s bookkeeper, Tanner, suddenly appears. After that, the police—whom Nick had called once he found the body—arrive and concludes that Wynant committed the murders of Julia and now this newly discovered body. They assume that the remains belong to the &quot;Fat Man&quot;—a long-ago enemy of Wynant&#x27;s—because of its oversized clothing with a belt buckle bearing an &quot;R&quot; (for &quot;Rosebreen&quot;, that notorious figure&#x27;s surname). But Nick has already all but solved the case—and soon invites the full cast of suspects to an elegant dinner party.

There, as planned, the murderer is exposed. Nick—who had accompanied the medical examiner when he X-rayed the buried body—theorizes that the clothes were planted to hide the body&#x27;s true identity, as the X-ray revealed telltale shrapnel, presumably from an old war wound, in one leg, the exact same injury that had plagued the &quot;Thin Man&quot;: the missing Wynant. Nick deduces that the real culprit murdered Clyde once he discovered that the killer had been embezzling from him, and then the culprit murdered his own accomplice, Julia Wolf, because she knew about Clyde&#x27;s murder, and after that, he murdered Nunheim since he had witnessed Julia&#x27;s murder and was blackmailing him.

Nick unfurls more of his theory to the dinner guests. Herbert MacCauley, Clyde&#x27;s attorney, panics and tries to shoot Nick. Nick punches him out and declares MacCauley to be the murderer.

Finally, Nick and Nora, along with Dorothy and her new husband, Tommy, celebrate as they ride a luxury train back to California. Nora, in the lower bunk, wants to sleep with Asta, but Nick tosses Asta to the upper bunk and joins Nora himself. Asta looks down on the couple and covers his eyes with his paw.

==Cast==

Cast notes:
* Nat Pendleton reprised the role of Lt. Guild in 1939&#x27;s &quot;Another Thin Man&quot;.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett, released in January 1934. Hammett&#x27;s novel drew on his experiences as a union-busting Pinkerton detective in Butte, Montana. Hammett based Nick and Nora&#x27;s banter upon his rocky on-again, off-again relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman.

MGM paid Hammett $21,000 for the screen rights to the novel. The screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, who had been married for three years. Director W.S. Van Dyke encouraged them to use Hammett&#x27;s writing as a basis only, and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for Nick and Nora.

===Casting===
Van Dyke convinced MGM executives to let Powell and Loy portray the lead characters despite concerns that Powell was too old and strait-laced to play Nick Charles and that Loy had become typecast in exotic femme fatale roles.

Skippy played Asta, the dog of Nick and Nora. Skippy was subsequently cast in two screwball comedy classics, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937) and &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938).

===Filming===

The film was shot with a budget of $226,408 by cinematographer James Wong Howe. For Powell&#x27;s first scene in the film, Van Dyke told him to take the cocktail shaker, go to the bar and just walk through the scene while the crew checked lights and sound. Powell did it, throwing in some lines and business of his own. Suddenly he heard Van Dyke say, &quot;That&#x27;s it! Print it!&quot; The director had decided to shoot the scene without Powell knowing it so that he would be as relaxed and natural as possible.

Van Dyke often did not bother with cover shots if he felt the scene was right on the first take, reasoning that actors &quot;lose their fire&quot; if they have to do something over and over. It was a lot of pressure on the actors, who often had to learn new lines and business immediately before shooting, without the luxury of retakes, but Loy credited much of the appeal of the film to Van Dyke&#x27;s pacing and spontaneity. He paid the most attention to Powell and Loy&#x27;s easy banter between takes and their obvious enjoyment of each other&#x27;s company and worked it into the movie. The director often encouraged and incorporated improvisation and off-the-cuff details into the picture. In order to keep her entrance fresh and spontaneous, Van Dyke did not tell Loy about it until right before they shot it.

Powell loved working so much with Loy because of her naturalness, her professionalism, and her lack of any kind of &quot;diva&quot; temperament. Of her, Powell said: 
According to Loy, the actors were not allowed to interact between takes with the dog Skippy; trainers felt it would break his concentration. Skippy once bit Loy during filming.

Although she had great compliments for Powell&#x27;s charm and wit, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan (who played the daughter of Wynant) later said she did not enjoy making the picture because her part was so small and the production was so rushed.

The scene of Nick shooting the ornaments off the tree was added after Powell playfully picked up an air gun and started shooting ornaments the art department was putting up.

Loy wrote that the biggest problem during shooting was the climactic dinner party scene in which Nick reveals the killer. Powell complained that he had too many lines to learn and could barely decipher the complicated plot he was unraveling. It was the one scene when several retakes were necessary, which brought up an entirely new problem. The script called for oysters to be served to the dinner guests and, in take after take, the same plate of oysters was brought out under the hot lights. Loy recalled that &quot;they began to putrefy. By the time we finished that scene, nobody ever wanted to see another oyster&quot;.

==Reception==
The film was released on May 25, 1934, to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with special praise for the chemistry between Loy and Powell. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an excellent combination of comedy and excitement&quot;, and the film appeared on the &quot;Times&quot; year-end list of the ten best of the year. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;&quot;The Thin Man&quot; was an entertaining novel, and now it&#x27;s an entertaining picture. For its leads the studio couldn&#x27;t have done better than to pick Powell and Miss Loy, both of whom shade their semi-comic roles beautifully&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; raved: &quot;The screen seldom presents a more thoroughly interesting piece of entertainment than this adaptation of Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s popular novel. The rapid fire dialogue is about the best heard since talkies, and it is delivered by Powell and Miss Loy to perfection&quot;. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Loy and Powell played their parts &quot;beautifully&quot;, adding: &quot;All the people of the book are there, and I think the final scenes of the solution of the mystery are handled on a higher note than they were in print&quot;. Louella Parsons called it &quot;the greatest entertainment, the most fun and the best mystery-drama of the year&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that it was &quot;exciting&quot;, &quot;amusing&quot; and &quot;fat with ultra, ultra-sophisticated situations and dialog&quot;. It also called Powell and Loy &quot;delightful&quot;. Harrison Carroll of &quot;The Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; wrote that it was &quot;one of the cleverest adaptations of a popular novel that Hollywood has ever turned out&quot;.

The film was such a box-office success that it spawned five sequels:
* &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941)
* &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947)

&quot;The Thin Man&quot; was voted one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by &quot;Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s annual poll of critics.

In 2002, critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of Great Movies. Ebert praised William Powell&#x27;s performance in particular, stating that Powell &quot;is to dialogue as Fred Astaire is to dance. His delivery is so droll and insinuating, so knowing and innocent at the same time, that it hardly matters what he&#x27;s saying&quot;.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The Thin Man&quot; as one of his favorite films.

The film is 32nd on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2000 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs and was nominated for the following lists:

* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies

===Accolades===
==Box office==
&quot;The Thin Man&quot; earned total theater rentals of $1,423,000, with $818,000 from the US and Canada and $605,000 in other foreign rentals, resulting in a profit of $729,000.

==Trailer==
The trailer contained specially filmed footage in which Nick Charles (William Powell) is seen on the cover of the Dashiell Hammett novel &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. Nick Charles then steps out of the cover to talk to fellow detective Philo Vance (also played by Powell) about his latest case. Charles mentions he hasn&#x27;t seen Vance since &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot;, a film in which Powell played Vance, released in October 1933, just seven months prior to the release of &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. Charles goes on to explain to Vance that his latest case revolves around a &quot;tall, thin man&quot; (referring to Clyde Wynant&#x27;s character), just before clips of the film are shown.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Thin Man&quot; was dramatized as a radio play on an hour-long broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on June 8, 1936. William Powell, Myrna Loy, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall, William Henry, and Thomas Jackson reprised their film roles, and W. S. Van Dyke was host.

==Home media==
Long available on VHS and DVD, &quot;The Thin Man&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc by the Warner Archive Collection on July 30, 2019. The 1080p high-definition master was made from a 4K restoration based on new transfers of the picture&#x27;s best surviving film elements, with digital correction of a multitude of defects seen in earlier home-media releases. Blu-ray.com reported that the film &quot;looks exceptional and, aside from a true 4K option, will likely never get a better home video release&quot;. Extras include the theatrical trailer, the 1936 &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast, and the 1958 second-season premiere of the NBC television series.

==In popular culture==
* The TV series &quot;The Thin Man&quot; ran from 1957 through 1959, starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk.
* In the 1976 comedy spoof movie &quot;Murder by Death&quot;, the characters of Nick and Nora Charles became Dick and Dora Charleston, played by David Niven and Maggie Smith.
* In the 2005 animated film &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot;, the character Nicky Flippers, a frog detective voiced by David Ogden Stiers, was based on Nick Charles.
* Creators Rachel Cohn and David Levithan named their lead characters in the 2008 film &quot;Nick &amp; Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot; as an homage to the characters in &quot;The Thin Man&quot;.
* The 2022 science fiction novel &quot;The Spare Man&quot; by Mary Robinette Kowal is a sci-fi take on the Nick and Nora characters, but set in space.

<doc id="61176" wikidata="Q1619412" url="?curid=61176" title="Viva Villa!">
<text>Viva Villa! is a 1934 American pre-Code film directed by Jack Conway and starring Wallace Beery as Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. The screenplay was written by Ben Hecht, adapted from the 1933 book &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; by Edgecumb Pinchon and O. B. Stade. The film was shot on location in Mexico and produced by David O. Selznick. There was uncredited assistance with the script by Howard Hawks, James Kevin McGuinness, and Howard Emmett Rogers. Hawks and William A. Wellman were also uncredited directors on the film.

The film is a fictionalized biography of Pancho Villa starring Beery in the title role and featuring Fay Wray, who had played the leading lady in &quot;King Kong&quot; the previous year. The supporting cast includes Leo Carrillo, Donald Cook, Stuart Erwin, Henry B. Walthall, Joseph Schildkraut and Katherine DeMille.

==Plot==
After seeing his poor father lose his land and be whipped to death for protesting, young Pancho Villa stabs one of the killers, then heads off into the hills of Chihuahua, Mexico during the 1880s. As a grown man, Villa and a band of rebel bandits, including his trusted ally Sierra, kill wealthy landowners and become heroes to their fellow &quot;peons&quot;.

A wealthy aristocrat, Don Felipe, arranges an introduction for Villa to the distinguished and eloquent Francisco Madero, who resents what has become of Mexico under the rule of president Porfirio Díaz and persuades Villa to help him fight for liberty, not just for personal gain. The coarse and illiterate Villa is humbled in the presence of Madero and agrees to fight for his cause. He also is attracted to Don Felipe&#x27;s beautiful sister Teresa, although there are many women in Villa&#x27;s life, including one he is married to, Rosita.

Villa&#x27;s exploits are made even more colorful by an American newspaper reporter, Johnny Sykes, to whom Villa has taken a great liking. While drunk, Sykes is misinformed and reports that Villa has already overtaken the village of Santa Rosalia in a great victory for his men. Disobeying the orders of Madero and the arrogant General Pascal, simply to help his newspaper friend, Villa stages a raid on Santa Rosalia, as well as on Juarez.

Madero ultimately assumes office in Mexico City, then commands Villa to disband his personal army. Villa agrees, but when Sierra kills a bank teller just so Villa can withdraw his money, Villa himself ends up sentenced to death. A gloating General Pascal mocks the way Villa pleads for his life, then reads a telegram from Madero, ordering that Villa instead be exiled from the country.

Alone and drunk in El Paso, Texas, feeling forsaken by his homeland, Villa is visited by Sykes, who informs him that Madero has been assassinated by the power-mad Pascal and his men. Villa returns to Mexico and rebuilds his own army, recruiting tens of thousands to ride by his side. Together they storm the capital, where Pascal is subjected to a particularly gruesome death. Villa takes what he wants, but when Teresa resists and he physically assaults her, she draws a gun that her brother Don Felipe has given her for protection. Sierra intervenes and murders her.

Villa appoints himself president but is ineffectual, unable to restore Madero&#x27;s dream of land reform for Mexico&#x27;s poor. He ultimately agrees to step aside and go back to where he belongs, including to his wife. Before he can, with Sykes by his side, Villa is gunned down by Don Felipe out of revenge for his sister. Sykes vows to keep Villa&#x27;s memory alive, telling his dying friend that he is no longer news, but history.

==Production and release==
David O. Selznick began filming &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; in 1932 in Mexico. Between filming and its release in April 1934, the film went through a development hell.

Initially, Lee Tracy was cast to play a role of Jonny Sykes. However, following an incident on a Mexican balcony, from which he urinated on military cadets during a parade, he was fired from the film and eventually was replaced by Stuart Erwin.

On September 29, 1933, Pancho Villa&#x27;s son, Pancho Augustin Villa Jr. was signed to cast in a role of a young Pancho Villa.

The film also experienced script problems requiring a change of as many as three writers and two directors (William Wellman and Howard Hawks, both uncredited).

&quot;Viva Villa!&quot; premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles on May 17, 1934.

When the film premiered in Mexico on September 7, 1934, exploding firecrackers interrupted the showing.

==Reception==
&quot;Viva Villa!&quot; was popular at the box office and was voted one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by &quot;The Film Daily&quot;&#x27;s annual poll of critics.

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;corking western&quot;, while Helen Brown-Norden of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote &quot;There is also no denying the fact that Wallace Beery is not everybody&#x27;s Villa&quot;.

During the film&#x27;s production, the Mexican press called it &quot;derogatory to Mexico&quot;, and urged the film to be boycotted in Mexico.

==Box office==
In its initial release &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; earned total theater rentals of $1,875,000, with $941,000 from the US and Canada and $934,000 elsewhere. A 1949 re-release earned an additional $94,000 in foreign rentals, resulting in an overall profit of $157,000.

==Awards==
The picture was nominated for the following Academy Awards:
*Academy Award for Best Picture
*Assistant Director (John S. Waters) (winner)
*Writing (Adaptation) (Ben Hecht)
*Sound Recording (Douglas Shearer)

==In popular culture==
&quot;Viva Villa!&quot; partially inspired the creation of Elia Kazan&#x27;s 1952 film &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, written by John Steinbeck and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.

<doc id="61180" wikidata="Q233265" url="?curid=61180" title="Robert Browning">
<text>Robert Browning (7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose dramatic monologues put him high among the Victorian poets. He was noted for irony, characterization, dark humour, social commentary, historical settings and challenging vocabulary and syntax.

His early long poems (1833) and &quot;Paracelsus&quot; (1835) were acclaimed, but his reputation dwindled for a time – his 1840 poem &quot;Sordello&quot; was seen as wilfully obscure – and took over a decade to recover, by which time he had moved from Shelleyan forms to a more personal style. In 1846, he married fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett and moved to Italy. By her death in 1861, he had published the collection &quot;Men and Women&quot; (1855). His &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; (1864) and book-length epic poem &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; (1868–1869) made him a leading poet. By his death in 1889, he was seen as a sage and philosopher-poet who had fed into Victorian social and political discourse. Societies for studying his work survived in Britain and the US into the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Browning was born in Walworth in the parish of Camberwell, Surrey, which now forms part of the Borough of Southwark in south London. He was baptised on 14 June 1812, at Lock&#x27;s Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth, the only son of Sarah Anna (née Wiedemann) and Robert Browning. His father was a well-paid clerk for the Bank of England, earning about £150 per year. Browning&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a slave owner in Saint Kitts, West Indies, but Browning&#x27;s father was an abolitionist. Browning&#x27;s father had been sent to the West Indies to work on a sugar plantation but returned to England following a slave revolt. Browning&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a German shipowner who had settled in Dundee, Scotland and his Scottish wife. His paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, had inherited a plantation in St Kitts and was rumoured in the family to have a mixed-race ancestry including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was Kittitian rather than Jamaican. The evidence is inconclusive. Robert&#x27;s father, a literary collector, had a library of some 6,000 books; many of them were rare so that Robert grew up in a household with significant literary resources. His mother, to whom he was close, was a devout nonconformist and a talented musician. His younger sister, Sarianna, also gifted, became her brother&#x27;s companion in his later years, after the death of his wife in 1861. His father encouraged his children&#x27;s interest in literature and the arts.

By the age of 12, Browning had written a book of poetry, which he later destroyed for want of a publisher. After attending one or two private schools and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor, using the resources of his father&#x27;s library. By 14 he was fluent in French, Greek, Italian and Latin. He became an admirer of the Romantic poets, especially Shelley, whom he followed in becoming an atheist and a vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at University College London, but left after his first year. His parents&#x27; evangelical faith prevented his studying at either Oxford or Cambridge University, both then open only to members of the Church of England. He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents&#x27; remonstrations by dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son&#x27;s poems.

===First published works===
In March 1833, &quot;Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession&quot; was published anonymously by Saunders and Otley at the expense of the author, Robert Browning, who received the money from his aunt, Mrs Silverthorne. It is a long poem composed in homage to the poet Shelley and somewhat in his style. Originally Browning considered &quot;Pauline&quot; as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J. Fox writing in &quot;The Monthly Repository&quot; of April 1833 discerned merit in the work. Allan Cunningham praised it in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. However, it sold no copies. Some years later, probably in 1850, Dante Gabriel Rossetti came across it in the Reading Room of the British Museum and wrote to Browning, then in Florence, to ask if he was the author. John Stuart Mill, however, wrote that the author suffered from an &quot;intense and morbid self-consciousness&quot;. Later Browning was rather embarrassed by the work, and only included it in his collected poems of 1868 after making substantial changes and adding a preface in which he asked for indulgence for a boyish work.

In 1834, he accompanied the Chevalier George de Benkhausen, the Russian consul-general, on a brief visit to St Petersburg and began &quot;Paracelsus&quot;, which was published in 1835. The subject of the 16th-century savant and alchemist was probably suggested to him by the Comte Amédée de Ripart-Monclar, to whom it was dedicated. The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by Wordsworth, Dickens, Landor, J. S. Mill and the already famous Tennyson. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.

As a result of his new contacts he met Macready, who invited him to write a play. &quot;Strafford&quot; was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.

In 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for &quot;Sordello&quot;, a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by Dante in the Divine Comedy, canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson, jokingly, commented that he only understood the first and last lines. Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Thomas Carlyle (a friend of Browning&#x27;s who deeply influenced Browning&#x27;s poetry), quipped that she read the poem through and &quot;could not tell whether Sordello was a [sic] &#x27;a book, a city, or a man&#x27;&quot;.

Browning&#x27;s reputation began to make a partial recovery with the publication, 1841–1846, of &quot;Bells and Pomegranates&quot;, a series of eight pamphlets, originally intended just to include his plays. Fortunately for Browning&#x27;s career, his publisher, Moxon, persuaded him to include some &quot;dramatic lyrics&quot;, some of which had already appeared in periodicals.

===Marriage===


In 1845, Browning met the poet Elizabeth Barrett, six years his senior, who lived as a semi-invalid in her father&#x27;s house in Wimpole Street, London. They began regularly corresponding and gradually a romance developed between them, leading to their marriage and journey to Italy (for Elizabeth&#x27;s health) on 12 September 1846. The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth&#x27;s domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did each of his children who married: &quot;The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning.&quot; At her husband&#x27;s insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon William Wordsworth&#x27;s death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become Poet Laureate, the position eventually going to Tennyson.

From the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth&#x27;s death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in Pisa, and then, within a year, finding an apartment in Florence at Casa Guidi (now a museum to their memory). Their only child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning, nicknamed &quot;Penini&quot; or &quot;Pen&quot;, was born in 1849. In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning&#x27;s work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as Charles Kingsley, for deserting England.

===Political views===
Browning identified as a Liberal, supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the American Civil War. Later in life, he even championed animal rights in several poems attacking vivisection. He was also a stalwart opponent of anti-Semitism, leading to speculation that Browning himself was Jewish. In 1877 he wrote a poem explaining &quot;Why I am a Liberal&quot; in which he declared: &quot;Who then dares hold – emancipated thus / His fellow shall continue bound? Not I.&quot; Critical attention to Browning&#x27;s politics has, in general, been sparse. Isobel Armstrong&#x27;s writing on dramatic monologues, as well as more recent work on the influence of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; on Browning&#x27;s politics, has attempted to situate the poet&#x27;s political sensibility at the centre of his practice.

===Religious beliefs===
Browning was raised in an evangelical non-conformist household. However, after his reading of Shelley he is said to have briefly become an atheist. Browning is also said to have made an uncharacteristic admission of faith to Alfred Domett, when he is said to have admired Byron&#x27;s poetry &quot;as a Christian&quot;. Poems such as &quot;Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day&quot; seem to confirm this Christian faith, strengthened by his wife. However, many have dismissed the usefulness of these works at discovering Browning&#x27;s own religious views due to the consistent use of dramatic monologue which regularly expresses hypothetical views which cannot be ascribed to the author himself.

===Spiritualism incident===

Browning believed spiritualism to be fraud, and proved one of Daniel Dunglas Home&#x27;s most adamant critics. When Browning and his wife Elizabeth attended one of his séances on 23 July 1855, a spirit face materialized, which Home claimed was Browning&#x27;s son who had died in infancy: Browning seized the &quot;materialization&quot; and discovered it to be Home&#x27;s bare foot. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy.

After the séance, Browning wrote an angry letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he said: &quot;the whole display of hands, spirit utterances etc., was a cheat and imposture.&quot; In 1902 Browning&#x27;s son Pen wrote: &quot;Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.&quot; Elizabeth, however, was convinced that the phenomena she witnessed were genuine, and her discussions about Home with her husband were a constant source of disagreement.

===Major works===

In Florence, probably from early in 1853, Browning worked on the poems that eventually composed his two-volume &quot;Men and Women&quot;, for which he is now well known, although in 1855, when they were published, they made relatively little impact.

In 1861, Elizabeth died in Florence. Among those whom he found consoling in that period was the novelist and poet Isa Blagden, with whom he and his wife had a voluminous correspondence. The following year Browning returned to London, taking Pen with him, who by then was 12 years old. They made their home in 17 Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale. It was only when he became part of the London literary scene—albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)—that his reputation started to take off.

In 1868, after five years&#x27; work, he completed and published the long blank-verse poem &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot;. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning&#x27;s standards (over twenty-thousand lines), &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a &quot;tour de force&quot; of dramatic poetry. Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years. The Robert Browning Society was formed in 1881 and his work was recognised as belonging within the British literary canon.

===Last years and death===

In the remaining years of his life Browning travelled extensively. After a series of long poems published in the early 1870s, of which &quot;Balaustion&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and &quot;Red Cotton Night-Cap Country&quot; were the best-received, the volume &quot;Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper&quot; included an attack against Browning&#x27;s critics, especially Alfred Austin, who was later to become Poet Laureate. According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie, Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth&#x27;s death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, &quot;Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day&quot;. It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, &quot;Asolando&quot; (1889), published on the day of his death.

Browning died at his son&#x27;s home Ca&#x27; Rezzonico in Venice on 12 December 1889. He was buried in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of Alfred Tennyson.

During his life Browning was awarded many distinctions. He was made LL.D. of Edinburgh, a life Governor of London University, and had the offer of the Lord Rectorship of Glasgow. But he turned down anything that involved public speaking.

==History of sound recording==
At a dinner party on 7 April 1889, at the home of Browning&#x27;s friend the artist Rudolf Lehmann, an Edison cylinder phonograph recording was made on a white wax cylinder by Edison&#x27;s British representative, George Gouraud. In the recording, which still exists, Browning recites part of &quot;How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix&quot; (and can be heard apologising when he forgets the words). When the recording was played in 1890 on the anniversary of his death, at a gathering of his admirers, it was said to be the first time anyone&#x27;s voice &quot;had been heard from beyond the grave.&quot;

==Legacy==

Browning&#x27;s admirers have tended to temper their praise with reservations about the length and difficulty of his most ambitious poems, particularly &quot;Sordello&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot;. Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as Henry James, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, G. K. Chesterton, Ezra Pound, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Jorge Luis Borges, and Vladimir Nabokov. Among living writers, Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, A. S. Byatt&#x27;s &quot;Possession&quot;, and Maggie O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Portrait&quot; refer directly to Browning&#x27;s work.

Today Browning&#x27;s critically most esteemed poems include the monologues &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot;, &quot;Fra Lippo Lippi&quot;, &quot;Andrea Del Sarto&quot;, and &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;. His most popular poems include &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot;, &quot;How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix&quot;, the diptych &quot;Meeting at Night&quot;, the patriotic &quot;Home Thoughts from Abroad&quot;, and the children&#x27;s poem &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;. His abortive dinner-party recital of &quot;How They Brought The Good News&quot; was recorded on an Edison wax cylinder, and is believed to be one of the oldest surviving recordings made in the United Kingdom of a notable person (a recording of Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s voice was made about six months earlier).
Browning is now popularly known for such poems as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and also for certain famous lines: &quot;Grow old along with me!&quot; (&quot;&quot;), &quot;A man&#x27;s reach should exceed his grasp&quot; and &quot;Less is more&quot; (&quot;Andrea Del Sarto&quot;), &quot;It was roses, roses all the way&quot; (&quot;The Patriot&quot;), and &quot;God&#x27;s in His heaven—All&#x27;s right with the world!&quot; (&quot;Pippa Passes&quot;).

His critical reputation has traditionally rested mainly on his dramatic monologues, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker&#x27;s character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a soliloquy, the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while rationalising past actions or special pleading his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirisation of the sadistic attitude in his &quot;Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister&quot;. Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning&#x27;s poems 1833–1864, comments that Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot &quot;all learned from Browning&#x27;s exploration of the possibilities of dramatic poetry and of colloquial idiom&quot;.

In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s dialogue &quot;The Critic as Artist&quot;, Browning is given a famously ironical assessment: &quot;He is the most Shakespearean creature since Shakespeare. If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is George Meredith. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.&quot;

Probably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from Harold Bloom: &quot;Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival Tennyson and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even Yeats, Hardy, and Wallace Stevens. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by criticism, and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet... Yet when you read your way into his world, precisely his largest gift to you is his involuntary unfolding of one of the largest, most enigmatic, and most multipersoned literary and human selves you can hope to encounter.&quot; More recently, critics such as Annmarie Drury, Hédi A. Jaouad, and Joseph Hankinson have shifted to focus on Browning&#x27;s surprising receptivity to other cultures, languages, and literary traditions.

His work has nevertheless had many detractors, and most of his voluminous output is not widely read. In a largely hostile essay Anthony Burgess wrote: &quot;We all want to like Browning, but we find it very hard.&quot; Gerard Manley Hopkins and George Santayana were also critical. The latter expressed his views in the essay &quot;The Poetry of Barbarism&quot;, which attacks Browning and Walt Whitman for what he regarded as their embrace of irrationality.

==Cultural references==
The young Henry Walford Davies made a musical setting of &quot;Prospice&quot; in 1894 for baritone and string quartet. Stephen Banfield rates it highly among musical settings of Browning, calling it &quot;one of his few very powerful compositions&quot;. It has been recorded by Martin Oxenham and the Bingham String Quartet.

In 1914, the American modernist composer Charles Ives created the &quot;Robert Browning Overture&quot;, a dense and darkly dramatic piece with gloomy overtones reminiscent of the Second Viennese School.

In 1917, the U.S. composer Margaret Hoberg Turrell composed a song based on Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Love: Such a Starved Bank of Moss&quot;. In 1920, the U.S. composer Anne Stratton composed one based on Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Parting at Morning&quot;.

In 1930, the story of Browning and his wife was made into the play &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, by Rudolph Besier. It was a success and brought popular fame to the couple in the United States. The role of Elizabeth became a signature role for the actress Katharine Cornell. It was twice adapted into film. It was also the basis of the stage musical &quot;Robert and Elizabeth&quot;, with music by Ron Grainer and book and lyrics by Ronald Millar.

Browning is an important character in Michael Dibdin&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;A rich full death&quot;. 

&quot;God&#x27;s in his heaven – All&#x27;s right in the world&quot;, an excerpt from his poem, Pippa Passes, is the slogan for the fictional organisation NERV from Hideaki Anno&#x27;s 1995 anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion.

A memorial plaque on the site of Browning&#x27;s London home, in Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale, was unveiled on 11 December 1993.

<text>The Way of All Flesh (originally titled Ernest Pontifex or the Way of All Flesh) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler that attacks Victorian-era hypocrisy. Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published posthumously in 1903 as &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; it was accepted as part of the general reaction against Victorianism. Butler&#x27;s first literary executor, R. A. Streatfeild, made substantial changes to Butler&#x27;s manuscript. The original manuscript was first published in 1964 as &quot;Ernest Pontifex or the Way of All Flesh&quot; by Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, edited by Daniel F. Howard.

The title is a quotation from the &quot;Douay–Rheims Bible&quot;″s translation of the Biblical Hebrew expression, to &quot;go the way of all the earth&quot;, meaning &quot;to die&quot;, in the &quot;Books of Kings&quot;: &quot;I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself a man.&quot; (1 Kings 2.2). 

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; twelfth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Plot summary==
The story is narrated by Overton, godfather to the central character.

The novel takes its beginnings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to trace Ernest&#x27;s emergence from previous generations of the Pontifex family. John Pontifex was a carpenter; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher; George&#x27;s son Theobald, pressed by his father to become a minister, is manipulated into marrying Christina, the daughter of a clergyman; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of Theobald and Christina.

The author depicts an antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents. His aunt Alethea is aware of this relationship, but dies before she can fulfil her aim of counteracting the parents&#x27; malign influence on the boy. However, shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton&#x27;s keeping, with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight, he can receive it.

As Ernest develops into a young man, he travels a bumpy theological road, reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era. Easily influenced by others at university, he starts out as an Evangelical Christian, and soon becomes a clergyman. He then falls for the lures of the High Church (and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman). He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to convert, and, second, that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he has incorrectly believed to be of loose morals.

This assault leads to a prison term. His parents disown him. His health deteriorates.

As he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison. He rejects Christianity as superstition. He marries Ellen, a former housemaid of his parents; they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry. However, in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic. Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend, and she happily leaves with another for America. He gives Ernest a job, and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe.

When Ernest reaches the age of 28 he receives his aunt Alethea&#x27;s gift. He returns to the family home until his mother&#x27;s death; his father&#x27;s influence over him wanes as Theobald&#x27;s own position as a clergyman is reduced in relative stature, though to the end Theobald deliberately finds small ways to annoy him. Ernest becomes the author of controversial literature.

==Critical reputation==
The writer George Orwell praised the novel and called it &quot;a great book because it gives an honest picture of the relationship between father and son, and it could do that because Butler was a truly independent observer, and above all because he was courageous. He would say things that other people knew but didn&#x27;t dare to say. And finally there was his clear, simple, straightforward way of writing, never using a long word where a short one will do.&quot;

A. A. Milne, author of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, wrote about it in his essay &quot;A Household Book&quot;, published in a collection of his essays, &quot;Not That It Matters&quot;:
&quot;Once upon a time I discovered Samuel Butler; not the other two, but the one who wrote &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, the second-best novel in the English language. I say the second-best, so that, if you remind me of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, or &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, or any other that you fancy, I can say, of course, that one is the best.&quot;

<text>The Broadway Melody, also known as The Broadway Melody of 1929, is a 1929 American pre-Code musical film and the first sound film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. It was one of the early musicals to feature a Technicolor sequence, which sparked the trend of color being used in a flurry of musicals that would hit the screens in 1929–1930.

&quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; was written by Norman Houston and James Gleason from a story by Edmund Goulding and directed by Harry Beaumont. Original music was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, including the popular hit &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;. The George M. Cohan classic &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; is used under the opening establishing shots of New York City, its film debut. Bessie Love was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Today, the Technicolor sequence survives only in black and white. The film was the first musical released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was Hollywood&#x27;s first all-talking musical.

Having been published in 1929, it entered the public domain on January 1, 2025.

==Plot==

Eddie Kearns sings &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; and tells some chorus girls that he has brought the Mahoney Sisters vaudeville act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield. Harriet &quot;Hank&quot; Mahoney and her sister Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie&#x27;s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big, while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.

Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a young girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield&#x27;s revue to present their act. Flo, a dancer in Zanfield’s company, sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn&#x27;t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank&#x27;s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number.

Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop, and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is enamored with Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques &quot;Jock&quot; Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.

Over the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deteriorating the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she&#x27;s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister&#x27;s heart, runs off to Jock once again.

After witnessing Queenie&#x27;s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, Hank finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. Hank claims to have never loved him and that she&#x27;d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, Hank breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.

There&#x27;s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says it&#x27;s the least she could do after all he&#x27;s done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.

Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she&#x27;s through with show business and will settle in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments that she couldn&#x27;t help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank&#x27;s new partner is Flo, the blonde who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they&#x27;ll be back on Broadway within six months.

==Production==
Because this movie was one of the early sound features made, and one of the early sound musicals, the production learned how to record sound properly by trial-and-error. After the rushes were seen, the sets were changed to improve the recording qualities, and scenes were re-shot, resulting in long days for the actors and an overall long shooting schedule. It took over three hours to film Bessie Love&#x27;s brief ukulele-playing scene. For earlier takes, a full orchestra was off-camera, but for later takes, the actors sang and danced to prerecorded music. A silent version of the film was produced, as there were still many motion picture theaters without sound equipment at the time.

John Arnold shot with spherical lenses on 35mm black-and-white film, with one sequence in color. The film was presented in an aspect ratio of 1.37:1 (sound on disc version) and 1.20:1 (sound on film version).

The film featured a musical sequence for &quot;The Wedding of the Painted Doll&quot; that was presented in early two-color Technicolor (red and green filters). Color quickly became associated with the musical genre, and numerous features were released in 1929 and 1930 that either featured color sequences or were filmed entirely in color, like &quot;On with the Show&quot; (1929), &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot; (1929), &quot;Sally&quot; (1929), &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; (1930), and others. The color footage is not extant, although a few frames still survive.

==Reception and legacy==
===Contemporary===

&quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; was a substantial success and made a profit of $1.6 million for MGM. It was the top grossing picture of 1929 and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Contemporary reviews from critics were generally positive. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it &quot;has everything a silent picture should have outside of its dialog. A basic story with some sense to it, action, excellent direction, laughs, a tear, a couple of great performances and plenty of sex.&quot; &quot;Has everything&quot;, agreed &quot;Film Daily&quot;. &quot;Sure-fire moneymaker that will drag &#x27;em in everywhere.&quot;

&quot;This picture is great. It will revolutionize the talkies&quot;, wrote Edwin Schallert for &quot;Motion Picture News&quot;. &quot;The direction is an amazing indication of what can be done in the new medium.&quot;

Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a mixed review, calling it &quot;rather cleverly directed&quot; but &quot;somewhat obvious&quot;, with sentiment &quot;served out too generously in most of the sequences.&quot; Hall called King&#x27;s performance &quot;vigorous,&quot; but of Page, he wrote, &quot;Her acting, especially her voice, does not enhance her personality. Notwithstanding, it must be admitted that there are girls who talk as they are made to for the screen. Miss Page, however, fails to give one an impression of spontaneity, for she recites rather than speaks her lines.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;The stage background allows opportunity for one or two musical interpolations, and no one is more glad than we that the talkies charmingly succeed in a very pleasant ballet. Because of that, we shall try to forget the dialogue of the play, and that James Gleason ever wanted to take any credit for it.&quot;
===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three Academy Awards at the 1930 ceremony: Best Actress (Bessie Love), Best Director (Harry Beaumont), and Outstanding Picture. No nominations were announced before the 1930 ceremonies. Love and Beaumont are presumed to have been under consideration, and they are listed as such by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

===Retrospective===
Historically, &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; is often considered the first complete example of a Hollywood musical. Contemporary critics now view the movie as cliché-ridden and overly melodramatic, despite the fact that it was considered innovative for its time and contributed to the concept and structure of musical films. It currently holds a rating of 42% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is that the film &quot;is interesting as an example of an early Hollywood musical, but otherwise, it&#x27;s essentially bereft of appeal for modern audiences&quot;.

Assessing the film in 2009, James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;&quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; has not stood the test of time in ways that many of its more artistic contemporaries have. Some of its deficiencies can be attributed to ways in which the genre has been re-shaped and improved over the years, but some are the result of the studio&#x27;s validated belief that viewers would be willing to ignore bad acting and pedestrian directing in order to experience singing, dancing, and talking on the silver screen.&quot;

==Sequels==
Three more movies were later made by MGM with similar titles: &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot;, &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot;, and &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot;. Although not direct sequels in the traditional sense, they all had the same basic premise of a group of people putting on a show (the films also had recurring cast members playing different roles, most notably dancer Eleanor Powell who appeared in all three).

The original movie was remade in 1940 as &quot;Two Girls on Broadway&quot;. Another &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; film was planned for 1943 (starring Gene Kelly and Eleanor Powell), but production was cancelled when Kelly was loaned to Columbia for &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944). &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;, a 1944 musical by MGM, was originally to have been titled &quot;Broadway Melody of 1944&quot;.

==Home media==
Warner Bros. released &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; on a Region 1 special edition DVD in 2005. It is included in the 18-disc &quot;Best Picture Oscar Collection&quot;, also released by Warner Bros. The film was given a Blu-ray release from a 4K restoration by Warner Archive in July 2023. After the DVD had been released, a 25- to 30-second establishing shot of New York City, missing from 35mm prints and the DVD release, was discovered in a 16mm print. This footage was put back into the film when Warner Brothers restored the film for its 2023 Warner Archive Blu-Ray release .

<text>Alibi (also known as The Perfect Alibi, Nightstick) is a 1929 American crime film directed by Roland West. The screenplay was written by West and C. Gardner Sullivan, who adapted the 1927 Broadway stage play, &quot;Nightstick&quot;, written by Elaine Sterne Carrington, J.C. Nugent, Elliott Nugent, and John Wray.

The movie is a crime drama starring Chester Morris, Harry Stubbs, Mae Busch, and Regis Toomey. Director West experimented a great deal with sound, music, and camera angles.

==Plot==
Joan Manning, the daughter of a police sergeant, secretly marries Chick Williams, a gangleader who convinces her that he is leading an honest life. Chick attends the theater with Joan and, at the intermission, sneaks away, committing a robbery during which a policeman is killed. Chick is suspected of the crime but is able to use Joan to substantiate his alibi. The police plant Danny McGann, an undercover agent, in Chick&#x27;s gang; but he is discovered, and Chick murders him. Chick is later cornered by the police in his own home. Before they can arrest him, he flips the light switch, plunging the room into darkness. In the midst of the chaos, Chick escapes to the roof. He attempts to jump off to a nearby building, but stumbles on the landing, thus falling to his death.

<text>The Patriot is a 2000 American epic historical drama war film directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Robert Rodat. The film stars Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper, and Tom Wilkinson. Set in Berkeley County, South Carolina, it follows Benjamin Martin (Gibson), an American colonist who is opposed to going to war with Great Britain but, along with his son Gabriel (Ledger), gets swept into the American Revolutionary War when his home life is disrupted, and one of his sons is murdered by a cruel British officer (Isaacs). Rodat has said Martin is a composite character based on four historical men: Andrew Pickens, Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter.

&quot;The Patriot&quot; had its world premiere in Century City on June 27, 2000, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 30, 2000. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $215.3 million against a $110 million budget. The film generated controversy due to themes of anti-British sentiment and was criticized by historians over its fictionalized portrayal of British figures and atrocities.

==Plot==

In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, Benjamin Martin, a French and Indian War veteran and a widower with seven children, is called to Charlestown to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Benjamin abstains, fearing war against Great Britain and not wanting to force others to fight when Benjamin himself would not. Still, the vote passes, and Benjamin&#x27;s oldest son, Gabriel, joins the Continental Army against his father&#x27;s wishes.

Four years later, in 1780, Charlestown falls to the British Army, and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying rebel dispatches. The Martins care for wounded British and American soldiers before British dragoons arrive, led by Colonel William Tavington. Tavington press gangs the Martins&#x27; African American former slaves into the army and arrests Gabriel as a spy. Gabriel&#x27;s brother Thomas tries to free him, but Tavington kills Thomas, then orders the Martins&#x27; house burned and all the wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin and his two younger sons ambush the British convoy transporting Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully but brutally slaughters all but one of the soldiers in front of his children. The survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the &quot;Ghost&quot; moniker.

Gabriel rejoins the Continentals, and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin&#x27;s sister-in-law, Charlotte. While they travel, they witness American forces under General Horatio Gates engaging the British at Camden.

Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who appoints him as colonel to raise a militia unit because of his combat experience and places Gabriel under his father&#x27;s command. Benjamin is tasked with weakening Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s regiments by guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid. Gabriel asks his father why Villeneuve and other militia often mention Fort Wilderness, and Benjamin finally tells him that while fighting in the British Army, Benjamin and his men discovered atrocities against British colonists by French soldiers in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Enraged, they caught up with the retreating French at Fort Wilderness and killed all but two of them. The survivors had to present the severed heads of their comrades to the Cherokee, which convinced the tribe to betray the French. Though regarded as a hero, Benjamin never forgave himself.

Benjamin&#x27;s militia ambushes many British patrols and supplies caravans, including some of Cornwallis&#x27;s personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burns bridges and ferries that Cornwallis needs. Cornwallis angrily blames Tavington for his setbacks but, after Benjamin uses a dishonorable and embarrassing ploy to free his captured men, reluctantly allows Tavington to do everything possible to arrest Benjamin.

With the aid of Wilkin, a local Loyalist, Tavington has several militiamen&#x27;s homes burned and their families executed. Benjamin&#x27;s family flees Charlotte&#x27;s plantation to live in a Gullah settlement with formerly enslaved residents. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed, Anne. Tavington&#x27;s brigade raids Anne&#x27;s town and assembles everyone in the church, including her parents and Anne herself; knowing that they are secretly aiding the militia, he demands the location of their camp. Despite one townsperson giving it away, Tavington has the doors barricaded and burns the church, killing everyone inside. Upon discovering the tragedy, Gabriel and several other soldiers attack Tavington&#x27;s encampment for revenge, where Tavington kills Gabriel before fleeing. A grieving Benjamin contemplates desertion, but after seeing the American flag Gabriel repaired, he is reminded of his son&#x27;s patriotic dedication and decides to rejoin the others.

Martin devises a battlefield tactic that uses Cornwallis&#x27;s own pride against him. Martin&#x27;s militia joins the Continental Army regiment and confronts Cornwallis&#x27;s troops at Cowpens. Benjamin and Tavington engage in personal combat. Tavington wounds Benjamin and prepares to deliver the coup de grâce. At the last second, Benjamin dodges the attack and impales Tavington twice, killing him. The battle becomes a Continental victory, and Cornwallis retreats.

Cornwallis is finally besieged at Yorktown, where his subordinate surrenders to the American and French forces. Afterwards, Benjamin returns to his family and discovers that his former militia has rebuilt his homestead in honor of Gabriel&#x27;s dream of building a new world.

==Production==
===Script===
Screenwriter Robert Rodat wrote seventeen drafts of the script before there was an acceptable one. In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel&#x27;s child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Mel Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin and gave the character six children to signal that preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson&#x27;s seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin has seven children. Like the character William Wallace, which Gibson had portrayed in &quot;Braveheart&quot; five years earlier, Martin is a man who seeks to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life of an innocent family member is taken.

===Casting===
Harrison Ford turned down the lead role of Benjamin Martin because he considered the film &quot;too violent&quot; and that &quot;it boiled the American Revolution down to one guy wanting revenge.&quot; Gibson was paid a record salary of $25 million. Joshua Jackson, Elijah Wood, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Renfro were considered to play Gabriel Martin. The producers and director narrowed their choices for the role of Gabriel to Ryan Phillippe and Heath Ledger, with Ledger chosen because Roland Emmerich thought he possessed &quot;exuberant youth.&quot;

===Filming===
The film&#x27;s German director Emmerich said &quot;these were characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict that had a significant outcome—the creation of the first modern democratic government.&quot;

The film was shot entirely on location in South Carolina, including Charleston, Rock Hill—for many of the battle scenes, and Lowrys—for the farm of Benjamin Martin, as well as nearby Fort Lawn. It was filmed on September 7, 1999, and ended on January 20, 2000. Other scenes were filmed at Mansfield Plantation, an antebellum rice plantation in Georgetown, Middleton Place in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Cistern Yard on the campus of College of Charleston, and Hightower Hall and Homestead House at Brattonsville, South Carolina, along with the grounds of the Brattonsville Plantation in McConnells, South Carolina. Producer Mark Gordon said the production team &quot;tried their best to be as authentic as possible&quot; because &quot;the backdrop was serious history,&quot; giving attention to details in period dress. Producer Dean Devlin and the film&#x27;s costume designers examined actual Revolutionary War uniforms at the Smithsonian Institution prior to shooting.

===Musical score===

The musical score for &quot;The Patriot&quot; was composed and conducted by John Williams and was nominated for an Academy Award. David Arnold, who composed the scores to Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and &quot;Godzilla&quot;, created a demo for &quot;The Patriot&quot; that was ultimately rejected. As a result, Arnold never returned to compose for any of Emmerich&#x27;s subsequent films and was replaced by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Patriot&quot; holds an approval rating of 62% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Patriot&quot; can be entertaining to watch, but it relies too much on formula and melodrama.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Elvis Mitchell gave the film a generally negative review, although he praised its casting and called Mel Gibson &quot;an astonishing actor&quot;, particularly for his &quot;on-screen comfort and expansiveness&quot;. He said the film is a &quot;gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality&quot;. Jamie Malanowski, also writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said &quot;The Patriot&quot; &quot;will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer evening. It&#x27;s got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally guilt-free villain, thrills, tenderness, sorrow, rage and a little bit of kissing&quot;. In his review of the film, the critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;I enjoyed the strength and conviction of Gibson&#x27;s performance, the sweep of the battle scenes, and the absurdity of the British caricatures. None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War, but with such an enormous budget at risk, how could it?&quot;

===False reviews controversy===
A highly positive review was purportedly written by a critic named David Manning, who was credited to &quot;The Ridgefield Press&quot;, a small Connecticut weekly news publication. During an investigation into Manning&#x27;s quotes, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter John Horn discovered that the newspaper had never heard of him. The story emerged at around the same time as an announcement that Sony had used employees posing as moviegoers in television commercials to praise the film. All of those occurrences raised questions and controversies about ethics in film promotion practices.

On the June 10, 2001 episode of &quot;Le Show&quot;, host Harry Shearer conducted an in-studio interview with Manning, whose &quot;review&quot; of the film was positive. The voice of Manning was provided by a computer voice synthesizer.

On August 3, 2005, Sony made an out-of-court settlement and agreed to refund $5 each to dissatisfied customers who saw that and four other films in American theaters as a result of Manning&#x27;s reviews.

===Box office===
&quot;The Patriot&quot; opened in 3,061 venues at #2 with $22,413,710 domestically in its opening weekend, falling slightly short of expectations (predictions had the film opening #1 with roughly $25 million ahead). The film opened behind Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, which opened at #1 with $41,325,042. The film closed on October 16, 2000, with a domestic total of $113,330,342. It saw a similar level of success in foreign markets, earning $101,964,000 there for a grand total of $215,294,342, against a production budget of $110 million.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Patriot&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound (Kevin O&#x27;Connell, Greg P. Russell and Lee Orloff). It also received several guild awards, including the American Society of Cinematographers award to Caleb Deschanel for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography and the Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award for Best Period Makeup and Best Period Hair Styling.

==Historical authenticity==
During development, Emmerich and his team consulted experts at the Smithsonian Institution on set, props, and costumes; advisor Rex Ellis even recommended the Gullah village as an appropriate place for Martin&#x27;s family to hide. In addition, screenwriter Robert Rodat read through many journals and letters of colonists as part of his preparation for writing the screenplay.

Producer Mark Gordon said that in making the film, &quot;while we were telling a fictional story, the backdrop was serious history&quot;. Some of the resulting characters and events thus were composites of real characters and events that were designed to serve the fictional narrative without losing the historical flavor. Rodat said of Gibson&#x27;s character: &quot;Benjamin Martin is a composite character made up of Thomas Sumter, Daniel Morgan, Andrew Pickens, and Francis Marion, and a few bits and pieces from a number of other characters.&quot; Rodat also indicated that the fictional Colonel William Tavington is &quot;loosely based on Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who was particularly known for his brutal acts&quot;.

While some events, such as Tarleton&#x27;s pursuit of Francis Marion and his fellow irregular soldiers who escaped by disappearing into the swamps of South Carolina, were loosely based on history, and others were adapted, such as the final battle in the film which combined elements of the Battles of Cowpens and Battle of Guilford Court House, most of the plot events in the film are pure fiction.

===Criticism of Benjamin Martin as based on Francis Marion===
The film was harshly criticized in the British press in part because of its connection to Francis Marion, a militia leader in South Carolina known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;. After the release of &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; denounced Marion as &quot;a serial rapist who hunted Red Indians for fun.&quot; Historian Christopher Hibbert told the &quot;Daily Express&quot; about Marion:

The truth is that people like Marion committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British.

&quot;The Patriot&quot; does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character&#x27;s guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the French and Indian War, leading him to repentantly repudiate General Cornwallis for the brutality of his men.

Conservative radio host Michael Graham rejected Hibbert&#x27;s criticism of Marion in a commentary published in &quot;National Review&quot;:

Was Francis Marion a slave owner? Was he a determined and dangerous warrior? Did he commit acts in an 18th century war that we would consider atrocious in the current world of peace and political correctness? As another great American film hero might say: &#x27;You&#x27;re damn right.&#x27; &quot;That&#x27;s what made him a hero, 200 years ago and today.&quot;

Graham also refers to what he describes as &quot;the unchallenged work of South Carolina&#x27;s premier historian&quot; Dr. Walter Edgar, who claimed in his 1998 &quot;South Carolina: A History&quot; that Marion&#x27;s partisans were &quot;a ragged band of both black and white volunteers&quot;.

Amy Crawford, in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine, stated that modern historians such as William Gilmore Simms and Hugh Rankin have written accurate biographies of Marion, including Simms&#x27; &quot;The Life of Francis Marion&quot;. The introduction to the 2007 edition of Simms&#x27; book was written by Sean Busick, a professor of American history at Athens State University in Alabama, who wrote:

Marion deserves to be remembered as one of the heroes of the War for Independence...Francis Marion was a man of his times: he owned slaves, and he fought in a brutal campaign against the Cherokee Indians...Marion&#x27;s experience in the French and Indian War prepared him for more admirable service.

During pre-production, the producers debated on whether Martin would own slaves, ultimately deciding not to make him a slave owner. This decision received criticism from Spike Lee, who in a letter to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; accused the film&#x27;s portrayal of slavery as being &quot;a complete whitewashing of history&quot;. Lee wrote that after he and his wife went to see the film, &quot;we both came out of the theatre fuming. For three hours &quot;The Patriot&quot; dodged around, skirted about or completely ignored slavery.&quot; Gibson himself remarked: &quot;I think I would have made him a slave holder. Not to seems kind of a cop-out.&quot;

===Criticism of Tavington as based on Tarleton===
After release, several British voices criticized the film for its depiction of the film&#x27;s villain Tavington and defended the historical character of Banastre Tarleton. Ben Fenton, commenting in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote:

There is no evidence that Tarleton, called &#x27;Bloody Ban&#x27; or &#x27;The Butcher&#x27; in rebel pamphlets, ever broke the rules of war and certainly did not ever shoot a child in cold blood.

Although Tarleton gained the reputation among Americans as a butcher for his involvement in the Battle of Waxhaws in South Carolina, he was a hero in the City of Liverpool. Liverpool City Council, led by Mayor Edwin Clein, called for a public apology for what they viewed as the film&#x27;s &quot;character assassination&quot; of Tarleton.

What happened during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, is the subject of debate. According to an American field surgeon named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a white flag of surrender, &quot;expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare&quot;. While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton&#x27;s horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out &quot;indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages&quot;.

In Tarleton&#x27;s own account, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge in which he was knocked out for several minutes and that his men, thinking him dead, engaged in &quot;a vindictive asperity not easily restrained&quot;.

Tarleton&#x27;s role in the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas is examined by Ben Rubin who shows that historically, while the actual events of the Battle of the Waxhaws were presented differently according to which side was recounting them, the story of Tarleton&#x27;s atrocities at Waxhaws and on other occasions became a rallying cry, particularly at the Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain. The tales of Tarleton&#x27;s atrocities were a part of standard U.S. accounts of the war and were described by Washington Irving and by Christopher Ward in his 1952 history, &quot;The War of the Revolution&quot;, where Tarleton is described as &quot;cold-hearted, vindictive, and utterly ruthless. He wrote his name in letters of blood all across the history of the war in the South.&quot; Not until Anthony Scotti&#x27;s 2002 book, &quot;Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton&quot;, were Tarleton&#x27;s actions fully reexamined. Scotti challenged the factual accounts of atrocities and stressed the &quot;propaganda value that such stories held for the Americans both during and after the war&quot;. Scotti&#x27;s book, however, did not come out until two years after &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself.

Whereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in Leintwardine, Herefordshire, England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended. He outlived Col. Francis Marion who died in 1795, by 38 years. Before his death, Tarleton had achieved the military rank of General, equal to that held by the overall British commanders during the American Revolution, and became a baronet and a member of the British Parliament.

===Depiction of atrocities in the Revolutionary War===

&quot;The Patriot&quot; was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the Revolutionary War, including the killing of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers and Tavington&#x27;s burning a church filled with civilians. Although historians have noted that both sides during the conflict committed atrocities, they &quot;generally agree that the rebels probably violated the rules of war more often than the British&quot;. According to &quot;Salon.com&quot;, the church-burning scene in the film is based on the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre committed by German forces in 1944, though &quot;[there] is no evidence that a similar event took place during the American Revolution&quot;. Historian Bill Segars noted that there was no record of the British ever burning a church full of civilians during the Revolutionary War, though British and Loyalist forces did burn several empty churches such as the St. Philip&#x27;s Church in Brunswick Town and Indiantown Presbyterian Church.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; film critic Jonathan Foreman was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at Salon.com:

The most disturbing thing about &quot;The Patriot&quot; is not just that German director Roland Emmerich (director of&quot; Independence Day)&quot; and his screenwriter Robert Rodat (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British and other Allied troops in the Normandy landings from his script for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;) depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to war crimes carried out by German troops—particularly the SS in World War II. It&#x27;s hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda... They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradour—and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history&#x27;s worst monsters... So it&#x27;s no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; film critic Stephen Hunter said: &quot;Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that is something that I am afraid has been lost to history...[T]he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties.&quot; The historian Richard F. Snow, editor of &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine, said of the church-burning scene: &quot;Of course it never happened—if it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I.&quot;

== Home media ==
&quot;The Patriot&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on October 24, 2000, a Blu-ray release followed on July 3, 2007. The film was later released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on May 22, 2018.

<text>The Big House is a 1930 American pre-Code prison drama film directed by George Hill, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and starring Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Lewis Stone and Robert Montgomery. The story and dialogue were written by Frances Marion, who won the Academy Award for Best Writing Achievement. As one of the first prison movies, it inspired many others of this genre.

==Plot==

Kent (Robert Montgomery), a drunk driver who carelessly kills a man, is sentenced to ten years for manslaughter. In an overcrowded prison designed for 1800 and actually holding 3000, he is placed in a cell with Butch (Wallace Beery) and Morgan (Chester Morris), the two leaders of the inmates. Butch is alternately menacing and friendly, while Morgan tries to help out the frightened, inexperienced youngster, but Kent rebuffs his overtures.

When Butch is ordered into solitary confinement for sparking a protest over the prison food, he passes along his knife before being searched. It ends up in Kent&#x27;s hands. Meanwhile, Morgan is notified that he is to be paroled. Prior to a search of their cell, Kent hides the knife in Morgan&#x27;s bed. When it is found, Morgan&#x27;s parole is canceled, and he is put in solitary as well. He vows to make Kent pay for what he has done.

When Morgan is let out of solitary, he escapes by switching places with a corpse on the way to the morgue. He makes his way to the bookstore run by Kent&#x27;s beautiful sister, Anne (Leila Hyams). She, however, recognizes him. She manages to get his gun and starts to call the police, but then changes her mind and gives him back his pistol. Morgan (who has been attracted to Anne since he saw Kent&#x27;s photograph of her) gets a job and becomes better acquainted with Anne and her family. They all like him, especially Anne. However, he is caught and sent back to prison.

When Butch tells Morgan of his plan for a jailbreak on Thanksgiving, Morgan tells him that he is going straight. In return for a promise of freedom, Kent informs the warden (Lewis Stone) of the attempt, though he is not privy to the details. Despite the warning, the inmates succeed in taking over the prison, capturing many of the guards, though they are unable to force their way out. Thwarted, Butch threatens to shoot the guards one by one unless they are allowed to escape. When the warden stands firm, Butch shoots the warden&#x27;s right-hand man in cold blood, then tosses the dying man out for all to see.

Army tanks are called to break down the entrance. Morgan grabs a pistol from the prisoner assigned to watch the guards. He finds Kent cowering with the guard but spares him. Kent panics and flees before Morgan locks the guards in to save their lives. When Kent tries to open the front doors, he is killed in the crossfire. Butch is told that Morgan was the &quot;stoolie&quot; who tipped off the warden and learns he has put the guards out of danger. He sets out to kill his former friend. In the ensuing gunfight, both are wounded, Butch fatally. Before he dies, he learns that Kent was actually the informer, and he and Morgan reconcile. For his efforts, Morgan is given a full pardon. When he exits the prison, Anne rushes to embrace him.

==Background==
The story was inspired by a spate of prison riots in 1929 and resulting federal investigation. In response, George Hill wrote a twenty-seven page story treatment called &quot;The Reign of Terror: A Story of Crime and Punishment&quot;. Irving Thalberg gave the go ahead for the screenplay and assigned Frances Marion to work with George Hill.

Lon Chaney was originally chosen for the role of Butch, a violent career criminal who rules the prison cellblock, but the cancer from which he was to die in August 1930 had already advanced too far and the role went to Wallace Beery. The movie launched Beery&#x27;s sound career to new heights; a top supporting actor and frequent leading man in silents, he had been dropped by his previous studio Paramount when sound came in even though he recorded a successful voice test. After &quot;The Big House&quot; became a hit and his performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, he became the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor within two years.

The story and dialogue were written by Frances Marion, with additional dialogue by Joe Farnham and Martin Flavin. Marion won the Academy Award for Best Writing Achievement. Douglas Shearer also won the first Academy Award for Sound. The film was nominated for Best Picture. &quot;The Big House&quot; was one of the first prison films ever made and was tremendously influential on the genre.

== Foreign-language versions ==
In the early days of sound films, it was common for Hollywood studios to produce &quot;Foreign Language Versions&quot; of their films using the same sets, costumes and so on. While many of these versions no longer exist, the French, Spanish and German-language versions of &quot;The Big House&quot; survive, which are entitled &quot;Révolte dans la prison&quot;, &quot;El presidio&quot; and &quot;Menschen hinter Gittern&quot;. The French and Spanish versions are available with the original in a triple feature set from the Warner Archives.

==Reception==
Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a film in which the direction, the photography, the microphone work and the magnificent acting take precedence over the negligible story.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;virile, realistic melodrama&quot;. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;So expert are many of the scenes, so effective the photography, so direct and spare the dialogue, that certain obvious, silly, and dull moments may almost be overlooked.&quot;

Wallace Beery was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in &quot;The Big House&quot;, cementing his career in sound films, and won the following year for &quot;The Champ&quot; (1931).

According to MGM records &quot;The Big House&quot; took in approximately $1,279,000 in theater rentals from the United States and Canada, an additional $436,000 from foreign rentals, and earned a profit of $462,000.

==Evaluation in film guides==
&quot;Steven H. Scheuer&#x27;s TV Movie Almanac &amp; Ratings 1958 &amp; 1959&quot; gave &quot;The Big House&quot; a &quot;Good&quot; rating of 3 stars (out of 4), summarizing its plot as &quot;[D]esperate convicts try a prison break&quot;, with the evaluation, &quot;[T]his early example of prison melodrama is still entertaining&quot;. &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s TV Movies &amp; Video Guide&quot; (1989 edition) also put the rating at 3 (out of 4 stars), describing it as &quot;[T]he original prison drama&quot; and indicating that &quot;this set the pattern for all later copies; it&#x27;s still good, hard-bitten stuff with one of Beery&#x27;s best tough-guy roles&quot;. In the third edition (2015) of his &quot;Classic Movie Guide&quot;, Maltin also mentioned the surviving French and Spanish-language versions and added that &quot;Charles Boyer stars in the former&quot;.

British references had some positive words for the film, with the 1984 edition of &quot;David Shipman&#x27;s The Good Film and Video Guide&quot; giving 1 star out of 4 (&quot;Recommended with reservations&quot;), noting that it is &quot;[An] untypical MGM film, about prison life which is now laughably conventional but was then very influential&quot;. Shipman describes Wallace Beery and Chester Morris as &quot;two old lags&quot; and Robert Montgomery as &quot;the wealthy guy too weak for the system&quot;. Leslie Halliwell in the 5th edition (1985) of his &quot;Film and Video Guide&quot;, rated it 2 stars out of 4 and described it as an &quot;[A]rchetypal prison melodrama and a significant advance in form for early talkies.&quot;

<doc id="61188" wikidata="Q206171" url="?curid=61188" title="Scottish Parliament">
<text>The Scottish Parliament ( ; ) is the unicameral legislature of Scotland. Located in the Holyrood area of the capital city, Edinburgh, it is frequently referred to by the metonym &quot;Holyrood&quot;. The Parliament is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), elected for five-year terms under the regionalised form of Additional-member system (MMP): 73 MSPs represent individual geographical constituencies elected by the plurality (first-past-the-post) system, while a further 56 are returned as list members from eight additional member regions. Each region elects seven party-list MSPs. Each region elects 15 to 17 MSPs in total. The most recent general election to the Parliament was held on 6 May 2021, with the Scottish National Party winning a plurality.

The original Parliament of Scotland was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland ceased to exist, while the Parliament of England, which sat at Westminster, was subsumed into the Parliament of Great Britain. In practice, all of the traditions, procedures, and standing orders of the English parliament were retained, with the addition of Scottish members in both the Commons and Lords.

Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the powers of the devolved legislature were specified by the Scotland Act 1998. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are &quot;reserved&quot; to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The UK Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws. The first meeting of the reconvened Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.

The legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament has been amended numerous times since then. The Scotland Act 2012 and Scotland Act 2016 expanded the Parliament&#x27;s powers, especially over taxation and welfare. The purpose of the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, the most recent amendment, is to constrain the powers of the devolved institutions and restrict the exercise of devolved competences. Its effect is to undermine the freedom of action, regulatory competence and authority of the Parliament, limiting its ability to make different economic or social choices to those made by Westminster.

== History ==

===Original Parliament of Scotland===
Before the Treaty of Union 1707 united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England into a new state called &quot;Great Britain&quot;, Scotland had an independent parliament known as the Parliament of Scotland. Initial Scottish proposals in the negotiation over the Union suggested a devolved Parliament be retained in Scotland, but this was not accepted by the English negotiators.

===Treaty of Union===

For the next 290 years, Scotland was governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a &#x27;devolved&#x27; Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.

===1979 devolution referendum===

During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot; campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should. The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974. Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978, an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh if the public approved it in a referendum be held on 1 March 1979. A narrow majority of 51.6% to 48.4% voted in favour of a Scottish Assembly, but the Act also required that at least 40% of the total electorate vote in favour of the proposal. As the turnout was only 63.6%, the vote in favour represented only 32.9% of the eligible voting population, and the Assembly was not established.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.

===1997 devolution referendum===

Devolution continued to form part of the platform of the Labour Party which won power under Tony Blair in May 1997. In September 1997, the Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the reestablishment of the Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. 

===Opening of the new Scottish Parliament===

An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new reconvened Parliament. While the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, a temporary home for the Parliament was found in Edinburgh. The General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile was chosen to host the Parliament. Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh. This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church&#x27;s General Assembly. In May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber at Strathclyde House in Glasgow, and to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002.

Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn&#x27;s Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.

In 2024, the Scottish Parliament celebrated its 25th anniversary.

== Officials ==

After each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. The Presiding Officer (currently Alison Johnstone) and deputies (currently Annabelle Ewing and Liam McArthur) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.

As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.

The Presiding Officer controls debates by calling on members to speak. The Presiding Officer rules on points of order raised by members, which are not subject to debate or appeal. The Presiding Officer may also discipline members who fail to observe the rules of the Parliament.

== Parliamentary chamber ==
The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus and compromise. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament&#x27;s elected MSPs and two are seats for the Scottish Law Officers—the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.

Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.

In front of the Presiding Officers&#x27; desk is the parliamentary mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: &quot;Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Compassion&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Integrity&quot;. The words &quot;There shall be a Scottish Parliament&quot;, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament&#x27;s official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

== Proceedings ==

Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October. Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm. Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Parliament TV is a webcast and archive of Parliamentary business back to 2012. and on the BBC&#x27;s parliamentary channel BBC Parliament. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the &quot;Official Report&quot;, which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.

Since September 2012, the first item of business on Tuesday afternoons is usually Time for Reflection at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith. This contrasts with the formal style of &quot;Prayers&quot;, which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons. Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census. Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers. Before September 2012, Time for reflection was held on Wednesday afternoons.

The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.

Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day. This &quot;Decision Time&quot; is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote. At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking &quot;&quot;Are we all agreed?&quot;, to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces &quot;There will be a division&quot;&quot; and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.

The outcome of most votes can be predicted since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party&#x27;s policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce &quot;free votes&quot;, which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on moral issues.

Immediately after Decision Time a &quot;Members Debate&quot; is held, which lasts for 45 minutes. Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member&#x27;s own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to &quot;winds up&quot; the debate by speaking after all other participants.

== Committees ==

Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.

Committees comprise a small number of MSPs, who look at specific subjects such as health, the economy or justice. They play a central role in the work of the Scottish parliament because, unlike the UK Parliament, the Scottish parliament is a single-chamber parliament. The committees can thus, consider and amend proposals for new laws, they can also propose new laws themselves. The committees can investigate any area that is within their remit and publish recommendations, and can also report on petitions that have been submitted by members of the public or groups. The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.

Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.

A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie–Bathgate rail link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.

== Legislative functions and powers ==
The Scotland Act 1998, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence. Since the establishment of the Parliament, there have been a number of changes to its legislative competence.

The Parliament is able to debate any issue (including those reserved to Westminster) but is unable to make laws on issues that are outside its legislative competence. As the Scottish Parliament is able to make laws on the areas constitutionally devolved to it, the legislative process begins with bills (draft laws) which are presented to Parliament. Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.

The Scotland Act 2012 and the Scotland Act 2016 extended the devolved competencies, including areas such as taxation powers, welfare and elections to the Scottish parliament. The United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 is intended to restrict the operation of devolved powers. The latter legislation, passed under the regime of Boris Johnson, gives UK ministers extended powers to enforce mutual recognition of regulations across the UK, and the exemptions permitted for the devolved administrations are significantly less extensive than previous exemptions under the EU Single Market rules. It both legally and practically restrains the legislative competence of the Parliament and undermines devolution. The business secretary tacitly acknowledged this fact in the impact assessment that the BEIS department was obliged to publish alongside the bill, which states: &quot;The final cost of this legislation is the potentially reduced ability for different parts of the UK to achieve local policy benefits. While this legislation does not constrain the ability of different parts of the UK to introduce distinct policies, to the extent that those policies may be enforceable on a reduced number of businesses might make it harder to realise fully the benefits of those policies.&quot; Although the UK Government stated on publication that the proposed bill sought to &quot;protect the integrity of the UK&#x27;s single market&quot;, the legislation has been heavily criticised for its dealings with the devolved nations. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the bill a &quot;full frontal assault on devolution&quot;. The legislation undermines the freedom of action, regulatory competence and authority of the Parliament, limiting its ability to make different economic or social choices from those made in Westminster, and to focus and plan investment in infrastructure in Scotland.

Under the terms of the Scotland Acts, the Parliament of the United Kingdom agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Act 1998 enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues, and to hold the Scottish Government to account. Although the Westminster Parliament retains the authority to legislate on devolved matters, under the Sewell convention it is understood that it will not do so without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.

== Scrutiny of government ==
The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland&#x27;s Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.

Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government&#x27;s legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.

Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A &quot;General Question Time&quot; takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government. At 2:30 pm, a 40-minute-long themed &quot;Question Time&quot; takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister&#x27;s Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction.

Members who wish to ask general or themed questions, or questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer. Written questions may also be submitted by members to ministers. Written questions and answers are published in the &quot;Official Report&quot;.

The first session of Leaders&#x27; Virtual Question Time, or virtual First Minister&#x27;s Questions, was held on 9 April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Members, constituencies and voting systems ==

Elections for the Scottish Parliament were amongst the first in Britain to use a Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system. The system is a regionalized form of MMP, known as the additional member system (AMS) of proportional representation in Britain. Under the system, voters are given two votes: one for a specific candidate and one for a political party. The one vote is used to elect the local member; the other is grouped with votes from other districts in the region to compose party-proportional representation within the region. (There are no overall levelling seats.)

Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first-past-the-post constituencies and are known as &quot;Constituency MSPs&quot;. Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland&#x27;s population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population. If a constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned by the plurality system.

The remaining 56 MSPs, called &quot;List MSPs&quot;, are elected by an additional members system, which seeks to make the overall results more proportional, countering any distortions in the constituency results. Seven list MSPs are elected from each of eight electoral regions, of which constituencies are sub-divisions:
* Central Scotland
* Glasgow
* Highlands and Islands
* Lothian
* Mid Scotland and Fife
* North East Scotland
* South Scotland
* West Scotland

Each political party draws up a list of candidates standing in each electoral region, from which the list MSPs are elected. Independents can also stand in regions, in which case they are treated as a one-person &quot;list&quot;. Candidates can stand for both a constituency and a list; should they be elected for a constituency, this takes precedence and they are skipped over when apportioning seats from their party list. If a list MSP later leaves the Parliament, the next person on the resigning MSPs&#x27; party&#x27;s list takes the seat. Should a list MSP leave their party, however, they retain their seat and are not replaced. If an independent list MSP leaves the Parliament, they are not replaced and the seat is left vacant until the next general election.

The total number of seats in the Parliament is allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d&#x27;Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated. As the allocation of seats to parties mirrors the popular vote, it is commonplace for the most successful party in the election not to win an outright majority of the seats, thereby requiring them to seek some form and level of cross-party support for their initiatives in government. Nonetheless, the 2011 election saw the SNP become the first–and to date, only–party to win a majority government.

As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. There is no legal prohibition on holding a dual mandate, sitting in both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Commons. However, while several members of the original Scottish Parliament held seats at Westminster, it is now rare; since 2011, only one MSP has served concurrently as an MP for a significant period of time.

== Elections ==


Elections for the Scottish Parliament are for all 129 seats using the Additional Member System. There have been six elections to the Parliament, in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2021.

Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Monarch by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).

The latest Scottish Parliament election was held on Thursday 6 May 2021. Under the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the 2016 election, i.e. in May 2020. This would have coincided with the proposed date of the next United Kingdom general election until an early UK election was called in 2017. In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years. That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021.

Citizens of the UK, Ireland, EU member states and other countries who have permission to enter or remain in the UK (or who do not need such permission), and are resident in Scotland, are entitled to vote. The minimum voting age is 16. This differs from elections to the Westminster parliament, which are restricted to citizens of the UK, Ireland and qualifying Commonwealth citizens, with a minimum voting age of 18. Citizens of other non-Commonwealth EU member states who are resident in Scotland have been entitled to vote in elections to the Scottish Parliament since 1999. Since this date, the franchise has been further extended, with a two-thirds majority being required to make changes to the franchise under the Scotland Act 2016. From the 2016 election, the franchise for Scottish Parliament elections was expanded to include 16- and 17-year-olds. In 2020, the Scottish Parliament voted to extend the right to vote in Scotland to all foreign nationals with leave to remain (limited or indefinite).

== Criticism ==

The resignation of Henry McLeish as First Minister, brought on by an office expenses scandal, generated controversy in the first years of the Scottish Parliament. Various academics have written on how the Scottish Parliament can be improved as a governing institution.

=== West Lothian question ===
As a consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland – whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism. Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election, standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new &quot;veto&quot; over laws only affecting England, known as English votes for English laws. The mechanism was abolished in 2021.

=== Abolition ===
Parties such as the Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and Scottish Unionist Party (SUP) have advocated for abolishing the Scottish Parliament.

<text>Disraeli is a 1929 American sound (All-Talking) pre-Code historical film directed by Alfred E. Green, released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., and adapted by Julien Josephson (screenplay) and De Leon Anthony (titles) from the 1911 play &quot;Disraeli&quot; by Louis N. Parker.

The lobby card states, &quot;Mr. George Arliss in his greatest picture Disraeli&quot;. His performance as British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli won him the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The story revolves around the British plan to buy the Suez Canal and the efforts of two spies to stop it.

As with the original 1911 Broadway play and its 1917 revival, and the 1921 silent film, Arliss&#x27; wife Florence appeared opposite him in the role of Disraeli&#x27;s wife, Mary Anne (Lady Beaconsfield).

==Plot==
In 1874, Disraeli&#x27;s ambitious foreign policy, aimed at extending the British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker.

Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase but he does not tell him about the spies.

Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters.

Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers&#x27; cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Disraeli is elated when he receives the news. However, Myers comes and informs him that his banking house has been driven into bankruptcy by sabotage; the cheque is worthless. Disraeli tells him to keep his situation secret for the moment. When the prying Mrs. Travers arrives, Disraeli allows her to learn of the purchase, and she exultantly admits to her key part in sabotaging Myers.

Thinking quickly, Disraeli summons Probert. Though the banker initially refuses to help, Disraeli forces him to sign a paper giving unlimited credit to Myers by threatening to have Parliament revoke the bank&#x27;s charter. (After Probert leaves, Disraeli confesses to his wife and Clarissa that he was bluffing.) Myers&#x27; solvency is restored, the deal is completed, and as a result of Disraeli&#x27;s success, Queen Victoria can add Empress of India to her other titles. Disraeli is honored when he and his wife, who has recovered from serious illness, attend a reception for the Queen.

==Cast==
*George Arliss as Disraeli
*Doris Lloyd as Mrs. Travers
*David Torrence as Lord Probert
*Joan Bennett as Clarissa
*Florence Arliss as Lady Beaconsfield
*Anthony Bushell as Charles
*Michael Visocoff, S.T. as Count Borsinov

==Production==
&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; was filmed in 1929 and completed before &quot;Disraeli&quot;, but was held out of release until 1930 at the request of Arliss because he felt this film was a better vehicle for his talkie debut. Silent film versions of Parker&#x27;s play, both also titled &quot;Disraeli&quot;, had previously been produced: A 1916 version produced by British company NB Films; and the 1921 version produced by Arliss&#x27; production company, Distinctive Productions, and released by United Artists.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $924,000 domestically and $574,000 foreign.

==Reception==
The film received three Academy Award nominations. George Arliss&#x27; win for Best Actor made him the first British actor to win, the first actor to win for a remake of a previously produced movie, and the first to win for reprising a movie role. The film was also nominated for Outstanding Production, but lost to &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot; Screenwriter Julien Josephson was nominated for Best Writing Achievement in a year when only one award was given for screenwriting. (In most years, he would have been nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.) He lost to Frances Marion for &quot;The Big House&quot;. The film was also awarded the &quot;Photoplay Magazine&quot; Medal of Honor in 1929.

The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; praised the film, saying it &quot;raises a set standard&quot; and especially praising Arliss, who &quot;is the whole picture.&quot; In a retrospective review, Richard Gilliam praised the film for Arliss&#x27;s performance in a &quot;compelling portrait,&quot; though criticizing its sound and set design.

==Preservation status==
The film survives in its 1934 re-release form, when it was converted from its original sound-on-disc technology to sound-on-film. To provide space for the soundtrack, the image was noticeably cropped on the left side, except for the opening credit sequence and end title, which were replaced and are centered. Some pre-Code footage, about three minutes, was also deleted and is believed to be lost.

<text>In mathematics, the Cauchy integral theorem (also known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem) in complex analysis, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy (and Édouard Goursat), is an important statement about line integrals for holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Essentially, it says that if formula_1 is holomorphic in a simply connected domain Ω, then for any simply closed contour formula_2 in Ω, that contour integral is zero. 

formula_3

==Statement==
=== Fundamental theorem for complex line integrals ===
If is a holomorphic function on an open region , and formula_4 is a curve in from formula_5 to formula_6 then,
formula_7

Also, when has a single-valued antiderivative in an open region , then the path integral formula_8 is path independent for all paths in .

==== Formulation on simply connected regions ====

Let formula_9 be a simply connected open set, and let formula_10 be a holomorphic function. Let formula_11 be a smooth closed curve. Then:
formula_12
(The condition that formula_13 be simply connected means that formula_13 has no &quot;holes&quot;, or in other words, that the fundamental group of formula_13 is trivial.)

==== General formulation ====

Let formula_9 be an open set, and let formula_10 be a holomorphic function. Let formula_11 be a smooth closed curve. If formula_4 is homotopic to a constant curve, then:
formula_12
(Recall that a curve is homotopic to a constant curve if there exists a smooth homotopy (within formula_13) from the curve to the constant curve. Intuitively, this means that one can shrink the curve into a point without exiting the space.) The first version is a special case of this because on a simply connected set, every closed curve is homotopic to a constant curve.

==== Main example ====

In both cases, it is important to remember that the curve formula_4 does not surround any &quot;holes&quot; in the domain, or else the theorem does not apply. A famous example is the following curve: 
formula_23
which traces out the unit circle. Here the following integral:
formula_24
is nonzero. The Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since formula_25 is not defined at formula_26. Intuitively, formula_4 surrounds a &quot;hole&quot; in the domain of formula_28, so formula_4 cannot be shrunk to a point without exiting the space. Thus, the theorem does not apply.

==Discussion==
As Édouard Goursat showed, Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem can be proven assuming only that the complex derivative formula_30 exists everywhere in formula_13. This is significant because one can then prove Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula for these functions, and from that deduce these functions are infinitely differentiable.

The condition that formula_13 be simply connected means that formula_13 has no &quot;holes&quot; or, in homotopy terms, that the fundamental group of formula_13 is trivial; for instance, every open disk formula_35, for formula_36, qualifies. The condition is crucial; consider
formula_37
which traces out the unit circle, and then the path integral
formula_38
is nonzero; the Cauchy integral theorem does not apply here since formula_25 is not defined (and is certainly not holomorphic) at formula_26.

One important consequence of the theorem is that path integrals of holomorphic functions on simply connected domains can be computed in a manner familiar from the fundamental theorem of calculus: let formula_13 be a simply connected open subset of formula_42, let formula_10 be a holomorphic function, and let formula_4 be a piecewise continuously differentiable path in formula_13 with start point formula_46 and end point formula_47. If formula_48 is a complex antiderivative of formula_28, then
formula_50

The Cauchy integral theorem is valid with a weaker hypothesis than given above, e.g. given formula_13&quot;,&quot; a simply connected open subset of formula_42, we can weaken the assumptions to formula_28 being holomorphic on formula_13 and continuous on formula_55 and formula_4 a rectifiable simple loop in formula_55.

The Cauchy integral theorem leads to Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula and the residue theorem.

==Proof==
If one assumes that the partial derivatives of a holomorphic function are continuous, the Cauchy integral theorem can be proven as a direct consequence of Green&#x27;s theorem and the fact that the real and imaginary parts of formula_58 must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in the region bounded by and moreover in the open neighborhood of this region. Cauchy provided this proof, but it was later proven by Goursat without requiring techniques from vector calculus, or the continuity of partial derivatives.

We can break the integrand as well as the differential formula_59 into their real and imaginary components:

formula_60
formula_61

In this case we have
formula_62

By Green&#x27;s theorem, we may then replace the integrals around the closed contour formula_4 with an area integral throughout the domain formula_64 that is enclosed by formula_4 as follows:

formula_66
formula_67

But as the real and imaginary parts of a function holomorphic in the domain formula_68 and formula_69 must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations there:
formula_70
formula_71

We therefore find that both integrands (and hence their integrals) are zero

formula_72
formula_73

This gives the desired result
formula_74

<text>The Divorcee is a 1930 American pre-Code drama film written by Nick Grindé, John Meehan, and Zelda Sears, based on the 1929 novel &quot;Ex-Wife&quot; by Ursula Parrott. It was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, and won Best Actress for its star Norma Shearer.

==Plot==
Ted, Jerry, Paul, and Dorothy are part of the New York in-crowd. Jerry&#x27;s decision to marry Ted crushes Paul. He gets drunk and drives, causing an accident that leaves Dorothy&#x27;s face disfigured. Out of guilt, Paul marries Dorothy. Ted and Jerry have been married for three years when, on the evening of their third anniversary, she discovers that he has had a brief affair with another woman. Ted tells Jerry it did not &quot;mean a thing&quot;. Upset, and with Ted away on a business trip, Jerry spends the night with his best friend, Don. Upon Ted&#x27;s return, she tells him that she &quot;balanced our accounts&quot;, withholding Don&#x27;s name.

Ted is outraged, and they argue, which ends with Ted leaving her and the couple filing for a divorce. While Jerry turns to partying to forget her sorrows, Ted becomes an alcoholic. Paul and Jerry run into each other, and she discovers he still loves her and is willing to leave Dorothy, with whom he is in a loveless, resentful marriage, to be with Jerry. They spend two weeks together and plan for a future together.

Dorothy comes to speak with Jerry at her home but Paul is coincidentally meeting Jerry for dinner and the three have an awkward exchange. Despite good arguments from Paul, Dorothy’s desperation not to lose him forces Jerry to reevaluate her decision to leave with Paul. Ultimately, Jerry admits she regrets giving up on her first marriage. She decides to see if her husband will reconcile, disappointing Paul bitterly a second time.

Weeks later, on her third attempt to locate Ted in Paris, Jerry finally finds him at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party. After a polite exchange, Ted expresses his regret at how he reacted before the divorce. Jerry tells Ted her true feelings, and the two kiss at midnight to begin the new year, and presumably their new lives, together.

==Production==
MGM production head Irving Thalberg bought the rights to &quot;Ex-Wife&quot; in the summer of 1929. Thalberg&#x27;s original choice for the role of Jerry was Joan Crawford.

Norma Shearer, Thalberg&#x27;s wife, originally was not in the running for the lead role in &quot;The Divorcee&quot; because it was believed that she did not have enough sex appeal. Only after Shearer arranged a special photo session with independent portrait photographer George Hurrell, and Thalberg saw the result, did he relent and give her the role.

==Release==
Warner Home Video released &quot;The Divorcee&quot; (along with &quot;A Free Soul&quot;, also starring Norma Shearer) as part of a DVD box set of five pre-Code films called the Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Vol. 2 on March 4, 2008.

==Reception==
Norma Shearer won the Academy Award for Best Actress. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing.

<doc id="61193" wikidata="Q275372" url="?curid=61193" title="Externality">
<text>In economics, an externality is an indirect cost (external cost) or benefit (external benefit) to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party&#x27;s (or parties&#x27;) activity. Externalities can be considered as unpriced components that are involved in either consumer or producer consumption. Air pollution from motor vehicles is one example. The cost of air pollution to society is not paid by either the producers or users of motorized transport. Water pollution from mills and factories are another example. All (water) consumers are made worse off by pollution but are not compensated by the market for this damage.

The concept of externality was first developed by Alfred Marshall in the 1890s and achieved broader attention in the works of economist Arthur Pigou in the 1920s. The prototypical example of a negative externality is environmental pollution. Pigou argued that a tax, equal to the marginal damage or marginal external cost, (later called a &quot;Pigouvian tax&quot;) on negative externalities could be used to reduce their incidence to an efficient level. Subsequent thinkers have debated whether it is preferable to tax or to regulate negative externalities, the optimally efficient level of the Pigouvian taxation, and what factors cause or exacerbate negative externalities, such as providing investors in corporations with limited liability for harms committed by the corporation.

Externalities often occur when the production or consumption of a product or service&#x27;s private price equilibrium cannot reflect the true costs or benefits of that product or service for society as a whole. This causes the externality competitive equilibrium to not adhere to the condition of Pareto optimality. Thus, since resources can be better allocated, externalities are an example of market failure.

Externalities can be either positive or negative. Governments and institutions often take actions to internalize externalities, thus market-priced transactions can incorporate all the benefits and costs associated with transactions between economic agents. The most common way this is done is by imposing taxes on the producers of this externality. This is usually done similar to a quote where there is no tax imposed and then once the externality reaches a certain point there is a very high tax imposed. However, since regulators do not always have all the information on the externality it can be difficult to impose the right tax. Once the externality is internalized through imposing a tax the competitive equilibrium is now Pareto optimal.

==History of the concept==
The term &quot;externality&quot; was first coined by the British economist Alfred Marshall in his seminal work, &quot;Principles of Economics,&quot; published in 1890. Marshall introduced the concept to elucidate the effects of production and consumption activities that extend beyond the immediate parties involved in a transaction. Marshall&#x27;s formulation of externalities laid the groundwork for subsequent scholarly inquiry into the broader societal impacts of economic actions. While Marshall provided the initial conceptual framework for externalities, it was Arthur Pigou, a British economist, who further developed the concept in his influential work, &quot;The Economics of Welfare,&quot; published in 1920. Pigou expanded upon Marshall&#x27;s ideas and introduced the concept of &quot;Pigovian taxes&quot; or corrective taxes aimed at internalizing externalities by aligning private costs with social costs. His work emphasized the role of government intervention in addressing market failures resulting from externalities.

Additionally, the American economist Frank Knight contributed to the understanding of externalities through his writings on social costs and benefits in the 1920s and 1930s. Knight&#x27;s work highlighted the inherent challenges in quantifying and mitigating externalities within market systems, underscoring the complexities involved in achieving optimal resource allocation. Throughout the 20th century, the concept of externalities continued to evolve with advancements in economic theory and empirical research. Scholars such as Ronald Coase and Harold Hotelling made significant contributions to the understanding of externalities and their implications for market efficiency and welfare.

The recognition of externalities as a pervasive phenomenon with wide-ranging implications has led to its incorporation into various fields beyond economics, including environmental science, public health, and urban planning. Contemporary debates surrounding issues such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion underscore the enduring relevance of the concept of externalities in addressing pressing societal challenges.

==Definitions==
A negative externality is any difference between the private cost of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social cost. In simple terms, a negative externality is anything that causes an indirect cost to individuals. An example is the toxic gases that are released from industries or mines, these gases cause harm to individuals within the surrounding area and have to bear a cost (indirect cost) to get rid of that harm. Conversely, a positive externality is any difference between the private benefit of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social benefit. A positive externality is anything that causes an indirect benefit to individuals and for which the producer of that positive externality is not compensated. For example, planting trees makes individuals&#x27; property look nicer and it also cleans the surrounding areas.

In microeconomic theory, externalities are factored into competitive equilibrium analysis as the social effect, as opposed to the private market which only factors direct economic effects. The social effect of economic activity is the sum of the indirect (the externalities) and direct factors. The Pareto optimum, therefore, is at the levels in which the social marginal benefit equals the social marginal cost. 

Externalities are the residual effects of economic activity on persons not directly participating in the transaction. The consequences of producer or consumer behaviors that result in external costs or advantages imposed on others are not taken into account by market pricing and can have both positive and negative effects. To further elaborate on this, when expenses associated with the production or use of an item or service are incurred by others but are not accounted for in the market price, this is known as a negative externality. The health and well-being of local populations may be negatively impacted by environmental deterioration resulting from the extraction of natural resources. Comparably, the tranquility of surrounding inhabitants might be disturbed by noise pollution from industry or transit, which lowers their quality of life. On the other hand, positive externalities occur when the activities of producers or consumers benefit other parties in ways that are not accounted for in market exchanges. A prime example of a positive externality is education, as those who invest in it gain knowledge and production for society as a whole in addition to personal profit.

Government involvement is frequently necessary to address externalities. This can be done by enacting laws, Pigovian taxes, or other measures that encourage positive externalities or internalize external costs. Through the integration of externalities into economic research and policy formulation, society may endeavor to get results that optimize aggregate well-being and foster sustainable growth.

==Implications==
A voluntary exchange may reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externalities in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered utility: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a trespass on their health or violating their property rights (by reduced valuation). Thus, an external cost may pose an ethical or political problem. Negative externalities are Pareto inefficient, and since Pareto efficiency underpins the justification for private property, they undermine the whole idea of a market economy. For these reasons, negative externalities are more problematic than positive externalities.

Although positive externalities may appear to be beneficial, while Pareto efficient, they still represent a failure in the market as it results in the production of the good falling under what is optimal for the market. By allowing producers to recognise and attempt to control their externalities production would increase as they would have motivation to do so. With this comes the free rider problem. The free rider problem arises when people overuse a shared resource without doing their part to produce or pay for it. It represents a failure in the market where goods and services are not able to be distributed efficiently, allowing people to take more than what is fair. For example, if a farmer has honeybees a positive externality of owning these bees is that they will also pollinate the surrounding plants. This farmer has a next door neighbour who also benefits from this externality even though he does not have any bees himself. From the perspective of the neighbour he has no incentive to purchase bees himself as he is already benefiting from them at zero cost. But for the farmer, he is missing out on the full benefits of his own bees which he paid for, because they are also being used by his neighbour. 
There are a number of theoretical means of improving overall social utility when negative externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to internalize third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused. But in many cases, internalizing costs or benefits is not feasible, especially if the true monetary values cannot be determined.

Laissez-faire economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman sometimes refer to externalities as &quot;neighborhood effects&quot; or &quot;spillovers&quot;, although externalities are not necessarily minor or localized. Similarly, Ludwig von Mises argues that externalities arise from lack of &quot;clear personal property definition.&quot;

==Examples==

Externalities may arise between producers, between consumers or between consumers and producers. Externalities can be negative when the action of one party imposes costs on another, or positive when the action of one party benefits another.

===Negative===
A negative externality (also called &quot;external cost&quot; or &quot;external diseconomy&quot;) is an economic activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party, not captured by the market price. It can arise either during the production or the consumption of a good or service. Pollution is termed an externality because it imposes costs on people who are &quot;external&quot; to the producer and consumer of the polluting product. Barry Commoner commented on the costs of externalities:
Clearly, we have compiled a record of serious failures in recent technological encounters with the environment. In each case, the new technology was brought into use before the ultimate hazards were known. We have been quick to reap the benefits and slow to comprehend the costs.
Many negative externalities are related to the environmental consequences of production and use. The article on environmental economics also addresses externalities and how they may be addressed in the context of environmental issues.

==== Negative production externalities ====

Examples for negative production externalities include:
* Air pollution from burning fossil fuels. This activity causes damages to crops, materials and (historic) buildings and public health.
* Anthropogenic climate change as a consequence of greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and the rearing of livestock. The &quot;Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change&quot; says &quot;Climate change presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest example of market failure we have ever seen.&quot;
* Water pollution from industrial effluents can harm plants, animals, and humans
* Spam emails during the sending of unsolicited messages by email.
* Government regulation: Any costs required to comply with a law, regulation, or policy, either in terms of time or money, that are not covered by the entity issuing the edict (see also unfunded mandate).
* Noise pollution during the production process, which may be mentally and psychologically disruptive.
* Systemic risk: the risks to the overall economy arising from the risks that the banking system takes. A condition of moral hazard can occur in the absence of well-designed banking regulation, or in the presence of badly designed regulation.
* Negative effects of Industrial farm animal production, including &quot;the increase in the pool of antibiotic-resistant bacteria because of the overuse of antibiotics; air quality problems; the contamination of rivers, streams, and coastal waters with concentrated animal waste; animal welfare problems, mainly as a result of the extremely close quarters in which the animals are housed.&quot;
* The depletion of the stock of fish in the ocean due to overfishing. This is an example of a common property resource, which is vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons in the absence of appropriate environmental governance.
* In the United States, the cost of storing nuclear waste from nuclear plants for more than 1,000 years (over 100,000 for some types of nuclear waste) is, in principle, included in the cost of the electricity the plant produces in the form of a fee paid to the government and held in the nuclear waste superfund, although much of that fund was spent on Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository without producing a solution. Conversely, the costs of managing the long-term risks of disposal of chemicals, which may remain hazardous on similar time scales, is not commonly internalized in prices. The USEPA regulates chemicals for periods ranging from 100 years to a maximum of 10,000 years.

==== Negative consumption externalities ====
Examples of negative consumption externalities include:

* Noise pollution: Sleep deprivation due to a neighbor listening to loud music late at night.
* Antibiotic resistance, caused by increased usage of antibiotics: Individuals do not consider this efficacy cost when making usage decisions. Government policies proposed to preserve future antibiotic effectiveness include educational campaigns, regulation, Pigouvian taxes, and patents.
* Passive smoking: Shared costs of declining health and vitality caused by smoking or alcohol abuse. Here, the &quot;cost&quot; is that of providing minimum social welfare. Economists more frequently attribute this problem to the category of moral hazards, the prospect that parties insulated from risk may behave differently from the way they would if they were fully exposed to the risk. For example, individuals with insurance against automobile theft may be less vigilant about locking their cars, because the negative consequences of automobile theft are (partially) borne by the insurance company.
* Traffic congestion: When more people use public roads, road users experience congestion costs such as more waiting in traffic and longer trip times. Increased road users also increase the likelihood of road accidents.
* Price increases: Consumption by one party causes prices to rise and therefore makes other consumers worse off, perhaps by preventing, reducing or delaying their consumption. These effects are sometimes called &quot;pecuniary externalities&quot; and are distinguished from &quot;real externalities&quot; or &quot;technological externalities&quot;. Pecuniary externalities appear to be externalities, but occur within the market mechanism and are not considered to be a source of market failure or inefficiency, although they may still result in substantial harm to others.
* Weak public infrastructure, air pollution, climate change, work misallocation, resource requirements and land/space requirements as in the externalities of automobiles.

===Positive===
A positive externality (also called &quot;external benefit&quot; or &quot;external economy&quot; or &quot;beneficial externality&quot;) is the positive effect an activity imposes on an unrelated third party. Similar to a negative externality, it can arise either on the production side, or on the consumption side.

A positive production externality occurs when a firm&#x27;s production increases the well-being of others but the firm is uncompensated by those others, while a positive consumption externality occurs when an individual&#x27;s consumption benefits other but the individual is uncompensated by those others.

==== Positive production externalities ====
Examples of positive production externalities
* A beekeeper who keeps the bees for their honey. A side effect or externality associated with such activity is the pollination of surrounding crops by the bees. The value generated by the pollination may be more important than the value of the harvested honey.
* The corporate development of some free software (studied notably by Jean Tirole and Steven Weber)
* Research and development, since much of the economic benefits of research are not captured by the originating firm.
* An industrial company providing first aid classes for employees to increase on the job safety. This may also save lives outside the factory.
* Restored historic buildings may encourage more people to visit the area and patronize nearby businesses.
* A foreign firm that demonstrates up-to-date technologies to local firms and improves their productivity.
* Public transport can increase economic welfare by providing transit services to other economic activities, however the benefits of those other economic activities are not felt by the operator, it can also decrease the negative externalities of increasing road patronage in the absence of a congestion charge.
* The personal cost of an education will have an external benefit to society.

==== Positive consumption externalities ====
Examples of positive consumption externalities include:
* An individual who maintains an attractive house may confer benefits to neighbors in the form of increased market values for their properties. This is an example of a pecuniary externality, because the positive spillover is accounted for in market prices. In this case, house prices in the neighborhood will increase to match the increased real estate value from maintaining their aesthetic. (such as by mowing the lawn, keeping the trash orderly, and getting the house painted) 
* Anything that reduces the rate of transmission of an infectious disease carries positive externalities. This includes vaccines, quarantine, tests and other diagnostic procedures. For airborne infections, it also includes masking. For waterborne diseases, it includes improved sewers and sanitation. (See &quot;herd immunity&quot;)
* Increased education of individuals, as this can lead to broader society benefits in the form of greater economic productivity, a lower unemployment rate, greater household mobility and higher rates of political participation.
* An individual buying a product that is interconnected in a network (e.g., a smartphone). This will increase the usefulness of such phones to other people who have a video cellphone. When each new user of a product increases the value of the same product owned by others, the phenomenon is called a network externality or a network effect. Network externalities often have &quot;tipping points&quot; where, suddenly, the product reaches general acceptance and near-universal usage.
* In an area that does not have a public fire department, homeowners who purchase private fire protection services provide a positive externality to neighboring properties, which are less at risk of the protected neighbor&#x27;s fire spreading to their (unprotected) house.

Collective solutions or public policies are implemented to regulate activities with positive or negative externalities.

===Positional===
The sociological basis of Positional externalities is rooted in the theories of conspicuous consumption and positional goods.
Conspicuous consumption (originally articulated by Veblen, 1899) refers to the consumption of goods or services primarily for the purpose of displaying social status or wealth. In simpler terms, individuals engange in conspicuous consumption to signal their economic standing or to gain social recognition. Positional goods (introduced by Hirsch, 1977) are such goods, whose value is heavily contingent upon how they compare to similar goods owned by others. Their desirability is or derived utility is intrinsically tied to their relative scarcity or exclusivity within a particular social context.

The economic concept of Positional externalities originates from Duesenberry&#x27;s Relative Income Hypothesis. This hypothesis challenges the conventional microeconomic model, as outlined by the Common Pool Resource (CPR) mechanism, which typically assumes that an individual&#x27;s utility derived from consuming a particular good or service remains unaffected by other&#x27;s consumption choices. Instead, Duesenberry posits that individuals gauge the utility of their consumption based on a comparison with other consumption bundles, thus introducing the notion of relative income into economic analysis. Consequently, the consumption of positional goods becomes highly sought after, as it directly impacts one&#x27;s perceived status relative to others in their social circle.

Example: consider a scenario where individuals within a social group vie for the latest luxury cars. As one member acquires a top-of-the-line vehicle, others may feel compelled to upgrade their own cars to preserve their status within the group. This cycle of competitive consumption can result in inefficient allocation of resources and exacerbate income inequality within society.

The consumption of positional goods engenders negative externalities, wherein the acquisition of such goods by one individual diminishes the utility or value of similar goods held by others within the same reference group. This positional externality, can lead to a cascade of overconsumption, as individuals strive to maintain or improve their relative position through excessive spending.

Positional externalities are related, but not similar to Percuniary externalities.

=== Pecuniary ===
Pecuniary externalities are those which affect a third party&#x27;s profit but not their ability to produce or consume. These externalities &quot;occur when new purchases alter the relevant context within which an existing positional good is evaluated.&quot; Robert H. Frank gives the following example:
:if some job candidates begin wearing expensive custom-tailored suits, a side effect of their action is that other candidates become less likely to make favorable impressions on interviewers. From any individual job seeker&#x27;s point of view, the best response might be to match the higher expenditures of others, lest her chances of landing the job fall. But this outcome may be inefficient since when all spend more, each candidate&#x27;s probability of success remains unchanged. All may agree that some form of collective restraint on expenditure would be useful.&quot;

Frank notes that treating positional externalities like other externalities might lead to &quot;intrusive economic and social regulation.&quot; He argues, however, that less intrusive and more efficient means of &quot;limiting the costs of expenditure cascades&quot;—i.e., the hypothesized increase in spending of middle-income families beyond their means &quot;because of indirect effects associated with increased spending by top earners&quot;—exist; one such method is the personal income tax.

The effect that rising demand has on prices in marketplaces with intense competition is a typical illustration of pecuniary externalities. Prices rise in response to shifts in consumer preferences or income levels, which raise demand for a product and benefit suppliers by increasing sales and profits. But other customers who now have to pay more for identical goods might also suffer from this price hike. As a result, consumers who were not involved in the initial transaction suffer a monetary externality in the form of diminished buying power, while producers profit from increased prices. Furthermore, markets with economies of scale or network effects may experience pecuniary externalities. For example, when it comes to network products, like social media platforms or communication networks, the more people use the technology or engage in it, the more valuable the product becomes. Consequently, early adopters could gain financially from positive pecuniary externalities such as enhanced network effects or greater resale prices of related products or services. As a conclusion, pecuniary externalities draw attention to the intricate relationships that exist between market players and the effects that market transactions have on distribution. Comprehending pecuniary externalities is essential for assessing market results and formulating policies that advance economic efficiency and equality, even if they might not have the same direct impact on welfare or resource allocation as traditional externalities.

===Inframarginal===
The concept of inframarginal externalities was introduced by James Buchanan and Craig Stubblebine in 1962. Inframarginal externalities differ from other externalities in that there is no benefit or loss to the marginal consumer. At the relevant margin to the market, the externality does not affect the consumer and does not cause a market inefficiency. The externality only affects at the inframarginal range outside where the market clears. These types of externalities do not cause inefficient allocation of resources and do not require policy action.

===Technological===
Technological externalities directly affect a firm&#x27;s production and therefore, indirectly influence an individual&#x27;s consumption; and the overall impact of society; for example Open-source software or free software development by corporations.

These externalities occur when technology spillovers from the acts of one economic agent impact the production or consumption potential of another agency. Depending on their nature, these spillovers may produce positive or negative externalities. The creation of new technologies that help people in ways that go beyond the original inventor is one instance of positive technical externalities. Let us examine the instance of research and development (R&amp;D) inside the pharmaceutical sector. In addition to possible financial gain, a pharmaceutical company&#x27;s R&amp;D investment in the creation of a new medicine helps society in other ways. Better health outcomes, higher productivity, and lower healthcare expenses for both people and society at large might result from the new medication. Furthermore, the information created via research and development frequently spreads to other businesses and sectors, promoting additional innovation and economic expansion. For example, biotechnology advances could have uses in agriculture, environmental cleanup, or renewable energy, not just in the pharmaceutical industry. However, technical externalities can also take the form of detrimental spillovers that cost society money. Pollution from industrial manufacturing processes is a prime example. Businesses might not be entirely responsible for the expenses of environmental deterioration if they release toxins into the air or rivers as a result of their production processes. Rather, these expenses are shifted to society in the form of decreased quality of life for impacted populations, harm to the environment, and health risks. In addition, workers in some industries may experience job displacement and unemployment as a result of disruptive developments in labor markets brought about by technological improvements. For instance, individuals with outdated skills may lose their jobs as a result of the automation of manufacturing processes through robots and artificial intelligence, causing social and economic unrest in the affected areas.

==Supply and demand diagram==
The usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard supply and demand diagram if the externality can be valued in terms of money. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the &quot;private cost&quot; that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the &quot;true&quot; cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal social cost. Similarly, there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as effective demand in the market.

What curve is added depends on the type of externality that is described, but not whether it is positive or negative. Whenever an externality arises on the production side, there will be two supply curves (private and social cost). However, if the externality arises on the consumption side, there will be two demand curves instead (private and social benefit). This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities.

===External costs===

The graph shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the steel industry is assumed to be selling in a competitive market – before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under laissez-faire). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of air pollution and water pollution. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit &quot;equals&quot; individual benefit.

If the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price Pp and quantity Qp, instead of the more efficient price Ps and quantity Qs. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased &quot;only&quot; as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a free market is &quot;inefficient&quot; since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between Qp and Qs had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming &quot;too much&quot; steel.

This discussion implies that negative externalities (such as pollution) are &quot;more than&quot; merely an ethical problem. The problem is one of the disjunctures between marginal private and social costs that are not solved by the free market. It is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance costs and benefits. This also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. Some &quot;collective&quot; solution is needed, such as a court system to allow parties affected by the pollution to be compensated, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, or economic incentives such as green taxes.

===External benefits===

The graph shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market. The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost &quot;equals&quot; individual cost.

If consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price Pp and quantity Qp as before, instead of the more efficient price Ps and quantity Qs. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an unfettered market is &quot;inefficient&quot; since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying &quot;too few&quot; vaccinations.

The issue of external benefits is related to that of public goods, which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a merit good. Examples include policies to accelerate the introduction of electric vehicles or promote cycling, both of which benefit public health.

==Causes==

Externalities often arise from poorly defined property rights. While property rights to some things, such as objects, land, and money can be easily defined and protected, air, water, and wild animals often flow freely across personal and political borders, making it much more difficult to assign ownership. This incentivizes agents to consume them without paying the full cost, leading to negative externalities. Positive externalities similarly accrue from poorly defined property rights. For example, a person who gets a flu vaccination cannot own part of the herd immunity this confers on society, so they may choose not to be vaccinated.

When resources are managed poorly or there are no well-defined property rights, externalities frequently result, especially when it comes to common pool resources. Due to their rivalrous usage and non-excludability, common pool resources including fisheries, forests, and grazing areas are vulnerable to abuse and deterioration when access is unrestrained. Without clearly defined property rights or efficient management structures, people or organizations may misuse common pool resources without thinking through the long-term effects, which might have detrimental externalities on other users and society at large. This phenomenon—famously referred to by Garrett Hardin as the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;—highlights people&#x27;s propensity to put their immediate self-interests ahead of the sustainability of shared resources. 

Imagine, for instance, that there are no rules or limits in place and that several fishers have access to a single fishing area. In order to maintain their way of life and earn income, fishers are motivated to maximize their catches, which eventually causes overfishing and the depletion of fish populations. Fish populations decrease, and as a result, ecosystems are irritated, and the fishing industry experiences financial losses. These consequences have an adverse effect on subsequent generations and other people who depend on the resource. Nevertheless, the reduction of externalities linked to resources in common pools frequently necessitates the adoption of collaborative management approaches, like community-based management frameworks, tradable permits, and quotas. Communities can lessen the tragedy of the commons and encourage sustainable resource use and conservation for the benefit of current and future generations by establishing property rights or controlling access to shared resources. 

Another common cause of externalities is the presence of transaction costs. Transaction costs are the cost of making an economic trade. These costs prevent economic agents from making exchanges they should be making. The costs of the transaction outweigh the benefit to the agent. When not all mutually beneficial exchanges occur in a market, that market is inefficient. Without transaction costs, agents could freely negotiate and internalize all externalities.

In order to further understand transactional costs, it is crucial to discuss Ronald Coase&#x27;s methodologies. The standard theory of externalities, which holds that internalizing external costs or benefits requires government action through measures like Pigovian taxes or regulations, has been challenged by Coase. He presents the idea of transaction costs, which include the expenses related to reaching, upholding, and keeping an eye on agreements between parties. In the existence of externalities, transaction costs may hinder the effectiveness of private bargaining and result in worse-than-ideal results, according to Coase. He does, however, contend that private parties can establish mutually advantageous arrangements to internalize externalities without the involvement of the government, provided that there are minimal transaction costs and clearly defined property rights. Nevertheless, Coase uses the example of the distribution of property rights between a farmer and a rancher to support his claims. Assume there is a negative externality because the farmer&#x27;s crops are harmed by the rancher&#x27;s livestock. In a society where property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are minimal, the farmer and rancher can work out a voluntary agreement to settle the dispute. For example, the farmer may invest in preventive measures to lessen the impact, or the rancher could pay the farmer back for the harm the cattle caused. Coase&#x27;s approach emphasizes how crucial it is to take property rights and transaction costs into account when managing externalities. He highlights that voluntary transactions between private parties can allow private parties to internalise externalities and that property rights distribution and transaction cost reduction can help make this possible. 

==Possible solutions==
===Solutions in non-market economies===

* In planned economies, production is typically limited only to necessity, which would eliminate externalities created by overproduction. 
* The central planner can decide to create and allocate jobs in industries that work to mitigate externalities, rather than waiting for the market to create a demand for these jobs.

===Solutions in market economies===
There are several general types of solutions to the problem of externalities, including both public- and private-sector resolutions:
* Corporations or partnerships will allow confidential sharing of information among members, reducing the positive externalities that would occur if the information were shared in an economy consisting only of individuals. 
* Pigovian taxes or subsidies intended to redress economic injustices or imbalances.
* Regulation to limit activity that might cause negative externalities
* Government provision of services with positive externalities
* Lawsuits to compensate affected parties for negative externalities
* Voting to cause participants to internalize externalities subject to the conditions of the efficient voter rule.
* Mediation or negotiation between those affected by externalities and those causing them

A Pigovian tax (also called Pigouvian tax, after economist Arthur C. Pigou) is a tax imposed that is equal in value to the negative externality. In order to fully correct the negative externality, the per unit tax should equal the marginal external cost. The result is that the market outcome would be reduced to the efficient amount. A side effect is that revenue is raised for the government, reducing the amount of distortionary taxes that the government must impose elsewhere. Governments justify the use of Pigovian taxes saying that these taxes help the market reach an efficient outcome because this tax bridges the gap between marginal social costs and marginal private costs.

Some arguments against Pigovian taxes say that the tax does not account for all the transfers and regulations involved with an externality. In other words, the tax only considers the amount of externality produced. Another argument against the tax is that it does not take private property into consideration. Under the Pigovian system, one firm, for example, can be taxed more than another firm, even though the other firm is actually producing greater amounts of the negative externality.

Further arguments against Pigou disagree with his assumption every externality has someone at fault or responsible for the damages. Coase argues that externalities are reciprocal in nature. Both parties must be present for an externality to exist. He uses the example of two neighbors. One neighbor possesses a fireplace, and often lights fires in his house without issue. Then one day, the other neighbor builds a wall that prevents the smoke from escaping and sends it back into the fire-building neighbor’s home. This illustrates the reciprocal nature of externalities. Without the wall, the smoke would not be a problem, but without the fire, the smoke would not exist to cause problems in the first place. Coase also takes issue with Pigou’s assumption of a “benevolent despot” government. Pigou assumes the government’s role is to see the external costs or benefits of a transaction and assign an appropriate tax or subsidy. Coase argues that the government faces costs and benefits just like any other economic agent, so other factors play into its decision-making.

However, the most common type of solution is a tacit agreement through the political process. Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests. Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm. These laws and regulations can take the form of &quot;command and control&quot; regulation (such as enforcing standards and limiting process variables), or environmental pricing reform (such as ecotaxes or other Pigovian taxes, tradable pollution permits or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.

Government intervention might not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action.

The use of taxes and subsidies in solving the problem of externalities
Correction tax, respectively subsidy, means essentially any mechanism that increases, respectively decreases, the costs (and thus price) associated with the activities of an individual or company.

The private-sector may sometimes be able to drive society to the socially optimal resolution. Ronald Coase argued that an efficient outcome can sometimes be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political argument that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result.

This result, often known as the Coase theorem, requires that
* Property rights be well-defined
* People act rationally
* Transaction costs be minimal (costless bargaining)
* Complete information
If all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. The second part of the Coase theorem asserts that, when these conditions hold, whoever holds the property rights, a Pareto efficient outcome will be reached through bargaining.

This theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered &quot;acceptable&quot;) while paying for the regulation and enforcement with taxes. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.

In some cases, the Coase theorem is relevant. For example, if a logger is planning to clear-cut a forest in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby resort, the resort-owner and the logger could, in theory, get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut – or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase&#x27;s perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone, or in any example in which there are not well-defined and enforceable property rights; the question of &quot;who&quot; owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).

However, the Coase theorem is difficult to implement because Coase does not offer a negotiation method. Moreover, Coasian solutions are unlikely to be reached due to the possibility of running into the assignment problem, the holdout problem, the free-rider problem, or transaction costs. Additionally, firms could potentially bribe each other since there is little to no government interaction under the Coase theorem. For example, if one oil firm has a high pollution rate and its neighboring firm is bothered by the pollution, then the latter firm may move depending on incentives. Thus, if the oil firm were to bribe the second firm, the first oil firm would suffer no negative consequences because the government would not know about the bribing.

In a dynamic setup, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have shown that the impossibility to rule out Coasean bargaining tomorrow may actually justify Pigouvian intervention today. To see this, note that unrestrained bargaining in the future may lead to an underinvestment problem (the so-called hold-up problem). Specifically, when investments are relationship-specific and non-contractible, then insufficient investments will be made when it is anticipated that parts of the investments’ returns will go to the trading partner in future negotiations (see Hart and Moore, 1988). Hence, Pigouvian taxation can be welfare-improving precisely because Coasean bargaining will take place in the future. Antràs and Staiger (2012) make a related point in the context of international trade.

Kenneth Arrow suggests another private solution to the externality problem. He believes setting up a market for the externality is the answer. For example, suppose a firm produces pollution that harms another firm. A competitive market for the right to pollute may allow for an efficient outcome. Firms could bid the price they are willing to pay for the amount they want to pollute, and then have the right to pollute that amount without penalty. This would allow firms to pollute at the amount where the marginal cost of polluting equals the marginal benefit of another unit of pollution, thus leading to efficiency.

Frank Knight also argued against government intervention as the solution to externalities. He proposed that externalities could be internalized with privatization of the relevant markets. He uses the example of road congestion to make his point. Congestion could be solved through the taxation of public roads. Knight shows that government intervention is unnecessary if roads were privately owned instead. If roads were privately owned, their owners could set tolls that would reduce traffic and thus congestion to an efficient level. This argument forms the basis of the traffic equilibrium. This argument supposes that two points are connected by two different highways. One highway is in poor condition, but is wide enough to fit all traffic that desires to use it. The other is a much better road, but has limited capacity. Knight argues that, if a large number of vehicles operate between the two destinations and have freedom to choose between the routes, they will distribute themselves in proportions such that the cost per unit of transportation will be the same for every truck on both highways. This is true because as more trucks use the narrow road, congestion develops and as congestion increases it becomes equally profitable to use the poorer highway. This solves the externality issue without requiring any government tax or regulations.

===Solutions to greenhouse gas emission externalities===
The negative effect of carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases produced in production exacerbate the numerous environmental and human impacts of anthropogenic climate change. These negative effects are not reflected in the cost of producing, nor in the market price of the final goods. There are many public and private solutions proposed to combat this externality

====Emissions fee====
An emissions fee, or carbon tax, is a tax levied on each unit of pollution produced in the production of a good or service. The tax incentivised producers to either lower their production levels or to undertake abatement activities that reduce emissions by switching to cleaner technology or inputs.

====Cap-and-trade systems====
The cap-and-trade system enables the efficient level of pollution (determined by the government) to be achieved by setting a total quantity of emissions and issuing tradable permits to polluting firms, allowing them to pollute a certain share of the permissible level. Permits will be traded from firms that have low abatement costs to firms with higher abatement costs and therefore the system is both cost-effective and cost-efficient. The cap and trade system has some practical advantages over an emissions fee such as the fact that:
1. it reduces uncertainty about the ultimate pollution level. 
2. If firms are profit maximizing, they will utilize cost-minimizing technology to attain the standard which is efficient for individual firms and provides incentives to the research and development market to innovate. 
3. The market price of pollution rights would keep pace with the price level while the economy experiences inflation.

The emissions fee and cap and trade systems are both incentive-based approaches to solving a negative externality problem.

====Command-and-control regulations====
Command-and-control regulations act as an alternative to the incentive-based approach. They require a set quantity of pollution reduction and can take the form of either a technology standard or a performance standard. A technology standard requires pollution producing firms to use specified technology. While it may reduce the pollution, it is not cost-effective and stifles innovation by incentivising research and development for technology that would work better than the mandated one. Performance standards set emissions goals for each polluting firm. The free choice of the firm to determine how to reach the desired emissions level makes this option slightly more efficient than the technology standard, however, it is not as cost-effective as the cap-and-trade system since the burden of emissions reduction cannot be shifted to firms with lower abatement.

==== Scientific calculation of external costs ====

A 2020 scientific analysis of external climate costs of foods indicates that external greenhouse gas costs are typically highest for animal-based products – conventional and organic to about the same extent within that ecosystem-subdomain – followed by conventional dairy products and lowest for organic plant-based foods and concludes that contemporary monetary evaluations are &quot;inadequate&quot; and that policy-making that lead to reductions of these costs to be possible, appropriate and urgent.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41467-020-19474-6&quot;&gt; Available under CC BY 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Ecological economics criticizes the concept of externality because there is not enough system thinking and integration of different sciences in the concept.
Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually cancelling &quot;externalities&quot; is not warranted. Joan Martinez Alier, for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet. The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by Fred Pearce and by the Stern Report (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash).

Concerning these externalities, some, like the eco-businessman Paul Hawken, argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations. These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot;.

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning. Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by Karl William Kapp argues that the concept of &quot;externality&quot; is a misnomer. In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits. Charles Eisenstein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive. Social ecological economist Clive Spash argues that externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system. Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed &#x27;externalities&#x27;. This is precisely why heterodox economists argue for a heterodox theory of social costs to effectively prevent the problem through the precautionary principle.

<text>A Prairie Home Companion is a weekly radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician Chris Thile took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed &quot;Live from Here&quot; and ran until 2020. &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other U.S. cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor&#x27;s wry storytelling segment, &quot;News from Lake Wobegon,&quot; was the show&#x27;s best-known feature during his long tenure.

Distributed by Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s distribution arm, American Public Media, &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; was heard on 690 public radio stations in the United States at its peak in spring 2015 and reached an audience of four million U.S. listeners each week. The show borrowed its name from a radio program in existence in 1969 that was named after the Prairie Home Cemetery near Concordia College, in Moorhead, Minnesota. It inspired a 2006 film of the same name, written by and featuring Keillor.

==History==
=== Origin ===
The Saturday-evening show was a partial spin-off of &quot;A Prairie Home Morning Show&quot; with Keillor and Tom Keith, which ran from 6 to 9 a.m. on Minnesota Public Radio and was continued by Keith and Dale Connelly for many years as &quot;The Morning Show&quot;.

After researching the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; took place on Minnesota Public Radio. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of Macalester College. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by Butch Thompson, who became house pianist. Thompson stayed with the program until 1986 and frequently performed on the show until its 2016 conclusion.

In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which Minnesota Public Radio purchased and renovated in 1986 and renamed the Fitzgerald Theater in 1994. This is the same venue the program used to the end.

&quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; began national distribution in May 1980. Because National Public Radio (NPR) rejected the show due to its president Frank Mankiewicz perceiving the show as too expensive and insulting towards small towns, the show was initially distributed through a public radio satellite system that had been completed by June 1980 and allowed NPR member stations to distribute programs outside the NPR network. In 1983, Minnesota Public Radio president William Kling started a new company to distribute &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; called American Public Radio, which would later be renamed Public Radio International in 1994.

=== Hiatus ===
The show went off the air in 1987, with a &quot;final performance&quot; on June 13, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. For a brief time, the show was replaced—both on the air and in the World Theater—by &quot;Good Evening&quot;, hosted by Noah Adams, a live variety show designed by ex-&quot;Prairie Home&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; staffers to retain the audience Keillor had cultivated over the years. However, many stations opted instead to continue &quot;APHC&quot; repeats in its traditional Saturday time slot.

In 1989, Keillor returned to radio with &quot;The American Radio Company of the Air&quot; (renamed &quot;Garrison Keillor&#x27;s American Radio Company&quot; in its second season), broadcast originally from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The new program featured a broadly similar format to &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, with sketches and musical guests reflecting a more New York sensibility, rather than the country and folk music predominant in &quot;APHC&quot;. Also, while Keillor sang and delivered a regular monologue on &quot;American Radio Company&quot;, Lake Wobegon was initially downplayed, as he felt it was &quot;cruel&quot; to talk to a Brooklyn audience about life in a small town. During this period, Keillor revived the full &quot;APHC&quot; format only for &quot;annual farewell performances.&quot; In the fall of 1992, Keillor returned to the Fitzgerald Theater with &quot;ARC&quot; for the majority of the season, with Lake Wobegon and other &quot;APHC&quot; elements gradually but unmistakably returning to prominence.

=== Return to broadcast ===

The following year, on October 2, 1993, the program officially reverted to the &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; name and format.

The show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with Public Radio International. Later, its distributor was Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s distribution unit, American Public Media.

===Guest hosts===

Singer Sara Watkins of San Diego, California, hosted the January 15, 2011, broadcast. The format was the same, but Keillor appeared only as a guest actor and to deliver the &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot;. He claimed he had taken the chance to see the show being performed for himself. It was reported that this could be the beginning of a trend toward Keillor&#x27;s eventual retirement, and on March 16, 2011, Keillor stated in an interview with the AARP that he would most likely retire from the show by the time he turned 70 in August 2012.

In September 2011, Keillor told &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; that his last broadcast would be recorded in &quot;early July 2013&quot;, and that instead of a permanent replacement host, there would be &quot;a whole group of people. A rotation of hosts&quot;, but in December 2011 Keillor said he had changed his mind and reconsidered his plans to retire because he still enjoyed hosting the show.

On February 7 and 14, 2015, mandolinist Chris Thile hosted the show (like Sara Watkins, a member of Nickel Creek). As when Watkins hosted, the format remained largely unchanged, but Keillor did not make an appearance. Instead, storyteller Tristan Jimerson appeared on the February 7 show and comedienne/storyteller Elna Baker on the February 14 show. Thile&#x27;s band Punch Brothers performed on the February 7 show. Thile was named permanent host of the show in late June 2015, and took over as permanent host on October 15, 2016.

=== Keillor&#x27;s departure ===
When Keillor formally announced his departure from &quot;APHC&quot; at the show&#x27;s airing on July 21, 2015, he indicated that Thile would succeed him as permanent host in 2016. Keillor recorded his final regular episode as host live at the Hollywood Bowl before an audience of 18,000, on July 1, 2016; it was aired on the following day. The episode was titled , and was a vocal duet show of &quot;time-honored American ballads, British Invasion romps, country-western weepers, and Broadway classics,&quot; guest-starring Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O&#x27;Donovan, Heather Masse, and Christine DiGiallonardo, alongside the &quot;Royal Academy of Radio Actors,&quot; Tim Russell, Sue Scott, and Fred Newman, and the &quot;APHC&quot; band, with music director and pianist Rich Dworsky and Bernie Dresel (drums), Larry Kohut (bass), Richard Kriehn (mandolin and fiddle), and Chris Siebold (guitar).

Barack Obama recorded a telephone call into the show, which ran on the Saturday broadcast, and Keillor performed his last &quot;Lives of the Cowboys&quot; sketch as regular host, with regulars Scott, Russell, and Newman, and including a series of duets with the guests Masse, O&#x27;Donovan, Jarosz, DiGiallonardo, and Watkins. 

While the July 2 Hollywood Bowl performance was the last regular episode of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, Garrison Keillor also hosted a final live performance titled &quot;The Minnesota Show&quot; at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2016, including the last-ever &quot;Guy Noir&quot; and &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot; segments.

Since his departure from the radio show, Keillor has continued to tour with his stage show also called &quot;A Prairie Home Companion.&quot;

===Name change===
On November 29, 2017, Minnesota Public Radio terminated its contract with Keillor because of &quot;allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.&quot; Because Keillor still owned artistic rights and the trademark to the show&#x27;s name, MPR also announced that it would change the name. After two episodes under the placeholder name &quot;The Show with Chris Thile&quot;, the new title was announced as &quot;Live from Here&quot; live on the December 16, 2017, broadcast of the show. MPR also announced it would cease distributing reruns of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; featuring Keillor. Keillor stated he had been &quot;fired&quot; from MPR, but he had technically not been employed by MPR/APM since 2002, working instead as an independent contractor. When it was announced in 2019 that &quot;Live from Here&quot; was going to be based in and broadcast out of New York City, many Minnesotan fans publicly complained that the radio show was losing its Midwestern style. &quot;Live from Here&quot; was canceled in 2020.

===Broadcast archives===

On April 13, 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to reinstate the free online archives of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;. The portion of the PrairieHome.org website containing the archives was restored later in the year.

==Format==
From the show&#x27;s inception until 1987, its theme song was Hank Snow&#x27;s hit &quot;Hello Love&quot;. After 1987, each show has opened with Spencer Williams&#x27; composition &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot; as the theme song, with lyrics by Garrison Keillor that were written especially for &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

Music was a main feature of the program; the show was a significant outlet for American folk music of many genres, especially country, bluegrass, blues, and gospel, but it also had guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera, and music from a number of different countries. The country musician and former record company executive Chet Atkins appeared on the show many times, as did singer-songwriters Mark Knopfler (lead guitarist and frontman of the bands Dire Straits and the Notting Hillbillies) and Jeff Lang. Folk/gospel duo Robin and Linda Williams had been regular guests since 1976, and often join Keillor and another female performer, often Jearlyn Steele, to form &quot;The Hopeful Gospel Quartet&quot;. Peter Ostroushko, Greg Brown, Jean Redpath, and Prudence Johnson, among others, were recurring guests on the program between 1974 and 1987. The Wailin&#x27; Jennys and Andra Suchy were also recurring guests, and when the show travelled, Keillor generally featured local musicians and acts.

Greetings from members of the audience to friends and family at home (frequently humorous) were read each week by Keillor just after the show&#x27;s intermission, at the top of the second hour. Birthdays and anniversaries of famous composers and musicians were also observed.

===Features===

Keillor and the ensemble performed comedy skits. Notable skits and characters often recur, such as the satirical &quot;Guy Noir, Private Eye&quot;, which parodied film noir and radio dramas. Guy Noir&#x27;s popularity was such that the first few notes of the theme or the first lines of the announcer&#x27;s introduction (&quot;A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets ...&quot;) often drew applause and cheers from the audience. Also regularly featured were the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, &quot;The Lives of the Cowboys&quot;.

===News from Lake Wobegon===
One of the show&#x27;s best-known features was Keillor&#x27;s &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot;, a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from his fictitious hometown of Lake Wobegon, &quot;the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve ... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average&quot;. The opening words of the monologue usually did not change: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the prairie.&quot; Keillor often poked fun at central Minnesota&#x27;s large Scandinavian-American and German-American communities, and many of his fictional characters have names that reflect this. The &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot; did not have a set structure, but featured recurring characters and places such as the Chatterbox Café, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Ingqvist of the Lake Wobegon Lutheran Church and his successor Pastor Liz, Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Roman Catholic Church (a parody of Our Mother of Perpetual Help), the Lake Wobegon Whippets sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby &quot;Norwegian bachelor farmers&quot;.

In-jokes are sprinkled through the show, such as &quot;Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin&quot;, a made-up word that&#x27;s been used both for places and for people&#x27;s names. The components of this made-up word are portions of Native American place names in the New England region of the United States, most of them in Maine (i.e.: Piscataqua, Passamaquoddy, and Androscoggin).

=== Annual &quot;Joke Show&quot; ===
Once a year the program featured a special &quot;joke show&quot;, which generally included the Lake Wobegon monologue and musical acts, but with other skits replaced by the performers taking turns telling jokes. Humorists such as Paula Poundstone and Roy Blount Jr. often made guest appearances on those shows, and listeners and audience members were encouraged to submit jokes for use on the air. Portions of such shows were incorporated into a book and CDs.

===Fictional sponsors===

The show creates advertisements for fictional products, performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show acknowledges its actual underwriters at the beginning, end, and middle (break) of the show.

&quot;Prairie Home&quot;″s most prominent &quot;sponsor&quot; is the fictitious &quot;Powdermilk Biscuits&quot;. Before he and the band performed the product&#x27;s jingle every week (&quot;Has your family tried &#x27;em, Powdermilk?&quot;), Garrison Keillor would extol Powdermilk&#x27;s virtues in this way:

Among its other &quot;sponsors&quot;, Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie (and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling) has been prominent, with ads featuring the Bebop-A-Reebop jingle, performed to the tune of &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread&quot;:

The jingle is usually sung after a bombastic, sound-effect-enhanced tale of woe, and is immediately followed by Keillor asking, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t this be a great time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and humiliation out of your mouth quite like Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie.&quot;

Another prominent &quot;sponsor&quot; is Bertha&#x27;s Kitty Boutique, whose locations in the fictional &quot;Dales&quot; shopping centers (&quot;Roy &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, Airedale, Teasdale, Clydesdale, Chippendale, Mondale, and all the other fine shopping centers&quot;) allude to various real people and things, while also parodying Minnesota&#x27;s similarly named real-life malls (Southdale, Brookdale, Rosedale, and Ridgedale). Additionally, there is The Catchup Advisory Board—its name a portmanteau of the common &quot;catsup&quot; and &quot;ketchup&quot; spellings—which has the tagline &quot;Catchup: For the good times.&quot;

Other &quot;sponsors&quot; have included:

* Café Boeuf, a fictionally and exceptionally snobbish French restaurant in Lake Wobegon &quot;where the elite meet to eat&quot;
* Guy&#x27;s Shoes—purveyor of Guy&#x27;s All-Star Shoes, the Converse-like sponsor of the Shoe Band, which specializes in steel-toed shoes (&quot;so even when you strike out &quot;[ping!]&quot; you can walk away&quot;)
* The American Duct Tape Council
* The American Society of Sound Effects Specialists
* Bob&#x27;s Bank (&quot;Save at the sign of the sock&quot;, &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot;)
* The Bon Marché Beauty Salon
* Earl&#x27;s Academy of Accents
* The Fearmonger&#x27;s Shop, a purveyor of security devices for the perpetually paranoid
* The Federation of Associated Organizations
* Fred Farrell Animal Calls
* Fritz Electronics (&quot;Where everything you need is on the Fritz&quot;; a possible parody of Muntz Electronics)
* Jack&#x27;s Auto Repair and Jack&#x27;s Warm Car Service (&quot;All tracks lead to Jack&#x27;s, where the bright shining lights show you the way to complete satisfaction&quot;)
* Marvin and Mavis Smiley seasonal bluegrass albums
* Midwestern Discount Store
* Monback Moving &amp; Storage, in which a mover can be heard directing a moving truck to back up (hence the name) while the truck&#x27;s backup alarm can be heard beeping (&quot;Monback ... Monback ... &quot;[crunch]&quot; That&#x27;s good.&quot;)
* Mournful Oatmeal, a parody of Quaker Oats (&quot;Calvinism in a box&quot;)
* The Professional Organization of English Majors (P.O.E.M.)
* Ralph&#x27;s Pretty Good Grocery (&quot;If you can&#x27;t find it at Ralph&#x27;s, you can darn well get along without it&quot;)
* Raw Bits breakfast cereal, a cereal for a select small target audience (&quot;Oat hulls and wheat chaff—it&#x27;s not for everybody&quot;)
* Rent-a-Raptor (&quot;Rid your home of mice, rabbits, squirrels, and pesky boyfriends&quot;)
* The Sidetrack Tap
In addition, the recurring segment &quot;The Lives of the Cowboys&quot; featured its own Western-themed sponsors, including Prairie Dog Granola Bars (&quot;healthier than chewing tobacco and you don&#x27;t have to spit&quot;) and Cowboy Toothpicks (&quot;the toothpick that&#x27;s guaranteed not to splinter&quot;).

===Alterations===
This was primarily a radio comedy program. Some of it was devoted to the sentimental. Other stories put together by Keillor and others, depicted tragedies. Occasionally political satire could be found in some episodes. Other occasions marked current events.

When Minnesota leader Paul Wellstone&#x27;s end came in a 2002 airplane crash, Mr. Keillor rewrote a portion of that program revolving around Senator Wellstone.

Mentions during a 2004 show regarded the passing of President Reagan.

==Cast==

===Actors===
Regularly appearing actors included Tim Russell (beginning in 1994) and Sue Scott (beginning in 1989).

He retired doing his weekday morning radio show in 2008, but continued performing on Prairie Home broadcasts from the Fitzgerald Theater and other regional locations. He continued working on A Prairie home Companion until his death in 2011. Newman eventually took over full-time after Keith passed away.

==Film==

Released on June 9, 2006, &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; is a film about &quot;a dying radio show that bears striking similarities to &#x27;A Prairie Home Companion,&#x27;&quot; with the actual &quot;APHC&quot; home venue, the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul chosen to serve &quot;as set piece, soundstage and framing device&quot;. The film was written by Garrison Keillor and directed by Robert Altman, and shot digitally, with camera by Altman&#x27;s son, Robert Altman Jr.; the film stars Keillor, Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, John C.

The film depicts the titular radio program&#x27;s behind-the-scenes activities, and the relational dynamics within the cast over its anticipated, imminent cancellation. The antagonist, Axeman, &quot;who has come to shut the show down&quot;, is played by Tommy Lee Jones. As described in a 2005 on-set piece by David Carr for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the film set&#x27;s atmosphere had The film, which makes no reference to Lake Wobegon, is of feature length, with its financing provided by GreeneStreet Films, River Road Entertainment, and local Minnesota sources.

<text>Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) is a public radio network for the state of Minnesota. With its three services, News &amp; Information, YourClassical MPR and The Current, MPR operates a 46-station regional radio network in the upper Midwest.

MPR has won more than 875 journalism awards, including the Peabody Award, both the RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting award of the same name, and the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award. As of September 2011, MPR was tied with WNYC for most listener support for a public radio network, and had the highest level of recurring monthly donors of any public radio network in the nation.

MPR also produces and distributes national public radio programming via American Public Media.

== History ==
Minnesota Public Radio began on January 22, 1967, when KSJR-FM first signed on from the campus of Saint John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, just outside St. Cloud. Colman Barry, then president of Saint John&#x27;s, saw promise in the then relatively new technology of FM radio, and believed radio was an appropriate extension of Saint John&#x27;s cultural and artistic functions to the broader community. He hired a 23-year-old graduate of St. John&#x27;s, William H. Kling, as director of broadcasting.

The network began more or less out of necessity. Shortly after KSJR signed on, it became apparent that St. Cloud and surrounding Stearns County did not have enough listeners for the station to be viable. Kling more than tripled KSJR&#x27;s power in hopes of reaching the Twin Cities, but that only provided grade B coverage to Minneapolis and the western portion of the metro, and completely missed St. Paul and the east. Realizing that the station needed to cover the Twin Cities to have a realistic chance of survival, St. John&#x27;s started KSJN, a low-powered repeater station for the Twin Cities, in 1968. The operation was awash in debt, and by 1969, St. John&#x27;s realized it did not have adequate financial or personnel resources to operate a full-fledged noncommercial radio station. With Barry&#x27;s support, Saint John&#x27;s transferred KSJR/KSJN&#x27;s assets to a community corporation, St. John&#x27;s University Broadcasting. This corporation later changed its name to Minnesota Educational Radio, and finally Minnesota Public Radio. Kling led MPR as president and CEO for 44 years before retiring in 2011.

MPR was a charter member of National Public Radio in 1971, and had helped lay the groundwork for forming that organization during 1969 and 1970. In 1971, operations moved from Collegeville to St. Paul, funded in part with a news programming &quot;demonstration&quot; grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. New studios were built and KSJN became the flagship station. In the 1970s, additional stations were added across Minnesota. During this period KSJN&#x27;s news department won numerous regional and national awards and became one of the region&#x27;s most highly regarded news operations.

In 1974, MPR began live broadcasting of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, one of the best-known programs on public radio, from the Park Square Theatre in Saint Paul. In the program&#x27;s early days, members of the production staff worked hard to fill the theatre seats, sometimes bringing in radio station staff and urging passersby to come into the theatre from the street. In 1980, MPR originated the Peabody Award-winning classical music show &quot;Saint Paul Sunday&quot;, which went national via syndication in 1981.

MPR assisted in 1983 with the formation of American Public Radio, now known as Public Radio International, which merged with Public Radio Exchange in 2019.

Originally, MPR played a mix of classical music and NPR news/talk programming. But as NPR expanded its offerings, Kling made plans to split MPR into separate classical and news/talk networks. To that end, MPR sought to buy a second FM frequency in the Twin Cities from the late 1970s onward. As a fallback, in 1980 it bought WLOL (AM 1330), one of Minnesota&#x27;s oldest stations, and changed its calls to KSJN (AM), a simulcast of KSJN-FM. In 1989, AM 1330 changed its calls to KNOW and began airing an expanded lineup of NPR programming. In 1991, MPR bought WLOL-FM, AM 1330&#x27;s former FM sister, allowing it to finally split its services into two networks. The KNOW call letters and intellectual unit, including the NPR news and talk format, moved to KSJN&#x27;s old frequency of 91.1. The KSJN calls moved to WLOL-FM&#x27;s former frequency of 99.5, which began playing classical music full-time.

MPR acquired Marketplace Productions, which produces &quot;Marketplace&quot;, &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot; and &quot;Marketplace Money&quot;, from studios in Los Angeles, in association with the University of Southern California, in 2000. The same year, MPR founded Southern California Public Radio, which entered into a public service operating agreement with Pasadena City College to run KPCC in Pasadena, California. In 2004, MPR began distributing its own shows through American Public Media, leaving PRI; APM was the third radio network in the U.S. to receive founding support from MPR, probably an unmatched record for an American radio station or network.

In 2004, MPR announced it would buy WCAL (89.3 FM), the classical music station operated by St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. WCAL (and a repeater station, KMSE in Rochester), were sold in a deal valued at $10.5 million, which the Federal Communications Commission approved in 2004. The next year, following the acquisition by MPR, WCAL changed its call letters to KCMP and was transformed into MPR&#x27;s third service, &quot;The Current&quot;.

In 2008, a WCAL advocacy group took St. Olaf College to court for breach of trust in selling the radio station. (A June 2008 judge&#x27;s opinion described the station as a charitable trust and therefore not the college&#x27;s property to freely dispose of. MPR&#x27;s General Counsel and three attorneys took part in the proceedings. In 2009 a court found in favor of MPR, ruling that the statute of limitations on the matter had expired, nullifying the advocacy group&#x27;s standing.)

Today, MPR serves a regional audience of one million listeners through 43 stations presenting three broadcast network services.

Original materials from Minnesota Public Radio have been contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.

== Services ==

With the addition of later stations, MPR originally offered a mix of classical music and NPR news/talk programming on a single service. Beginning in 1991, MPR&#x27;s programming split in two, forming separate news and classical music services (although one station in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan still carries a combination of the two). The 2005 acquisition of WCAL in Northfield, Minnesota, which covers the Minneapolis–St. Paul and Rochester areas, provided the opportunity to launch another music service, &quot;The Current.&quot; This third service has gradually expanded to most of southeastern Minnesota.

=== MPR News ===
MPR&#x27;s news and information service includes a mix of locally produced programs and national/international shows. The flagship station is KNOW-FM (91.1 FM) in the Twin Cities.

The MPR newsroom has garnered international acclaim, earning the inaugural Knight News Innovation EPpy Award in 2008. The newsroom is known for its Public Insight Network, a database of citizen sources who contribute their expertise on a wide array of topics. The Public Insight Network grew to 140,000 sources in 2011 and partners with other news media, journalism schools, foundations and community groups.

As of 2022, 24 full-power stations carry MPR&#x27;s News and Information service and various translator signals around the state offer additional coverage.

MPRNews.org is a nonprofit news website maintained by MPR. This online news source covers issues that affect the state including politics, business, education, health, environment, and the economy. MPR News offers headline news, video, blogs, audio, and multiple ways for readers to become involved in the news-making process.

=== YourClassical MPR===
MPR&#x27;s classical music network is carried on 18 full-power stations and various translators offer additional coverage. The flagship station is KSJN (99.5 FM), in the Twin Cities. In April 2021, the station rebranded as &quot;YourClassical MPR&quot;, aligning it with the umbrella branding used for American Public Media&#x27;s digital classical music platforms and nationally distributed programming. Most of the network&#x27;s schedule is a simulcast of APM&#x27;s Classical 24 network, although statewide morning and afternoon shows air Monday through Friday and the network airs various specials and live broadcasts. The HD 2 signal of KSJN-FM offers a 24-hour feed of the Classical 24 network.

On September 10, 2020, Garrett McQueen, the host of Classical 24&#x27;s Music Through the Night and MPR&#x27;s only African-American classical music host, was terminated by American Public Media for &quot;not following programming guidelines.&quot; According to McQueen, he was &quot;given two warnings—one of which was about his need to improve communication and the other warning was for switching out scheduled music to play pieces he felt were more appropriate to the moment and more diverse.&quot;

=== The Current ===

MPR&#x27;s third service, The Current, debuted on January 24, 2005, and airs an adult album alternative format.

Several people on The Current&#x27;s initial staff are well known in the area for previous work at stations that highlight music from Minnesota and the Upper Midwest. Many of the staffers and on-air personalities came from other similar stations, such as the University of Minnesota&#x27;s KUOM, community-oriented KFAI, and commercial alternative rock outlets REV 105 and Cincinnati, Ohio&#x27;s WOXY.com.

Programming on The Current is mostly locally produced. The flagship station is KCMP (89.3 FM), licensed to Northfield on the southeastern periphery of the Twin Cities, though the signal covers most of the metro area. A lower-power station, KMSE (88.7 FM), serves Rochester and southeastern Minnesota, KZIO (104.3 FM) serves the Duluth area, and translators offer additional coverage in other parts of the state. The service is also carried as an HD service on several of MPR&#x27;s full power stations. KPCC, the NPR affiliate in Los Angeles operated by MPR&#x27;s parent company, APM, carries The Current on its HD 2 signal. The Current also streams online in a variety of formats.

=== Additional services ===
Minnesota Public Radio also programs several other music services, all available online, with a few offered on HD Radio in the Twin Cities area.

Carbon Sound is the newest MPR service, focused on R&amp;B music and Black artists. In addition to streaming online, it is available on the HD 2 subchannel of KCMP in the Twin Cities.

Local Current is a service programmed by the staff of The Current, and features music from Minnesota artists. The service streams online.

Purple Current is an R&amp;B and Hip-Hop service inspired by Prince.

Rock The Cradle is also programmed by personnel at The Current, and airs a variation of their AAA format, with music geared toward children and parents. It is available via a separate webstream.

Radio Heartland features an eclectic mix of acoustic, Americana and roots music. The service can be found on the HD2 subchannel of KNOW-FM and also via a separate webcast. KNOW-FM also features an HD3 subchannel consisting of programming from NPR and the BBC World Service. The signal carries additional hours of Morning Edition and All Things Considered not available on KNOW&#x27;s main signal. Several other NPR and APM shows air on the service.

Subsidiary Communications Authority (SCA&#x27;s) are used to transmit a Minnesota version of the Radio Talking Book Network to disabled listeners around the state, in cooperation with Minnesota State Services for the Blind. MPR also serves as the radio backbone for the radio portion of the state&#x27;s Emergency Alert System, and as the backbone for the state&#x27;s AMBER Alert System.

MPR owns WGGL, the NPR affiliate serving Houghton, Michigan. The station airs a combination of NPR News, BBC World Service and Classical 24 programming. While MPR supplies weather updates, local MPR programming and news updates are not aired on the station.

== Programs ==
== Revenue and expenses ==
Minnesota Public Radio is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.

MPR&#x27;s funding comes from listener contributions (membership dues), foundations, corporate and private contributions, government grants, advertising, education partners, and publicly traded securities.

The for-profit Rivertown Trading Company, once a subsidiary of MPR&#x27;s parent company, was sold in 1998 for $124 million. Profits went toward creating MPR&#x27;s endowment, a percentage of which contributes to MPR&#x27;s annual budget.

=== Annual expenses ===

Total expenses for MPR for fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023), as shown in the MPR Board of Trustees audit, was $117.1 million ($119.7 million the next year). That includes $17.7 million spent on fundraising and is distributed among the categories in the table below.


On MPR&#x27;s federal 2021 tax form, total expenses are shown as $112,380,820.

On its federal 2021 tax form, MPR entered $9.2 million for &quot;Fees for services (nonemployees)&quot; under the category &quot;Other&quot;. Since that amount is less than 10% (8.2%) of its total expenses, MPR is not required to provide details on Schedule O, and none were provided.

== Broadcast coverage ==
Minnesota Public Radio broadcasts on several dozen stations that serve Minnesota and its neighboring communities and various translators providing additional local coverage. Stations are in Minnesota, South Dakota (Brookings and Sioux Falls), Michigan (Houghton), Iowa (Decorah), and Idaho (Sun Valley). MPR also operates KPCC in Pasadena, California.

Most areas are served by both a classical music station and a news and information station. Duluth and Rochester are served by a classical music station, a news and information station, and The Current.

MPR&#x27;s newest service, The Current, is available in Austin, Hinckley, Mankato, the Twin Cities, New Ulm, Rochester, St. Cloud (Collegeville), and St. Peter.

Minnesota Public Radio also broadcasts all three of its services—News, Classical and The Current—on HD Radio in several Minnesota communities. In the Twin Cities, MPR multicasts Classical 24, an additional news service and Purple Current.

===Public Insight Network===
Public Insight Network (PIN), a newsgathering and networking initiative founded by MPR, was created by American Public Media in 2003. Through the PIN initiative, a community of citizens consigned their insights, personal experiences, and firsthand knowledge to journalists they trusted. This shared knowledge could then be included in printed materials, broadcast on live news, or shared on the Internet. PIN contributed to national shows such as Marketplace.

<text>Vermes (&quot;worms&quot;) is an obsolete taxon used by Carl Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for non-arthropod invertebrate animals.

==Linnaeus==
In Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, the Vermes had the rank of class, occupying the 6th (and last) slot of his animal systematics. It was divided into the following orders, all except the Lithophyta containing (in modern terms) organisms from a variety of phyla:

* Intestina, including horsehair worms, earthworms, roundworms, liver flukes, leeches, hagfishes, and shipworms
* Mollusca, including slugs, sea slugs, polychaetes, sea mice, priapulids, salps, jellyfish, starfish, and sea urchins
* Testacea, including chitons, barnacles, clams, cockles, nautiluses, snails and serpulid worms
* Lithophyta, including various corals
* Zoophyta, including bryozoans, coralline algae, &quot;Hydra&quot;, sea pens, tapeworms, and &quot;Volvox&quot;

Apart from the Mollusca, understood very differently from the modern phylum of that name, Linnaeus included a very diverse and rather mismatched assemblage of animals in the categories. The Intestina group encompassed various parasitic animals, among them the hagfish, which Linnaeus would have found in dead fish. Shelled molluscs were placed in the Testacea, together with barnacles and tube worms. Cnidarians (jellyfish and corals), echinoderms and polychaetes were spread across the other orders.

==Lamarck==

Linnaeus&#x27;s system was revised by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his 1801 &quot;Système des Animaux sans Vertebres&quot;. In this work, he categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans and annelids, which he separated from &quot;Vermes&quot;.
==Modern==

After Linnaeus, and especially with the advent of Darwinism, it became apparent that the Vermes animals are not closely related. Systematic works on phyla since Linnaeus continued to split up Vermes and sort the animals into natural systematic units.

Of the classes of Vermes proposed by Linnaeus, only Mollusca has been kept as a phylum, and its composition has changed almost entirely. Linnaeus&#x27;s early classification of the soft-bodied organisms was revolutionary in its day. A number of the organisms classified as Vermes by Linnaeus were very poorly known, and a number of them were not even viewed as animals.

==Vermiform==

While the &quot;Vermes&quot; is no longer a taxonomic group, anatomists continue to use the description &quot;vermiform&quot; of animals or organs that are worm-shaped. The word root is Latin, and . A well known example is the vermiform appendix, a small, blind section of the gut in humans and a number of other mammals.

Several soft-bodied animal phyla including the annelids (earthworm and relatives) and the roundworms (mainly parasites), but also the minute parasitic mesozoans and some larger-bodied free-living phyla like the ribbon worms, peanut worms, and priapulids.

<text>The Potsdam Declaration, or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender, was a statement that called for the surrender of all Japanese armed forces during World War II. On July 26, 1945, United States President Harry S. Truman, United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Chairman of China Chiang Kai-shek issued the document, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan, as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. The ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face &quot;prompt and utter destruction.&quot;

==Drafting==
At the start of the conference, the United States delegation considered a proclamation demanding Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender by the heads of governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China. The Potsdam Declaration went through many drafts until a version acceptable to all was found. Knowing on 24 July that the &quot;Joint Chiefs of Staff had reached an agreement on ... military strategy&quot;, Truman gave Churchill a copy of the draft proclamation, which didn&#x27;t mention the Soviet Union. The United States Delegation adopted all the suggested British amendments. Since Chiang Kai-shek had not been invited to the conference in a Berlin suburb, China did not participate in the drafting of the Potsdam Declaration. Chinese agreement on the issuance of the proposed proclamation was sought by telegram on 24 July. Ambassador Hurley delivered the message the next day in Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek concurred with one amendment to the text, the listing of “President of the National Government of the Republic of China” before the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and the telegraphic reply sent from Chongqing at 11:05 a.m. on 26 July. Thus, Churchill could authorize the text as British Prime Minister, before submitting his resignation later that evening. In reality, the “signatures” of the Generalissimo and Prime Minister were in Truman’s handwriting.

==Terms==
On July 26, the United States, Britain, and China released the declaration announcing the terms for Japan&#x27;s surrender, with the warning as an ultimatum: &quot;We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.&quot; For Japan, the terms of the declaration specified:
* The elimination &quot;for all time of the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest&quot;
* The occupation of &quot;points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies&quot;
* That the &quot;Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and such minor islands as we determine,&quot; as had been announced in the Cairo Declaration in 1943
* That &quot;the Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives&quot;
* That &quot;we do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners&quot;

On the other hand, the declaration offered:
* &quot;The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.&quot;
* &quot;Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.&quot;
* &quot;The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established, in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people, a peacefully inclined and responsible government.&quot;

The mention of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; came at the end of the declaration:
* &quot;We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.&quot;

Contrary to what had been intended at its conception, which was to disenfranchise the Japanese leadership so that the people would accept a mediated transition, the declaration made no direct mention of the Japanese emperor at all. However, it insisted that &quot;the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated for all time.&quot; Allied intentions on issues of utmost importance to the Japanese, including the extent and number of Allied &quot;occupation points,&quot; the fate of Japan&#x27;s minor islands, and the extent to which the Allies planned to &quot;control&quot; Japan&#x27;s &quot;raw materials,&quot; as well as whether Hirohito was to be regarded as one of those who had &quot;misled the people of Japan&quot; or he might potentially become part of &quot;a peacefully inclined and responsible government,&quot; were thus left unstated, which essentially made it a blank check for the Allies.

The &quot;prompt and utter destruction&quot; clause has been interpreted as a veiled warning about American possession of the atomic bomb, which had been successfully tested in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, the day before the opening of the conference. Although the document warned of further destruction like the &quot;Operation Meetinghouse&quot; raid on Tokyo and other carpetbombing of Japanese cities, it did not mention anything about the atomic bomb.

The Potsdam Declaration had terms unclearly stated. It is not clear from the document itself whether a Japanese government would remain under Allied occupation or the occupation would be run by a foreign military government. In the same manner, it was not clear whether after the end of the occupation, Japan was to include any territory other than the four main Japanese islands. However, State Department policy showed an intent to obtain a free hand in running the affairs of Japan afterwards.

=== Intentions of the Allied Powers ===
Each of the Allies who signed the Declaration had their own intentions for doing so, and all parties desired to receive reparations for war damages from the Japanese.

==== Republic of China ====
The Republic of China – under the Nationalist rule of Chiang Kai-shek – desired immediate withdrawal of the Imperial Japanese Army and its subsidiary force the Kwantung Army from all Chinese territory, including Manchuria. Until the very end of the war the Japanese Army had been campaigning in China to assert the rule of the Japanese colonial state there, and the Chinese Nationalists and Communists had been fighting in tandem to expel them from the country. The Potsdam Declaration was issued in part to make clear the Chinese expectation of complete Japanese withdrawal from China.

==== United Kingdom ====
The United Kingdom had lost control of its possessions in Southeast Asia and China to the Japanese advance in 1941–42. These included Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo, Hong Kong, and others. A key motivation of the British government was a restoration of control in its prewar possessions, along with a prompt end to the Japanese war effort, especially on the Indian front in Burma.

==== United States ====
The United States desired to keep maximum strategic latitude for itself upon the defeat of Japan. The American government had demanded in the past the unconditional surrender of Japan as the precondition to peace, and the text of the Declaration reiterated this demand. In the remainder of Asia, the American government had the goals of total rollback of the Empire of Japan&#x27;s overseas possessions, as well as the additional goal of preventing the communists – with the support and patronage of the Soviet Union – from expanding influence in East Asia and Southeast Asia.

==Leaflets and radio broadcasts==
The declaration was released to the press in Potsdam on the evening of July 26 and was simultaneously transmitted to the Office of War Information (OWI) in Washington. By 5:00 p.m. Washington time, OWI&#x27;s West Coast transmitters, aimed at the Japanese home islands, were broadcasting the text in English, and two hours later they began broadcasting it in Japanese. The declaration was never transmitted to the Japanese government by diplomatic channels, one reason being that the State Department did not want the United States to be seen as suing for peace. The Japanese ambassador to Moscow reacted to the news by calling the declaration &quot;a big scare-bomb directed against us&quot;. American bombers dropped over 3 million leaflets describing the declaration over Japan, despite the fact that picking up enemy propaganda leaflets and listening to foreign radio broadcasts was illegal in Japan.

The initial English radio transmission was received in Japan by the Foreign Ministry, Dōmei News Agency, the Imperial Army, and the Imperial Navy. It was translated into Japanese by Takeso Shimoda of the Treaty Division of the Foreign Ministry. An internal discussion in the Foreign Ministry concluded that acceptance was unavoidable, but there was still room for negotiation. &quot;Remaining silent is prudent; the news media should be instructed to print it without any comments.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The Potsdam Declaration and consideration of adopting it occurred before nuclear weapons were used. The terms of the declaration were hotly debated within the Japanese government. Upon receiving the declaration, Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō hurriedly met with Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki and Cabinet Secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu. Sakomizu recalled that all felt the declaration must be accepted. Despite being sympathetic to accepting the terms, Tōgō felt it was vague about the eventual form of government for Japan, disarmament, and the fate of accused war criminals. He also still had hope that the Soviet Union would agree to mediate negotiations with the Western Allies to obtain clarifications and revisions of the declaration&#x27;s terms.

Shortly afterwards, Tōgō met with Emperor Hirohito and advised him to treat the declaration with the utmost circumspection, but that a reply should be postponed until the Japanese received a response from the Soviets to mediate peace. According to Foreign Ministry official Toshikazu Kase, Hirohito &quot;said without hesitation that he deemed it [the declaration] acceptable in principle.&quot;

Meanwhile, the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War met the same day to discuss the declaration. War Minister Korechika Anami, General Yoshijirō Umezu, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda opposed accepting the declaration, argued that the terms were &quot;too dishonorable,&quot; and advised for the Japanese government to reject it openly. Suzuki, Tōgō, and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai leaned towards accepting it but agreed that clarification was needed over the status of the Emperor. Tōgō&#x27;s suggestion for the government not to respond until it received the Soviet response was accepted.

Suzuki stated that the Japanese policy toward the declaration was one of , which the United States interpreted as meaning &quot;rejection by ignoring.&quot; That led to a decision by the White House to carry out the threat of destruction. After the White House decision, the United States Army Air Forces dropped the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and then the second atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Both bombings devastated the two cities, killing tens of thousands of people and destroying much of the cities&#x27; infrastructure as well as military bases and factories in a matter of seconds in a radius that stretched for more than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).

However, the word can also mean &quot;withholding comment.&quot; Since then, it has been alleged that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were attributable to English translations of having misrepresented Suzuki as rejecting the terms of the Potsdam Declaration; however, this claim is not universally accepted. 

On August 9, 1945, Soviet general secretary Joseph Stalin, based on a secret agreement at the Yalta Conference in February, unilaterally abrogated the 1941 Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact and declared war on Japan. Thus began the Soviet–Japanese War, with the Soviets invading Manchuria on three fronts. The previous day, 8 August, the Soviet Union had agreed to adhere to the Potsdam Declaration.

In a widely broadcast speech after the bombing of Hiroshima, which was picked up by Japanese news agencies, Truman warned that if Japan failed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, it could &quot;expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.&quot; As a result, Suzuki felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, and he reiterated his government&#x27;s commitment to ignore the Allies&#x27; demands and fight on.

However, soon after that statement, it became clear to many that surrender was a realistic option. The thoroughness of the Allies&#x27; demands and the fact they were made public forced the Japanese leaders and populace to realize the success that Japan&#x27;s enemies had achieved in the war. After the receipt of the Potsdam Declaration, the Japanese government attempted to maintain the issue of the Emperor&#x27;s administrative prerogative within the Potsdam Declaration by its surrender offer of August 10, but in the end, it had to take comfort with US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes&#x27; reply: &quot;From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms.&quot; Thus, at 1200 JST on August 15, 1945, the Emperor announced his acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, which culminated in the surrender documents signature on board the on September 2, 1945. The radio announcement to the Japanese people was the first time many of them had actually heard the voice of the Emperor.

The Potsdam Declaration was intended from the start to serve as legal basis for handling Japan after the war. After the surrender of the Japanese government and the landing of General MacArthur in Japan in September 1945, the Potsdam Declaration served as the legal basis for the occupation&#x27;s reforms.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China cites the Potsdam Declaration as one of the bases for the One-China Principle that Taiwan is part of China.

== Historical controversy ==
The Imperial Japanese Government, under the direction of prime minister Suzuki Kantarō, did not publicly entertain the possibility of surrender to the Allies. The historical controversy lies in whether or not the demand for an unconditional surrender by Japan stalled possible peace negotiations. If the demand for unconditional surrender had not been made, so the argument goes, there could be no argument for the necessity of the use of firebombing and nuclear weapons against Japan. This is the flashpoint around which much of historiographical controversy surrounding the Declaration revolves.

According to American historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa the Japanese cabinet remained averse to surrender, and no governmental record immediately pursuant to the Little Boy nuclear detonation over Hiroshima indicates a shift toward capitulation under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

Hasegawa also notes that Stalin told Truman at the Potsdam Conference that the Soviet Union would begin war with Japan within the beginning of August, but that American estimates placed the estimated time at the end of the month.

<text>Abu Qir (, &quot;Abu Qīr&quot;, or , ), formerly also spelled Abukir or Aboukir, is a town on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, near the ruins of ancient Canopus and northeast of Alexandria by rail. It is located on Abu Qir Peninsula, with Abu Qir Bay to the east.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s present name is Arabic for &quot;Father Cyrus&quot;, one of a pair of fourth century Christian martyrs venerated as Saints Cyrus and John by the Coptic Church.

==History==
The remains of many ancient buildings from the Egyptian, Greek and Roman periods can be found near the town. About southeast of the town are the ruins of the Ancient Egyptian coastal town of Canopus. A little farther east, the now-dry Canopic branch of the Nile once entered the Mediterranean.

The wide Abu Qir Bay (Khalīj Abū Qīr) stretches eastward from the town as far as the Rosetta mouth of the Nile. On 1 August 1798 the bay was the location of the Battle of the Nile, fought by the British Admiral Horatio Nelson. The battle is often referred to as the &quot;Battle of Aboukir Bay&quot;, though this title is more properly applied to Battle of Abukir of 1799, an engagement between the French expeditionary army and the Turks under Mustapha Pasha fought on 25 July the following year. Later in the war, on 8 March 1801 at the beginning of the Battle of Alexandria, units of the British army commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby landed from their transports near the town, and faced strenuous opposition from General Louis Friant&#x27;s French forces entrenched on the beach. The battle continued further down the peninsula toward Alexandria and did not end until 22 March.

The town contains a castle that was used as a state prison by Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century. The prison was known as Liman Abu Qir.

In 2000, an Italian archaeological team discovered the remains of British officers, sailors, marines, women, and children on Nelson&#x27;s Island, which lies in the bay.

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), but it lies at the northern coast of Egypt, moderating its temperatures. Due to its proximity to Alexandria, it has a very similar climate. The wettest places in Egypt are Rafah, Alexandria, Abu Qir, Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr El Dawwar, Mersa Matruh.

<doc id="61211" wikidata="Q413357" url="?curid=61211" title="Anatase">
<text>Anatase is a metastable mineral form of titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a tetragonal crystal structure. Although colorless or white when pure, anatase in nature is usually a black solid due to impurities. Three other polymorphs (or mineral forms) of titanium dioxide are known to occur naturally: brookite, akaogiite, and rutile, with rutile being the most common and most stable of the bunch. Anatase is formed at relatively low temperatures and found in minor concentrations in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Glass coated with a thin film of TiO2 shows antifogging and self-cleaning properties under ultraviolet radiation.

Anatase is always found as small, isolated, and sharply developed crystals, and like rutile, it crystallizes in a tetragonal system. Anatase is metastable at all temperatures and pressures, with rutile being the equilibrium polymorph. Nevertheless, anatase is often the first titanium dioxide phase to form in many processes due to its lower surface energy, with a transformation to rutile taking place at elevated temperatures. Although the degree of symmetry is the same for both anatase and rutile phases, there is no relation between the interfacial angles of the two minerals, except in the prism-zone of 45° and 90°. The common octahedral crystal habit of anatase, with four perfect cleavage planes, has an angle over its polar edge of 82°9&#x27;, whereas rutile octahedra only has a polar edge angle of 56°52½&#x27;. The steeper angle gives anatase crystals a longer vertical axis and skinnier appearance than rutile. Additional important differences exist between the physical characters of anatase and rutile. For example, anatase is less hard (5.5–6 vs. 6–6.5 on the Mohs scale) and less dense (specific gravity about 3.9 vs. 4.2) than rutile. Anatase is also optically negative, whereas rutile is optically positive. Anatase has a more strongly adamantine or metallic-adamantine luster than that of rutile as well.

==Nomenclature==
The modern name was introduced by René Just Haüy in 1801, but the mineral was known and described before. It derives from &#x27;stretching out&#x27;, because the crystals are stretched along an axis compared to other dipyramidal ones.

Another name commonly in use for anatase is &quot;octahedrite&quot;, which is earlier than anatase and was given by Horace Bénédict de Saussure because of the common (acute) octahedral habit of the crystals. Other names, now obsolete, are &quot;oisanite&quot; (by Jean-Claude Delamétherie) and &quot;dauphinite&quot;, from the well-known French locality of Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans in Dauphiné.

==Crystal habit==

Two growth habits of anatase crystals may be distinguished. The more common occurs as simple acute octahedra with an indigo-blue to black color and steely luster. Crystals of this kind are abundant at Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans in Dauphiné, France, where they are associated with rock-crystal, feldspar, and axinite in crevices in granite and mica schist. Similar crystals of microscopic size are widely distributed in sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, clays, and slates, from which they may be separated by washing away the lighter constituents of the powdered rock. The (101) plane of anatase is the most thermodynamically stable surface and thus the most widely exposed facet in natural and synthetic anatase.

Crystals of the second type have numerous pyramidal faces developed, and they are usually flatter or sometimes prismatic in habit. Their color is honey-yellow to brown. Such crystals closely resemble the mineral xenotime in appearance and were historically thought to be a special form of xenotime, termed &quot;wiserine&quot;. They occur attached to the walls of crevices in gneisses in the Alps, a well-known locality being the Binnenthal near Brig in canton Valais, Switzerland.

While anatase is not an equilibrium phase of TiO2, it is metastable near room temperature. At temperatures between 550 and about 1000 °C, anatase converts to rutile. The temperature of this transformation strongly depends on impurities, or dopants, as well as the morphology of the sample.

==Synthetic anatase==
Due to its potential application as a semiconductor, anatase is often prepared synthetically. Crystalline anatase can be prepared in laboratories by chemical methods such as the sol-gel process. This might be done through controlled hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) or titanium ethoxide. Often dopants are included in such synthesis processes to control the morphology, electronic structure, and surface chemistry of an anatase sample.

<doc id="61213" wikidata="Q425432" url="?curid=61213" title="Laurent series">
<text>In mathematics, the Laurent series of a complex function formula_1 is a representation of that function as a power series which includes terms of negative degree. It may be used to express complex functions in cases where a Taylor series expansion cannot be applied. The Laurent series was named after and first published by Pierre Alphonse Laurent in 1843. Karl Weierstrass had previously described it in a paper written in 1841 but not published until 1894.

==Definition==
The Laurent series for a complex function formula_1 about an arbitrary point formula_3 is given by
formula_4
where the coefficients formula_5 are defined by a contour integral that generalizes Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula:
formula_6

The path of integration formula_7 is counterclockwise around a Jordan curve enclosing formula_3 and lying in an annulus formula_9 in which formula_1 is holomorphic (analytic). The expansion for formula_1 will then be valid anywhere inside the annulus. The annulus is shown in red in the figure on the right, along with an example of a suitable path of integration labeled formula_7. When formula_7 is defined as the circle formula_14, where formula_15, this amounts
to computing the complex Fourier coefficients of the restriction of formula_16 to formula_7. The fact that these integrals are unchanged by a deformation of the contour formula_7 is an immediate consequence of Green&#x27;s theorem. 

One may also obtain the Laurent series for a complex function formula_1 at formula_20. However, this is the same as when formula_21. 

In practice, the above integral formula may not offer the most practical method for computing the coefficients
formula_5 for a given function formula_1; instead, one often pieces together the Laurent series by combining known Taylor expansions. Because the Laurent expansion of a function is unique whenever
it exists, any expression of this form that equals the given function 
formula_1 in some annulus must actually be the Laurent expansion of formula_1.

== Convergence ==

Laurent series with complex coefficients are an important tool in complex analysis, especially to investigate the behavior of functions near singularities.

Consider for instance the function formula_26 with formula_27. As a real function, it is infinitely differentiable everywhere; as a complex function however it is not differentiable at formula_28. The Laurent series of formula_29 is obtained via the power series representation,
formula_30
which converges to formula_29 for all formula_32 except at the singularity formula_28. The graph on the right shows formula_29 in black and its Laurent approximations
formula_35
As formula_36, the approximation becomes exact for all (complex) numbers formula_37 except at the singularity formula_38.

More generally, Laurent series can be used to express holomorphic functions defined on an annulus, much as power series are used to express holomorphic functions defined on a disc.

Suppose 
formula_39
is a given Laurent series with complex coefficients formula_5 and a complex center formula_3. Then there exists a unique inner radius formula_42 and outer radius formula_43 such that:
* The Laurent series converges on the open annulus formula_44. That is, both the positive- and negative degree power series converge. Furthermore, this convergence will be uniform on compact sets. Finally, the convergent series defines a holomorphic function formula_1 on formula_9.
* Outside the annulus, the Laurent series diverges. That is, at each point in the exterior of formula_9, either the positive- or negative degree power series diverges.
* On the boundary of the annulus, one cannot make a general statement, except that there is at least one point on the inner boundary and one point on the outer boundary such that formula_1 cannot be holomorphically extended to those points; giving rise to a Riemann-Hilbert problem.

It is possible that formula_42 may be zero or formula_43 may be infinite; at the other extreme, it&#x27;s not necessarily true that formula_42 is less than formula_43.
These radii can be computed by taking the limit superior of the coefficients formula_5 such that:
formula_54

When formula_55, the coefficient formula_56 of the Laurent expansion is called the residue of formula_1 at the singularity formula_3. For example, the function
formula_59
is holomorphic everywhere except at formula_60. The Laurent expansion about formula_61 can then be obtained from the power series representation:
formula_62
hence, the residue is given by formula_63.

Conversely, for a holomorphic function formula_1 defined on the annulus formula_44, there always exists a unique Laurent series with center formula_3 which converges (at least on formula_9) to formula_1.

For example, consider the following rational function, along with its partial fraction expansion:
formula_69

This function has singularities at formula_70 and formula_71, where the denominator is zero and the expression is therefore undefined.
A Taylor series about formula_60 (which yields a power series) will only converge in a disc of radius 1, since it &quot;hits&quot; the singularity at formula_70.

However, there are three possible Laurent expansions about 0, depending on the radius of formula_74:

* One series is defined on the inner disc where ; it is the same as the Taylor series, formula_75 This follows from the partial fraction form of the function, along with the formula for the sum of a geometric series, formula_76 for formula_77.
* The second series is defined on the middle annulus where formula_78 is caught between the two singularities: formula_79 Here, we use the alternative form of the geometric series summation, formula_80 for formula_81.
* The third series is defined on the infinite outer annulus where formula_82, (which is also the Laurent expansion at formula_83) formula_84 This series can be derived using geometric series as before, or by performing polynomial long division of 1 by formula_85, not stopping with a remainder but continuing into formula_86 terms; indeed, the &quot;outer&quot; Laurent series of a rational function is analogous to the decimal form of a fraction. (The &quot;inner&quot; Taylor series expansion can be obtained similarly, just by reversing the term order in the division algorithm.)

== Uniqueness ==
Suppose a function formula_1 holomorphic on the annulus formula_88 has two Laurent series:
formula_89

Multiply both sides by formula_90, where k is an arbitrary integer, and integrate on a path γ inside the annulus,
formula_91

The series converges uniformly on formula_92, where &quot;ε&quot; is a positive number small enough for &quot;γ&quot; to be contained in the constricted closed annulus, so the integration and summation can be interchanged. Substituting the identity
formula_93
into the summation yields
formula_94

Hence the Laurent series is unique.

== Laurent polynomials ==
A Laurent polynomial is a Laurent series in which only finitely many coefficients are non-zero. Laurent polynomials differ from ordinary polynomials in that they may have terms of negative degree.

== Principal part ==

The principal part of a Laurent series is the series of terms with negative degree, that is
formula_95

If the principal part of formula_16 is a finite sum, then formula_16 has a pole at formula_3 of order equal to (negative) the degree of the highest term; on the other hand, if formula_16 has an essential singularity at formula_3, the principal part is an infinite sum (meaning it has infinitely many non-zero terms).

If the inner radius of convergence of the Laurent series for formula_16 is 0, then formula_16 has an essential singularity at formula_3 if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum, and has a pole otherwise.

If the inner radius of convergence is positive, formula_16 may have infinitely many negative terms but still be regular at formula_3, as in the example above, in which case it is represented by a &quot;different&quot; Laurent series in a disk about formula_3.

Laurent series with only finitely many negative terms are well-behaved—they are a power series divided by formula_107, and can be analyzed similarly—while Laurent series with infinitely many negative terms have complicated behavior on the inner circle of convergence.

== Multiplication and sum ==
Laurent series cannot in general be multiplied.
Algebraically, the expression for the terms of the product may involve infinite sums which need not converge (one cannot take the convolution of integer sequences).
Geometrically, the two Laurent series may have non-overlapping annuli of convergence.

Two Laurent series with only &quot;finitely&quot; many negative terms can be multiplied: algebraically, the sums are all finite; geometrically, these have poles at formula_3, and inner radius of convergence 0, so they both converge on an overlapping annulus.

Thus when defining formal Laurent series, one requires Laurent series with only finitely many negative terms.

Similarly, the sum of two convergent Laurent series need not converge, though it is always defined formally, but the sum of two bounded below Laurent series (or any Laurent series on a punctured disk) has a non-empty annulus of convergence.

Also, for a field formula_109, by the sum and multiplication defined above, formal Laurent series would form a field formula_110 which is also the field of fractions of the ring formula_111 of formal power series.

<text>Bolesław Bierut (; 18 April 1892 – 12 March 1956) was a Polish communist activist and politician, leader of communist-ruled Poland from 1947 until 1956. He was President of the State National Council from 1944 to 1947, President of Poland from 1947 to 1952, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party from 1948 to 1956, and Prime Minister of Poland from 1952 to 1954. Bierut is believed to have worked as an NKVD informant or agent prior to 1945, although his relationship with the Soviet agency has been a subject of debate among historians. As communist leader, he implemented aspects of the Stalinist system in Poland. Together with Władysław Gomułka, his main rival, Bierut is chiefly responsible for the historic changes that Poland underwent in the aftermath of World War II. Unlike any of his communist successors, Bierut led Poland until his death.

Born in Congress Poland on the outskirts of Lublin, Bierut joined the Polish Socialist Party in 1912. Later he became a member of the Communist Party of Poland and spent some years in the Soviet Union. He was sentenced to a prison term in 1935 for conducting illegal labor activity in Poland by the anti-communist Sanation government and was later released in 1938. During World War II, Bierut was an activist of the newly founded Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) and subsequently the chairman of the State National Council (KRN), established by the PPR. Trusted by Joseph Stalin, Bierut participated in the Potsdam Conference, where he successfully lobbied for the establishment of Poland&#x27;s western border at the Oder–Neisse line.

After the 1947 Polish legislative election, marked by electoral fraud, Bierut was made the first post-war President of Poland. In 1952, the new Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (until then known as the Republic of Poland) abolished the position of president and a Marxist–Leninist government was officially imposed. Bierut supported the radical Stalinist policies as well as the systematic introduction of socialist realism in Poland. His regime was marked by a silent terror – he presided over the hunting down of armed opposition members and their eventual murder at the hands of the Ministry of Public Security (UB), including some former members of the Home Army. Under Bierut&#x27;s supervision, the UB evolved into a notorious secret police, which was responsible for the execution of six thousand people between 1944 and 1956, according to the Hoover Institution. 

As Poland&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, he resided in the Belweder Palace and headed the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party from the party headquarters at New World Street in central Warsaw, known as &quot;Dom Partii&quot;. He was also the chief proponent for the reconstruction of Warsaw (rebuilding of the historic district) and the erection of the Palace of Culture and Science. Bierut died of a heart attack on 12 March 1956 in Moscow, after attending the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His death was sudden, and many theories arose questioning the circumstances in which he died. His body was brought back to Poland and buried with honours in a monumental tomb at the Powązki Military Cemetery.

==Career==

===Youth and early career===
Bierut was born in Rury, Congress Poland (then part of the Russian Empire), now a part of Lublin, to Wojciech and Marianna Salomea (Wolska) Bierut, peasants from the Tarnobrzeg area, the youngest of their six children. In 1900, he attended an elementary school in Lublin. In 1905, he was removed from the school for instigating anti-Russian protests. From the age of fourteen he was employed in various trades, but obtained further education through self-studies. Influenced by the leftist intellectual Jan Hempel, who in 1910 arrived in Lublin, before World War I Bierut joined the Polish Socialist Party – Left (&quot;PPS – Lewica&quot;).

From 1915, Bierut was active in the cooperative movement. In 1916, he became trade manager of the Lublin Food Cooperative, and from 1918 was its top leader, declaring the cooperative&#x27;s &quot;class-socialist&quot; character. During World War I, he stayed at times at Hempel&#x27;s apartment in Warsaw and took trade and cooperative courses at the Warsaw School of Economics. In Warsaw, he established contacts with Maria Koszutska and in December 1918 some form of association with the newly created Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Poland (KPRP), from which, according to his later testimony, he withdrew in fall 1919. Bierut kept assuming ever higher offices in the cooperative movement. In 1919 he and Hempel went to Prague, where they represented the Polish cooperatives at the congress of their Czechoslovak counterparts. Bierut&#x27;s increasingly radical views, however, eventually hindered his cooperative career and caused his departure from the leadership of the movement, beginning in 1921. From 1921, he officially functioned as a member of the KPRP.

In July 1921 Bierut married Janina Górzyńska, a preschool teacher who had helped him a great deal when his illegal activities forced him to hide from the police. They were married by a priest at the Lublin Cathedral, even though the priest, according to Janina, excused them from the confession requirement. In February 1923 their daughter Krystyna was born, followed by son Jan in January 1925.

===Communist party activism until 1939===

In 1922–25, Bierut was a member of the Cooperative Department of the KPRP Central Committee. He worked as an accountant and was active in Warsaw at the Polish Association of Freethinkers. In August 1923, he was sent for party work in the Dąbrowa Basin, to manage the Workers&#x27; Food Cooperative. He lived in Sosnowiec, where he brought his wife and daughter and where he experienced the first of his many arrests. Detained repeatedly in various parts of the country, in October 1924 he moved to Warsaw. He had become a full-time conspiratorial party activist and in 1925 was a member of the Temporary Secretariat of the Central Committee and then the head of the Cooperative Department there.

Already trusted by the Soviets and knowing the Russian language well, from October 1925 to June 1926 Bierut was in the Moscow area, sent there for training at the secret school of the Communist International.

Arrested in Warsaw in January 1927, he was released on 30 April, based on personal assurances issued on his behalf by Stanisław Szwalbe and Zygmunt Zaremba. During the Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of Poland (KPP, the new name of the KPRP), which took place from 22 May to 9 August 1927, Bierut became a member of the Temporary Secretariat of the Central Committee again. In November, the party sent him to the International Lenin School in Moscow. He received positive evaluations there, except for not being entirely free of ideological right-wing errors, characteristic, in the school&#x27;s opinion, of the Polish communist party.

In 1930–31, Bierut was sent by the Comintern to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Many details of his activities are not reliably known, but from 1 October 1930 he was an instructor at the executive committee of the Comintern. He later claimed having lived in Moscow in 1927–32, except for a nine-month period in 1931, and having been enrolled at the Lenin School until 1930. Jerzy Eisler wrote: &quot;... in light of the Soviet archival materials, in 1927–32 Bierut was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), with his party seniority counted from 1921, the moment he formally joined the Polish communist party.&quot; In Moscow he met Małgorzata Fornalska, a KPP activist. They became romantically involved and had a daughter, named Aleksandra, born in June 1932. Soon afterwards Bierut left for Poland, leaving in Moscow for the time being also his legal family, whom he had brought there.

For several months Bierut was district secretary of the KPP organization in Łódź. After the regional organization was demolished by arrests, in 1933 he became secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish section of the International Red Aid. On 18 December 1933, Bierut was arrested and in 1935 sentenced to seven years in prison. In 1936, while imprisoned, he was excluded &quot;in absentia&quot; from the KPP for an &quot;unworthy of a communist behavior during the investigation and the court trial&quot;. The decision was invalidated and reversed by the Comintern on 7 September 1940 (even though the KPP by that time no longer existed). Bierut was found to have been a member of the moderate &quot;majority&quot; faction of the KPP, and the factional infighting in which he participated was determined not to amount to acting against the party.

He was released from prison on 20 December 1938, based on an earlier amnesty. He lived with his wife and children and worked in Warsaw cooperatives until the outbreak of war. The &quot;Sanation&quot; prison may have saved his life: while he was incarcerated, the KPP was disbanded by the Comintern and most of its leaders murdered in Stalin&#x27;s purges.

===In the Soviet Union===

On 1 September 1939, Nazi Germany attacked Poland. On 6 September the Polish military command issued a radio appeal for all able-bodied men to head east;
Bierut left Warsaw for Lublin, from where he proceeded to Kovel. Eastern Poland was soon occupied by the Red Army and Bierut was about to spend a part of World War II in the Soviet Union. From early October, he was employed by the Soviets in political capacities, including vice-chairmanship of a regional election commission before the Elections to the People&#x27;s Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia. The two assemblies, once established, voted for the incorporation of the previously Polish territories into the respective Soviet republics.

Bierut spent the rest of 1939, 1940 and the first part of 1941 in the Soviet Union, in Kiev and Moscow, working, making efforts to sanitize his record as a communist and searching for Fornalska, whom he met in Moscow in July 1940 and again in May 1941 in Białystok, where she had moved with Aleksandra. The mother and daughter were evacuated to Yershov in the Soviet Union after the June 1941 outbreak of the Soviet-German war, but Bierut ended up in Minsk. From November 1941, he was employed there by the German occupation authorities as a manager in the trade and food distribution department of the city government. In the summer of 1943, Bierut arrived in Nazi-occupied Poland, likely dispatched there as a trusted Soviet operative. He came to join the leadership of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR), a new communist party founded in January 1942. He may have been recommended for the job by Fornalska; parachuted into the General Government in the spring of 1942, she was in charge of the PPR&#x27;s radio communications with Moscow. Bierut became a member of the party Secretariat on 23 November 1943.

While there are many accounts and stories relating to Bierut during the 1939–1943 period, not much is known with certainty about his activities and the accounts are often speculative or amount to hearsay.

===In occupied Poland from 1943===

Upon his arrival in Warsaw, Bierut became a member of the Central Committee of the PPR, which comprised several individuals. The Secretariat had three members: General Secretary Paweł Finder, Franciszek Jóźwiak and Władysław Gomułka, whom Bierut did not know, but who quickly became his principal rival. Bierut lost his first confrontation over the management of &quot;Trybuna Wolności&quot; (&#x27;The Tribune of Freedom&#x27;), the party&#x27;s press organ.

In a major blow to the re-emergent Polish communist party, Finder and Fornalska were arrested by the Gestapo on 14 November 1943. They were executed in July 1944. They were the only people with the knowledge of radio codes needed to communicate with Moscow and such communications were indeed interrupted for several months. On 23 November 1943, the PPR chose Gomułka as its general secretary.

On 31 December 1943, Bierut assumed an important office: chairmanship of the State National Council (&quot;Krajowa Rada Narodowa&quot;, KRN), a communist-led body established by Gomułka and the PPR. The KRN was declared to be a wartime parliament of Poland and some splinter socialist and agrarian activists were co-opted. Starting with the KRN post, with Gomułka and others, Bierut would play a leading role in the establishment of communist Poland.

In May 1944, the KRN delegation flew into Moscow. They were officially received at the Kremlin by Joseph Stalin; supremacy of the KRN was recognized by the Union of Polish Patriots, which operated in the Soviet Union under communist leadership.

In June 1944 Bierut wrote a letter, meant for the Soviet leadership and addressed to Georgi Dimitrov in Moscow. He accused his Polish communist rival Gomułka of dictatorial tendencies and numerous offenses contrary to Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy; if taken seriously, the accusations could have cost Gomułka his life but they were not, and Gomułka did not find out about the letter until 1948, when it was used against him in Poland.

In July 1944, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) was established in liberated Lublin province. Just before the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, on 31 July 1944, Bierut came to Świder. The next day he crossed the front line and arrived in Lublin, the seat of the PKWN.

===In Soviet-dominated Poland===

Continuing as the KRN president, from August 1944 Bierut was secretly a member of the newly created Politburo of the PPR; he was officially presented to the public as a nonpartisan politician.

After the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, Bierut arrived in Moscow. On 6–7 August 1944, together with Wanda Wasilewska and Michał Rola-Żymierski, he conducted negotiations with Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk of the Polish government-in-exile. Mikołajczyk refused their offer of the job of prime minister in a coalition government, which otherwise would be dominated by the communists. Bierut&#x27;s daughter Krystyna participated in the uprising as a soldier of &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; and was gravely wounded.

A KRN and PKWN delegation, led by Bierut, was summoned to Moscow, where it stayed from 28 September to 3 October. Stalin, assisted by Wasilewska, had two meetings with the leaders from Poland, during which he lectured them on a number of issues, but was especially displeased by the lack of progress in implementing the land reform decree passed by the PKWN on 6 September. Stalin urged them to proceed forcefully with the agrarian revolution and to eliminate the great land owners class without further delay or undue legal concerns; Bierut felt that the remarks were addressed to him in particular.

On 12 October, the anniversary of the Battle of Lenino, the KRN for the first time deliberated in Lublin. The proceedings were interrupted to allow the deputies (including Bierut), together with officials of the PKWN and Nikolai Bulganin representing the Soviet Union, to participate in a field mass celebrated for the occasion and in the military parade that followed. Such participation in religious ceremonies by leading communist politicians continued for a while; it was one of the manifestations of the officially proclaimed after the war democratic and pluralistic policies, which included preservation of religious freedoms. Marshal Rola-Żymierski recalled kneeling together with Bierut before the altar at another field mass in May 1946, on the first anniversary of World War II victory. In conversations with Stanisław Łukasiewicz, his press secretary, Bierut expressed his support for moderate and liberal policies. His personal views were anti-clerical and he thought the reform proposals put forward by Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL), the legally existing opposition, would be abandoned in the event of PSL victory.

A military department of the PPR Central Committee was created on 31 October 1944 and included Bierut and Gomułka, in addition to three generals. Its goal was to politicize the armed forces, currently fighting the war, and to establish a politically reliable officer corps. According to Eisler, Bierut and Gomułka are both responsible for the post-war persecution of many former Home Army soldiers and other groups and individuals. The terror policies, particularly brutal in the 1944–48 period, were directed against declared opponents of the regime, including the legally functioning PSL, and had nor yet involved society as a whole.

In February 1945, the Yalta Conference took place in Crimea. At that time Bierut, together with the PPR leadership and government departments, moved to the capital city of Warsaw. The city was in ruins and its rebuilding and expansion became a major concern and preoccupation for Bierut during the years that followed.

In June 1945, the Provisional Government of National Unity was established in Moscow. In July, Bierut and other Polish leaders participated in the Potsdam Conference, where, together with Stalin, they successfully lobbied for the establishment of Poland&#x27;s western border at the Oder–Neisse line. The Polish administration in the formerly German lands was to continue until the final delimitation of the frontier in the (future) peace settlement. Poland&#x27;s newly acquired &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; had thus reached their maximum attainable size.

===Referendum and election, Bierut&#x27;s presidency===

On 30 June 1946, the Polish people&#x27;s referendum took place. It was done in preparation for the Yalta-mandated national elections; affirmative answers to the three questions given were supposed to demonstrate public support for the issues promoted by the communists. The results were falsified.

On 22 September 1946, the KRN passed the electoral rules and in November set the date; the delayed legislative elections were held on 19 January 1947. The PPR-led coalition, running as the Democratic Bloc, was opposed by Mikołajczyk&#x27;s PSL. 

Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Peasant Party, although it also had progressive overtones, had grown to be publicly associated with the traditional Polish right, which had engaged in antisemitic and anti-communist repressions before the war. The government dissolved the explicitly antisemitic right-wing parties still active after the war, but many of their supporters joined PSL since it was the only remaining legal opposition. The long-standing trope of the &quot;Judeo-Bolshevik&quot;, or &quot;Żydokomuna&quot;, was used by the far-right in anti-communist propaganda to cast Polish communism as a plot to control Poland by Russian Jews. 

The government also engaged in heavy interference with the election. Due to the electoral rules passed in September, 1 million people, or about 8% of the electorate, were disqualified on the grounds that they collaborated with the German Nazis during occupation or with underground fascist organizations still active in the country. Additionally, Peasant Party lists in 10 of the 52 districts were disqualified on the basis that they were composed of rightists. In places where Peasant Party observers were not allowed to oversee the election process, results were directly falsified. Lastly, peasant participation was limited by the fact that the elections were set in January, when most rural roads were covered in snow. The falsified results saw the Democratic Bloc receiving 80.1% of the vote, and Mikołajczyk only getting 10.3%. The PSL was practically eliminated as the legal opposition. 

The newly elected &quot;Sejm&quot; convened on 4 February 1947 and on the following day it elected Bierut President of the Republic of Poland. The installation ceremony was done in a traditional format and ended with the new president uttering the words &quot;so help me God&quot;.

On 16 November 1947, during the opening ceremony of the Polish Radio broadcasting station in Wrocław, President Bierut made a speech entitled &quot;For the dissemination of culture&quot;. &quot;The artistic and cultural creative process should reflect the great breakthrough that the nation is experiencing. It should, but so far it isn&#x27;t&quot;, he said. Bierut called for greater centralization and planning in culture and art, which, according to him, should form, educate and engross society. The speech was a harbinger of the upcoming norm of socialist realism in Poland.

Sometimes, Bierut on his own undertook special interventions with Stalin. He repeatedly and at different times asked Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria about the whereabouts of the missing Polish communists (former members of the disbanded KPP), many of whom were murdered in the Great Purge in the 1930s, but others may have survived. He also kept looking for the missing family of Fornalska. While Stalin and Beria discouraged and ridiculed Bierut&#x27;s efforts, in some cases his exertions brought positive results. Besides the communists, mostly surviving women, Bierut was able to bring back to Poland many other Poles, including former Home Army soldiers exiled in the Soviet Union.

Bierut was a gallant man, well-liked by women. His wife Janina did not live with him and was not known to many of his associates. She occasionally visited him in his offices and seemed intimidated by the surroundings and her husband&#x27;s position. On the other hand, his son and two daughters had seen Bierut frequently; they spent with him holidays and vacations and he appeared to genuinely enjoy their company. Bierut&#x27;s actual female partner, after Fornalska&#x27;s arrest, was Wanda Górska. She worked as his secretary and in other capacities, controlled access to him and visitors often thought of her as Bierut&#x27;s wife.

===Top leader of Stalinist Poland===

Gomułka, general secretary of the PPR (and until that time the principal figure in post-war Polish communist establishment), was accused of a &quot;right-wing nationalistic deviation&quot; and removed from his position during a plenary meeting of the Central Committee in August 1948. The move was Stalin-orchestrated and Stalin&#x27;s choice to fill the vacated job was President Bierut, who had thus become both the top party leader and top state official.

The historic PPS was practically taken over by the PPR at the Unification Congress, held in Warsaw in December 1948. The resulting &quot;Marxist–Leninist&quot; Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) was nearly synonymous with the state and Bierut became its first general secretary. The Three-Year Plan of post-war rebuilding and economic consolidation ended in 1949 and was followed by the Six-Year Plan, which intensified the industrialisation process and brought extensive urbanization of Poland.

In November 1949, Bierut asked the Soviet government to make available Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, a Polish-Soviet politician and famous World War II commander, for service in the government of Poland. Rokossovsky subsequently became a Marshal of Poland and Minister of National Defense.

In early August 1951, Bierut had his main rival Gomułka arrested. Gomułka, though imprisoned, refused to cooperate with his accusers and displayed remarkable ability to defend himself, while Bierut&#x27;s people bungled the prosecution. According to Edward Ochab, though, Stalin and Beria ordered the arrest and trial of Gomułka, while Bierut and Jakub Berman tried to protect him and caused delays in the proceedings. Informal political reforms, slow to take hold after Stalin&#x27;s death, eventually materialized and in December 1954 Gomułka was released.

During the lifetime of Stalin, Bierut was strictly subservient to the Soviet leader. Bierut routinely received instructions from Stalin over the telephone or was summoned to Moscow for consultations. Bierut still had far more power in Poland than any of his successors as First Secretary of the PZPR. He ruled jointly with his two closest associates, Berman and Hilary Minc. Security issues he also consulted with Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security.

===Bierut&#x27;s 60th birthday, constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic===

The apogee of Bierut&#x27;s cult, promoted by the authorities over a number of years, was the celebration of his sixtieth birthday on 18 April 1952. It included various industrial and other production or accomplishment commitments undertaken by institutions and individuals. The University of Wrocław and some state enterprises were named in his honor. The History Department of the party&#x27;s Central Committee prepared a special book about Bierut and his life, while Polish poets, including some notable ones, generated a book of poems dedicated to the leader. Many postage stamps dedicated to Bierut were issued.

As the PZPR leadership felt ready to sanction its rule in a fundamental legal document, a new constitution was being worked on. On 26 May 1951, the &quot;Sejm&quot; passed a statute concerning the preparation and passing of the constitution. The Constitutional Committee, led by Bierut, commenced its deliberations on 19 September. In the fall of 1951, a Russian translation of the draft constitution was examined by Stalin, who inserted dozens of corrections, subsequently implemented in the Polish text by Bierut. The officially proclaimed national public discussion resulted in hundreds of other proposed changes. After all the delays and the necessary extension of the term of the &quot;Sejm&quot;, the Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic was officially proclaimed on 22 July 1952.

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic (&quot;Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa&quot;) was the new name of the state. The &quot;Sejm&quot; was designated as the highest national authority; it represented &quot;the working people of towns and villages&quot;. The office of the president was eliminated and replaced with the collegial Council of State, elected by the &quot;Sejm&quot; from its members. The first chairman of the new council was Aleksander Zawadzki. Bierut replaced Józef Cyrankiewicz as prime minister in November 1952. The constitution, amended many times, remained in force until a new Constitution of Poland came into effect in October 1997, in what was then the Republic of Poland.

===Bierut&#x27;s last years===

In March 1953, Bierut led the Polish delegation for Stalin&#x27;s funeral in Moscow.

The regime&#x27;s relations with the Catholic Church kept deteriorating. The authorities imprisoned Bishop Czesław Kaczmarek and interned Poland&#x27;s primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński.

In the Soviet Union, changes were initiated by the new leader of the communist party, Nikita Khrushchev. The collective leadership concept, promoted first in the Soviet Union, made its way to other communist countries, including Poland. It meant, among other things, giving top party and state functions to different officials.

The Second Congress of the PZPR deliberated from 10 to 17 March 1954 in Warsaw. Bierut&#x27;s party chief&#x27;s title was changed from general secretary to first secretary. Because of the separation of functions requirement, Bierut remained only a party secretary and Cyrankiewicz returned to the post of prime minister. The Six-Year Plan was modified and some of the heavy industrial investment resources were shifted toward production of consumer articles.

When Khrushchev, a guest at the congress, inquired about the reasons for the continuing imprisonment of Gomułka, Bierut professed his own ignorance on that issue.

===Death and funeral===

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union deliberated on 14–25 February 1956. Afterwards, Bierut did not return to Poland with the rest of the Polish delegation, but remained in Moscow, hospitalized with bad influenza, which turned into pneumonia and heart complications.

On 3 March, during a conference of PZPR activists in Warsaw, Stefan Staszewski and others severely criticized the contemporary party leadership, including the absent Bierut.

Bierut died of a heart attack on 12 March 1956, having read the text of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, in which Khrushchev criticized Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality.

Bierut, however, would not die until sixteen days after that speech and four members of the delegation of Polish students who studied in Moscow, who met him on 25 February 1956, told Eisler that the first secretary showed signs of physical distress already at that time.

The deceased leader was given a splendid funeral in Warsaw. A period of national mourning was declared. Catholic bishops conceded to the demand that church bells ring all over the country on the day of the funeral.

In a radio address on 14 March, Helena Jaworska, chairperson of the board of the Union of Polish Youth, eulogized Bierut on behalf of the Polish youth. She recalled Bierut&#x27;s war and post-war activities and declared that &quot;the beloved friend of the youth has departed&quot;. She spoke of the &quot;great son of the Polish nation&quot; and &quot;a beautiful, loved person&quot;.

The funeral, which took place on 16 March, was transmitted by the Polish Radio over many hours. Warsaw residents were given a day-off from work to be able to participate. Large crowds of people gathered and joined the funeral procession, which began at the Palace of Culture and Science and proceeded toward the Powązki Military Cemetery, where the burial took place and where, for logistic reasons, only invited guests and delegations could enter.

==Remembrance in communist and post-communist Poland==

Khrushchev, who participated in Bierut&#x27;s funeral, stayed in Warsaw for several days and attended the Sixth Plenum of the PZPR Central Committee. On 20 March, Edward Ochab was chosen there as the party&#x27;s new first secretary. Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz delivered a detailed account of the history of Bierut&#x27;s illness, going back to the early spring of 1950, when Bierut experienced his first myocardial infarction. The report was not made public.

According to historian Andrzej Garlicki, Bierut died just in time to make possible the political demise of Berman and Minc and the triumphal return of Gomułka. Had Bierut lived much longer, the de-Stalinization process in Poland could have been stalled.

Soon after Bierut&#x27;s death, on 18 April 1956, a merchant ship newly built in Gdańsk Shipyard was named &quot;Bolesław Bierut&quot;.

During Gomułka&#x27;s rule as first secretary (1956–70), the memory of Bierut was marginalized. After 1970, First Secretary Edward Gierek brought Bierut back into public consciousness. Some books about him were published and in July 1979, on the 35th anniversary of communist Poland, Bierut&#x27;s monument was erected in Lublin. Bierut&#x27;s legend was sustained and cultivated during the 1970s. Gierek and his team, according to Eisler, idealized Bierut and his period and introduced a soft version of Stalinism, lacking the terror component of the original.

During the brief but turbulent Solidarity period, the University of Wrocław attempted to reclaim its original name, but the Ministry of Higher Education declined to implement the faculty resolution in January 1982.

On 1 June 1987, a factory in Skierniewice was given Bierut&#x27;s name, which was likely the last such outcome. In 1989, the University of Wrocław got its old name back, Bierut&#x27;s monument in Lublin was taken down, and soon all the mention of Bierut was removed from public space. However, memorials dedicated to countless many public and other figures and groups, judged compromised by their activities or connections with the communist regime, as well as other objects and names, including monuments of Soviet World War II soldiers or Polish Eastern Front soldiers, met the same fate.

Communist historian Zenobiusz Kozik wrote of the &quot;important role of Bierut in the deep social, economic and civilizational processes of those years. Processes that caused the rapid economic development of the country and great cultural advancement of entire groups and social spheres, especially the great masses of young people. (Regardless of the negative results and side effects, especially destroying the value of existing structures and the unconditional breaking of continuity). The civilizational advancement of Poland influenced the judgements regarding Bierut&#x27;s place in the history of Poland, especially for a certain generation&quot;.

Eisler countered this argument by writing of &quot;the brutal and bloody persecution of soldiers of the independence-seeking underground, clandestine murders, fake political trials, and also the falsified referendum of 1946 and the elections of the following year, and finally the Sovietization of Poland in practically all areas of public life&quot;.

Szwalbe related that Bierut tried to persuade him that &quot;every social revolution has to result in victims, including innocent ones. [...] Bierut considered himself a student of Stalin. He found making statements and declarations with the intent of obfuscating reality to be purposeful and justified (like Stalin did), and also the liquidation of the so-called adversaries in the process of the so-called successive stages of the revolution...&quot;

According to the historians Eleonora and Bronisław Syzdek, Bierut &quot;brought to mind no associations with a figure of despot or dictator&quot;. &quot;He knew how to listen and express himself competently, although formally he completed only five grades of elementary schooling and trade-cooperative courses. The knowledge he possessed, he acquired through self-education.&quot; &quot;People from Bierut&#x27;s immediate surroundings, whom he always treated with proper respect, while keeping the necessary distance in formal relations, to this day have retained a sympathetic view of him and try to defend the former president of People&#x27;s Poland against negative judgements&quot;.

Leon Chajn spoke of Bierut: &quot;Refined, tactful, composed. Not an eagle, but valued intelligence in others. A great patriot, enthusiast of Stalin&#x27;s concepts but opponent of his methods.&quot; Stanisław Łukasiewicz wrote about Bierut: &quot;Always read a lot and wrote a lot, especially in prison. The years spent in prison were for him the period of his university studies.&quot;

== Notes ==
&quot;a.&quot;After his arrival in Minsk, in September 1941, Bierut met Anastasia Kalesnikova, a woman fifteen years his junior and wife of the composer Isaac Luban, who had fled to Moscow leaving his family in Minsk. Bierut obtained &quot;Aryan&quot; (non-Jewish) documents for the family and moved into their apartment. Reportedly, Bierut and Kalesnikova had a daughter. After the war, Kalesnikova lived in Minsk again and was discreetly supported financially by Bierut. In 1974, suffering from material hardship, she wrote to First Secretary Edward Gierek of the PZPR, introducing herself as a &quot;friend, wife and helper of his great fellow countryman, the outstanding party activist Bolesław Bierut&quot;. She asked for Polish retirement pay for herself and her family and the Polish authorities granted her request.

&quot;b.&quot;In a sense, Bierut&#x27;s patriotism was recognized by Primate Stefan Wyszyński: &quot;People of Mr Bierut type honestly care for the future of Poland. At the present time, they see no other opportunity to serve Poland than through communizing of the country.&quot; In 1952 Polish legislative election, Wyszyński himself voted for Bierut.

<doc id="61218" wikidata="Q2296748" url="?curid=61218" title="Octahedrite">
<text>Octahedrites are the most common structural class of iron meteorites. The structures occur because the meteoric iron has a certain nickel concentration that leads to the exsolution of kamacite out of taenite while cooling.

==Structure==

Octahedrites derive their name from the crystal structure paralleling an octahedron. Opposite faces are parallel so, although an octahedron has 8 faces, there are only 4 sets of kamacite plates.

Due to a long cooling time in the interior of the parent asteroids, these alloys have crystallized into intermixed millimeter-sized bands (from about 0.2 mm to 5 cm). When polished and acid etched the classic Widmanstätten patterns of intersecting lines of lamellar kamacite, are visible.

In gaps between the kamacite and taenite lamellae, a fine-grained mixture called plessite is often found. An iron nickel phosphide, schreibersite, is present in most nickel-iron meteorites, as well as an iron-nickel-cobalt carbide, cohenite. Graphite and troilite occur in rounded nodules up to several cm in size.

==Subgroups==
Octahedrites can be grouped by the dimensions of kamacite lamellae in the Widmanstätten pattern, which are related to the nickel content:
* Coarsest octahedrites, lamellae width &gt;3.3 mm, 5-9% Ni, symbol Ogg
* Coarse octahedrites, lamellae 1.3-3.3 mm, 6.5-8.5% Ni, symbol Og
* Medium octahedrites, lamellae 0.5-1.3 mm, 7-13% Ni, symbol Om
* Fine octahedrites, lamellae 0.2-0.5 mm, 7.5-13% Ni, symbol Of
* Finest octahedrites, lamellae &lt;0.2 mm, 17-18% Ni, symbol Off
* Plessitic octahedrites, kamacite spindles, a transitional structure between octahedrites and ataxites, 9-18% Ni, symbol Opl

==Mineral==
Octahedrite is an obsolete synonym for anatase, one of the three known titanium dioxide minerals.

<doc id="61220" wikidata="Q258659" url="?curid=61220" title="Spintronics">
<text>Spintronics (a portmanteau meaning spin transport electronics), also known as spin electronics, is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment, in addition to its fundamental electronic charge, in solid-state devices. The field of spintronics concerns spin-charge coupling in metallic systems; the analogous effects in insulators fall into the field of multiferroics.

Spintronics fundamentally differs from traditional electronics in that, in addition to charge state, electron spins are used as a further degree of freedom, with implications in the efficiency of data storage and transfer. Spintronic systems are most often realised in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and Heusler alloys and are of particular interest in the field of quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, upon which leads to integrated research requirements around Hyperdimensional Computation.

==History==
Spintronics emerged from discoveries in the 1980s concerning spin-dependent electron transport phenomena in solid-state devices. This includes the observation of spin-polarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal by Johnson and Silsbee (1985) and the discovery of giant magnetoresistance independently by Albert Fert et al. and Peter Grünberg et al. (1988). The origin of spintronics can be traced to the ferromagnet/superconductor tunneling experiments pioneered by Meservey and Tedrow and initial experiments on magnetic tunnel junctions by Julliere in the 1970s. The use of semiconductors for spintronics began with the theoretical proposal of a spin field-effect-transistor by Datta and Das in 1990 and of the electric dipole spin resonance by Rashba in 1960.

== Theory ==
The spin of the electron is an intrinsic angular momentum that is separate from the angular momentum due to its orbital motion. The magnitude of the projection of the electron&#x27;s spin along an arbitrary axis is formula_1, implying that the electron acts as a fermion by the spin-statistics theorem. Like orbital angular momentum, the spin has an associated magnetic moment, the magnitude of which is expressed as

:formula_2.

In a solid, the spins of many electrons can act together to affect the magnetic and electronic properties of a material, for example endowing it with a permanent magnetic moment as in a ferromagnet.

In many materials, electron spins are equally present in both the up and the down state, and no transport properties are dependent on spin. A spintronic device requires generation or manipulation of a spin-polarized population of electrons, resulting in an excess of spin up or spin down electrons. The polarization of any spin dependent property X can be written as

:formula_3.

A net spin polarization can be achieved either through creating an equilibrium energy split between spin up and spin down. Methods include putting a material in a large magnetic field (Zeeman effect), the exchange energy present in a ferromagnet or forcing the system out of equilibrium. The period of time that such a non-equilibrium population can be maintained is known as the spin lifetime, formula_4.

In a diffusive conductor, a spin diffusion length formula_5 can be defined as the distance over which a non-equilibrium spin population can propagate. Spin lifetimes of conduction electrons in metals are relatively short (typically less than 1 nanosecond). An important research area is devoted to extending this lifetime to technologically relevant timescales.

The mechanisms of decay for a spin polarized population can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and spin dephasing. Spin-flip scattering is a process inside a solid that does not conserve spin, and can therefore switch an incoming spin up state into an outgoing spin down state. Spin dephasing is the process wherein a population of electrons with a common spin state becomes less polarized over time due to different rates of electron spin precession. In confined structures, spin dephasing can be suppressed, leading to spin lifetimes of milliseconds in semiconductor quantum dots at low temperatures.

Superconductors can enhance central effects in spintronics such as magnetoresistance effects, spin lifetimes and dissipationless spin-currents.

The simplest method of generating a spin-polarised current in a metal is to pass the current through a ferromagnetic material. The most common applications of this effect involve giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices. A typical GMR device consists of at least two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a spacer layer. When the two magnetization vectors of the ferromagnetic layers are aligned, the electrical resistance will be lower (so a higher current flows at constant voltage) than if the ferromagnetic layers are anti-aligned. This constitutes a magnetic field sensor.

Two variants of GMR have been applied in devices: (1) current-in-plane (CIP), where the electric current flows parallel to the layers and (2) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP), where the electric current flows in a direction perpendicular to the layers.

Other metal-based spintronics devices:
* Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), where CPP transport is achieved by using quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a thin insulator separating ferromagnetic layers.
* Spin-transfer torque, where a current of spin-polarized electrons is used to control the magnetization direction of ferromagnetic electrodes in the device.
* Spin-wave logic devices carry information in the phase. Interference and spin-wave scattering can perform logic operations.

==Spintronic-logic devices==
Non-volatile spin-logic devices to enable scaling are being extensively studied. Spin-transfer, torque-based logic devices that use spins and magnets for information processing have been proposed. These devices are part of the ITRS exploratory road map. Logic-in memory applications are already in the development stage. A 2017 review article can be found in &quot;Materials Today&quot;.

A generalized circuit theory for spintronic integrated circuits has been proposed so that the physics of spin transport can be utilized by SPICE developers and subsequently by circuit and system designers for the exploration of spintronics for “beyond CMOS computing.”

===Applications===
Read heads of magnetic hard drives are based on the GMR or TMR effect.

Motorola developed a first-generation 256 kb magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) based on a single magnetic tunnel junction and a single transistor that has a read/write cycle of under 50 nanoseconds. Everspin has since developed a 4 Mb version. Two second-generation MRAM techniques are in development: thermal-assisted switching (TAS) and spin-transfer torque (STT).

Another design, racetrack memory, a novel memory architecture proposed by Dr. Stuart S. P. Parkin, encodes information in the direction of magnetization between domain walls of a ferromagnetic wire.

In 2012, persistent spin helices of synchronized electrons were made to persist for more than a nanosecond, a 30-fold increase over earlier efforts, and longer than the duration of a modern processor clock cycle.

==Semiconductor-based spintronic devices==

Doped semiconductor materials display dilute ferromagnetism. In recent years, dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) including ZnO based DMOs and TiO2-based DMOs have been the subject of numerous experimental and computational investigations. Non-oxide ferromagnetic semiconductor sources (like manganese-doped gallium arsenide ), increase the interface resistance with a tunnel barrier, or using hot-electron injection.

Spin detection in semiconductors has been addressed with multiple techniques:
* Faraday/Kerr rotation of transmitted/reflected photons
* Circular polarization analysis of electroluminescence
* Nonlocal spin valve (adapted from Johnson and Silsbee&#x27;s work with metals)
* Ballistic spin filtering

The latter technique was used to overcome the lack of spin-orbit interaction and materials issues to achieve spin transport in silicon.

Because external magnetic fields (and stray fields from magnetic contacts) can cause large Hall effects and magnetoresistance in semiconductors (which mimic spin-valve effects), the only conclusive evidence of spin transport in semiconductors is demonstration of spin precession and dephasing in a magnetic field non-collinear to the injected spin orientation, called the Hanle effect.

===Applications===
Applications using spin-polarized electrical injection have shown threshold current reduction and controllable circularly polarized coherent light output. Examples include semiconductor lasers. Future applications may include a spin-based transistor having advantages over MOSFET devices such as steeper sub-threshold slope.

Magnetic-tunnel transistor: The magnetic-tunnel transistor with a single base layer has the following terminals:
* Emitter (FM1): Injects spin-polarized hot electrons into the base.
* Base (FM2): Spin-dependent scattering takes place in the base. It also serves as a spin filter.
* Collector (GaAs): A Schottky barrier is formed at the interface. It only collects electrons that have enough energy to overcome the Schottky barrier, and when states are available in the semiconductor.

The magnetocurrent (MC) is given as:

:formula_6

And the transfer ratio (TR) is

:formula_7

MTT promises a highly spin-polarized electron source at room temperature.

=== Storage media ===
Antiferromagnetic storage media have been studied as an alternative to ferromagnetism, especially since with antiferromagnetic material the bits can be stored as well as with ferromagnetic material. Instead of the usual definition 0 ↔ &#x27;magnetisation upwards&#x27;, 1 ↔ &#x27;magnetisation downwards&#x27;, the states can be, e.g., 0 ↔ &#x27;vertically-alternating spin configuration&#x27; and 1 ↔ &#x27;horizontally-alternating spin configuration&#x27;.).

The main advantages of antiferromagnetic material are:

* insensitivity to data-damaging perturbations by stray fields due to zero net external magnetization;
* no effect on near particles, implying that antiferromagnetic device elements would not magnetically disturb its neighboring elements;
* far shorter switching times (antiferromagnetic resonance frequency is in the THz range compared to GHz ferromagnetic resonance frequency);
* broad range of commonly available antiferromagnetic materials including insulators, semiconductors, semimetals, metals, and superconductors.

Research is being done into how to read and write information to antiferromagnetic spintronics as their net zero magnetization makes this difficult compared to conventional ferromagnetic spintronics. In modern MRAM, detection and manipulation of ferromagnetic order by magnetic fields has largely been abandoned in favor of more efficient and scalable reading and writing by electrical current. Methods of reading and writing information by current rather than fields are also being investigated in antiferromagnets as fields are ineffective anyway. Writing methods currently being investigated in antiferromagnets are through spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque from the spin Hall effect and the Rashba effect. Reading information in antiferromagnets via magnetoresistance effects such as tunnel magnetoresistance is also being explored.

<doc id="61221" wikidata="Q2460307" url="?curid=61221" title="École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne">
<text>École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne (; ) was a French grande école of engineering, and a research center providing training in information technologies and telecommunications. In 2017, it merged with École des mines de Nantes to form IMT Atlantique, which has consistently been ranked high in French and international rankings, e.g. 98 for Computer Science and 151-200th for Electrical Engineering in the 2023 QS Ranking.

As a member of the Institut Mines-Télécom, it had three campuses:
* Plouzané, in the Technopôle Brest-Iroise, near Brest (France);
* Campus de Beaulieu, in Rennes (France);
* SUPAERO campus, in Toulouse (France).

Télécom Bretagne had been the source of breakthroughs in the world of telecommunications, notably the turbo codes (first published in Proc. IEEE ICC&#x27;93) used extensively in 3G mobile telephony standards.

== History ==

* 1974: Pierre Lelong – Secretary of State for the PTT (literally &quot;Postal Telegraph and Telephone&quot;) – decides to establish a second school of telecommunications that will be located in the Brest area.
* 1977: Creation of ENST Bretagne in Brest. Admission of the first student body which counted 31 students.
* 1986: Creation of the Rennes site.
* 1997: Creation of the Groupe des Écoles des Télécommunications (GET).
* 2008: Renamed Télécom Bretagne.
* 2012: Creation of the Institut Mines-Télécom.
* 2017: Merger with École des Mines de Nantes to form IMT Atlantique.

=== Master of engineering ===

For students admitted in &quot;formation initiale&quot; (FI, literally &quot;initial formation&quot;), the curriculum takes three years and deals with six main domains in 1st and 2nd year:

* Mathematics and signal processing
* Electronics and physics
* Computer science
* Networks
* Economy and social sciences
* Languages and intercultural dimensions

and four options in 3rd year:
* Engineering and system integration
* Software systems and networks
* Services and business engineering

=== Master of Sciences ===

Télécom Bretagne delivers Master of Science degrees, which are fully compliant with the Bologna system. MSc is a two-year training course leading to a high level of expertise in Information Technologies (IT):

<doc id="61229" wikidata="Q115368" url="?curid=61229" title="Straightedge and compass construction">
<text>In geometry, straightedge-and-compass construction – also known as ruler-and-compass construction, Euclidean construction, or classical construction – is the construction of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures using only an idealized ruler and a compass.

The idealized ruler, known as a straightedge, is assumed to be infinite in length, have only one edge, and no markings on it. The compass is assumed to have no maximum or minimum radius, and is assumed to &quot;collapse&quot; when lifted from the page, so it may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with a collapsing compass; see compass equivalence theorem. Note however that whilst a non-collapsing compass held against a straightedge might seem to be equivalent to marking it, the neusis construction is still impermissible and this is what unmarked really means: see Markable rulers below.) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by the first three postulates of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

It turns out to be the case that every point constructible using straightedge and compass may also be constructed using compass alone, or by straightedge alone if given a single circle and its center.

Ancient Greek mathematicians first conceived straightedge-and-compass constructions, and a number of ancient problems in plane geometry impose this restriction. The ancient Greeks developed many constructions, but in some cases were unable to do so. Gauss showed that some polygons are constructible but that most are not. Some of the most famous straightedge-and-compass problems were proved impossible by Pierre Wantzel in 1837 using field theory, namely trisecting an arbitrary angle and doubling the volume of a cube (see § impossible constructions). Many of these problems are easily solvable provided that other geometric transformations are allowed; for example, neusis construction can be used to solve the former two problems.

In terms of algebra, a length is constructible if and only if it represents a constructible number, and an angle is constructible if and only if its cosine is a constructible number. A number is constructible if and only if it can be written using the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots but of no higher-order roots.

==Straightedge and compass tools==
The &quot;straightedge&quot; and &quot;compass&quot; of straightedge-and-compass constructions are idealized versions of real-world rulers and compasses.

*The straightedge is an infinitely long edge with no markings on it. It can only be used to draw a line segment between two points, or to extend an existing line segment.
*The compass can have an arbitrarily large radius with no markings on it (unlike certain real-world compasses). Circles and circular arcs can be drawn starting from two given points: the centre and a point on the circle. The compass may or may not collapse (i.e. fold after being taken off the page, erasing its &#x27;stored&#x27; radius).
*Lines and circles constructed have infinite precision and zero width.

Actual compasses do not collapse and modern geometric constructions often use this feature. A &#x27;collapsing compass&#x27; would appear to be a less powerful instrument. However, by the compass equivalence theorem in Proposition 2 of Book 1 of Euclid&#x27;s Elements, no power is lost by using a collapsing compass. Although the proposition is correct, its proofs have a long and checkered history. In any case, the equivalence is why this feature is not stipulated in the definition of the ideal compass.

Each construction must be mathematically &quot;exact&quot;. &quot;Eyeballing&quot; distances (looking at the construction and guessing at its accuracy) or using markings on a ruler, are not permitted. Each construction must also &quot;terminate&quot;. That is, it must have a finite number of steps, and not be the limit of ever closer approximations. (If an unlimited number of steps is permitted, some otherwise-impossible constructions become possible by means of infinite sequences converging to a limit.)

Stated this way, straightedge-and-compass constructions appear to be a parlour game, rather than a serious practical problem; but the purpose of the restriction is to ensure that constructions can be &quot;proved&quot; to be &quot;exactly&quot; correct.

==History==

The ancient Greek mathematicians first attempted straightedge-and-compass constructions, and they discovered how to construct sums, differences, products, ratios, and square roots of given lengths. They could also construct half of a given angle, a square whose area is twice that of another square, a square having the same area as a given polygon, and regular polygons of 3, 4, or 5 sides (or one with twice the number of sides of a given polygon). But they could not construct one third of a given angle except in particular cases, or a square with the same area as a given circle, or regular polygons with other numbers of sides. Nor could they construct the side of a cube whose volume is twice the volume of a cube with a given side.

Hippocrates and Menaechmus showed that the volume of the cube could be doubled by finding the intersections of hyperbolas and parabolas, but these cannot be constructed by straightedge and compass. In the fifth century BCE, Hippias used a curve that he called a quadratrix to both trisect the general angle and square the circle, and Nicomedes in the second century BCE showed how to use a conchoid to trisect an arbitrary angle; but these methods also cannot be followed with just straightedge and compass.

No progress on the unsolved problems was made for two millennia, until in 1796 Gauss showed that a regular polygon with 17 sides could be constructed; five years later he showed the sufficient criterion for a regular polygon of &quot;n&quot; sides to be constructible.

In 1837 Pierre Wantzel published a proof of the impossibility of trisecting an arbitrary angle or of doubling the volume of a cube, based on the impossibility of constructing cube roots of lengths. He also showed that Gauss&#x27;s sufficient constructibility condition for regular polygons is also necessary.

Then in 1882 Lindemann showed that formula_1 is a transcendental number, and thus that it is impossible by straightedge and compass to construct a square with the same area as a given circle.

==The basic constructions==
All straightedge-and-compass constructions consist of repeated application of five basic constructions using the points, lines and circles that have already been constructed. These are:

*Creating the line through two points
*Creating the circle that contains one point and has a center at another point
*Creating the point at the intersection of two (non-parallel) lines
*Creating the one point or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect)
*Creating the one point or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect).

For example, starting with just two distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the other point). If we draw both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. Drawing lines between the two original points and one of these new points completes the construction of an equilateral triangle.

Therefore, in any geometric problem we have an initial set of symbols (points and lines), an algorithm, and some results. From this perspective, geometry is equivalent to an axiomatic algebra, replacing its elements by symbols. Probably Gauss first realized this, and used it to prove the impossibility of some constructions; only much later did Hilbert find a complete set of axioms for geometry.
==Common straightedge-and-compass constructions==

The most-used straightedge-and-compass constructions include:

* Constructing the perpendicular bisector from a segment
* Finding the midpoint of a segment.
* Drawing a perpendicular line from a point to a line.
* Bisecting an angle
* Mirroring a point in a line
* Constructing a line through a point tangent to a circle
* Constructing a circle through 3 noncollinear points
* Drawing a line through a given point parallel to a given line.

==Constructible points==


One can associate an algebra to our geometry using a Cartesian coordinate system made of two lines, and represent points of our plane by vectors. Finally we can write these vectors as complex numbers.

Using the equations for lines and circles, one can show that the points at which they intersect lie in a quadratic extension of the smallest field &quot;F&quot; containing two points on the line, the center of the circle, and the radius of the circle. That is, they are of the form formula_2, where &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; are in &quot;F&quot;.

Since the field of constructible points is closed under &quot;square roots&quot;, it contains all points that can be obtained by a finite sequence of quadratic extensions of the field of complex numbers with rational coefficients. By the above paragraph, one can show that any constructible point can be obtained by such a sequence of extensions. As a corollary of this, one finds that the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible point (and therefore of any constructible length) is a power of 2. In particular, any constructible point (or length) is an algebraic number, though not every algebraic number is constructible; for example, is algebraic but not constructible.

===Constructible angles===
There is a bijection between the angles that are constructible and the points that are constructible on any constructible circle. The angles that are constructible form an abelian group under addition modulo 2π (which corresponds to multiplication of the points on the unit circle viewed as complex numbers). The angles that are constructible are exactly those whose tangent (or equivalently, sine or cosine) is constructible as a number. For example, the regular heptadecagon (the seventeen-sided regular polygon) is constructible because

:formula_3

as discovered by Gauss.

The group of constructible angles is closed under the operation that halves angles (which corresponds to taking square roots in the complex numbers). The only angles of finite order that may be constructed starting with two points are those whose order is either a power of two, or a product of a power of two and a set of distinct Fermat primes. In addition there is a dense set of constructible angles of infinite order.

===Relation to complex arithmetic===
Given a set of points in the Euclidean plane, selecting any one of them to be called 0 and another to be called 1, together with an arbitrary choice of orientation allows us to consider the points as a set of complex numbers.

Given any such interpretation of a set of points as complex numbers, the points constructible using valid straightedge-and-compass constructions alone are precisely the elements of the smallest field containing the original set of points and closed under the complex conjugate and square root operations (to avoid ambiguity, we can specify the square root with complex argument less than π). The elements of this field are precisely those that may be expressed as a formula in the original points using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, complex conjugate, and square root, which is easily seen to be a countable dense subset of the plane. Each of these six operations corresponding to a simple straightedge-and-compass construction. From such a formula it is straightforward to produce a construction of the corresponding point by combining the constructions for each of the arithmetic operations. More efficient constructions of a particular set of points correspond to shortcuts in such calculations.

Equivalently (and with no need to arbitrarily choose two points) we can say that, given an arbitrary choice of orientation, a set of points determines a set of complex ratios given by the ratios of the differences between any two pairs of points. The set of ratios constructible using straightedge and compass from such a set of ratios is precisely the smallest field containing the original ratios and closed under taking complex conjugates and square roots.

For example, the real part, imaginary part and modulus of a point or ratio &quot;z&quot; (taking one of the two viewpoints above) are constructible as these may be expressed as
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6

&quot;Doubling the cube&quot; and &quot;trisection of an angle&quot; (except for special angles such as any &quot;φ&quot; such that &quot;φ&quot;/(2)) is a rational number with denominator not divisible by 3) require ratios which are the solution to cubic equations, while &quot;squaring the circle&quot; requires a transcendental ratio. None of these are in the fields described, hence no straightedge-and-compass construction for these exists.

==Impossible constructions==
The ancient Greeks thought that the construction problems they could not solve were simply obstinate, not unsolvable. With modern methods, however, these straightedge-and-compass constructions have been shown to be logically impossible to perform. (The problems themselves, however, are solvable, and the Greeks knew how to solve them without the constraint of working only with straightedge and compass.)

===Squaring the circle===
The most famous of these problems, squaring the circle, otherwise known as the quadrature of the circle, involves constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only straightedge and compass.

Squaring the circle has been proved impossible, as it involves generating a transcendental number, that is, . Only certain algebraic numbers can be constructed with ruler and compass alone, namely those constructed from the integers with a finite sequence of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots. The phrase &quot;squaring the circle&quot; is often used to mean &quot;doing the impossible&quot; for this reason.

Without the constraint of requiring solution by ruler and compass alone, the problem is easily solvable by a wide variety of geometric and algebraic means, and was solved many times in antiquity.

A method which comes very close to approximating the &quot;quadrature of the circle&quot; can be achieved using a Kepler triangle.

===Doubling the cube===

Doubling the cube is the construction, using only a straightedge and compass, of the edge of a cube that has twice the volume of a cube with a given edge. This is impossible because the cube root of 2, though algebraic, cannot be computed from integers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots. This follows because its minimal polynomial over the rationals has degree 3. This construction is possible using a straightedge with two marks on it and a compass.

===Angle trisection===
Angle trisection is the construction, using only a straightedge and a compass, of an angle that is one-third of a given arbitrary angle. This is impossible in the general case. For example, the angle 2/5 radians (72° = 360°/5) can be trisected, but the angle of /3 radians (60°) cannot be trisected. The general trisection problem is also easily solved when a straightedge with two marks on it is allowed (a neusis construction).

===Distance to an ellipse===
The line segment from any point in the plane to the nearest point on a circle can be constructed, but the segment from any point in the plane to the nearest point on an ellipse of positive eccentricity cannot in general be constructed. See Note that results proven here are mostly a consequence of the non-constructivity of conics. If the initial conic is considered as a given, then the proof must be reviewed to check if other distinct conic needs to be generated. As an example, constructions for normals of a parabola are known, but they need to use an intersection between circle and the parabola itself. So they are not constructible in the sense that the parabola is not constructible.

===Alhazen&#x27;s problem===
In 1997, the Oxford mathematician Peter M. Neumann proved the theorem that there is no ruler-and-compass construction for the general solution of the ancient Alhazen&#x27;s problem (billiard problem or reflection from a spherical mirror).

==Constructing regular polygons==
Some regular polygons (e.g. a pentagon) are easy to construct with straightedge and compass; others are not. This led to the question: Is it possible to construct all regular polygons with straightedge and compass?

Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1796 showed that a regular 17-sided polygon can be constructed, and five years later showed that a regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if the odd prime factors of &quot;n&quot; are distinct Fermat primes. Gauss conjectured that this condition was also necessary; the conjecture was proven by Pierre Wantzel in 1837.

The first few constructible regular polygons have the following numbers of sides:

:3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60, 64, 68, 80, 85, 96, 102, 120, 128, 136, 160, 170, 192, 204, 240, 255, 256, 257, 272... 

There are known to be an infinitude of constructible regular polygons with an even number of sides (because if a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible, then so is a regular 2&quot;n&quot;-gon and hence a regular 4&quot;n&quot;-gon, 8&quot;n&quot;-gon, etc.). However, there are only 5 known Fermat primes, giving only 31 known constructible regular &quot;n&quot;-gons with an odd number of sides.

==Constructing a triangle from three given characteristic points or lengths==

Sixteen key points of a triangle are its vertices, the midpoints of its sides, the feet of its altitudes, the feet of its internal angle bisectors, and its circumcenter, centroid, orthocenter, and incenter. These can be taken three at a time to yield 139 distinct nontrivial problems of constructing a triangle from three points. Of these problems, three involve a point that can be uniquely constructed from the other two points; 23 can be non-uniquely constructed (in fact for infinitely many solutions) but only if the locations of the points obey certain constraints; in 74 the problem is constructible in the general case; and in 39 the required triangle exists but is not constructible.

Twelve key lengths of a triangle are the three side lengths, the three altitudes, the three medians, and the three angle bisectors. Together with the three angles, these give 95 distinct combinations, 63 of which give rise to a constructible triangle, 30 of which do not, and two of which are underdefined.

== Restricted constructions ==
Various attempts have been made to restrict the allowable tools for constructions under various rules, in order to determine what is still constructible and how it may be constructed, as well as determining the minimum criteria necessary to still be able to construct everything that compass and straightedge can.

===Constructing with only ruler or only compass===
It is possible (according to the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem) to construct anything with just a compass if it can be constructed with a ruler and compass, provided that the given data and the data to be found consist of discrete points (not lines or circles). The truth of this theorem depends on the truth of Archimedes&#x27; axiom, which is not first-order in nature. Examples of compass-only constructions include Napoleon&#x27;s problem.

It is impossible to take a square root with just a ruler, so some things that cannot be constructed with a ruler can be constructed with a compass; but (by the Poncelet–Steiner theorem) given a single circle and its center, they can be constructed.

==Extended constructions==
The ancient Greeks classified constructions into three major categories, depending on the complexity of the tools required for their solution. If a construction used only a straightedge and compass, it was called planar; if it also required one or more conic sections (other than the circle), then it was called solid; the third category included all constructions that did not fall into either of the other two categories. This categorization meshes nicely with the modern algebraic point of view. A complex number that can be expressed using only the field operations and square roots (as described above) has a planar construction. A complex number that includes also the extraction of cube roots has a solid construction.

In the language of fields, a complex number that is planar has degree a power of two, and lies in a field extension that can be broken down into a tower of fields where each extension has degree two. A complex number that has a solid construction has degree with prime factors of only two and three, and lies in a field extension that is at the top of a tower of fields where each extension has degree 2 or 3.

===Solid constructions===
A point has a solid construction if it can be constructed using a straightedge, compass, and a (possibly hypothetical) conic drawing tool that can draw any conic with already constructed focus, directrix, and eccentricity. The same set of points can often be constructed using a smaller set of tools. For example, using a compass, straightedge, and a piece of paper on which we have the parabola y=x2 together with the points (0,0) and (1,0), one can construct any complex number that has a solid construction. Likewise, a tool that can draw any ellipse with already constructed foci and major axis (think two pins and a piece of string) is just as powerful.

The ancient Greeks knew that doubling the cube and trisecting an arbitrary angle both had solid constructions. Archimedes gave a neusis construction of the regular heptagon, which was interpreted by medieval Arabic commentators, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, and others as being based on a solid construction, but this has been disputed, as other interpretations are possible. The quadrature of the circle does not have a solid construction.

A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon has a solid construction if and only if &quot;n&quot;=2&quot;a&quot;3&quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are some non-negative integers and &quot;m&quot; is a product of zero or more distinct Pierpont primes (primes of the form 2&quot;r&quot;3&quot;s&quot;+1). Therefore, regular &quot;n&quot;-gon admits a solid, but not planar, construction if and only if &quot;n&quot; is in the sequence
:7, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 26, 27, 28, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 45, 52, 54, 56, 57, 63, 65, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 81, 84, 90, 91, 95, 97... 

The set of &quot;n&quot; for which a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon has no solid construction is the sequence

:11, 22, 23, 25, 29, 31, 33, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 53, 55, 58, 59, 61, 62, 66, 67, 69, 71, 75, 77, 79, 82, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 92, 93, 94, 98, 99, 100... 

Like the question with Fermat primes, it is an open question as to whether there are an infinite number of Pierpont primes.

===Angle trisection=== 
What if, together with the straightedge and compass, we had a tool that could (only) trisect an arbitrary angle? Such constructions are solid constructions, but there exist numbers with solid constructions that cannot be constructed using such a tool. For example, we cannot double the cube with such a tool. On the other hand, every regular n-gon that has a solid construction can be constructed using such a tool.

===Origami===

The mathematical theory of origami is more powerful than straightedge-and-compass construction. Folds satisfying the Huzita–Hatori axioms can construct exactly the same set of points as the extended constructions using a compass and conic drawing tool. Therefore, origami can also be used to solve cubic equations (and hence quartic equations), and thus solve two of the classical problems.

===Markable rulers===

Archimedes, Nicomedes and Apollonius gave constructions involving the use of a markable ruler. This would permit them, for example, to take a line segment, two lines (or circles), and a point; and then draw a line which passes through the given point and intersects the two given lines, such that the distance between the points of intersection equals the given segment. This the Greeks called &quot;neusis&quot; (&quot;inclination&quot;, &quot;tendency&quot; or &quot;verging&quot;), because the new line &quot;tends&quot; to the point.
In this expanded scheme, we can trisect an arbitrary angle (see Archimedes&#x27; trisection) or extract an arbitrary cube root (due to Nicomedes). Hence, any distance whose ratio to an existing distance is the solution of a cubic or a quartic equation is constructible. Using a markable ruler, regular polygons with solid constructions, like the heptagon, are constructible; and John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy give constructions for several of them.

The neusis construction is more powerful than a conic drawing tool, as one can construct complex numbers that do not have solid constructions. In fact, using this tool one can solve some quintics that are not solvable using radicals. It is known that one cannot solve an irreducible polynomial of prime degree greater or equal to 7 using the neusis construction, so it is not possible to construct a regular 23-gon or 29-gon using this tool. Benjamin and Snyder proved that it is possible to construct the regular 11-gon, but did not give a construction. It is still open as to whether a regular 25-gon or 31-gon is constructible using this tool.

===Trisect a straight segment===

Given a straight line segment called AB, could this be divided in three new equal segments and in many parts required by the use of intercept theorem.

==Computation of binary digits==
In 1998 Simon Plouffe gave a ruler-and-compass algorithm that can be used to compute binary digits of certain numbers.
The algorithm involves the repeated doubling of an angle and becomes physically impractical after about 20 binary digits.

<text>Candy, alternatively called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, also called &quot;sugar confectionery&quot;, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be &quot;candied&quot;.

Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.

==History==
The word candy entered the English language from the Old French &quot;çucre candi&quot; (&quot;sugar candy&quot;). The French term probably has earlier roots in the Arabic &quot;qandi&quot;, Persian &quot;qand&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;khanda&quot;, all words for sugar.

Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia. Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient India and consumed as &quot;khanda&quot;. Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the people in India and their &quot;reeds that produce honey without bees&quot;. They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture.

Before sugar was readily available, candy was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China, the Middle East, Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create forms of candy. Candy is still served in this form today, though now it is more typically seen as a type of garnish.

Before the Industrial Revolution, candy was often considered a form of medicine, either used to calm the digestive system or cool a sore throat. In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar used as an aid to digestion. Banquet hosts typically served these types of &#x27;candies&#x27; at banquets for their guests. One of these candies, sometimes called &quot;chamber spice&quot;, was made with cloves, ginger, aniseed, juniper berries, almonds and pine kernels dipped in melted sugar.

The Middle English word &quot;candy&quot; began to be used in the late 13th century.

The first candy came to America during the early 18th century from Britain and France. Only a few of the early colonists were proficient in sugar work and sugary treats were generally only enjoyed by the very wealthy. Even the simplest form of candy – rock candy, made from crystallized sugar – was considered a luxury.

===Industrial Revolution===

The candy business underwent a drastic change in the 1830s when technological advances and the availability of sugar opened up the market. The new market was not only for the enjoyment of the rich but also for the pleasure of the working class. There was also an increasing market for children. While some fine confectioners remained, the candy store became a favorite of the child of the American working class. Penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy. Penny candy became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason, candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating.

In 1847, the invention of the candy press (also known under the surprising name of a &quot;toy machine&quot;) made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once. In 1851, confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business.
As the path from producer to market became increasingly complicated, many foods were affected by adulteration and the addition of additives which ranged from relatively harmless ingredients, such as cheap cornstarch and corn syrup, to poisonous ones. Some manufacturers produced bright colors in candy by the addition of hazardous substances for which there was no legal regulation: green (chromium(III) oxide and copper acetate), red (lead(II,IV) oxide and mercury sulfide), yellow (lead chromate) and white (chalk, arsenic trioxide).

In an 1885 cover cartoon for &quot;Puck&quot;, Joseph Keppler satirized the dangers of additives in candy by depicting the &quot;mutual friendship&quot; between striped candy, doctors, and gravediggers. By 1906, research into the dangers of additives, exposés of the food industry, and public pressure led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, the first federal United States law to regulate food and drugs, including candy.

==Classification==
Sugar candies include hard candies, soft candies, caramels, marshmallows, taffy, and other candies whose principal ingredient is sugar. Commercially, sugar candies are often divided into groups according to the amount of sugar they contain and their chemical structure.

Hard-boiled candies made by the vacuum cooking process include stick candy, lemon drops and horehound drops. Open-fire candy, like molasses taffy and cream taffy, is cooked in open kettles and then pulled. Pan work candies include nuts and other candies like jelly beans and sugar-coated almonds, made by coating with sugar in revolving copper kettles. Gum work candy is cooked in large kettles fashioned for melting and molded, dried and sugared like gum drops. They are soaked for a time in sugar syrup to allow crystals to form.

Sugar candies can be classified into noncrystalline and crystalline types. Noncrystalline candies are homogeneous and may be chewy or hard; they include hard candies, caramels, toffees, and nougats. Crystalline candies incorporate small crystals in their structure, are creamy that melt in the mouth or are easily chewed; they include fondant and fudge. In 2022, flavorless candy was developed that was hard but not sweet.
Chocolate is sometimes treated as a separate branch of confectionery. In this model, chocolate candies like chocolate candy bars and chocolate truffles are included. Hot chocolate or other cocoa-based drinks are excluded, as is candy made from white chocolate. When chocolate is treated as a separate branch, it also includes confections whose classification is otherwise difficult, being neither exactly candies nor exactly baked goods, like chocolate-dipped foods, tarts with chocolate shells, and chocolate-coated cookies.

==Production==


Sugar candy is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a syrup, which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to caramelize. Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle. The texture of candy depends on the ingredients and the temperatures that the candy is processed at.

The final texture of sugar candy depends primarily on the concentration of sugar. As the syrup is heated, it boils, water evaporates, the sugar concentration increases and the boiling point rises. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration. These are called sugar stages. In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies. Once the syrup reaches or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an amber-colored substance known as caramel. This should not be confused with caramel candy, although it is the candy&#x27;s main flavoring.

Most candies are made commercially. The industry relies significantly on trade secret protection, because candy recipes cannot be copyrighted or patented effectively, but are very difficult to duplicate exactly. Seemingly minor differences in the machinery, temperature, or timing of the candy-making process can cause noticeable differences in the final product.

==Packaging==

&quot;Candy wrapper&quot; or &quot;sweets wrapper&quot; is a common term for this packaging.

===Purposes of packaging===
Packaging preserves aroma and flavor and eases shipping and dispensation. Wax paper seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while cellophane is valued by packagers for its transparency and resistance to grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. Polyethylene is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material is often used to make bags in bulk packaging. Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. Cardboard cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.

Packages are often sealed with a starch-based adhesive derived from tapioca, potato, wheat, sago, or sweet potato. Occasionally, glues are made from the bones and skin of cattle and hogs for a stronger and more flexible product, but this is not as common because of the expense.

===History===
Prior to the 1900s, candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street, where it was exposed to dirt and insects. By 1914, there were some machines to wrap gum and stick candies, but this was not the common practice. After the polio outbreak in 1916, unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs. At the time, only upscale candy stores used glass jars. With advancements in technology, wax paper was adopted, and foil and cellophane were imported to the U.S. from France by DuPont in 1925. Necco packagers were one of the first companies to package without human touch. Kiosks and vending machines were introduced around the beginning of the 20th century.

Candy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during trick-or-treating for Halloween in the US. In the 1940s, most treats were homemade. During the 1950s, small, individually wrapped candies were recognized as convenient and inexpensive. By the 1970s, after widely publicized but largely false stories of poisoned candy myths circulating in the popular press, factory-sealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a sign of safety.

===Marketing and design===
Packaging helps market the product as well. Manufacturers know that candy must be hygienic and attractive to customers. In the children&#x27;s market quantity, novelty, large size and bright colors are the top sellers. Many companies redesign the packaging to maintain consumer appeal.

==Shelf life==
Because of its high sugar concentration, bacteria are not usually able to grow in candy. As a result, the shelf life is longer for candy than for many other foods. Most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at room temperature in a dry, dark cupboard for months or years. As a rule, the softer the candy or the damper the storage area, the sooner it goes stale.

Shelf life considerations with most candies are focused on appearance, taste, and texture, rather than about the potential for food poisoning; that is, old candy may not look appealing or taste very good, even though it is very unlikely to make the eater sick. Candy can be made unsafe by storing it badly, such as in a wet, moldy area. Typical recommendations are these:
* Hard candy may last indefinitely in good storage conditions.
*Dark chocolate lasts up to two years.
*Milk chocolates and caramels usually become stale after about one year.
* Soft or creamy candies, like candy corn, may last 8 to 10 months in ideal conditions.
* Chewing gum and gumballs may stay fresh as long as 8 months after manufacture.

==Nutrition==

Most sugar candies are defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.

Even in a culture that eats sweets frequently, candy is not a significant source of nutrition or food energy for most people. The average American eats about 1.1 kg (2.5 pounds) of sugar or similar sweeteners each week, but almost 95% of that sugar—all but about 70 grams (2.5 ounces)—comes from non-candy sources, especially soft drinks and processed foods.

===Meal replacements===
Candy is considered a source of empty calories, because it provides little or no nutritional value beyond food energy. At the start of the 20th century, when undernutrition was a serious problem, especially among poor and working-class people, and when nutrition science was a new field, the high calorie content was promoted as a virtue. Researchers suggested that candy, especially candy made with milk and nuts, was a low-cost alternative to normal meals. To get the food energy necessary for a day of labor, candy might cost half as much as eggs. During the 1920s and 1930s, candy bars selling for five cents were often marketed as replacements for lunch.

At the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to Cracker Jack&#x27;s candy-coated popcorn. The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated breakfast cereal. Post Foods introduced their own version in 1948, originally called Happy Jax and later Sugar Crisp. They marketed it as both a replacement for unsweetened breakfast cereals and also for eating as a snack or as candy, using three animated cartoon bears as the mascots: Candy, Handy, and Dandy. The early slogans said, &quot;As a cereal it&#x27;s dandy—for snacks it&#x27;s so handy—or eat it like candy!&quot;

In more recent times, a variety of snack bars have been marketed. These include bars that are intended as meal replacements as well as snack bars that are marketed as having nutritional advantages when compared to candy bars, such as granola bars. However, the actual nutritional value is often not very different from candy bars, except for usually a higher sodium content, and the flavors (most popularly, chocolate, fudge, and caramel) and the presentation mimic candy bars.

Among the Bengali people, candy may be eaten for an entire meal, especially during festivals. Candy may also be offered to vegetarian guests in lieu of fish or meat dishes in India.

===Vegetarianism===
Most candy contains no meat or other animal parts, and many contain no milk or other animal products. Some candy, including marshmallows and gummi bears, contains gelatin derived from animal collagen, a protein found in skin and bones, and is thus avoided by vegans and some vegetarians. &quot;Kosher gelatin&quot; is also unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans, as it is derived from fish bones. Other substances, such as agar, pectin, starch and gum arabic may also be used as setting and gelling agents, and can be used in place of gelatin.

Other ingredients commonly found in candy that are not suitable for vegetarian or vegan diets include carmine, a red dye made from cochineal beetles, and confectioner&#x27;s glaze, which contains shellac, a resin excreted by female lac bugs.

==Health effects==

===Cavities===
Candy generally contains sugar, which is a key environmental factor in the formation of dental caries (cavities). Several types of bacteria commonly found in the mouth consume sugar, particularly &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;. When these bacteria metabolize the sugar found in most candies, juice, or other sugary foods, they produce acids in the mouth that demineralize the tooth enamel and can lead to dental caries. Heavy or frequent consumption of high-sugar foods, especially lollipops, sugary cough drops, and other sugar-based candies that stay in the mouth for a long time, increases the risk of tooth decay. Candies that also contain enamel-dissolving acids, such as acid drops, increase the risk. Cleaning the teeth and mouth shortly after eating any type of sugary food, and allowing several hours to pass between eating such foods, reduces the risk and improves oral health.

However, frequent consumption of fruits and fruit juice, which contain both acid and sugars, may be a more significant factor in dental decay than candies.

The link between candy and caries was formally identified through the Vipeholm experiments, where intellectually disabled people were fed copious amounts of candy and were found to develop poor dental health. The experiments are today considered to have violated multiple principles of medical ethics.

===Glycemic index===
Most candy, particularly low-fat and fat-free candy, has a high glycemic index (GI), which means that it causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels after ingestion. This is chiefly a concern for people with diabetes, but could also be dangerous to the health of non-diabetics.

===Contamination===
Some kinds of candy have been contaminated with an excessive amount of lead in it. Claims of contamination have been made since shortly after industrial-scale candy factories began producing candy in the mid-19th century, although these early claims were rarely true.

Contamination by infectious agents such as virus or bacteria is unlikely through sweets, including unwrapped sweets. This is in part because bacteria can not replicate in the very dry and sweet environment of candy.

===Choking deaths===

Hard, round candies are a leading cause of choking deaths in children. Some types of candy, such as Lychee Mini Fruity Gels, have been associated with so many choking deaths that their import or manufacture is banned by some countries.

Non-nutritive toy products such as chocolate eggs containing packaging with a toy inside are banned from sale in the US. If the material attached to confectionery has a function and will not cause any injury to the consumer, it is allowed to be marketed. In the EU, however, the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC specifies that toys contained in food only need separate packaging that cannot be swallowed.

==Sales==
Global sales of candies were estimated to have been approximately US$118 billion in 2012. In the United States, $2 is spent on chocolate for every $1 spent on non-chocolate candy.

Because each culture varies in how it treats some foods, a food may be considered a candy in one place and a dessert in another. For example, in Western countries, baklava is served on a plate and eaten with a fork as a dessert, but in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe, it is treated as a candy.

==Cultural significance==
Candy is the source of several cultural themes.

Adults worry that other people will use candy to poison or entice children into harmful situations. Stranger danger warnings include telling children not to take candy from strangers, for fear of the child being abducted. Poisoned candy myths persist in popular culture, especially around trick-or-treating at Halloween, despite the rarity of actual incidents.

The phrase is a common simile, and means that something is very easy to do.

A 1959 Swedish dental health campaign encouraged people to reduce the risk of dental problems by limiting consumption of candy to once a week. The slogan, &quot;All the sweets you want, but only once a week&quot;, started a tradition of buying candy every Saturday, called &quot;lördagsgodis&quot; (literally &quot;Saturday candy&quot;).

== Holidays ==

=== Association with Halloween ===

To this day, the process of going door to door to receive free candy during Halloween-time has become a major draw for children all across America. Children across the country dress up in costume and go door to door. In turn, the residents of each house graciously buy candy for children and hand it out in small increments. Just as it had been in the mid-1970s, the main form of candy that is passed out is pre-packaged sweets. Parents feel much more easy minded allowing their children to eat pre-packaged candies because of the quality control that comes with each product. As a result, name brand candies have become a staple for Halloween and trick-or-treating up to the present. Some candies continue to be popular with trick-or-treaters, such as Reese&#x27;s Cups, Kit Kat, and Snickers, which were the top three Halloween candies of 2022.

The tradition of handing out treats on Halloween originated from the holiday of All Hallows Day, or All Saints Day, which derives from Christian tradition. On this day, children would travel across town, saying prayers along the way. These children prayed mainly for all people who had died. In between their prayers, these children would also arrive at the doorsteps of people within their town. As a reward for their actions, they were given homemade cakes referred to as soul cakes, made by the homeowners. These soul cakes resembled a form of biscuit and were usually filled with raisins or cinnamon among other ingredients. Many cakes were also given to the poor during this time. The soul cakes gave these children the incentive to pray intensely in exchange for sweets.

The idea of providing trick-or-treaters with candy was not fully conceptualized until the 1950s. Up until that point many households continued to provide children with soul cakes among other homemade goods. However, it was discovered by numerous candy producers that the holiday of Halloween could be marketed to sell their products. As a result, many households began to buy candy products. The main draw to these candy products were that they were inexpensive, took no time to prepare, and came in bulk. Nevertheless, candy would not completely take over until the 1970s. Up until that point, givers would continue to make treats or package small toys and coins specifically for Halloween.

The main cause for the shift from homemade treats to pre-packaged candies was the result of speculation concerning tampered food. Many parents during this time were concerned that their children were being exposed to needles or toxic chemicals within their halloween goods. The lack of packaging made it much easier for a person to put dangerous substances into the food they were planning to give out. These worries were heightened because of a large number of false reports concerning medical attention relating to dangerous halloween treats. As a result, parents became much more likely to allow their children to participate in Halloween festivities when packed candy was introduced. They noticed that it would be much harder for a person to tamper with factory packaged sweets because the seal would be torn. It would be too noticeable if someone tried to affect the product.

Judging from recent statistics, it is evident that Halloween candy is still at high demand. In 2021 alone, profits from halloween candy were up to at least &quot;$324 million&quot;. From the same report, the demand for halloween candy was &quot;up 59.8% from 2019&quot;. From these numbers it can be presumed that Halloween is still a big deal for Americans. An even bigger deal for the American public is the act of receiving candy from trick-or-treating. Candy continues to be a staple for the Halloween season and remains the biggest draw for participation.

<text>Historical [[county|counties]] and [[territory|territories]] in [[Quebec]], Canada, and their county seats are listed below. The list is alphabetized by county, but can also be alphabetized by seat.

In terms of internal division, there are four types of counties:
# Those that contain only townships, as do counties surveyed by the British after 1763.
# Those that contain only parishes, as do counties chiefly in the Saint Lawrence Valley settled by French colonists before 1761.
# Those that each contain both townships and parishes.
# Those that each contain townships and undivided lands, as do the northern counties outside the main populated areas of the province.

Parishes as a land unit division arise from the elevation of municipalities based on religious parish limits (parish municipalities). Quebec&#x27;s counties were dissolved in the early 1980s and Quebec was then divided into regional county municipalities.

*Abitibi Territory
*Mistassini Territory
*Nouveau-Quebec Territory

==Renamed counties==
* Laval County – Former name of Ile-Jésus County.
* Jacques Cartier County – Renamed in 1970. Former name of Ile-de-Montréal County. It absorbed Hochelaga County in 1921.
* Ottawa County – Former name of Hull County.
* Wright County – Former name of Ottawa County.

<doc id="61255" wikidata="Q419061" url="?curid=61255" title="Bacterial artificial chromosome">
<text>A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) is a DNA construct, based on a functional fertility plasmid (or F-plasmid), used for transforming and cloning in bacteria, usually &quot;E. coli&quot;. F-plasmids play a crucial role because they contain partition genes that promote the even distribution of plasmids after bacterial cell division. The bacterial artificial chromosome&#x27;s usual insert size is 150–350 kbp. A similar cloning vector called a PAC has also been produced from the DNA of P1 bacteriophage.

BACs were often used to sequence the genomes of organisms in genome projects, for example the Human Genome Project, though they have been replaced by more modern technologies. In BAC sequencing, short piece of the organism&#x27;s DNA is amplified as an insert in BACs, and then sequenced. Finally, the sequenced parts are rearranged &quot;in silico&quot;, resulting in the genomic sequence of the organism. BACs were replaced with faster and less laborious sequencing methods like whole genome shotgun sequencing and now more recently next-gen sequencing.

==Common gene components==
;&quot;repE&quot;: for plasmid replication and regulation of copy number.
;&quot;parA and parB&quot;: for partitioning F plasmid DNA to daughter cells during division and ensures stable maintenance of the BAC.
;A selectable marker: for antibiotic resistance; some BACs also have lacZ at the cloning site for blue/white selection.
;&quot;T7 &amp; Sp6&quot;: phage promoters for transcription of inserted genes.

==Disease modeling==

===Inherited===
BACs are now being utilized to a greater extent in modeling genetic disease, often alongside transgenic mice. BACs have been useful in this field as complex genes may have several regulatory sequences upstream of the encoding sequence, including various promoter sequences that will govern a gene&#x27;s expression level. BACs have been used to some degree of success with mice when studying neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or as in the case of aneuploidy associated with Down syndrome. There have also been instances when they have been used to study specific oncogenes associated with cancers. They are transferred over to these genetic disease models by electroporation/transformation, transfection with a suitable virus or microinjection. BACs can also be utilized to detect genes or large sequences of interest and then used to map them onto the human chromosome using BAC arrays. BACs are preferred for these kind of genetic studies because they accommodate much larger sequences without the risk of rearrangement, and are therefore more stable than other types of cloning vectors.

===Infectious===
The genomes of several large DNA viruses and RNA viruses have been cloned as BACs. These constructs are referred to as &quot;infectious clones&quot;, as transfection of the BAC construct into host cells is sufficient to initiate viral infection. The infectious property of these BACs has made the study of many viruses such as the herpesviruses, poxviruses and coronaviruses more accessible. Molecular studies of these viruses can now be achieved using genetic approaches to mutate the BAC while it resides in bacteria. Such genetic approaches rely on either linear or circular targeting vectors to carry out homologous recombination.

<text>Rodney Stephen Steiger ( ; April 14, 1925 – July 9, 2002) was an American actor, noted for his portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. Ranked as &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most charismatic and dynamic stars&quot;, he is closely associated with the art of method acting, embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. He starred as Marlon Brando&#x27;s mobster brother Charley in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964) which won him the Silver Bear for Best Actor, and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite Sidney Poitier in the film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967) which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Steiger was born in Westhampton, New York, the son of a vaudevillian. He had a difficult childhood, running away from home to escape an alcoholic mother at the age of 16. After serving in the South Pacific during World War II, he began his acting career with television roles in 1947, and went on to garner critical acclaim for his portrayal of the main character in the teleplay &quot;Marty&quot; (1953). He made his stage debut in 1946, in a production of &quot;Curse you, Jack Dalton!&quot; at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark, and subsequently appeared in productions such as &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (1950), Clifford Odets&#x27;s &quot;Night Music&quot; (1951), &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; (1952), and &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1959).

Steiger made his film debut in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;Teresa&quot; in 1951, and subsequently appeared in films such as &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955), &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;Jubal&quot; (1956), &quot;Across the Bridge&quot; (1957), and &quot;Al Capone&quot; (1959). After his performance in &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;.

During the 1970s, Steiger increasingly turned to European productions in his search for more demanding roles. He portrayed Napoleon Bonaparte in &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970), a Mexican bandit in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; (1971), Benito Mussolini in &quot;Last Days of Mussolini&quot; (1975), and ended the decade playing a disturbed priest in&quot; The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979). By the 1980s, heart problems and depression took their toll on Steiger&#x27;s career, and he found it difficult to find employment, agreeing to appear in low-budget B movies. One of his final roles was as judge H. Lee Sarokin in the prison drama &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999), which reunited him with &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; director Norman Jewison. Steiger was married five times, and had a daughter, opera singer Anna Steiger, and a son, Michael Steiger. He died of pneumonia and kidney failure as a result of complications from surgery for a gallbladder tumor in 2002, aged 77, in Los Angeles. His fifth wife was Joan Benedict Steiger.

==Early life and acting background==

Steiger was born on April 14, 1925, in Westhampton, New York, the only child of Lorraine (née Driver) and Frederick Steiger, of French, Scottish, and German descent. Rod was raised as a Lutheran. He never knew his father, a vaudevillian who had been part of a travelling song-and-dance team with Steiger&#x27;s mother, but was told that he was a handsome Latino-looking man, who was a talented musician and dancer. Biographer Tom Hutchinson describes him as a &quot;shadowy, fugitive figure&quot;, one who &quot;haunted&quot; Rod throughout his life and was an &quot;invisible presence and unseen influence&quot;.

Hutchinson described Steiger&#x27;s mother as &quot;plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair&quot;. She had a good singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other children and their parents within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: &quot;If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would you take? A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute&quot;. During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger&#x27;s mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: &quot;I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again&quot;.

During his childhood, and owing to his considerable strength and bulk, Steiger became known as &quot;The Rock&quot;. Despite being mocked over his mother&#x27;s alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he ran away from home at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II.

He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the US Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS &quot;Taussig&quot; (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: &quot;I loved the Navy. I was stupid enough to think I was being heroic.&quot; His experiences during the war haunted him for the rest of his life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the &quot;Taussig&quot; which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the &quot;Taussig&quot; encountered Typhoon Cobra, which became known as &quot;Halsey&#x27;s Typhoon&quot;, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115 mph) and waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the &quot;Taussig&quot; survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.

After the war, the GI Bill paid for his rent at a room on West 81st Street in New York City, an income of just over $100 a month, and four years of schooling. He initially found a job oiling machines and washing floors. He decided to attend a drama class, primarily because of its membership of attractive young women. Known as the Civil Service Little Theater group, it was conducted by the Office of Dependents and Beneficiaries, where he was employed at the time. This led him to start a two-year course at the New School for Social Research, run by German émigré Erwin Piscator. During one audition, Steiger was cast after barely uttering a few words, the director exclaiming he had a &quot;fresh, wonderful quality&quot;. Another talented pupil at the time was Walter Matthau, who dubbed the institution &quot;The Neurotic School for Sexual Research&quot;. Steiger was surprised to discover his own talent as an actor, and he was encouraged to pursue further studies at the Dramatic Workshop. One of the main reasons he wanted to be an actor was to regain public respect for his family name, which had so humiliated him during childhood. Another important factor was his belief that he did not &quot;have the temperament for a regular job&quot;, and would have ended up a miserable, violent alcoholic. His only role model as an actor was Paul Muni, who he thought was &quot;the greatest&quot;, although he also had a deep respect for French actor Harry Baur and, according to biographer Hutchinson, he admired Charlie Chaplin &quot;to the point of adoration&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career and breakthrough (1946–1956)===
Steiger made his stage debut in a production of &quot;Curse you, Jack Dalton!&quot; (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation from one of his teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger&#x27;s stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; at the Music Box Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets&#x27;s production of &quot;Night Music&quot; (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot;, performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.

Steiger&#x27;s early roles, although minor, were numerous, especially in television series during the early 1950s, when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five-year period. He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBC&#x27;s manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation, and saw it as a place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles. Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as John Crosby, who noted that Steiger regularly gave &quot;effortless persuasive performances&quot;. Among Steiger&#x27;s credits were &quot;Danger&quot; (1950–53), &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (1951), &quot;Out There&quot; (1951), &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; (1952–53), &quot;The Gulf Playhouse&quot; (1953), &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot; (1953), &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; (1953), and as Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo in &quot;The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet (1957)&quot; episode of &quot;You Are There&quot; in 1954, under director Sidney Lumet. He continued to make appearances in various playhouse television productions, appearing in five episodes of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; (1952–54), which earned him praise from critics, six episodes of &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; (1951–55) and two episodes of &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; (1957–58). Steiger made his big screen debut in 1953, with a small role in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;Teresa&quot;, shot in 1951. Steiger, who described himself as &quot;cocky&quot;, won over Zinnemann by praising his direction. Zinnemann recalled that Steiger was &quot;very popular, extremely articulate and full of remarkable memories&quot;, and the two remained highly respectful of each other for life.

On May 24, 1953, Steiger played the title role in Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Marty&quot; episode of the Goodyear Television Playhouse. The role had originally been intended for Martin Ritt, who later became a director. &quot;Marty&quot; is the story of a lonely and homely butcher from the Bronx in search of love. The play was a critical success that increased Steiger&#x27;s public exposure; Tom Stempel noted that he brought &quot;striking intensity to his performance as Marty, particularly in giving us Marty&#x27;s pain&quot;. As Steiger refused to sign a seven-year studio contract, he was replaced with Ernest Borgnine in the film &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as the Best Actor Oscar for Borgnine. 1953 proved to be Steiger&#x27;s breakthrough year; he garnered Sylvania Awards for &quot;Marty&quot; and four other best performances of the year—as Vishinsky and Rudolf Hess in two episodes of &quot;You Are There&quot;, as gangster Dutch Schultz in a thriller, and as a radar operator in &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;.

For his role as Charley &quot;the Gent&quot;, the brother of Marlon Brando&#x27;s character in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the &quot;incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic&quot;. The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Although Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked him as a person and frequently complained during the production of Brando&#x27;s &quot;predilection for leaving the set&quot; immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: &quot;We didn&#x27;t get to know each other at all. He always flew solo and I haven&#x27;t seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he&#x27;s just a hooker, and that actors are whores&quot;. Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with &quot;BBC News&quot;, Steiger said he probably would not have done &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; if he&#x27;d known at the time that Kazan had provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.

Steiger played Jud Fry in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), in which he performed his own singing. It was one of the biggest location film productions of the 1950s, shot near Nogales, Arizona with a crew of 325 people and some 70 trucks. Steiger portrayed a disturbed, emotionally isolated version of Jud, which television channel Turner Classic Movies (TCM) believed brought a &quot;complexity to the character that went far beyond the stock musical villain&quot;. Steiger observed that James Dean, who auditioned for the role that went to Gordon MacRae, was a &quot;nice kid absorbed by his own ego, so much so that it was destroying him&quot;, which he thought led to his death. Dean reportedly gave Steiger his prized copy of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s book &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;, and had underlined every appearance of the word &quot;death&quot;.

Later in 1955, Steiger played an obnoxious film tycoon, loosely based on Columbia boss Harry Cohn, opposite Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s film noir &quot;The Big Knife&quot;. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read a book about the Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character&#x27;s contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling that he was trying to steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot;, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.

Steiger portrayed the character &quot;Pinky&quot; in Columbia Pictures&#x27; western, &quot;Jubal&quot; (1956), which co-starred Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine. Steiger&#x27;s character is a rancher, a &quot;sneering baddie&quot;, who becomes jealous when his former mistress becomes attracted to Ford&#x27;s character. Ford noted Steiger&#x27;s deep commitment to method acting during production, considering him to be a &quot;fine actor but a real strange fellow&quot;. Steiger disliked the experience and frequently clashed with director Delmer Daves, who was more favorable to Ford&#x27;s lighthearted take on the film. Upon its release in April 1956, a writer for &quot;Variety&quot; was impressed with the &quot;evil venom&quot; displayed by his character, and remarked that there had not &quot;been as hateful a screen heavy around in a long time&quot;.

In Mark Robson&#x27;s &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;, Steiger played a crooked boxing promoter who hires a sports journalist (Humphrey Bogart in his last role). Steiger referred to Bogart as &quot;a professional&quot; who had &quot;tremendous authority&quot; during filming.

===Struggling actor (1957–1963)===

Steiger appeared in three films released in 1957. The first was John Farrow&#x27;s film noir &quot;The Unholy Wife&quot;, in which he played a wealthy Napa Valley vintner who marries a &quot;femme fatale&quot; named Phyllis (Diana Dors). In its original review of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Steiger&#x27;s performance as &quot;curious&quot; further stating that the actor&#x27;s voice modulation &quot;ranges from Marlon Brando to Ronald Colman and back&quot;. During the production of Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot;, in which he played a Confederate army veteran who refuses to accept defeat following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox at the end of the American Civil War, Steiger badly sprained his ankle before shooting one of the battle scenes and was unable to walk, let alone run. Fuller instead got one of the Native American extras to run in Steiger&#x27;s place, which is why the scene was shot showing only the feet, instead of using close-ups. Steiger had researched the history behind the film and decided to play the character as an Irishman, becoming &quot;the first Irish cowboy&quot; as he put it. Later that year, Steiger took the lead role in the British thriller &quot;Across the Bridge&quot;, in which he played a German conman with British citizenship who goes into hiding in Mexico after embezzling company funds. Film critic Dennis Schwartz stated that Steiger gave &quot;one of his greatest performances&quot;.

Steiger portrayed a mastermind criminal seeking to obtain a $500,000 ransom, opposite James Mason and Inger Stevens, in Andrew L. Stone&#x27;s &quot;Cry Terror!&quot; (1958) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paul Beckley of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; had thought Steiger &quot;superbly laconic&quot;, but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as &quot;an ill-conceived attempt&quot; with &quot;too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest&quot;. The following year, Steiger appeared with Claire Bloom (whom he later married) in a Fay and Michael Kanin stage production of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1950 film, &quot;Rashomon&quot;, where he enacted the role of the bandit originally played by Toshiro Mifune. A major success, it was lauded by critics and nominated for three Tony Awards. Robert Coleman of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; described Steiger&#x27;s performance as &quot;magnificently animalish&quot;, while Kenneth Tynan of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway. The same year, Steiger portrayed iconic mobster Al Capone in the film of the same name. Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the showiness of Capone, speaking thunderously, slinging a camel-hair coat over his shoulders and wearing his hat at a jaunty angle. The film, noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject, earned Steiger a Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance nomination. Although Hutchinson, author of &quot;Rod Steiger: Memoirs of a friendship&quot;, perceived Steiger&#x27;s portrayal of Capone to be more of a caricature, George Anastasia and Glen Macnow, authors of the book &quot;The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies&quot;, described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone.

Following the success of &quot;Al Capone&quot;, Steiger played sophisticated thief Paul Mason, who masterminds a caper to steal $4 million in French francs from the underground vault of the casino of Monte Carlo, in the Henry Hathaway heist film &quot;Seven Thieves&quot; (1960). Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a positive review of the film, praising the &quot;nerve-rackingly delicate plot&quot; and the &quot;most elaborate roles&quot; of Steiger and his co-star, Edward G. Robinson. The following year, he took the part of a prison psychiatrist who tries to cure the psychological demons of Stuart Whitman&#x27;s character in &quot;The Mark&quot;. Steiger&#x27;s performance was so convincing that, after the film was released, he received a call from a psychiatric institution asking him to attend one of their board meetings. &quot;The Mark&quot; was followed by a role in the European film production of &quot;World in My Pocket&quot; alongside Nadja Tiller. Steiger increasingly played in films in Italy and France during this period. Not only did he believe he had greater credibility and esteem as an actor in Europe, but he approved of the more relaxed filming schedule prevalent there at that time.

In 1962, Steiger appeared on Broadway in &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot;, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, as well as playing a detective searching for a scientist&#x27;s (Alan Ladd) mugger in Philip Leacock&#x27;s &quot;13 West Street&quot; for Columbia Pictures. Steiger played a small role of a destroyer commander among the large ensemble cast of &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had privately admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had a face lift, which Burton thought made him look like &quot;one half of a naked ass-hole&quot;. The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi&#x27;s Italian production, &quot;Hands over the City&quot; (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted &quot;a rich interpreter of great capacity&quot; in the part of the land developer.

===Mainstream film acclaim (1964–1969)===
Shortly after &quot;Hands over the City&quot;, Steiger agreed to appear in another Italian film, &quot;Time of Indifference&quot; (1964), in which he starred opposite Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger&#x27;s powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting it to be a purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet&#x27;s gritty drama &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger&#x27;s career was waning at the time, and he had to &quot;scramble for paying gigs for a decade&quot; before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. He read Edward Lewis Wallant&#x27;s novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: &quot;Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him.&quot;

Steiger remarked of the film: &quot;I think my best work is in &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;. The last scene, where I find the boy dead on the street. I think that&#x27;s the highest moment, whatever it may be, with my talent.&quot; He drew upon inspiration for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, which depicts war-ravaged villagers. Cecil Wilson of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote that Steiger&#x27;s character &quot;seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man&quot;. Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of antisemitism, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance; he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin.

In 1965, Steiger played an effeminate embalmer in Tony Richardson&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Loved One&quot;, about the funeral business in Los Angeles, based on the 1948 short satirical novel by Evelyn Waugh. His curly-haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of Apollo he once saw while meeting Richardson. Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who found his character repellent. His next role, as Komarovsky, a Russian politician and &quot;villainous opportunist&quot; who rapes Julie Christie&#x27;s character in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), was one of his favorites. Steiger, one of only two Americans in the cast, was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness, and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American. The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s, grossing $200 million worldwide. It has since been acclaimed as one of the greatest films ever made, and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list by the American Film Institute.

Steiger had intended returning to the stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot;, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, opposite Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. A stereotypical Southern racist, he jumps to the conclusion that the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger&#x27;s Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named &quot;King&quot;, remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, &quot;He&#x27;s so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had.&quot; A. D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; described Steiger&#x27;s performance as &quot;outstanding&quot;, writing: &quot;Steiger&#x27;s transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder.&quot; Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.

In 1968, Steiger played a serial killer opposite George Segal in Jack Smight&#x27;s black comedy thriller &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;. During the course of the film, he adopts various disguises, including those of an Irish priest, a New York City policeman, a German plumber, and a gay hairdresser, to avoid being identified, and to put his victims at ease, before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick. The film and Steiger&#x27;s performance were critically acclaimed, with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; highlighting Steiger&#x27;s &quot;beautifully uninhibited performance as a hammy&quot;, and a writer for &quot;Time Out&quot; describing him as &quot;brilliant as a sort of Boston strangler, son of a great actress who has left her boy with a mother fixation&quot;.

Later in 1968, Steiger played a repressed gay non-commissioned officer opposite John Phillip Law in John Flynn&#x27;s &quot;The Sergeant&quot; for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which earned him the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor. Despite the award win, film critic Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was particularly critical of the casting of Steiger as a homosexual and felt that he was &quot;totally outside his range&quot;, to which Steiger concurred that he was ineffective.

Steiger was cast as a short-tempered tattooed man with soon-to-be ex-wife Claire Bloom in the science fiction picture &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; (1969). The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Ray Bradbury said: &quot;Rod was very good in it, but it wasn&#x27;t a good film... the script was terrible&quot;. Steiger had better luck alongside Bloom later that year in Peter Hall&#x27;s British drama &quot;Three into Two Won&#x27;t Go&quot;, playing an Irishman who cheats on his wife with a young hiker. It was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival and became the 19th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969.

===Historical roles and declining fortunes (1970–1981)===
Steiger was offered the title role in &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), but turned it down because he did not want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his &quot;dumbest career move&quot;, remarking, &quot;I got on my high horse. I thought I was a pacifist.&quot; Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte opposite Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. Anatoly Efros wrote: &quot;I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not the right word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo&quot;, while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger&#x27;s Napoleon as an &quot;unusual interpretation&quot;, finding him less convincing than Plummer&#x27;s Wellington.

In 1971, Steiger played a chauvinistic big game hunter, explorer and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson&#x27;s &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot;, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, which was alternatively titled &quot;A Fistful of Dynamite&quot;. Leone was initially dissatisfied with his performance in that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan&#x27;s stagecoach is destroyed. After the film&#x27;s completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned for the role of Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo&#x27;s 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.

Steiger played a rural Tennessee patriarch and father of Jeff Bridges, at odds with Robert Ryan&#x27;s character, in &quot;Lolly-Madonna XXX&quot; (1973), which received mixed reviews. Later that year he was cast as the turban-wearing German officer Guenther von Lutz in Duccio Tessari&#x27;s Italian war comedy &quot;The Heroes&quot;, opposite Rod Taylor, and appeared as &quot;foul-mouthed Sicilian mobster&quot; Eugenio Giannini opposite Gian Maria Volonté&#x27;s Lucky Luciano in Francesco Rosi&#x27;s film of the same name.

In 1975, Steiger portrayed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Carlo Lizzani&#x27;s &quot;Last Days of Mussolini&quot;, which received a positive critical reception. He appeared in Claude Chabrol&#x27;s French picture &quot;Innocents with Dirty Hands&quot;, playing the role of Louis Wormser, the wealthy alcoholic husband of Romy Schneider&#x27;s character Julie Wormser. It was poorly received by critics, and Steiger found the director, whom he had admired, a bitter disappointment. He was highly critical of Chabrol&#x27;s lack of communication and aloofness from the production, and preference for playing chess on set instead of talking through scenes. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dismissed it as &quot;little more than a soap opera&quot;, writing: &quot;The performances are of a piece—uniformly atrocious. Mr. Steiger surpasses his own earlier records for lumbering busyness. Within his first few minutes on screen he (1) gets drunk, (2) whines, (3) pleads for understanding, (4) weeps and (5) goes to bed alone.&quot; Later that year, Steiger starred as an Irish Republican Army terrorist who plans to blow up the Houses of Parliament in Don Sharp&#x27;s British thriller &quot;Hennessy&quot;. John Simon of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;This fellow Hennessy, as played by Rod Steiger, is about as interesting and likable as a Guy Fawkes dummy.&quot;

The following year, Steiger portrayed the comic actor W. C. Fields in an Arthur Hiller biopic, &quot;W. C. Fields and Me&quot;, for Universal Pictures. The screenplay, which was based on a memoir by Carlotta Monti, who was Fields&#x27; mistress for the last 14 years of his life, was penned by Bob Merrill. Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role, and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life. He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; (1940). One day, Fields&#x27; mistress Monti turned up on set, and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody. Nervous that she might not approve, he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said &quot;Woody, Woody, Woody, My Woody&quot;, a nickname used only by those very close to Fields. Despite the energy Steiger put into the picture, like the actor&#x27;s previous recent films, it was poorly received by critics. Canby called it &quot;dreadful&quot; and described Steiger&#x27;s portrayal of Fields as a &quot;wax dummy of a character&quot;. Lucia Bozzola of &quot;The New York Times&quot; later referred to Steiger&#x27;s portrayal of Fields as &quot;superb&quot;, but noted that his Hollywood career had &quot;undeniably fallen from his 1950s and &#x27;60s heights&quot;.

Steiger played Pontius Pilate in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s TV miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977). Stacy Keach, who portrayed Barabbas, expressed his joy at the opportunity to work with Steiger, describing him as &quot;generous and opinionated&quot;. In 1978, Steiger played a senator in Norman Jewison&#x27;s &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, opposite Sylvester Stallone, who played a Cleveland warehouse worker involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional organisation named Federation of Inter-State Truckers. &quot;Love and Bullets&quot;, later that year, in which Steiger appeared as a mafia boss, was poorly received; Roger Ebert dismissed it as a &quot;hopelessly confused hodgepodge of chases, killings, enigmatic meetings and separations, and insufferably overacted scenes by Steiger alternating with alarmingly underacted scenes by [Charles] Bronson&quot;. The following year, Steiger was cast as a general opposite Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum in Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s war film &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, set on the Western Front. In &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979), Steiger appeared as a disturbed priest, who is invited to perform an exorcism on a haunted house. Again Steiger was accused of overacting; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything. He won&#x27;t even pick up the phone before it&#x27;s rung 12 or 15 times.&quot; Pauline Kael thought that Steiger&#x27;s &quot;spiritual agony was enough to shatter the camera lens&quot;.

In 1980, Steiger received two Genie Award for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor nominations for his roles in &quot;Klondike Fever&quot; and &quot;The Lucky Star&quot;, both Canadian productions. &quot;Klondike Fever&quot; is based on Jack London&#x27;s journey from San Francisco to the Klondike gold fields in 1898. Steiger revisited his role as Mussolini in &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;, a production that was financed by Muammar Gaddafi, and which co-starred Anthony Quinn as Bedouin tribal leader Omar Mukhtar, fighting the Italian army in the years leading up to World War II. The Italian authorities reportedly banned the film in 1982, as it was considered damaging to the army, and it was not shown on Italian television until a state visit by Gaddafi in 2009. It received critical acclaim in Britain, where it was praised in particular for the quality of its battle scenes. Later in 1981, Steiger won the Montréal World Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of white-bearded Orthodox rabbi Reb Saunders in Jeremy Kagan&#x27;s &quot;The Chosen&quot;. Janet Maslin commented that Steiger&#x27;s &quot;slow, rolling delivery&quot; was more &quot;numbing than prepossessing&quot;, though a critic from &quot;Variety&quot; thought it an &quot;exceptional performance as the somewhat tyrannical but loving patriarch&quot;.

===B-movies and criticism (1982–1994)===
After his open-heart surgery in 1979, clinical depression and health problems during the 1980s directly affected Steiger&#x27;s career, and he often turned to B movies, low-budget, independent productions, and TV miniseries. He admitted that during this period he accepted &quot;everything I was offered&quot;, and knew that many of the films he appeared in were not great, but wanted to demonstrate his strong work ethic despite his issues. He later regretted the poorer films in which he appeared during the 1980s, and wished he had done more stage work. He sank into an even deeper depression when he was not involved in acting, but it bothered him more that his acting career had taken a turn for the worse and was no longer challenging. The major studio producers were wary of his problems and considered him a liability. Steiger spoke about the experience to a younger colleague while advising: &quot;Never tell anyone if you&#x27;ve got heart problems, kid. Never.&quot; His reputation as a fine character actor remained intact, and Joel Hirschhorn at the time considered his talent to be &quot;as strong as ever&quot;.

In 1984, Steiger starred as a detective assigned to investigate the murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Face&quot;. Richard Christiansen of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; referred to it as a &quot;wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [that] doesn&#x27;t do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it&quot;, and considered Steiger to be &quot;acting in his high hysteria gear&quot;, who &quot;snarls and whines and overacts&quot;. Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series &quot;The Glory Boys&quot; (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of &quot;The Glory Boys&quot;. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins &quot;so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking&quot; that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song &quot;Tax Free&quot;.

Steiger played a villain/antagonist role in the Argentine-American film &quot;Catch the Heat&quot; (1987), an action/martial arts picture about two undercover agents of the law who fight against an American-Brazilian drug baron who smuggles drugs into the United States inside showgirls&#x27; breast implants. According to director Fred Olen Ray, it was pulled from distribution within a week of release. In 1988, Steiger and Yvonne De Carlo played a spooky elderly couple with developmentally delayed children in John Hough&#x27;s horror film &quot;American Gothic&quot;. Universally panned by the critics, Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Steiger addresses the camera as if he were reciting Shakespeare, he is truly, straightforwardly, hilariously bad.&quot; During the last year of the decade he played authority figures, including a mayor in &quot;The January Man&quot;, and as Judge Prescott in &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;. Although Steiger admitted that his performance in &quot;The January Man&quot; was &quot;way over the top&quot;, he enjoyed the experience, thereby marking a positive turning point after a period of clinical depression.

In 1990, Steiger starred in &quot;Men of Respect&quot;, a crime drama film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He played a character based on King Duncan, opposite John Turturro as Mike Battaglia (Macbeth), who plays a Mafia hitman who climbs his way to the top by killing Steiger&#x27;s character. The film was critically panned, with Roger Ebert awarding it one star out of four, describing the concept as a &quot;very, very bad idea&quot;. Steiger played another mobster, Sam Giancana, two years later in the miniseries &quot;Sinatra&quot; (1992).

Steiger portrayed a reverend living in a small town in the American South in the macabre Merchant Ivory film production &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Café&quot; (1991), co-starring Vanessa Redgrave and Keith Carradine. The film met with generally lukewarm reviews, though it was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Steiger auditioned for the part of an elderly Irishman in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Far and Away&quot;, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Steiger, who had long been bald, was ordered by Howard to wear a wig to the audition. He resented the fact that Howard insisted on taping the audition, which he believed to be a form of humiliation for actors, serving as after-dinner entertainment for the Hollywood executives. Steiger never forgave Howard, whom he referred to as a &quot;cocksucker&quot;, for rejecting him for the part and giving it to Cyril Cusack.

In 1993, Steiger portrayed an aging gynaecologist who terrorizes his urban neighbors in a rural community in Burlington, Vermont in &quot;The Neighbor&quot;. Dennis Schwartz considered it to have been one of Steiger&#x27;s creepiest roles, though he thought that the poor script had rendered the role awkward and &quot;mildly entertaining in the sense that Steiger is asked to carry the film and hams it up&quot;. The following year, Steiger agreed to play the role of a Cuban mob boss opposite Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone in Luis Llosa&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Specialist&quot;, citing its purpose as a &quot;$40 million commercial&quot; to show a new generation that he existed. Critics panned the film, which has a four percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews as of July 2015. The role earned Steiger a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor nomination, and the film was listed in &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made&quot;.

===Later work and final years (1995–2002)===

Following &quot;The Specialist&quot; (1994), Steiger appeared in &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Op Center&quot; (1995), a film that was edited down into a TV miniseries, and featured in a &quot;Columbo&quot; television film, &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. The following year, he took a minor role as Doc Wallace in the Dale Rosenbloom family drama &quot;Shiloh&quot;. He reprised the role three years later in the sequel. Also in 1996, Steiger played a &quot;jingoistic top general&quot; who &quot;petitions the president to go nuclear in the middle of a global crisis&quot; in the ensemble production of &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;.

In 1997, Steiger played Tony Vago, the mob boss of Vincent Gallo&#x27;s character in Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Truth or Consequences, N.M.&quot;, a gritty &quot;noir&quot; about a drug heist gone wrong. Steiger played judges in Antonio Banderas&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; and in the prison drama, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, both in 1999, the latter of which tells the story of former middleweight boxer Rubin Carter, who was wrongly convicted of a triple homicide in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. &quot;The Hurricane&quot; reunited Steiger with Norman Jewison, who had directed him in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. Steiger portrayed H. Lee Sarokin, the judge responsible for freeing Carter. Sarokin thought it was a &quot;marvellous film&quot; that was Oscar-worthy, but found Steiger&#x27;s portrayal as overacted and a &quot;little arrogant and pompous&quot;.

After a minor role as a &quot;bombastic priest&quot; in &quot;End of Days&quot; (1999), Steiger was one of the lead actors in Burt Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;The Last Producer&quot; (2000), a film about a washed-up, veteran producer (Reynolds) who tries to re-enter the movie business by producing a new film. Steiger&#x27;s last film role was as the billiard hall manager, Nick, in &quot;Poolhall Junkies&quot; (2002); it was poorly received by critics.

==Personal life==

Steiger was married five times: he married actress Sally Gracie (1952–1958), actress Claire Bloom (1959–1969), secretary Sherry Nelson (1973–1979), singer Paula Ellis (1986–1997) and actress Joan Benedict Steiger (married 2000 until his death). He had a daughter, opera singer Anna Steiger (born in 1960) by Bloom, and a son, Michael Steiger (born in 1993), from his marriage to Ellis. In an interview with journalist Kenneth Passingham, Steiger stated that Bloom was &quot;all I ever wanted in a woman&quot;, and that &quot;maybe our marriage was better than most because we were both established when we met&quot;. The couple bought a home in Malibu, California, a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring. They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in County Galway, close to John Huston&#x27;s home. Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid-1970s. It upset him greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer Hillard Elkins the same year, a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting &quot;Waterloo&quot;. Steiger was also close friends with actress Elizabeth Taylor.

Steiger was outspoken critic of McCarthyism. He later clashed on the subject with Charlton Heston, and referred to Heston as &quot;America’s favourite fascist.&quot; For example, Heston published a column in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; saying that he was shocked that the American Film Institute had not honored Elia Kazan, who had cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee and named several Communists. Steiger wrote a response letter, describing himself as &quot;appalled, appalled, appalled,&quot; and saying that Kazan&#x27;s actions had resulted in actors and writers being forced to drive cabs because they were blacklisted and even committing suicide as a result. Heston did not reply.

Steiger suffered from depression throughout much of his life. He described himself as &quot;incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression&quot; before his Oscar win for &quot;In The Heat of the Night&quot;. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and again in 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly a side effect of his surgery, negatively affected his career during the 1980s. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: &quot;You begin to lose self-esteem. You don&#x27;t walk, you don&#x27;t shave and if no one was watching you&#x27;d go to the bathroom right where you were sitting&quot;. He would lie in bed at night thinking, &quot;You&#x27;ll never act again. Why bother? You&#x27;re no good&quot;. Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: &quot;Pain must never be a source of shame. It&#x27;s a part of life, it&#x27;s part of humanity.&quot;

== Death ==
Steiger died in a Westside hospital in Los Angeles on July 9, 2002, at age 77, of pneumonia and kidney failure as a result of complications from surgery for a gallbladder tumor. He was buried in Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery. The film &quot;Saving Shiloh&quot;, released in 2006, was dedicated to his memory.

==Acting style==

Steiger was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most respected character actors. Hutchinson described him as &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most charismatic and dynamic stars&quot;. Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained &quot;out of sympathy with Hollywood&quot; during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an &quot;effusive talent&quot; according to Lucia Bozzola of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the &quot;Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath&quot; during the 1970s, roles that he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as &quot;the Screen&#x27;s No.1 Bad Man&quot;, while the newspaper &quot;London Evening News&quot; referred to him as &quot;the man you would love to hate if you had the courage&quot;. A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; referred to Steiger as an &quot;angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [who] works best only at emotional white heat&quot;, and remarked that he found it &quot;stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life&quot;. Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he &quot;often seems to take over a picture even when he isn&#x27;t in the lead&quot;. The journal &quot;Films and Filming&quot;, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent &quot;developed steadily through films good and bad&quot;, and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said &quot;I pity the player who can&#x27;t keep his feet on the ground. It&#x27;s too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still.&quot;

A product of the Actors Studio, Steiger is closely associated with method acting, embodying the characters he played. Writer James F. Scott notes that during his career, he &quot;many times put aside his own personality to think his way into an alien psyche&quot;. Steiger once said:

Steiger was so devoted to his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, especially in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In one of his last interviews, Steiger said: &quot;What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that&#x27;s it, when somebody says to me &#x27;I&#x27;ll never forget&#x27;, that&#x27;s worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I&#x27;m in that person&#x27;s life&quot;.

Film writer Paul Simpson notes how closely Steiger prepared for his roles, and how he &quot;effortlessly&quot; recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a &quot;compelling take on an enigmatic figure&quot;. Judith Crist of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, reviewing &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, commented that Steiger was &quot;totally without mannerisms, always with manner&quot;, and noted that his &quot;silences are stunningly effective&quot;. Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, &quot;When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don&#x27;t know how he does it. It&#x27;s almost as if he gets inside the skin of the guy he&#x27;s playing and starts being that person for a while&quot;. Steiger said: &quot;I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I&#x27;d try to do it a little different.&quot; His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger&#x27;s portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger&#x27;s &quot;powerful and wrenching performance&quot; in &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;.

Despite Steiger&#x27;s acclaim as an actor, he was frequently accused of overacting and won his share of critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, as he was intolerant of Steiger&#x27;s &quot;unusual acting technique&quot;. Steiger ignored the director&#x27;s concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: &quot;Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!&quot;, and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio&#x27;s techniques disagreeable, preferring &quot;more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness&quot;. Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely &quot;trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge&quot;.

Several co-stars found working with Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, according to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as &quot;somebody who had a tendency to go over the top&quot; during the making of &quot;In The Heat of the Night&quot;. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with &quot;Poitier&#x27;s stillness and implied intensity&quot; and &quot;Steiger&#x27;s busy, exteriorised method acting&quot;. Humphrey Bogart, Steiger&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;, referred to Steiger&#x27;s method acting as the &quot;scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting&quot;. Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: &quot;Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor&#x27;s performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him&quot;. Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of &quot;Across the Bridge&quot;, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger&#x27;s idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had &quot;never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance&quot; as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.

<text>A filling station (also known as a gas station [] or petrol station []) is a facility that sells fuel and engine lubricants for motor vehicles. The most common fuels sold are gasoline (or petrol) and diesel fuel.

Fuel dispensers are used to pump gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, compressed hydrogen, hydrogen compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, alcohol fuels (like methanol, ethanol, butanol, and propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil and biodiesel), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Besides gasoline pumps, one other significant device which is also found in filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tires. 

Many filling stations provide convenience stores, which may sell convenience food, beverages, tobacco products, lottery tickets, newspapers, magazines, and, in some cases, a small selection of grocery items, such as milk or eggs. Some also sell propane or butane and have added shops to their primary business. Conversely, some chain stores, such as supermarkets, discount stores, warehouse clubs, or traditional convenience stores, have provided fuel pumps on the premises.

==Terminology==
In North America the fuel is known as &quot;gasoline&quot; or &quot;gas&quot; for short, and the terms &quot;gas station&quot; and &quot;service station&quot; are used in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. In some regions of Canada, the term &quot;gas bar&quot; (or &quot;gasbar&quot;) is used. 

In the rest of the English-speaking world the fuel is known as &quot;petrol&quot;. As a result, the term &quot;petrol station&quot; or &quot;petrol pump&quot; is used in the United Kingdom. In Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa &quot;garage&quot; and &quot;forecourt&quot; are still commonly used. Similarly, in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, the term &quot;service station&quot; describes any petrol station; Australians and New Zealanders also call it a &quot;servo&quot;. In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is called a &quot;petrol pump&quot; or a &quot;petrol bunk&quot;. In Japanese, a commonly used term is although the abbreviation &quot;SS&quot; (for &quot;service station&quot;) is also used.

==History==
The first known filling station was the city pharmacy in Wiesloch, Germany, where Bertha Benz refilled the tank of the first automobile on its maiden trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim back in 1888. Shortly thereafter other pharmacies sold gasoline as a side business. Since 2008 the Bertha Benz Memorial Route commemorates this event.

===Brazil===
The first &quot;posto de gasolina&quot; of South America was opened in Santos, São Paulo, Brazil, in 1920. It was located on Ana Costa Avenue, in front of the beach, in a corner that is located by the Hotel Atlântico, which occupies its area nowadays. It was owned by Esso and brought by Antonio Duarte Moreira, a taxi entrepreneur.

===Russia===

In Russia, the first filling stations appeared in 1911, when the Imperial Automobile Society signed an agreement with the partnership &quot;Br. Nobel&quot;. By 1914 about 440 stations functioned in major cities across the country.

In the mid-1960s in Moscow there were about 250 stations. A significant boost in retail network development occurred with the mass launch of the car &quot;Zhiguli&quot; at the Volga Automobile Plant, which was built in Tolyatti in 1970. Gasoline for other than non-private cars was sold for ration cards only. This type of payment system stopped in the midst of perestroika in the early 1990s.

Since the saturation of automobile filling stations in Russia is insufficient and lags behind the leading countries of the world, there is a need to accommodate new stations in the cities and along the roads of different levels.

===United States===
The increase in automobile ownership after Henry Ford started to sell automobiles that the middle class could afford resulted in an increased demand for filling stations. The world&#x27;s first purpose-built gas station was constructed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1905 at 420 South Theresa Avenue. The second station was constructed in 1907 by Standard Oil of California (now Chevron) in Seattle, Washington, at what is now Pier 32. Reighard&#x27;s Gas Station in Altoona, Pennsylvania claims that it dates from 1909 and is the oldest existing filling station in the United States. Early on, they were known to motorists as &quot;filling stations&quot; and often washed vehicle windows for free.

The first &quot;drive-in&quot; filling station, Gulf Refining Company, opened to the motoring public in Pittsburgh on December 1, 1913, at Baum Boulevard and St Clair&#x27;s Street. Prior to this, automobile drivers pulled into almost any general or hardware store, or even blacksmith shops in order to fill up their tanks. On its first day, the station sold of gasoline at 27 cents per gallon (7 cents per litre). This was also the first architect-designed station and the first to distribute free road maps. The first alternative fuel station was opened in San Diego, California, by Pearson Fuels in 2003.

Maryland officials said that on September 26, 2019, RS Automotive in Takoma Park, Maryland became the first filling station in the country to convert to an EV charging station.

==Design and function==


The majority of filling stations are built in a similar manner, with most of the fueling installation underground, pump machines in the and a point of service inside a building. Single or multiple fuel tanks are usually deployed underground. Local regulations and environmental concerns may require a different method, with some stations storing their fuel in container tanks, entrenched surface tanks or unprotected fuel tanks deployed on the surface. Fuel is usually offloaded from a tanker truck into each tank by gravity through a separate capped opening located on the station&#x27;s perimeter. Fuel from the tanks travels to the dispenser pumps through underground pipes. For every fuel tank, direct access must be available at all times. Most tanks can be accessed through a service canal directly from the forecourt.

Older stations tend to use a separate pipe for every kind of available fuel and for every dispenser. Newer stations may employ a single pipe for every dispenser. This pipe houses a number of smaller pipes for the individual fuel types. Fuel tanks, dispenser and nozzles used to fill car tanks employ vapor recovery systems, which prevents releases of vapor into the atmosphere with a system of pipes. The exhausts are placed as high as possible. A vapor recovery system may be employed at the exhaust pipe. This system collects the vapors, liquefies them and releases them back into the lowest grade fuel tank available.

The forecourt is the part of a filling station where vehicles are refueled. Gasoline pumps are placed on concrete plinths, as a precautionary measure against collision by motor vehicles. Additional elements may be employed, including metal barriers. The area around the gasoline pumps must have a drainage system. Since fuel sometimes spills onto the pavement, as little of it as possible should remain. Any liquids present on the forecourt will flow into a channel drain before it enters a petrol interceptor which is designed to capture any hydrocarbon pollutants and filter these from rainwater which may then proceed to a sanitary sewer, stormwater drain, or to ground.

If a filling station allows customers to pay at the dispenser, the data from the dispenser may be transmitted via RS-232, RS-485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station&#x27;s building, and fed into the station&#x27;s cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the gasoline pump, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank&#x27;s status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly to an external database.

===Underground filling stations===
The underground modular filling station is a construction model for filling stations that was developed and patented by U-Cont Oy Ltd in Finland in 1993. Afterwards the same system was used in Florida, US. Above-ground modular stations were built in the 1980s in Eastern Europe and especially in Soviet Union, but they were not built in other parts of Europe due to the stations&#x27; lack of safety in case of fire.

The construction model for underground modular filling station makes the installation time shorter, designing easier and manufacturing less expensive. As a proof of the model&#x27;s installation speed an unofficial world record of filling station installation was made by U-Cont Oy Ltd when a modular filling station was built in Helsinki, Finland in less than three days, including groundwork. The safety of modular filling stations has been tested in a filling station simulator, in Kuopio, Finland. These tests have included for instance burning cars and explosions in the station simulator.

==Negative impacts==
===Human health===
Gasoline contains a mixture of BTEX hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes). Prolonged exposure to toluene can cause permanent damage to the central nervous system, and chlorinated solvents can cause liver and kidney problems. Benzene in particular causes leukemia and is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. People who work in filling stations, live near them, or attend school close to them are exposed to fumes and are at increased lifetime risk of cancer, with risk increased if there are multiple stations nearby. There is some evidence that living near a filling station is a risk for childhood leukemia. In addition to long-term exposure, there are bursts of short-term exposures to benzene when tanker trucks deliver fuel. 
High levels of benzene have been detected near stations across urban, suburban, and rural environments, though the causes (such as road traffic or congestion) can vary by location.

Gas station attendants have suffered adverse health consequences depending on the type of fuel used, exposure to vehicle exhaust, and types of personal protective equipment (PPE) offered. Studies have noted higher levels of chromosomal deletions and higher rates of miscarriage, and workers have reported headaches, fatigue, throat irritation and depression. Exposure to exhaust and fumes has been associated with eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, and cough.

===Environment===
Gasoline can leak into the surrounding soil and water, posing health risks. Areas formerly occupied by stations are often contaminated, resulting in brownfields and urban blight. Underground storage tanks (USTs) were typically made of steel and were common in the United States, but were prone to corrosion. They received national attention in 1983 after an episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; documented significant drinking water contamination from a Mobil station in Canob Park in Richmond, Rhode Island. This led to regulations banning these types of tanks in 1985. However, tanks that ceased operation before 1986 are unlikely to have been recorded, and many underground tanks are thus unknowingly hidden beneath redeveloped land, contributing to soil, groundwater, and indoor air pollution.

Because of the relatively small size of former stations (compared to larger brownfields), the cost-per-acre to rehabilitate the land is higher; the total cost in the United States is not known but is in the billions of dollars. Individual cleanups may be complex, with some in Canada taking decades and costing millions of dollars both for the cleanup efforts and in legal fees to determine whether individuals, governments, or corporations are liable for costs.

===Economic costs===
The cost of potential cleanup of a former filling station can lower property values, discourage development of land, and depress neighbouring property values and potential tax revenue. When areas are known to be contaminated by leaking underground storage tanks, the sale value of the land and neighbouring area drops. An analysis of residential properties in Cuyahoga County, Ohio estimated the loss at about 17% when within or one block of a registered leaking tank. Active filling stations have similar negative effects on property values, with an analysis in Xuancheng, China finding a loss of 16% within and 9% when between and .

==Marketing==
===North America===
In the United States and Canada, there are generally two marketing types of filling stations: premium brands and discount brands.

====Premium brands====

Filling stations with &quot;premium brands&quot; sell well-recognized and often international brands of fuel, including Exxon/Mobil and its Esso brand, Phillips 66/Conoco/76, Chevron, Mobil, Shell, Husky Energy, Sunoco (US), BP, Valero and Texaco. Non-international premium brands include Petrobras, Petro-Canada (owned by Suncor Energy Canada), QuikTrip, Hess, Sinclair, and Pemex. Premium-brand stations accept credit cards, often issue their own company cards (fuel cards or fleet cards) and may charge higher prices. In some cases, fuel cards for customers with a lower fuel consumption are ordered not directly from an oil company, but from an intermediary. Many premium brands have fully automated pay-at-the-pump facilities. Premium stations tend to be highly visible from highway and freeway exits, utilizing tall signs to display their brand logos.

====Discount brands====
Discount brands are often smaller, regional chains or independent stations, offering lower fuel prices. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers or the major petroleum companies. Lower-priced stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Big Y, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Hy-Vee, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, QuickChek, Road Ranger, Sheetz, Speedway and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam&#x27;s Club, and BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco gas stations, BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, or Sam&#x27;s Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card to be eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain&#x27;s cash card, debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.

===State-controlled stations===
Some countries have only one brand of filling station. In Malaysia, Shell is the dominant player by number of stations, with government-owned Petronas coming in second. In Indonesia, the dominant player by number of stations is the government-owned Pertamina, although other companies such as TotalEnergies and Shell are increasingly found in big cities such as the capital Jakarta or Surabaya. In Taiwan, the government-owned CPC Corporation is the dominant player by number of stations, with the privately owned and operated Formosa Petrochemical Corporation and respectively in second and third place.

===Global and local branding===

Some companies, such as Shell, use their brand worldwide, however, Chevron uses its inherited brand Caltex in Asia Pacific, Australia and Africa, and its Texaco brand in Europe and Latin America. ExxonMobil uses its Exxon and Mobil brands but is still known as Esso (the forerunner company name, Standard Oil or S.O.) in many places, most noticeably in Canada and Singapore.

In Brazil, the main operators are Vibra Energia and Ipiranga, but Esso and Shell (Raízen) are also present.

In Mexico, the historical monopoly filling station operator, and still the largest, is Pemex, but ever since Mexico&#x27;s energy laws were gradually liberalized starting from 2013, foreign brands such as Shell, BP, Mobil and Chevron, as well as the country&#x27;s largest convenience store chain Oxxo, have also started operating filling stations.

In the United Kingdom, the three largest are BP, Esso and Shell; the &quot;Big Four&quot; supermarket chains, Morrisons, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda and Tesco, also operate filling stations, as well as some smaller supermarket chains such as The Co-operative Group and Waitrose.

In Poland, the three largest operators are the partially state-owned PKN Orlen (including acquisitions Grupa Lotos and PGNiG), followed by Shell and BP. Smaller operators include Auchan, , Circle K, MOL Group and Żabka.

In Australia, the major operators are Ampol, BP, Chevron Australia (Caltex), EG Australia, ExxonMobil Australia (Mobil), Puma Energy, United Petroleum and Viva Energy (mostly under the dual Shell-Coles Express branding). Smaller operators include Costco, Liberty Oil, Seven &amp; i Holdings (operates servos under the 7-Eleven convenience store branding) and Shell Australia.

In India, the three major operators are the state-owned Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil Corporation, which together control approximately 87% of the market. Foreign brands such as BP (joint venture with Reliance Industries, branded as Jio-bp) and Shell are also present.

In Japan, the four major operators are: Cosmo Oil, Idemitsu (under the brand names &quot;apollostation&quot; and &quot;Idemitsu&quot;),
ENEOS Corporation (under the brand names &quot;ENEOS&quot;, &quot;Express&quot; and &quot;General&quot;) and San-Ai Oil (under the brand name &quot;Kygnus&quot;). Smaller operators include: Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (under the brand name , except in Hokkaido where the brand name is operated by ) and Mitsubishi Group (operates self-service stations under the Lawson convenience store branding). Previously, foreign filling station brands were also present in Japan: mainly Shell (operated by Idemitsu since its acquisition of Showa Shell Sekiyu in 2018–19, all rebranded to &quot;apollostation&quot; by 2023), Esso and Mobil (last operated by ENEOS Corporation under license from ExxonMobil, all rebranded to ENEOS in 2019).

==Payment methods==
===Australia and New Zealand===
Most service stations allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying. In recent years, some service stations have required customers to purchase their fuel first. In some small towns, the customer may hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if they are paying for a set amount of fuel and have no change; but usually customers will enter the service centre to pay a cashier. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay-at-pump only. Customers at the supermarket will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries at the supermarket, but normally starts at 4 cents a litre.

In New Zealand, BP has an app for smartphones that detects a user&#x27;s location, then allows one to select the type of fuel, which pump, and how much to spend. The amount is then deducted from the user&#x27;s account.

===Canada===
In British Columbia and Alberta, it is a legal requirement that customers either pre-pay for the fuel or pay at the pump. The law is called &quot;Grant&#x27;s Law&quot; and is intended to prevent &quot;gas-and-dash&quot; crimes, where a customer refuels and then drives away without paying for it.
In other provinces, payment after filling is permitted and widely available, though some stations may require either a pre-payment or a payment at the pump during night hours.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, most stations allow customers to pump fuel before paying. Some stations have pay-at-the-pump facilities.

===United Kingdom===
A large majority of stations allow customers to pay with a chip and pin payment card or pay in the shop. Many have a pay at the pump system, where customers can enter their PIN prior to refueling.

===United States===
Pre-payment is the norm in the US and customers may typically pay either at the pump or inside the gas station. Modern stations have pay-at-the-pump functions: in most cases credit, debit, ATM cards, fuel cards and fleet cards are accepted. Occasionally a station will have a pay-at-the-pump-only period per day, when attendants are not present, often at night, and some stations are pay-at-the-pump only 24 hours a day.

==Types of service==

Filling stations typically offer one of three types of service to their customers: full service, minimum service or self-service.

;Full service
:An attendant operates the pumps, often wipes the windshield, and sometimes checks the vehicle&#x27;s oil level and tire pressure, then collects payment and perhaps a small tip.

;Minimum service
:An attendant operates the pumps. This is often required due to legislation that prohibits customers from operating the pumps.

;Self service
:The customer performs all required service. Signs informing the customer of filling procedures and cautions are displayed on each pump. Customers can still enter a store or go to a booth to give payment to a person.

;Unstaffed
:Using cardlock (or pay-at-the-pump) system, these are completely unstaffed.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, self-service fuel filling is illegal, due to a federal law enacted in 2000. The law was introduced by Federal Deputy Aldo Rebelo, who claims it saved 300,000 fuel attendant jobs across the country.

===Japan===
Before 1998, filling stations in Japan were entirely full-service stations. Self-service stations were legalized in Japan in 1998 following the abolition of the Special Petroleum Law, which led to the deregulation of the petroleum industry in Japan. Under current safety regulations, while motorists are able to self-dispense fuel at self-service stations, generally identified in Japanese as , at least one fuel attendant must be on hand to keep watch over potential safety violations and to render assistance to motorists whenever necessary.

===South Korea===
Filling stations in South Korea offer a variety of services, such as providing bottled water or tissues, and cleaning free of charge. But most have switched to self-service. Some large full-service stations have many services, such as tire pressure charging, automatic car washing, and self-cleaning. Some of them are free to gas customers who spend more than a certain amount.

===North America===

In the past, filling stations in the United States offered a choice between &quot;full service&quot; and &quot;self service&quot;. Before 1970, full service was the norm, and self-service was rare. Today, few stations advertise or provide full service. Full service stations are more common in wealthy and upscale areas. The cost of full service is usually assessed as a fixed amount per US gallon.

The first self-service station in the United States was in Los Angeles, opened in 1947 by Frank Urich. In Canada, the first self-service station opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1949. It was operated by the independent company Henderson Thriftway Petroleum, owned by Bill Henderson.

In New Jersey, filling stations offer only full service (and mini service); attendants there are required to pump gasoline for customers. Customers, in fact, are prohibited by law from pumping their own gasoline. The only exception to this within New Jersey is at the filling station next to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Wrightstown. New Jersey prohibited self-service in 1949, with the passage of &quot;Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act,&quot; after lobbying by service station owners. That laws states that &quot;Because of the fire hazards directly associated with dispensing fuel, it is in the public interest that gasoline station operators have the control needed over that activity to ensure compliance with appropriate safety procedures, including turning off vehicle engines and refraining from smoking while fuel is dispensed.&quot; Proponents of the prohibition cite safety and jobs as reasons to keep the ban. Of note, the ban does not apply to the pumping of diesel fuel at filling stations (though individual filling stations may prohibit this); nor does it apply to the pumping of gasoline into boats or aircraft.

Oregon prohibited self-service in a 1951 statute prohibiting that listed 17 different justifications, including flammability, the risk of crime from customers leaving their vehicles, toxic fumes, and the jobs created by requiring mini service. In 1982 Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure sponsored by the service station owners, which would have legalized self-service. Oregon legislators passed a bill that was signed into law by the Governor in May 2017 to allow self-service for counties with a total population of 40,000 or less beginning in January 2018. Governor Tina Kotek passed a law allowing for it in 2023, but stations are still required to provide full-serve for customers who want it.

The constitutionality of the self-service bans has been disputed. The Oregon statute was brought into court in 1989 by ARCO, and the New Jersey statute was challenged in court in 1950 by a small independent service station, Rein Motors. Both challenges failed. Former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine sought to lift the ban on self-service for New Jersey. He asserted that it would be able to lower gas prices, but some New Jerseyans argued that it could cause drawbacks, especially unemployment.

The town of Huntington, New York has prohibited self-service stations since the early 1970s firstly to prevent theft and later due to safety concerns.

The towns of Arlington, Massachusetts and Weymouth, Massachusetts have also prohibited self-service stations since 1975 and 1977, respectively. 

Contrary to popular belief, lit cigarettes are not capable of igniting gasoline. However, several states outlaw smoking at gas stations as the fire from the ignition source used to light the cigarette can ignite gasoline vapors. Most gas stations and many municipalities will also explicitly ban any smoking activity within certain distances of gasoline pumps.

==Other goods and services commonly available==
Many filling stations provide toilet facilities for customer use, as well as squeegees and paper towels for customers to clean their vehicle&#x27;s windows. Discount stations may not provide these amenities in some countries.

Stations typically have an air compressor, typically with a built-in or provided handheld tire-pressure gauge, to inflate tires and a hose to add water to vehicle radiators. Some air compressor machines are free of charge, while others charge a small fee to use (typically 50 cents to a dollar in North America). In US states, such as California, state law requires that paying customers must be provided with free air compressor service and radiator water.

In some regions of America and Australia, many filling stations have a mechanic on duty, but this practice has died out in other parts of the world.

Many filling stations have integrated convenience stores which sell food, beverages, and often cigarettes, lottery tickets, motor oil, and auto parts. Prices for these items tend to be higher than they would be at a supermarket or discount store.

Many stations, particularly in the United States, have a fast food outlet inside. These are usually &quot;express&quot; versions with limited seating and limited menus, though some may be regular-sized and have spacious seating. Larger restaurants are common at truck stops and toll road service plazas.

In some US states, beer, wine, and liquor are sold at filling stations, though this practice varies according to state law (&quot;see Alcohol laws of the United States by state&quot;). Nevada also allows the operation of slot and video poker machines without time restrictions.

Vacuum cleaners, often coin-operated, are a common amenity to allow the cleaning of vehicle interiors, either by the customer or by an attendant.

Some stations are equipped with car washes. Car washes are sometimes offered free of charge or at a discounted price with a certain amount of fuel purchased. Conversely, some car washes operate filling stations to supplement their businesses.

From approximately 1920 to 1980, many service stations in the US provided free road maps affiliated with their parent oil companies to customers. This practice fell out of favor due to the 1970s energy crisis.

==Fuel prices==
===Europe===
In European Union member states, gasoline prices are much higher than in North America due to higher fuel excise or taxation, although the base price is also higher than in the US. Occasionally, price rises trigger national protests. In the UK, a large-scale protest in August and September 2000, known as &#x27;The Fuel Crisis&#x27;, caused wide-scale havoc not only across the UK, but also in some other EU countries. The UK Government eventually backed down by indefinitely postponing a planned increase in fuel duty. This was partially reversed during December 2006 when then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown raised fuel duty by 1.25 pence per liter.

Since 2007, gasoline prices in the UK rose by nearly 40 pence per liter, going from 97.3 pence per liter in 2007 to 136.8 pence per liter in 2012.

In much of Europe, including the UK, France and Germany, stations operated by large supermarket chains usually price fuel lower than stand-alone stations. In most of mainland Europe, sales tax is lower on diesel fuel than on gasoline, and diesel is accordingly the cheaper fuel: in the UK and Switzerland, diesel has no tax advantage and retails at a higher price by quantity than gasoline (offset by its higher energy yield).

In 2014, according to Eurostat, the mean EU28 price was €1.38 /L for euro-super 95 (gasoline), €1.26 /L for diesel.
The least expensive gasoline was in Estonia at €1.10 /L, and the most expensive at €1.57 /L in Italy.
The least expensive diesel was in Estonia at €1.14 /L, and the most expensive at €1.54 /L in the UK.
The least expensive LPG was in Belgium at €0.50 /L, and the most expensive at €0.83 /L in France.

===North America===
Nearly all filling stations in North America advertise their prices on large signs outside the stations. Some locations have laws requiring such signage.

In Canada and the United States, federal, state or provincial, and local sales taxes are usually included in the price, although tax details are often posted at the pump and some stations may provide details on sales receipts. Gasoline taxes are often ring-fenced (dedicated) to fund transportation projects such as the maintenance of existing roads and the construction of new ones.

Individual filling stations in the United States have little if any control over gasoline prices. The wholesale price of gasoline is determined according to area by oil companies which supply the gasoline, and their prices are largely determined by the world markets for oil. Individual stations are unlikely to sell gasoline at a loss, and the profit margin—typically between 7 and 11 cents a US gallon (2–3 cents per liter)—that they make from gasoline sales is limited by competitive pressures: a gas station which charges more than others will lose customers to them. Most stations try to compensate by selling higher-margin food products in their convenience stores.

Even with oil market fluctuations, prices for gasoline in the United States are among the lowest in the industrialized world; this is principally due to lower taxes. While the sales price of gasoline in Europe is more than twice that in the United States, the price excluding taxes is nearly identical in the two areas. Some Canadians and Mexicans in communities close to the US border drive into the United States to purchase cheaper gasoline.

Due to heavy fluctuations in price in the United States, some stations offer their customers the option to buy and store gasoline for future uses, such as the service provided by First Fuel Bank.

In order to save money, some consumers in Canada and the United States inform each other about low and high prices through the use of gasoline price websites. Such websites allow users to share prices advertised at filling stations with each other by posting them to a central server. Consumers then may check the prices listed in their geographic area in order to select the station with the lowest price available at the time. Some television and radio stations also compile pricing information via viewer and listener reports of pricing or reporter observations and present it as a regular segment of their newscasts, usually before or after traffic reports. These price observations must usually be made by reading the pricing signs outside stations, as many companies do not give their prices by telephone due to competitive concerns. It is a criminal offense to have written or verbal arrangements with competitors, suppliers or customers for:

* Fixing prices and exchanging information on prices or cost (including discounts and rebates),
* Limiting or restraining competition unduly,
* Engaging in misleading or deceptive practices.

Gas stations must never hold discussions with other competitors regarding pricing policies and methods, terms of sale, costs, allocation of markets or boycotts of our petroleum products.

===Rest of the world===

In other energy-importing countries such as Japan, gasoline and petroleum product prices are higher than in the United States because of fuel transportation costs and taxes.

On the other hand, some of the major oil-producing countries such as the Gulf states, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela provide subsidized fuel at well-below world market prices. This practice tends to encourage heavy consumption.

Hong Kong has some of the highest pump prices in the world, but most customers are given discounts as card members.

Singapore, like Hong Kong, also has similarly high pump prices, which are largely based on a pricing strategy called Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS). As Singapore does not have any oil reserves of its own, the city-state has instead built several off-shore refineries to refine oil imported mostly from Indonesian oil fields, as the latter country does not have enough refining capacity and capability of its own. Because neighbouring country Malaysia has cheaper pump prices than Singapore, cars registered in Singapore crossing over into Malaysia are legally required to have at least three-quarters of a tank of fuel since 1991 to prevent evading fuel duties, and when filling up in Malaysia, Singaporean-and Thai-registered hybrid and petrol-powered vehicles are legally restricted to only fill up on unsubsidised, premium-grade RON97-100 petrol, as RON95 petrol in Malaysia is partially subsidised by the Government of Malaysia for the benefit of lower-income Malaysian residents.

In Western Australia a program called FuelWatch requires most filling stations to notify their &quot;tomorrow prices&quot; by 2pm each day; prices are changed at 6am each morning, and must be held for 24 hours. Each afternoon, the prices for the next day are released to the public and the media, allowing consumers to decide when to fill up.

==Service stations==
A service station or &quot;servo&quot; is the terminology often used in Australia, along with petrol station, to describe any facility where motorists can refuel their cars.

In New Zealand a filling station is often referred to as a service station, petrol station or garage, even though it may not offer mechanical repairs or assistance with dispensing fuel. Levels of service available include full service, for which assistance in dispensing fuel is offered, as well as offers to check tire pressure or clean vehicle windscreens. That type of service is becoming uncommon in New Zealand, particularly Auckland. Further south of Auckland, many filling stations offer full service. There is also help service or assisted service, for which customers must request assistance before it is given, and self-service, for which no assistance is available.

In the US, a filling station that also offers services such as oil changes and mechanical repairs to automobiles is called a service station. Until the 1970s the vast majority of filling stations were service stations. These stations typically offered free air for inflating tires, as compressed air was already on hand to operate the repair garage&#x27;s pneumatic tools. While a few filling stations with a service station remain, many in the 1980s and 1990s were converted to convenience stores while still selling fuel, while others continued to offer services but discontinued offering fuel.

This kind of business provided the name for the US comic strip &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, where a number of the characters worked.

In the UK and Ireland, a &#x27;service station&#x27; refers to much larger facilities, usually attached to motorways (see rest area) or major truck routes, which provide food outlets, large parking areas, and often other services such as hotels, arcade games, and shops in addition to 24-hour fuel supplies and a higher standard of restrooms. Fuel is typically more expensive from these outlets due to their premium locations. UK or Irish service stations do not usually repair automobiles.

==Highway service centre==

This arrangement occurs on many toll roads and some interstate freeways and is called an oasis or service plaza. In many cases, these centers might have a food court or restaurants. In the United Kingdom and Ireland these are called motorway service areas.

Often, the state government maintains public rest areas directly connected to freeways, but does not rent out space to private businesses, as this is specifically prohibited by law via the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 which created the national Interstate Highway System, except sites on freeways built before January 1, 1960, and toll highways that are self-supporting but have Interstate designation, under a grandfather clause. As a result, such areas often provide only minimal services such as restrooms and vending machines.

Private entrepreneurs develop additional facilities, such as truck stops or travel centers, restaurants, gas stations, and motels in clusters on private land adjacent to major interchanges. In the US, Pilot Flying J and TravelCenters of America are two of the most common full-service chains of truck stops. Because these facilities are not directly connected to the freeway, they usually have huge signs on poles high enough to be visible by motorists in time to exit from the freeway. Sometimes, the state also posts small official signs (normally blue) indicating what types of filling stations, restaurants, and hotels are available at an upcoming exit; businesses may add their logos to these signs for a fee.

In Canada, the province of Ontario has stops along two of its 400-series highways, the 401 and the 400, traditionally referred to as &quot;Service Centres&quot;, but recently renamed &quot;ONroute&quot; as part of a full rebuild of the sites. Owned by the provincial government, but leased to private operator Host Kilmer Service Centres, they contain food courts, convenience stores, washrooms, and co-located gas and diesel bars with attached convenience stores. Food providers include Tim Hortons (at all sites), A&amp;W, Wendy&#x27;s and Pizza Pizza. At most sites fuel is sold by Canadian Tire, with a few older Esso gas bars at earlier renovated locations.

==Octane==
In Australia, gasoline is unleaded, and available in 91, 95, 98 and 100 octane (names differ from brand to brand). Fuel additives for use in cars designed for leaded fuel are available at most filling stations.

In Canada, the most commonly found octane grades are 87 (regular), 89 (mid grade) and 91 (premium), using the same &quot;(R+M)/2 Method&quot; used in the US (see below).

In China, the most commonly found octane grade is RON 91 (regular), 93 (mid grade) and 97 (premium). Almost all of the fuel has been unleaded since 2000. In some premium filling stations in large cities, such as PetrolChina and Sinopec, RON 98 gas is sold for racing cars.

In Europe, gasoline is unleaded and available in 95 RON (&quot;Eurosuper&quot;) and, in nearly all countries, 98 RON (&quot;Super Plus&quot;) octanes; in some countries 91 RON octane gasoline is offered as well. In addition, 100 RON is offered in some countries in continental Europe (Shell markets this as &quot;V-Power Racing&quot;). Some stations offer 98 RON with lead substitute (often called Lead-Replacement Petrol, or LRP).

In New Zealand, gasoline is unleaded, and most commonly available in 91 RON (&quot;Regular&quot;) and 95 RON (&quot;Premium&quot;). 98 RON is available at selected BP (&quot;Ultimate&quot;) and Mobil (&quot;Synergy 8000&quot;) service stations instead of the standard 95 RON. 96 RON was replaced by 95 RON, and subsequently abolished in 2006. Leaded fuel was abolished in 1996.

In the UK the most common gasoline grade (and lowest octane generally available) is &#x27;Premium&#x27; 95 RON unleaded. &#x27;Super&#x27; is widely available at 97 RON (for example &quot;Shell V-Power&quot;, &quot;BP Ultimate&quot;). Leaded fuel is no longer available.
In the United States all motor vehicle gasoline is unleaded and is available in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice has become increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic engine controls standard in recent decades.

In the US gasoline is described in terms of its &quot;pump octane&quot;, which is the mean of their &quot;RON&quot; (Research Octane Number) and &quot;MON&quot; (Motor Octane Number). Labels on pumps in the US typically describe this as the &quot;(R+M)/2 Method&quot;. Some nations describe fuels according to the traditional RON or MON ratings, so octane ratings cannot always be compared with the equivalent US rating by the &quot;(R+M)/2 method&quot;.

==Differences in gasoline pumps==

In Europe, New Zealand and Australia, the customer selects one of several colour-coded nozzles depending on the type of fuel required. The filler pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. 
In most stations in Canada and the US, the pump has a single nozzle and the customer selects the desired octane grade by pushing a button. Some pumps require the customer to pick up the nozzle first, then lift a lever underneath it; others are designed so that lifting the nozzle automatically releases a switch. Some newer stations have separate nozzles for different types of fuel. Where diesel fuel is provided, it is usually dispensed from a separate nozzle even if the various grades of gasoline share the same nozzle.

Motorists occasionally pump gasoline into a diesel car by accident. The converse is almost impossible because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of which does not fit the filler, and the nozzles are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine—while creating large amounts of smoke—does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of gasoline added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline—which has historically been used to &quot;thin&quot; diesel fuel in winter.

==Legislation==
In most countries, stations are subjected to guidelines and regulations which exist to minimize the potential of fires, and increase safety.

It is prohibited to use open flames on the forecourt of a filling station because of the risk of igniting gasoline vapor. In the United States, establishing fire codes and enforcing their compliance is the responsibility of state governments. Most localities ban smoking, open flames and running engines. Since the increased occurrence of static-related fires many stations have warnings about leaving the refueling point.

Cars can build up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire compounds contain enough carbon black to provide an electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer &quot;high mileage&quot; tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put into contact with the metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gasoline cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.

Although urban legends persist that using a mobile phone while pumping gasoline can cause sparks or explosion, this has not been duplicated under any controlled condition. Nevertheless, mobile phone manufacturers and gas stations ask users to switch off their phones. One suggested origin of this myth is said to have been started by gas station companies because the cell phone signal would interfere with the fuel counter on some older model fuel pumps causing it to give a lower reading. In the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;Cell Phone Destruction&quot;, investigators concluded that explosions attributed to cell phones could be caused by static discharges from clothing instead and also observed that such incidents seem to involve women more often than men.

The US National Fire Protection Association does most of the research and code writing to address the potential for explosions of gasoline vapor. The customer fueling area, up to above the surface, normally does not have explosive concentrations of vapors, but may from time to time. Above this height, where most fuel filler necks are located, there is no expectation of an explosive concentration of gasoline vapor in normal operating conditions. Electrical equipment in the fueling area may be specially certified for use around gasoline vapors.

<text>The Lotus Seven is a sports car produced by the British manufacturer Lotus Cars (initially called Lotus Engineering) between 1957 and 1973. The Seven is an open-wheel car with two seats and an open top. It was designed by Lotus founder Colin Chapman and has been considered the embodiment of the Lotus philosophy of performance through low weight and simplicity. The original model was highly successful with more than 2,500 cars sold, due to its attraction as a road legal car that could be used for clubman racing.

After Lotus ended production of the Seven, Caterham bought the rights and today Caterham makes both kits and fully assembled cars based on the original design known as the Caterham 7.

The Lotus Seven design has spawned a host of imitations on the kit car market, generally called &quot;Sevens&quot; or &quot;Sevenesque&quot; roadsters. 

==History==
===Series 1===
The Lotus Seven was launched in 1957 to replace the Mark VI as the entry-level Lotus model. The Seven name was left over from a model that Lotus abandoned, which would have been a Riley-engine single-seater that Lotus intended to enter into the Formula Two in 1952 or 1953. However, the car was completed on Chapman&#x27;s chassis as a sports car by its backers and christened the Clairmonte Special.

Externally similar to Chapman&#x27;s earlier Lotus Mark VI, but with a different tubular frame similar to the Lotus Eleven, the Seven was powered by a Ford Sidevalve 1,172 cc straight-four engine. In addition to the Ford unit, both BMC series A and Coventry Climax FWA engines were available for fitment. Under the Purchase Tax system of the time cars supplied as a kit did not attract the tax surcharge that would apply if sold in assembled form. Tax rules specified assembly instructions could not be included. This situation remained until 1973 and a large proportion of Sevens sold in the United Kingdom were delivered in kit form as a result.

The Seven Series 1 was used both on the road and for club racing (750 motor club in the UK).

===Series 2===

The Lotus Seven S2 followed in June 1960 and was supplemented by the Lotus Super Seven S2 from 1961. These were slightly more road-oriented than the Series 1, and received a somewhat simpler chassis. The Series 1&#x27;s aluminium nosecone was changed to a fibreglass unit. Cycle fenders were originally standard, with clamshell units standard fitment on the 1500, Super Seven, and America or available as an option.

While the 1172 cc Sidevalve unit remained available until 1962, the series 2 typically used Ford Kent engines of 1,340 or 1,499 cc from the Ford Consul Classic. These were also available with Cosworth modifications; the Cosworth 1,340 cc &quot;Super Seven&quot; delivered and the later &quot;Super Seven 1500&quot; . Some Series 2 Sevens built during 1968 (oftentimes referred to as &quot;Series &quot;) were fitted with the later crossflow Kent engine of 1,599 cc.

The series II had problems with its Standard Companion estate car rear axle and differential, unable to cope with the high power and cornering forces of the Seven. This was later solved on the Series III by installing a Ford Cortina rear end. Production of the Series 2 ended in August 1968, after 1310 examples had been built.

===Series 3===

The Seven S3 was released in 1968. As for late Series 2s, the S3 typically received the 1,599 cc crossflow Kent engine. First shown at Earl&#x27;s Court in 1969, the Super Seven Twin Cam SS used the Lotus Twin Cam engine. Only 13 examples were built. While only manufactured by Lotus for around two years, the Series 3 was the model later revived by Caterham after they ran out of Series 4 kits some time in the first half of the 1970s. In modified form, the design continues to be produced until today (2023).
Between 1970 and 1975, following a representation agreement, Lotus Argentina SA obtained the licence to manufacture the Lotus Seven in Argentina. This production reached approximately 51 units. These vehicles were not replicas but built under licence and branded as Lotuses.

===Series 4===

In 1970, Lotus radically changed the shape of the car to create the slightly more conventional sized Series 4 (S4), with a squarer fibreglass shell replacing most of the aluminium bodywork. It also offered some luxuries as standard, such as an internal heater matrix. The S4 Seven could be supplied with 1298 or 1599 cc Kent engines or the twin cam.

Until now, most Sevens in the UK had been sold in kit form in order to avoid paying purchase tax. However, once the UK joined the EEC on 1 January 1973, the VAT system was adopted instead so the tax advantage of the kit-built Lotus Seven came to an end. Accordingly, in 1973, Lotus decided to shed fully its &quot;British tax system&quot;-inspired kit car image. As part of this plan, it sold the rights to the Seven to its only remaining agents Caterham Cars in England and Steel Brothers Limited in New Zealand.

Caterham ran out of the Lotus Series 4 kits in the early 1970s. When this occurred and in accordance with their agreement with Lotus, Caterham introduced its own brand version of the Series 3. They have been manufacturing the car ever since as the Caterham Seven. Steel Brothers Limited in Christchurch, New Zealand, assembled Lotus Seven Series 4s until March 1979 when the last of the 95 kits provided by Lotus was used up. Steel Brothers had a much wider range of factory options than the UK models with carpet, centre console glove-box, radio, window-washer and hardtop. Sold largely to competition enthusiasts, the NZ cars also had engine modifications, close-ratio gears, and adjustable suspension as factory options. As such, they were very successful in local racing. With officially licensed production stopping in 1979, the last Lotus badged Seven, a Series 4, was therefore produced in New Zealand.

Steel Brothers Limited attempted to make a wider, modernised version of the Series 4, the Lotus Super 907, using the twin cam Lotus 907 engine. In the spring of 1978 it was announced that this was to be sold in the United States - but the American importer had no funds and the project came to naught. The single finished Super 907 was moved from New Zealand to the United States in 2010 to undergo a full restoration.

==Performance==

===Road test===
A car with a tuned Ford 1172 cc engine and close-ratio gearbox was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1958. It was found to have a top speed of , could accelerate from 0- in 6.2 seconds and had a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £1,157 including taxes of £386. They commented that car could be bought in component form and then it would have cost £399 for the parts from Lotus, £100 for the Ford engine and gearbox and £27 for the BMC rear axle.

===Top speed===
A Seven&#x27;s top speed greatly depends upon the body configuration, engine power and gearing. Early models with low-powered engines had difficulty exceeding , although a race-prepared Seven was clocked at whilst driven by Brausch Niemann through a speed-trap at the 1962 Natal Grand Prix. In addition, clamshell style wings tend to create drag and generate lift at higher speeds. Cycle wings help alleviate this tendency, and low height Brookland aeroscreens or the lighter Perspex variants that can replace the windscreen help improve top end speed. Sevens do suffer from front end lift at high speed – the nose creates more lift than downforce at speeds over around , although retro fitted &quot;winglets&quot; may counter this.

===Low speed acceleration===
Nearly all Sevens, due to their extremely light weight (around 10cwt / 500 kg) have excellent acceleration, especially up to , depending on power. The original late 1950s Sevens could beat most contemporary saloon cars—and by the early 1960s, with improved Ford-Cosworth engines could take on most high-performance sports cars with 0–60 mph time in the low 7 seconds.

===Braking===
The less powerful early models had drum brakes all around, in common with most road cars of the time. Later models had front disc brakes. Physics favours small cars in braking and Sevens have excellent stopping distances.

===Handling===
The highest part of the car is about three feet (900 mm) from the road and it has a cloth top and side curtains with plastic back and side windows. The supports for the top and the windshield frame are aluminium. The lower chassis tubes are five inches (127 mm) from the road, while the wet-sump, bell housing, and one chassis tube are lower, meaning the centre of gravity is very low.

The front/rear weight distribution is nearly equal and the lack of a boot and small petrol tank assure that it remains fairly constant. It is, however, more front-heavy than more modern high-performance cars.

====Suspension====
In the original Seven, the front lower A-arm (or &quot;wishbone&quot;) of the double wishbone suspension is traditional, but for the purpose of reducing weight, the upper suspension integrated an anti-roll (anti-sway) bar into a horizontal suspension arm. This approach formed a pseudo-wishbone which was semi-independent in nature. This approach worked well with early cross-ply tyres, but with later radials, the configuration seriously affected its adjustability.

For the rear suspension, Lotus originally used a live axle (or solid axle). This approach was very cost-effective since most production saloon cars up to the 1980s used these components. A mixture of Ford, Standard Motor Company and Austin components was used. One disadvantage of live axles is higher unsprung weight, affecting handling and ride on rough surfaces.

====Aerodynamics====
In general, cars with non-optimised aerodynamics tend to be free of adverse aerodynamic effects on handling, but the front wheel arches, of all but the Series I, cause lift at high speeds. Like the good straight-line performance, the car&#x27;s nimble handling is limited in the speed range, and this is not usually important in a car intended for public roads.

While the car&#x27;s frontal area is small, the Lotus Seven has a drag coefficient (formula_1) among the highest of any known production car - ranging from 0.65 to 0.75, depending on the bodywork.

Additionally, the clamshell front wings develop lift. This is accentuated by the slight natural lift caused by rotating wheels. Consequently, Sevens have exhibited understeer at high speeds.

====Steering====
The rack and pinion steering provide a minimum of play and friction.

===Frame rigidity===

It is a stressed skin construction, in which the flat aluminium body panels, and especially the floor, stiffen and effectively triangulate the largely rectangular steel tubular frame structure. This gives a rigid frame with few tubes and very little bodyweight that does not contribute to the frame stiffness. The flat panels avoid difficulties in shaping aluminum sheet into smooth compound curves. On the downside, it does not allow attractive curves or streamlining.

==Mechanical details==

===Engines===
Originally equipped with the Ford Sidevalve engine, the Series 2 received the new Ford Kent engine. The original &quot;Super Seven&quot; received versions of the Kent unit with Cosworth modifications. Later, the Kent engine was updated to the crossflow design; this 1.6-litre engine was the most commonly installed one in the Series 3 as well as Series 4. A limited number of earlier cars received Coventry Climax FWA engines, while the later cars were offered with the Lotus-Ford Twin Cam engine.

===Frame and body===
The Lotus Seven was designed with racing in mind, and lightness was of primary concern to Chapman. Like racing cars of the time, it was therefore built around a multi-tube space frame with high sides to allow a stiffer frame (longer lever arm). The Series II and later road versions had simpler frames than the more race-oriented Series I.

A front-mounted engine driving the rear wheels (a similar layout to most cars of the day) and a very lightweight steel spaceframe was covered with stressed aluminium panel bodywork. The body panels were mainly flat to avoid the expense of more elaborate curved bodywork, and the simple cloth lined plastic doors were hinged from the windscreen. The nose-cone and wheel arches were originally aluminium parts, but these were replaced in the later S2 and S3 models with painted or self-coloured fibreglass.

===Weight===
Early Lotus Sevens weighed around 1,100 lb (10cwt/500 kg). Although the weight crept upward as production progressed, it remained remarkably low for a production car of over a litre displacement.

===Suspension===
The front was by &quot;A&quot; arms and coil springs with an anti-roll bar serving as the front half of the top A-arm. The rear had trailing arms, a triangular centre locating member, and a solid rear axle.

==Replicas==
Because of the Seven&#x27;s relatively simple design, over 160 companies have offered replicas or Seven-type cars over the years. Many have been challenged over the years by the UK rights-holder, Caterham. Such cars are often referred to as &quot;sevenesque&quot; or simply a &quot;seven&quot; or &quot;se7en&quot;. Sometimes they are also called clubmans or &quot;locost&quot;. Some examples are:

<text>The Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) is a private university in the Terre Haute, Indiana area. It was founded in 1874 with only three bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. It has since grown to twelve academic departments with over thirty undergraduate and graduate degree programs in science, engineering, technology, and engineering management, leading to bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees.

==History==

===Founding===

Founder Chauncey Rose, along with nine friends, created the Terre Haute School of Industrial Science in 1874 to provide technical training after encountering difficulties in recruiting local engineers during construction of his railroads. Mr. Rose donated the land, at 13th and Locust St., and the majority of the funds needed to start the new school. A year later, the cornerstone of the new institution was laid and the name was changed to Rose Polytechnic Institute despite the objections of the president of the board of managers and chief benefactor, Mr. Rose. The original campus was a single building, with no dormitories or recreational facilities.

The first class of 48 students entered in 1883, chosen from 58 applicants. All students were male, and 37 came from Indiana. All but four chose to major in mechanical engineering, with civil engineering and chemistry the only other majors. Nearly half of the original students would eventually leave their studies before graduation for several reasons, including poor grades or conduct. The first president was Charles O. Thompson, who modeled the education of Rose Polytechnic after eastern institutions, making it the first private engineering college west of the Alleghenies.

During the early years of the school, finance was a major concern. Many faculty and staff accepted pay cuts to stay at the institution.

In 1889 the school awarded what it considered to be the first chemical engineering degree in the country. In 1897 John B. Peddle was appointed professor of machine design, a post he held until 1933. In 1910 he published the &quot;Construction of Graphical Charts&quot;, which was the first book in the English language treating the art of graphical representation.

===Relocation===
In 1917, the school, having grown to more than 300 students, moved from 13th and Locust Street to a new site consisting of of farmland east of town, donated by the Hulman family of Terre Haute. The old location was used continuously by the Vigo County School District from 1922 to 2013; as of 2020 the Terre Haute Boys &amp; Girls Club occupies the site. The cornerstone of the new campus was laid in 1922. The new campus consisted of an academic building (now known as Moench Hall) and the institute&#x27;s first dormitory, Deming Hall, both of which are still in use today.

Early life at Rose consisted of social fraternities, athletics, and the occasional &quot;high jinks&quot;. A popular &quot;high jinks&quot; involved the sophomore class inviting the freshmen class to a baseball game but were told to &quot;leave their pipes with the nurse&quot;. The freshmen would produce the pipes at a specific time and a brawl would ensue.

===War years===
During World War I, Rose Polytechnic trained students in technical subjects such as vehicle maintenance, and created a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) Engineer unit which later became the Wabash Battalion Army ROTC program. During World War II the ROTC unit was replaced with an Army Specialized Training Unit and students could enter and graduate after every quarter to support the war effort. This enrollment schedule continued through the post-war years until 1951.

===1960s–1970s===
In recognition of the Hulman family&#x27;s significant contributions and continued financial support, in particular a $15 million addition to the endowment, Rose Polytechnic was renamed Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology in 1971.

During the 1960s and 1970s, growth accelerated under president John A. Logan. Five new residence halls, a new student union, library, and a student recreation center were all constructed between 1963 and 1976. Permission was sought and received to increase the student population to 1000.

The quarterly cryptology journal &quot;Cryptologia&quot; was founded and published at RHIT from 1977 to 1995, at which time it was moved to the United States Military Academy.

===1990s–present===
For most of its history, Rose–Hulman was a men&#x27;s only institution with some cooperative arrangements with Saint Mary Of-The-Woods College women&#x27;s school and Indiana State University. It voted to become coeducational in 1991, with the first full-time women students starting in 1995.

In the decade following 1995, Rose–Hulman&#x27;s growth was aided by a major fundraising campaign, &quot;Vision to be the Best&quot;. Originally a $100 million campaign over ten years, it met its goal in half the time. The goal was extended to $200 million, and by the end of the campaign in June 2004, over $250 million had been raised. In 1997, many physical changes were made to the Rose–Hulman campus. Using a gift from the F. W. Olin Foundation, an expansion of Olin Hall known as the Olin Advanced Learning Center opened. Additionally, The John T Myers Center for Technological Research opened, with space for research laboratories, presentation rooms, classrooms, and academic offices. Shook Field House was replaced by the $20 million Sports and Recreation Center, which the National Football League&#x27;s Indianapolis Colts used for their summer training camp from 1999 to 2010. In 2002, Hatfield Hall, a theater and alumni center, was opened.

After the 2004 retirement of institute president Samuel Hulbert, who had led the school since 1976, the college faced a leadership crisis. Soon after John J. Midgley arrived as the new president, rumors of conflict between Midgley and the administration started to circulate. Students, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;, held a rally calling for Midgley&#x27;s resignation. Midgley resigned as president of the institute on June 11, 2005, less than a year into his presidency, after the faculty, staff, and Student Government Association approved votes of no confidence. During the succeeding academic year, Robert Bright, the chairman of the Board of Trustees, served as interim chief executive officer.

In 2006, Gerald Jakubowski, Vice President and Professor of Engineering at Arizona State University, became the 13th president of the institute, taking over July 1, 2006. He resigned in 2009, and the Board of Trustees elected Matt Branam to serve as interim president. He became president later that year. Branam died of a heart attack in April 2012, and the cabinet subsequently selected Robert A. Coons as the institute&#x27;s interim president. In 2013, the Board of Trustees named James C. Conwell as the institute&#x27;s 15th president, starting May 1, 2013.

In 2017, the school acquired from the former home of Mari Hulman George.

In 2018, Conwell resigned as president, and Senior Vice President Robert Coons was appointed to serve as acting president and then, in November 2018, as the university president. In the same year, the Hulman Memorial Student Union was renovated and renamed the Mussallem Union after the primary donors, the Mussallem Family. The Mussallem Union is centrally located on campus and provides student meeting spaces, dining areas, conference rooms, health services, bookstore, and administrative space.

In 2019, an expansion of the Branam Innovation Center (BIC), the Kremer Innovation Center (KIC) opened. The BIC and KIC provide rapid prototyping and manufacturing options to students, in addition to housing thermofluids and wet lab facilities, conference rooms, classrooms, and project team workshops.

In 2021, the New Academic Building was opened, with funding provided by a $15 million lead gift by an anonymous donor. The New Academic Building is home to the Engineering Design program, chemistry laboratory facilities, food science laboratory, breakout and study rooms, as well as a large atrium. Together with Moench Hall and the Myers Center, a new courtyard was opened. The New Academic building is the first building in the state of Indiana to apply for WELL recognition.

==Academics==
The curricula at RHIT concentrate on engineering and the natural sciences. The school&#x27;s primary focus is undergraduate education, though there is a small graduate program for master&#x27;s degree students. There are no doctoral programs. As of 2021, Rose–Hulman has 189 faculty members, 99% of whom hold a PhD. The current student-to-faculty ratio is 11:1. Admission to the institute remains competitive due to its self-selecting admissions class and applicant sharing with Purdue, and other top universities. In 2022, 602 freshman students enrolled out of 3,353 accepted applicants.

===Accreditation===
Rose–Hulman has been regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1916, with the most recent reaffirmation of accreditation having occurred in the 2014–2015 accreditation year. The Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Design, Engineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Optical Engineering, and Software Engineering programs are accredited by The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

In addition to institutional membership in the American Society for Engineering Education, the institute is also a member of the Association of Independent Technological Universities, a group formed to further the interests of private engineering schools.

===Rankings and reputation===
As of 2021, the institute has been ranked first among engineering colleges that do not offer a doctorate degree by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 24 consecutive years. Each individual program assessed has also been ranked first since the magazine has published individual rankings. These programs are the Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, and Biomedical Engineering programs (Biomedical Engineering programs have only received assessment in the 2015 rankings).

==Campus==
Most of the university property is in the Terre Haute city limits, though parts extend outside of the city limits. The university as a whole is in Lost Creek Township.

==Student life==
The student body tends to come mostly from the Midwestern United States, though, as the school has gained prominence, it has gradually attracted a more geographically and ethnically diverse applicant pool. 39% of students are from the state of Indiana with large numbers of students from the nearby states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota.

The school has several competition teams that operate out of the Branam and Kremer Innovation Centers. These include Team Rose Motorsports, Grand Prix Engineering (Formula SAE), Human Powered Vehicle Challenge, Rose Rocketry, AIAA Design/Build/Fly, Chem-E-Car, MakerLab, Make It Happen, and various robotics competitions among many others.

There are eight social fraternities and three social sororities, some of which have their houses on campus. As of 2003, nearly 69% of the students were members of Greek social organizations.

Rose–Hulman Ventures serves as a source of internships and job opportunities with startups and established companies of all sizes for Rose students and alumni. Rose–Hulman Ventures was established in 1999 with a $30 million grant from the Lilly Endowment and received a $24.9 million follow-up grant in 2002.

==Athletics==
The team&#x27;s sports teams are called the Rose–Hulman Fightin&#x27; Engineers.

==Media==
The school&#x27;s student-run newspaper is &quot;The Rose Thorn&quot;.

Rose–Hulman has an amateur radio club, the &quot;Rose Tech Radio Club&quot; (call sign W9NAA), that maintains a dedicated on-campus station.

The &quot;Rose–Hulman Film Club&quot; produces student-directed short films.

The campus radio station was WMHD-FM 90.7 FM, &quot;The Monkey&quot;. The station originally broadcast with a very low power transmitter and antenna located on campus, but later operated with an off-site transmitter at 1400 watts. The studio facilities for the station were in the basement of the BSB residence hall. The station was operated entirely by student volunteers, and all disc-jockeys choose their own format and playlists. In August 2014, the station was sold to Indiana State University.
