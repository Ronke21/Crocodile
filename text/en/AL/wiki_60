<text>Gertrude Stein (February 3, 1874 – July 27, 1946) was an American novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector. Born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh), and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.

In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot;, and &quot;there is no there there&quot;, with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.

Her books include &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein&#x27;s friends; &quot;Fernhurst&quot;, a fictional story about a love triangle; &quot;Three Lives&quot; (1905–06); &quot;The Making of Americans&quot; (1902–1911); and &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; (1914).

Her activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, only through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Faÿ. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshal Pétain.

==Early life==

Stein, the youngest of a family of five children, was born on February 3, 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (which merged with Pittsburgh in 1907), to upper-middle-class Jewish parents, Daniel Stein and Amelia Stein, née Keyser. Her father was a wealthy businessman with real estate holdings. German and English were spoken in their home. Gertrude&#x27;s siblings were: Michael (1865), Simon (1868), Bertha (1870), and Leo (1872).

When Stein was three years old, she and her family moved to Vienna, and then Paris. Accompanied by governesses and tutors, the Steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of European history and life. After a year-long sojourn abroad, they returned to America in 1878, settling in Oakland, California, where her father became director of San Francisco&#x27;s streetcar lines, the Market Street Railway. Stein attended First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland&#x27;s Sabbath school. During their residence in Oakland, they lived for four years on a ten-acre lot, and Stein built many memories of California there. She would often go on excursions with her brother, Leo, with whom she developed a close relationship. Stein found formal schooling in Oakland unstimulating, but she often read Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Scott, Burns, Smollett, Fielding, and more.

When Stein was 14 years old, her mother died. Three years later, her father died as well. Stein&#x27;s eldest brother, Michael Stein, age 26, then took over the family business holdings, moved his four siblings to San Francisco, where he now was a director of the Market Street Cable Railway Company, and in 1892 arranged for Gertrude and another sister, Bertha, to live with their mother&#x27;s family in Baltimore. Here she lived with her uncle David Bachrach, who in 1877 had married Gertrude&#x27;s maternal aunt, Fanny Keyser.

In Baltimore, Stein met Claribel and Etta Cone, who held Saturday evening salons that she would later emulate in Paris. The Cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that Stein would replicate in her relationship with Alice B. Toklas.

==Education==
===Radcliffe===
Stein attended Radcliffe College, then an annex of Harvard University, from 1893 to 1897 and was a student of psychologist William James. With James&#x27;s supervision, Stein and another student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on &quot;normal motor automatism&quot;, a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking.

These experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;, a psychological theory often attributed to James and the style of modernist authors Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. In 1934, behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner interpreted Stein&#x27;s difficult poem &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; as an example of &quot;normal motor automatism&quot;. In a letter Stein wrote during the 1930s, she explained that she never accepted the theory of automatic writing: &quot;[T]here can be automatic movements, but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically.&quot; She did publish an article in a psychological journal on &quot;spontaneous automatic writing&quot; while at Radcliffe, but &quot;the unconscious and the intuition (even when James himself wrote about them) never concerned her&quot;.

At Radcliffe, she began a lifelong friendship with Mabel Foote Weeks, whose correspondence traces much of the progression of Stein&#x27;s life. In 1897, Stein spent the summer in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, studying embryology at the Marine Biological Laboratory. She received her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1898.

===Johns Hopkins School of Medicine===
William James, who had become a committed mentor to Stein at Radcliffe, recognizing her intellectual potential, and declaring her his &quot;most brilliant woman student&quot;, encouraged Stein to enroll in medical school. Although Stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine, she enrolled at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1897. In her fourth year, Stein failed an important course, lost interest, and left. Ultimately, medical school had bored her, and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies, but taking long walks and attending the opera.

Stein&#x27;s tenure at Johns Hopkins was marked by challenges and stress. Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in &quot;Things As They Are&quot;, 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as &quot;Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn.&quot; According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein&#x27;s &quot;controversial stance on women&#x27;s medicine caused problems with the male faculty&quot; and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.

Asked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled &quot;The Value of College Education for Women&quot;, undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:

While a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still naïve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with Mary Bookstaver who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her &quot;erotic awakening&quot;. The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies. In 1902, Stein&#x27;s brother Leo Stein left for London, and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.

==Art collection==

From 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the Luxembourg Gardens on the Left Bank of Paris in a two-story apartment (with the adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at 27 rue de Fleurus, 6th arrondissement. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.

The gallery space was furnished with imposing Renaissance-era furniture from Florence, Italy. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to World War I.

Leo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time. The art historian and collector Bernard Berenson hosted Gertrude and Leo in his English country house in 1902, facilitating their introduction to Paul Cézanne and the dealer Ambroise Vollard. Vollard was heavily involved in the Cézanne art market, and he was the first important contact in the Paris art world for both Leo and Gertrude.

The joint collection of Gertrude and Leo Stein began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of 8,000 francs. They spent this at Vollard&#x27;s Gallery, buying Gauguin&#x27;s &quot;Sunflowers&quot; and &quot;Three Tahitians&quot;, Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Bathers&quot;, and two Renoirs.
The art collection increased and the walls at Rue de Fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions. In &quot;the first half of 1905&quot; the Steins acquired Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Mme Cézanne&quot; and Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Perseus and Andromeda&quot;. Shortly after the opening of the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1905 (on October 18, 1905), the Steins acquired Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Woman with a Hat&quot; and Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Young Girl with a Flower Basket&quot;. In 1906, Picasso completed &quot;Portrait of Gertrude Stein&quot;, which remained in her collection until her death.

Henry McBride (art critic for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;) did much for Stein&#x27;s reputation in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: &quot;[I]n proportion to its size and quality... [it is] just about the most potent of any that I have ever heard of in history.&quot; McBride also observed that Gertrude &quot;collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off.&quot;

By early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein&#x27;s studio had many paintings by Henri Manguin, Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Honoré Daumier, Henri Matisse, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in Paris, and to which they contributed, either by lending their art or by patronizing the featured artists. The Steins&#x27; elder brother, Michael, and sister-in-law Sarah (Sally) acquired a large number of Henri Matisse paintings; Gertrude&#x27;s friends from Baltimore, Claribel and Etta Cone, collected similarly, eventually donating their art collection, virtually intact, to the Baltimore Museum of Art.

While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Where Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso&#x27;s works dominated Leo and Gertrude&#x27;s collection, the collection of Michael and Sarah Stein emphasized Matisse. In April 1914 Leo relocated to Settignano, Italy, near Florence, and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins&#x27; art collection was described in a letter by Leo:

Leo departed with sixteen Renoirs and, relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to Cézanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist&#x27;s works with his sister, taking with him only a Cézanne painting of &quot;5 apples&quot;. The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after World War I, and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again. The Steins&#x27; holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.

After her and Leo&#x27;s households separated in 1914, Stein continued to collect examples of Picasso&#x27;s art, which had turned to Cubism, a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude&#x27;s remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and Juan Gris, most of her other pictures having been sold.

Gertrude Stein&#x27;s personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, &quot;[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th-century painting in the world.&quot; After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of Juan Gris, André Masson, and Sir Francis Rose. In 1932, Stein asserted: &quot;Painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.&quot;

In 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter Francisco Riba Rovira (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed with the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played, and tormented all these things.

The only one who wanted to insist on this problem was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.

==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==

The gatherings in the Stein home &quot;brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art&quot;. Dedicated attendees included Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Gavin Williamson, Thornton Wilder, Sherwood Anderson, Francis Cyril Rose, Bob Brown, René Crevel, Élisabeth de Gramont, Francis Picabia, Claribel Cone, Mildred Aldrich, Jane Peterson, Carl Van Vechten, Henri Matisse and Georges Braque. Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors.

It was Stein&#x27;s partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room. From &quot;Alice Entertained the Wives&quot; (New York Times, 1977): &quot; &#x27;I am a person acted upon, not a person who acts,&#x27; Alice told one of Gertrude&#x27;s biographers (...) When guests showed up, Alice was called upon to entertain their wives. The ladies were, of course, &#x27;second‐class citizens&#x27; &quot;

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of Cézanne: &quot;Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.&quot;

Among Picasso&#x27;s acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: Fernande Olivier (an artists’ model in a relationship with Picasso), Georges Braque (artist), André Derain (artist), Max Jacob (poet), Guillaume Apollinaire (poet and art critic), Marie Laurencin (artist, in a relationship with Apollinaire), Henri Rousseau (painter), and Joseph Stella (painter).

Hemingway frequented Stein&#x27;s salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway &quot;yellow&quot; in &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.&quot; Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child. While Stein has been credited with inventing the term &quot;Lost Generation&quot; for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.

During the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer Paul Bowles to go to Tangier, where she and Alice had vacationed.

In 1938, Stein and Toklas moved from the rue de Fleurus to 5 rue Christine in the 6th arrondissement. For much of the war they sheltered in a house they had rented for several years in the hamlet of Bilignin in the commune of Belley (Ain), which was initially outside the area of direct German occupation in the &quot;Zone libre&quot;.

==Literary style==

Stein&#x27;s writing can be placed in three categories: &quot;hermetic&quot; works best illustrated by &quot;The Making of Americans: The Hersland Family&quot;; popularized writing such as &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which &quot;Brewsie and Willie&quot; is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, libretti, and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot;; &quot;Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle&quot;; about her childhood home in Oakland, &quot;There is no there there&quot;; and &quot;The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.&quot;

A reader wrote to Stein in 1933 asking her to explain the rose quotation received a reply from Toklas as her secretary: &quot;The device rose is a rose is a rose is a rose means just that. Miss Stein is unfortunately too busy herself to be able to tell you herself, but trusts that you will eventually come to understand that each and every word that she writes means exactly what she says, for she says very exactly what she means, and really nothing more, but, of course, nothing less.&quot;

These stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or &quot;portraits&quot;, were designed to evoke &quot;the excitingness of pure being&quot; and can be seen as literature&#x27;s answer to visual art styles and forms such as Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Many of the experimental works such as &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein&#x27;s work on &quot;automatic writing&quot; with William James, she did not see her work as automatic, but as an &#x27;excess of consciousness&#x27;.

Though Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of Cézanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: &quot;the whole field of the canvas is important&quot;. Rather than a figure/ground relationship, &quot;Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.&quot; It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: &quot;[T]he important thing... is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.&quot;

Her use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the &quot;bottom nature&quot; of her characters, such as in &quot;The Making of Americans&quot; where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as &quot;As I was saying&quot; and &quot;There will be now a history of her.&quot; Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with &quot;too much association&quot;. Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear, and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative. Stein&#x27;s work was included in the second issue of 0 to 9 magazine, a journal which explored language and meaning-making during the 1960s avant garde movement.

Stein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous presence in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes &quot;play&quot; as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: &quot;rather than the emotional manipulation that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses &quot;play&quot;.&quot; In addition, Stein&#x27;s work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly, Grahn argues that one must &quot;&quot;inster&quot;stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than &#x27;figuring it out.&#x27; Figure it in.&quot; In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein&#x27;s autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of &quot;The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook&quot;, which was written by Toklas. Many critics speculated that Toklas actually had written &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, despite Toklas repeatedly denying authorship.

Several of Stein&#x27;s writings have been set to music by composers, including Virgil Thomson&#x27;s operas &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; and &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot;, and James Tenney&#x27;s setting of &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot; as a canon dedicated to Philip Corner, beginning with &quot;a&quot; on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. &quot;a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.&quot;

==Literary career==
While living in Paris, Stein began submitting her writing for publication. Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was &quot;Three Lives&quot;. In 1911, Mildred Aldrich introduced Stein to Mabel Dodge Luhan and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude&#x27;s legend in the United States.

Mabel was enthusiastic about Stein&#x27;s sprawling publication &quot;The Makings of Americans&quot; and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of &quot;Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia&quot;. Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the 69th Regiment Armory Show in 1913, &quot;the first avant-garde art exhibition in America&quot;.

In addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein&#x27;s writing to appear in America, in &quot;Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose&quot;, published in a special March 1913 publication of &quot;Arts and Decoration&quot;. Foreshadowing Stein&#x27;s later critical reception, Dodge wrote in &quot;Speculations&quot;:

Stein and Carl Van Vechten, the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was &quot;Papa Woojums&quot;, and Stein, &quot;Baby Woojums&quot;. Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein&#x27;s literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.

===America (1934–1935)===
In October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in Times Square announced to all that &quot;Gertrude Stein Has Arrived.&quot; Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Among other sites, Stein visited Civil War battlefields, toured Chicago with homicide detectives, saw a football game in New Haven, dined in New Orleans, visited Scott Fitzergald and Zelda Sayer in Baltimore, and returned to her childhood home in Oakland.

Stein&#x27;s tour was partly to give public lectures, and she prepared each individually; the audiences were limited to five hundred attendees. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.

Stein&#x27;s effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that &quot;Stein&#x27;s audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.&quot; Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a speech disorder, palilalia, which caused her &quot;to stutter over words and phrases&quot;. The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who could hold listeners with the &quot;musicality of her language&quot;.

In Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President&#x27;s wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. In Beverly Hills, California, she visited actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her. Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from Random House, who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works. The &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; wrote after Stein&#x27;s return to Paris: &quot;No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.&quot;

===Books===
====&quot;Q.E.D&quot;.====
Stein completed &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, her first novel, on October 24, 1903. One of the earliest coming out stories, it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and Mary Bookstaver, and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. 

====&quot;Fernhurst&quot; (1904)====
In 1904, Stein began &quot;Fernhurst&quot;, a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean (M. Carey Thomas), a faculty member from Bryn Mawr College (Mary Gwinn) and a Harvard graduate (Alfred Hodder). Mellow asserts that &quot;Fernhurst&quot; &quot;is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing&quot;. It includes some commentary that Gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the &quot;fateful twenty-ninth year&quot; during which:

Mellow observes that, in 1904, 30-year-old Gertrude &quot;had evidently determined that the &#x27;small hard reality&#x27; of her life would be writing&quot;.

====&quot;Three Lives&quot; (1905–1906)====
Stein attributed the inception of &quot;Three Lives&quot; to the inspiration she received from a portrait Cézanne had painted of his wife and which was in the Stein collection. She credited this as a revelatory moment in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:

She began &quot;Three Lives&quot; during the spring of 1905 and finished it the following year.

====&quot;The Making of Americans&quot; (1902–1911)====
Gertrude Stein stated the date for her writing of &quot;The Making of Americans&quot; was 1906–1908. Her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in 1902 and did not end until 1911. Stein compared her work to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and to Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. Her critics were less enthusiastic about it. Stein wrote the bulk of the novel between 1903 and 1911, and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time. The manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until 1924 when, at the urging of Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford agreed to publish excerpts in the &quot;transatlantic review&quot;. In 1925, the Paris-based Contact Press published a limited run of the novel consisting of 500 copies. A much-abridged edition was published by Harcourt Brace in 1934, but the full version remained out of print until Something Else Press republished it in 1966. In 1995, a new, definitive edition was published by Dalkey Archive Press with a foreword by William Gass.

Gertrude&#x27;s &quot;Matisse&quot; and &quot;Picasso&quot; descriptive essays appeared in Alfred Stieglitz&#x27;s August 1912 edition of &quot;Camera Work&quot;, a special edition devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her first publication. Of this publication, Gertrude said, &quot;[h]e was the first one that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one.&quot;

====Word Portraits (1908–1913)====
Stein&#x27;s descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of Alice B. Toklas, &quot;a little prose vignette, a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of &quot;The Making of Americans&quot;&quot;. Stein&#x27;s early efforts at word portraits are catalogued by Mellow and under individual&#x27;s names in Kellner, 1988. Matisse and Picasso were subjects of early essays, later collected and published in &quot;Geography and Plays&quot; and &quot;Portraits and Prayers&quot;.

Her subjects included several ultimately famous personages, and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her Saturday salons at 27 Rue de Fleurus: &quot;Ada&quot; (Alice B. Toklas), &quot;Two Women&quot; (The Cone sisters, Claribel Cone and Etta Cone), &quot;Miss Furr and Miss Skeene&quot; (Ethel Mars and Maud Hunt Squire), &quot;Men&quot; (Hutchins Hapgood, Peter David Edstrom, Maurice Sterne), &quot;Matisse&quot; (1909, Henri Matisse), &quot;Picasso&quot; (1909, Pablo Picasso), &quot;Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia&quot; (1911, Mabel Dodge Luhan), and &quot;Guillaume Apollinaire&quot; (1913).

====&quot;Tender Buttons&quot; (1912)====
&quot;Tender Buttons&quot; is the best known of Stein&#x27;s &quot;hermetic&quot; works. It is a small book separated into three sections—&quot;Food&quot;, &quot;Objects&quot; and &quot;Rooms&quot;, each containing prose under subtitles. Its publication in 1914 caused a great dispute between Mabel Dodge Luhan and Stein, because Mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher. Mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press Gertrude selected. Evans wrote Gertrude:

Stein ignored Mabel&#x27;s exhortations and published 1,000 copies of the book in 1914. An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as &quot;Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition&quot; by City Lights Publishers in March 2014.

In an interview with Robert Bartlett Haas in &quot;A Transatlantic Interview – 1946&quot;, Stein insisted that this work was completely &quot;realistic&quot; in the tradition of Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: &quot;I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen.&quot; Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the &quot;reference&quot; of objects remained central to her work, although the &quot;representation&quot; of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that &quot;[u]nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know.&quot;

====&quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; (1933)====
The publication of &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; lifted Gertrude Stein from literary obscurity to almost immediate celebrity in the United States. Although popular with the American public, Stein received considerable backlash from individuals portrayed in her book. Eugene Jolas, editor of the avant-garde journal &quot;Transition&quot;, published a pamphlet titled &quot;Testimony against Gertrude Stein&quot; in which artists such as Henri Matisse and Georges Braque expressed their objections to Stein&#x27;s portrayal of the Parisian community of artists and intellectuals. Braque, in his response, criticized, &quot;she had entirely misunderstood cubism which she sees simply in terms of personalities&quot;.

====&quot;Four in America&quot; (1947)====
Published posthumously by Yale University Press in 1947, with an introduction by Thornton Wilder, &quot;Four in America&quot; creates alternative biographies of Ulysses S. Grant as a religious leader, Wilbur Wright as a painter, George Washington as a novelist, and Henry James as a military general.

==Alice B. Toklas==

Stein met her life partner Alice B. Toklas on September 8, 1907, on Toklas&#x27;s first day in Paris, at Sarah and Michael Stein&#x27;s apartment. On meeting Stein, Toklas wrote:

Soon thereafter, Stein introduced Toklas to Pablo Picasso at his Bateau-Lavoir studio, where he was at work on &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;.

In 1908, they summered in Fiesole, Italy, Toklas staying with Harriet Lane Levy, the companion of her trip from the United States, and her housemate until Alice moved in with Stein and Leo in 1910. That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice&#x27;s summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark&#x27;s.

Toklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910. In an essay written at the time, Stein humorously discussed the complex efforts, involving much letter-writing and Victorian niceties, to extricate Levy from Toklas&#x27;s living arrangements. In &quot;Harriet&quot;, Stein considers Levy&#x27;s nonexistent plans for the summer, following her nonexistent plans for the winter:

During the early summer of 1914, Stein bought three paintings by Juan Gris: &quot;Roses&quot;, &quot;Glass and Bottle&quot;, and &quot;Book and Glasses&quot;. Soon after she purchased them from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler&#x27;s gallery, the Great War began, Kahnweiler&#x27;s stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Stein attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of &quot;Three Lives&quot;, to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914, and returned on October 17. When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting Alfred North Whitehead in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.

With money acquired from the sale of Stein&#x27;s last Matisse &quot;Woman with a Hat&quot; to her brother Michael, she and Toklas vacationed in Spain from May 1915 through the spring of 1916. During their interlude in Majorca, Spain, Gertrude continued her correspondence with Mildred Aldrich who kept her apprised of the War&#x27;s progression, and eventually inspired Gertrude and Alice to return to France to join the war effort.

Toklas and Stein returned to Paris in June 1916, and acquired a Ford automobile with the help of associates in the United States; Gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend William Edwards Cook. Gertrude and Alice then volunteered to drive supplies to French hospitals, in the Ford they named &quot;Auntie&quot;, &quot;after Gertrude&#x27;s aunt Pauline, &#x27;who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered.&#x27;&quot;
During the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass-market publication of &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;. She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the Ain district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the Rhône-Alpes. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named &quot;Basket&quot; whose successor, &quot;Basket II&quot;, comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude&#x27;s death.

With the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, Ain, in the Rhône-Alpes region. Stein and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to Bernard Faÿ who was a collaborator with the Vichy regime and had connections to the Gestapo, or possibly because Stein was an American and a famous author. Stein&#x27;s book &quot;Wars I Have Seen&quot; written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to Keystone Cops. When Faÿ was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Stein and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Faÿ&#x27;s escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler&#x27;s bunker in Berchtesgaden. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: &quot;Off We All Went To See Germany.&quot;

In the 1980s, a cabinet in the Yale University Beinecke Library, which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein&#x27;s endearment for Toklas was &quot;Baby Precious&quot;, in turn Stein was for Toklas, &quot;Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle&quot;.

===Lesbian relationships===
Stein is the author of one of the earliest coming out stories, &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; (published in 1950 as &quot;Things as They Are&quot;), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of romantic friendship as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested &quot;passion in its many disguised forms&quot;. The relationships of Stein&#x27;s acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with Mary Bookstaver (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.

Stein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of Otto Weininger&#x27;s &quot;Sex and Character&quot; (1906). Weininger, though Jewish by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.

More positive affirmations of Stein&#x27;s sexuality began with her relationship with Alice B. Toklas. Ernest Hemingway describes how Alice was Gertrude&#x27;s &quot;wife&quot; in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway&#x27;s) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two &quot;wives&quot; to chat.

The more affirming essay &quot;Miss Furr and Miss Skeene&quot; is one of the first homosexual revelation stories to be published. The work, like &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, is informed by Stein&#x27;s growing involvement with a homosexual community, though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars. The work contains the word &quot;gay&quot; over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word &quot;gay&quot; in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them. A similar essay of gay men begins more obviously with the line &quot;Sometimes men are kissing&quot; but is less well known.

In &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with &quot;highly condensed layers of public and private meanings&quot; created by wordplay including puns on the words &quot;box&quot;, &quot;cow&quot;, and in titles such as &quot;tender buttons&quot;.

==&quot;There is no there there&quot;==
Along with Stein&#x27;s widely known &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot; quotation, &quot;there is no there there&quot; is one of her most famous. It appears in her work &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Autobiography&quot; (Random House 1937, p. 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue).

Stein wrote:

==Political views==
Stein was a vocal critic of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.

Some have stressed Stein&#x27;s queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, although her statements on immigration need to be seen in context of the time and world events. In a 1934 interview published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she stated: That is the reason why I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant. The French may not like the competition of foreigners, but they let them in. They accept the challenge and derive the stimulus. I am surprised that there is not more discussion of immigration in the United States than there is. We have got rid of prohibition restrictions, and it seems to me the next thing we should do is to relax the severity of immigration restrictions. 

Stein expressed admiration for Vichy leader Marshal Philippe Pétain. Some have argued for a more nuanced view of Stein&#x27;s collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France. Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky: &quot;There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing.&quot;

A poem entitled &quot;The Reverie of the Zionist&quot; appears in Stein&#x27;s posthumous collection &quot;Painted Lace and Other Pieces&quot;. The scholar Barbara Will has described &quot;The Reverie of the Zionist&quot; as &quot;an obscure and fragmentary modernist dialogue.&quot; The poem includes the following lines: 

==World War II activities==
While identified with the modernist movements in art and literature, Stein&#x27;s political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas. She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the Industrial Revolution had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary Ancien Régime. At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal. Her last major work was the libretto of the feminist opera &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot; (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, &quot;Brewsie and Willie&quot; (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.

A compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful Vichy government official Bernard Faÿ. Stein had met Faÿ in 1926, and he became her &quot;dearest friend during her life&quot;, according to Alice B. Toklas. Faÿ had been the primary translator of Stein&#x27;s work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933–34 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;. Faÿ&#x27;s influence was instrumental in avoiding Nazi confiscation of Stein&#x27;s historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork, which throughout the war years was housed in Stein&#x27;s Paris rue Christine apartment, under locked safeguard.

In 1941, at Faÿ&#x27;s suggestion, Stein consented to translate into English some 180 pages of speeches made by Marshal Philippe Pétain. In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between George Washington and Pétain. She writes of the high esteem in which Pétain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler. Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein&#x27;s translations were ultimately never published in the United States. Random House publisher Bennett Cerf had read the introduction Stein had written for the translations and was horrified by what she had produced.

Although Jewish, Stein collaborated with Vichy France, a regime that deported more than 75,000 Jews to Nazi concentration camps, of whom only three percent survived the Holocaust. In 1944, Stein wrote that Pétain&#x27;s policies were &quot;really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary&quot;. This was Stein&#x27;s contention in the year when the town of Culoz, where she and Toklas resided, saw the removal of its Jewish children to Auschwitz. It is difficult to say, however, how aware Stein was of these events. As she wrote in &quot;Wars I Have Seen&quot;, &quot;However near a war is it is always not very near. Even when it is here.&quot; Stein had stopped translating Petain&#x27;s speeches three years previously, in 1941.

Stein was able to condemn the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of Hitler as conqueror of Europe. Journalist Lanning Warren interviewed Stein in her Paris apartment in a piece published in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; on May 6, 1934. Stein, seemingly ironically, proclaimed that Hitler merited the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Saxon element is always destined to be dominated. The Germans have no gift at organizing. They can only obey. And obedience is not organization. Organization comes from community of will as well as community of action. And in America, our democracy has been based on community of will and effort... I say Hitler ought to have the peace prize ... because he is removing all elements of contest and struggle from Germany. By driving out the Jews and the democratic Left elements, he is driving out everything that conduces to activity. That means peace.

Given that after the war Stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the Germans disobedience, this 1934 Stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy. In an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of Stein&#x27;s wartime activity, a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal &quot;Jacket2&quot;.

How much of Stein&#x27;s wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience. She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. In an essay written for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in November 1940, Stein wrote about her decision not to leave France: &quot;it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food.&quot; Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this at a time when Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.

Author Djuna Barnes provided a caustic assessment of Stein&#x27;s book, &quot;Wars I Have Seen&quot;: &quot;You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people. Her concerns at its highest pitch is a well-fed apprehension.&quot;

Others have argued that some of the accounts of Stein&#x27;s wartime activities have amounted to a &quot;witch hunt&quot;.

==Death==
Stein died on July 27, 1946, at the age of 72 after surgery for stomach cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was interred in Paris in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Later Alice B. Toklas was buried alongside her. Famously, one version of her last moments reports that, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: &quot;What is the answer?&quot; After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: &quot;Then, there is no question!&quot;

Her companion Toklas, however, has given two other versions of the encounter—neither of which agrees with the &quot;canonical&quot; version above. Writing in the June 2005 edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Janet Malcolm describes:
 Stein named writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten as her literary executor, and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.

== Critical reception ==
Sherwood Anderson in his public introduction to Stein&#x27;s 1922 publication of &quot;Geography and Plays&quot; wrote:
In a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, &quot;As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.

James Thurber wrote:

In his 1938 biographical novel &quot;The Green Fool,&quot; Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh describes the works of Gertrude Stein fondly as being &quot;like whisky to me; her strange rhythms broke up the cliché formation of my thought&quot;.

==Legacy and commemoration==
Stein has been the subject of many artistic works.

In Bryant Park, in New York City, there is cast replica of sculptor Jo Davidson&#x27;s bronze bust of Stein. The original, created in 1923, is now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Composers Florence Wickham and Marvin Schwartz used Stein&#x27;s text for their operetta &quot;Look and Long&quot;.

In 2005, playwright/actor Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Stein in the solo musical &quot;ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1&quot; at Princeton University. In 2006, theatre director/actor Luiz Päetow created his solo, &quot;Plays&quot;, portraying Stein&#x27;s 1934 homonymous lecture, and toured Brazil for several years. &quot;Loving Repeating&quot; is a musical by Stephen Flaherty based on the writings of Gertrude Stein. Stein and Toklas are both characters in the eight-person show. Stein is a central character in Nick Bertozzi&#x27;s 2007 graphic novel &quot;The Salon&quot;.

The posthumously published &quot;Journals of Ayn Rand&quot; contain several highly hostile references to Stein. From Rand&#x27;s working notes for her novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, it is clear that the character Lois Cook in that book was intended as a caricature of Stein.

Stein (played by Bernard Cribbins) and Toklas (played by Wilfrid Brambell) were depicted in the Swedish 1978 absurdist fiction film &quot;Picassos äventyr&quot; &quot;(The Adventures of Picasso)&quot; by director Tage Danielsson, with Gösta Ekman as Picasso.

Stein was portrayed in the 2011 Woody Allen film &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; by Kathy Bates, and by Tracee Chimo in the 2018 season of the television series &quot;Genius&quot; which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.

&quot;Waiting for the Moon&quot;, a movie starring Linda Bassett that was released in 1987. &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, a TV series starring Alice Dvoráková that was released in 1993.

Stein is added to a list of great artists and notables in the popular Broadway musical &quot;Rent&quot; in the song &quot;La Vie Boheme&quot;.
She is also mentioned in the Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers 1935 film &quot;Top Hat&quot; and in the song &quot;Roseability&quot; by the Scottish rock group Idlewild.

Composer Ricky Ian Gordon and librettist Royce Vavrek&#x27;s opera &quot;27&quot; about Stein and Toklas premiered at Opera Theatre of St. Louis in June 2014 with Stephanie Blythe as Stein.

In 2014 Stein was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;.

Edward Einhorn wrote the play &quot;The Marriage of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein&quot;, a farce about their fantasy marriage that also told the story of their life. It premiered in May 2017 at HERE Arts Center in New York.

The 2018 artwork &quot;Words Doing As They Want to Do&quot; by Eve Fowler involved recording trans and lesbian Californians reading Stein&#x27;s 1922 work called &quot;Miss Furr and Miss Skeene&quot;.

The Gertrude Stein Society (GSS) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an organization for LGBTQ+ students at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, is named after her.

<text>Bret Harte ( , born Francis Brett Hart, August 25, 1836 – May 5, 1902) was an American short story writer and poet best remembered for short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush. In a career spanning more than four decades, he also wrote poetry, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches.

Harte moved from California to the eastern U.S. and later to Europe. He incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been those most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.

==Early life==
Harte was born in 1836 in New York&#x27;s capital city of Albany. He was named after his great-grandfather, Francis Brett. When he was young, his father, Henry, changed the spelling of the family name from Hart to Harte. Henry&#x27;s father was Bernard Hart, an Orthodox Jewish immigrant who flourished as a merchant, becoming one of the founders of the New York Stock Exchange. Bret&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Rebecca Ostrander Hart, was from the English and Dutch culture and raised her child in a Dutch Reformed church. Later, Francis preferred to be known by his middle name, but he spelled it with only one &quot;t&quot;, becoming Bret Harte. Harte was of French Huguenot and Dutch ancestry and descended from prominent New York landowner Francis Rombouts.

An avid reader as a boy, Harte published his first work at age 11, a satirical poem titled &quot;Autumn Musings&quot;, now lost. Rather than attracting praise, the poem garnered ridicule from his family. As an adult, he recalled to a friend, &quot;Such a shock was their ridicule to me that I wonder that I ever wrote another line of verse.&quot;

Harte&#x27;s formal schooling ended when he was 13, in 1849.

==Career in California==
Harte moved to California in 1853, later working there in a number of capacities, including miner, teacher, messenger, and journalist; he was also secretary of the San Francisco Mint. He spent part of his life in the northern California coastal town of Union (now Arcata), a settlement on Humboldt Bay, as a tutor and school teacher, then a printer&#x27;s devil on &quot;The Northern Californian&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;humboldt/SusieBakerFountain&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to reporting news, writing poems, and occasionally, acting editor, leaving after three years, from lynching threats for writing an editorial about the 26 February 1860 Wiyot massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;humboldthistory/harte&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Union was established as a provisioning center for mining camps in the interior.

The &quot;Wells Fargo Messenger&quot; of July 1916 relates that after an unsuccessful attempt to make a living in the gold camps, Harte signed on as a messenger with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Express. He guarded treasure boxes on stagecoaches for a few months, then gave it up to become the schoolmaster at a school near the town of Sonora, in the Sierra foothills. He created his character Yuba Bill from his memory of an old stagecoach driver.

Among Harte&#x27;s first literary efforts was a poem published in &quot;The Golden Era&quot; in 1857 and, in October of that same year, his first prose piece on &quot;A Trip Up the Coast&quot;. In the spring of 1860 he was hired as editor of &quot;The Golden Era&quot;, which he attempted to make into a more literary publication. Mark Twain later recalled that, as an editor, Harte struck &quot;a new and fresh and spirited note&quot; which &quot;rose above that orchestra&#x27;s mumbling confusion and was recognizable as music&quot;. 

The 1860 massacre of between 80 and 200 Wiyot Indians at the village of Tuluwat (near Eureka in Humboldt County, California) was reported by Harte in San Francisco and New York. While serving as assistant editor of the &quot;Northern Californian&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Bret-Harte&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harte was left in charge of the paper during the temporary absence of his boss, Stephen G. Whipple. Harte published a detailed account condemning the slayings, writing: 

[A] more shocking and revolting spectacle was never exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people. Old women, wrinkled and decrepit, lay weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long gray hair. Infants scarce a span long, with their faces cloven with hatchets and their bodies ghastly with wounds.

After he published the editorial, Harte&#x27;s life was threatened, and he was forced to flee one month later. Harte quit his job and moved to San Francisco, where an anonymous letter published in a city paper describing widespread community approval of the massacre was attributed to him. In addition, no one was ever brought to trial, despite the evidence of a planned attack and of references to specific individuals, including a rancher named Larabee and other members of the unofficial militia called the Humboldt Volunteers.

Harte married Anna Griswold on August 11, 1862, in San Rafael, California. From the start, the marriage was rocky. Some suggested that she was consumed by extreme jealousy, while early Harte biographer Henry C. Merwin privately concluded that she was &quot;almost impossible to live with&quot;.

The well-known minister Thomas Starr King recommended Harte to James T. Fields, editor of the prestigious magazine &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, which published Harte&#x27;s first short story in October 1863. In 1864, Harte joined with Charles Henry Webb in starting a new literary journal called &quot;The Californian&quot;. He became friends with and mentored poet Ina Coolbrith.

In 1865, Harte was asked by bookseller Anton Roman to edit a book of California poetry; it was to be a showcase of the finest California writers. When the book, called &quot;Outcroppings&quot;, was published, it contained only 19 poets, many of them Harte&#x27;s friends (including Ina Coolbrith and Charles Warren Stoddard). The book caused some controversy, as Harte used the preface as a vehicle to attack California&#x27;s literature, blaming the state&#x27;s &quot;monotonous climate&quot; for its bad poetry. While the book was widely praised in the East, many newspapers and poets in the West took umbrage at his remarks.

In 1868, Harte became editor of &quot;The Overland Monthly&quot;, another new literary magazine, published by Roman Anton with the intention of highlighting local writings. The &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; was more in tune with the pioneering spirit of excitement in California. Harte&#x27;s short story &quot;The Luck of Roaring Camp&quot; appeared in the magazine&#x27;s second issue, propelling him to fame nationwide and in Europe.

When word of Charles Dickens&#x27;s death reached Harte in July 1870, he immediately sent a dispatch across the bay to San Francisco to hold back the forthcoming issue of the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; for 24 hours so that he could compose the poetic tribute &quot;Dickens in Camp&quot;.

Harte&#x27;s fame increased with the publication of his satirical poem &quot;Plain Language from Truthful James&quot; in the September 1870 issue of the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. The poem became better known by its alternate title &quot;The Heathen Chinee&quot; after being republished in a Boston newspaper in 1871. It was also quickly republished in a number of other newspapers and journals, including the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, the &quot;Providence Journal&quot;, the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, &quot;Prairie Farmer&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The poem was a fictional representation of attacks on Chinese immigrants and Harte intended to the reader to sympathize with the victim, the character Ah Sin. Instead, readers identified with the attacker, the character William Nye. Harte later referred to the piece as &quot;the worst poem I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote.&quot;

Like &quot;Plain Language from Truthful James&quot;, Harte&#x27;s 1874 short story &quot;Wan Lee, the Pagan&quot; also sought to undermine stereotypes about Chinese immigrants and to portray white Americans as the true savages.
==Move east==
Harte was determined to pursue his literary career and traveled back east with his family in 1871 to New York and eventually to Boston, where he contracted with the publisher of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; for an annual salary of $10,000, &quot;an unprecedented sum at the time&quot;. His popularity waned and, by the end of 1872, he was without a publishing contract and increasingly desperate. He spent the next few years struggling to publish new work or republish old and delivering lectures about the gold rush. The winter of 1877–78 was particularly hard for him and his family. He recalled it as a &quot;hand-to-mouth life&quot; and wrote to his wife Anna, &quot;I don&#x27;t know—looking back—what ever kept me from going down, in &quot;every way&quot;, during that awful December and January&quot;.

Some time between 1872 and 1881, Harte rented the Willows, a Morristown, New Jersey mansion then owned by Union general and author Joseph Warren Revere. Harte&#x27;s time in Morristown inspired him to write an 1877 historical romance novel, &quot;Thankful Blossom.&quot;

After months of soliciting for such a role, Harte accepted the position of United States Consul in the town of Krefeld, Germany, in May 1878. Mark Twain had been a friend and supporter of Harte&#x27;s until a substantial falling out, and he had previously tried to block any appointment for Harte. In a letter to William Dean Howells, he complained that Harte would be an embarrassment to the United States because, as he wrote, &quot;Harte is a liar, a thief, a swindler, a snob, a sot, a sponge, a coward, a Jeremy Diddler, he is brim full of treachery... To send this nasty creature to puke upon the American name in a foreign land is too much&quot;. Eventually, Harte was given a similar role in Glasgow in 1880. In 1885 he settled in London. Throughout his time in Europe, he regularly wrote to his wife and children and sent monthly financial contributions. He declined to invite them to join him, nor did he return to the United States to visit them. His excuses were usually related to money. During the 24 years that he spent in Europe, he never abandoned writing and maintained a prodigious output of stories that retained the freshness of his earlier work. Among his writings of this time were parodies and satires of other writers, including &quot;The Stolen Cigar-Case&quot; featuring ace detective &quot;Hemlock Jones&quot;, which Ellery Queen praised as &quot;probably the best parody of Sherlock Holmes ever written&quot;.

He died in Camberley, England, in 1902 of throat cancer and is buried at Frimley. His wife Anna (née Griswold) Harte died on August 2, 1920. The couple lived together only 16 of the 40 years that they were married.

==Reception==
In 1878, Andrew Carnegie praised Harte in &quot;Round the World&quot; as uniquely American, likely alluding to his regionalism:

Rudyard Kipling also showed himself to be an admirer of Harte&#x27;s writing. In &quot;From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel&quot;, while in San Francisco Kipling wrote:

Mark Twain characterized him and his writing as insincere. Writing in his autobiography four years after Harte&#x27;s death, Twain criticized the miners&#x27; dialect used by Harte, claiming that it never existed outside of his imagination. Additionally, Twain accused Harte of &quot;borrowing&quot; money from his friends with no intention of repaying it and of financially abandoning his wife and children. He referred repeatedly to Harte as &quot;The Immortal Bilk&quot;.

=== Parodies ===

Harte&#x27;s short story collections &quot;Condensed Novels (1867)&quot; and &quot;Condensed Novels: Second Series New Burlesques (1902)&quot; are parodies of contemporaneous writers and novels. 

==Dramatic and musical adaptations==
*Several film versions of &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; have been made, including one in 1937 with Preston Foster and another in 1952 with Dale Robertson.
*&quot;Tennessee&#x27;s Partner&quot; (1955) with John Payne and Ronald Reagan was based on the story of the same name.
*Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s treatment of the film version of &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; seems to borrow from &quot;Tennessee&#x27;s Partner&quot;: two close friends—one named &quot;Pardner&quot;—share the same woman. The Spaghetti Western &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; is based on &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; and &quot;The Luck of Roaring Camp&quot;. 
*The Soviet movie &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; (, 1977) is based on &quot;Gabriel Conroy&quot; and another of Harte&#x27;s stories.
*Operas based on &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; include those by Samuel Adler and by Stanford Beckler.
*The 1889 short story &quot;Salomy Jane&#x27;s Kiss&quot; and 1910 novel of the same name have been filmed many times:
**Salomy Jane (1914 film)
**Salomy Jane (1923 film)
**Wild Girl (1932)
*The actor Craig Hill was cast as Harte in the 1956 episode, &quot;Year of Destiny&quot;, on the syndicated anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The &quot;year of destiny&quot; is 1857, when Harte arrived in California. First a stagecoach guard, then a newspaper editor and schoolteacher, he slowly finds fame as a western writer.
*The popular 1975 Disney film &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang,&quot; based on the 1971 &quot;novel of the same name&quot; by &quot;Jack Bickham,&quot; is full of characters and situations inspired by Harte&#x27;s writings. Among them are a &quot;Tomboy&quot; Stage Driver, her Southern Gentleman father, a Roving Gambler trusted with the care of small children, a world weary Sherriff who also serves as Justice of the Peace, and two bumbling but lovable outlaws. The film was a major hit for Disney.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Costume Design is one of the Academy Awards presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for achievement in film costume design.

The award was first given in 1949, for films made in 1948. Initially, separate award categories were established for black-and-white films and color films. Since the merger of the two categories in 1967, the Academy has traditionally avoided giving out the award to films with a contemporary setting.

==Award==
The Academy Award for Best Costume Design is given out annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences for the best achievement of film costume design of the previous year. Films that are eligible for the award must meet a series of criteria, including the requirement that the costumes must have been &quot;conceived&quot; by a costume designer. For this particular criteria, each submission is reviewed by the costume designer members of the Art Directors Branch prior to the ballot process. Further rules include that the nominee(s) be only the principal costume designer(s), that the five films that receive the highest number of votes will become the ceremony&#x27;s nominations for final voting, and that the final voting will only be undertaken by active and life members of the academy.

==History==
The Academy Award for Best Costume Design was first given out at the 21st Academy Awards, held on March 24, 1949. The award had two subcategories, one for films in black and white and one for films in color. At the 30th Academy Awards, held on March 26, 1958, these two subcategories were merged into one, which was the result of the academy reducing the number of competitive categories from 30 to 24. The 32nd Academy Awards saw the category again be split into two for recognition of both black and white and color film. Eight years later, the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, along with two other awards, were each combined into their own single category recognizing achievement in film.

From 1949 to 1966, most Academy Awards for Best Costume Design in Black and White were given to a contemporary movie. On the other hand, epics, fantasies, and musicals dominated the color category. Since the merger into one singular category for color films in 1967, films set in modern times have won only three times. The three contemporary-set winners have been &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot;, &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;. All other winners during this period have been set in the past or in a science-fiction or fantasy setting.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Director (officially known as the Academy Award of Merit for Directing) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.

The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into &quot;Dramatic&quot; and &quot;Comedy&quot; categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot;, respectively. However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies. Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.

For the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; and &quot;Four Daughters&quot;, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony. That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot; in 2000, winning the award for the latter.

The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award. The award has been criticised in recent years for failing to recognise female directors. Of the 257 individual directors nominated in the history of the award, only 9 have been women; and only 3 of the 75 winners have been women.

Since its inception, the award has been given to 73 different directors or directing teams. As of the 96th Academy Awards ceremony, British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan is the most recent winner in this category for his work on &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31. For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.

* Four directors have won twice for films that did not win Best Picture: Frank Borzage, George Stevens, Ang Lee, and Alfonso Cuarón.
** Of John Ford&#x27;s four wins, the only film which also won Best Picture was &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941).
** Ford (1940–1941), Joseph L. Mankiewicz (1949–1950), and Alejandro González Iñárritu (2014–2015) are the only directors to have won the award in two consecutive years.
** Francis Ford Coppola is the only director to be nominated for each film of a trilogy, The Godfather trilogy, winning for the second film.
* Four directing teams have been nominated together (a total of five times, winning on three occasions): Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961, winners); Warren Beatty and Buck Henry for &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978); Joel and Ethan Coen for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007, winners) and &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010); and Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022, winners).
** The Coen Brothers are the only siblings to have won the award.
* Six directors won the award for their feature film debut: Delbert Mann for &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), Jerome Robbins for &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), Robert Redford for &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), James L. Brooks for &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), Kevin Costner for &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (1990), and Sam Mendes for &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). 
** Robbins is the only director to have won for his only career directing credit.
* Lina Wertmüller was the first woman nominated in the category, for &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; (1976).
** Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win the award, for &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; (2009).
** Chloé Zhao was the first woman of color to win the award, for &quot;Nomadland&quot; (2020).
** Jane Campion is the first woman to be nominated twice for the award: &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021)—winning for the latter.
* John Singleton is the first Black (and youngest) nominee for &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991).
** Steve McQueen is the first Black nominee to direct a Best Picture winner, for &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;. Barry Jenkins subsequently did the same three years later, with &quot;Moonlight&quot; (2016).
* David Lean was the first non-American to win—and twice, for &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). This did not recur for five decades with any other non-American directors, until Ang Lee, Alfonso Cuarón, and Alejandro González Iñárritu each won twice themselves.
** Lee was the first Asian director to win the award, for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005). He won again for &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012).
** Cuarón was the first Mexican (and Latin American) director to win the award, for &quot;Gravity&quot;. He won again for &quot;Roma&quot; (2018).

<text>An arsenal ship is a concept for a floating missile platform intended to have as many as five hundred vertical launch bays for large-sized missiles, most likely cruise missiles. In current U.S. naval thinking, such a ship would initially be controlled manually by an Aegis Cruiser, although plans that have long since been scrapped included control by AEW&amp;C aircraft such as the E-2 Hawkeye and E-3 Sentry.

==History==
Originally proposed by VADM Joseph Metcalf, DCNO Surface Warfare, as a component of the &quot;Surface Combatants of the 21st Century&quot; initiative in the mid-1980&#x27;s. Later, proposed by the U.S. Navy in 1996, the arsenal ship had funding problems, with the United States Congress canceling some funding, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) providing some funding to individual contractors for prototypes. Some concept artwork of the Arsenal Ship was produced, with some images bearing the number &quot;72&quot;, possibly hinting at an intent to classify the arsenal ships as a battleship, since the last battleship ordered (but never built) was USS &quot;Louisiana&quot; (BB-71).

The arsenal ship would have a small crew and as many as 500 vertical launch tubes for missiles to provide ship-to-shore bombardment for invading troops. The Navy calculated a $450 million price for the arsenal ship, but Congress scrapped funding for the project in 1998.

The U.S. Navy has since modified the four oldest Trident submarines to SSGN configuration, allowing them to carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles using vertical launching systems installed in the tubes which previously held strategic ballistic missiles, creating a vessel roughly equivalent to the arsenal ship concept.

In 2013, Huntington Ingalls Industries revived the idea when it proposed a Flight II version of the LPD-17 hull with a variant carrying up to 288 VLS cells for the ballistic missile defense and precision strike missions.

China has conducted studies and tested models of partially and completely submersible arsenal ship concepts. South Korea is also planning to deploy three arsenal ships by the late 2020s. These South Korean arsenal ships are designated &quot;Joint Strike Ships&quot;, or &quot;JSS&quot;.

<doc id="62013" wikidata="Q133855" url="?curid=62013" title="Guillaume Apollinaire">
<text>Guillaume Apollinaire (; ; born Kostrowicki; 26 August 1880 – 9 November 1918) was a French poet, playwright, short story writer, novelist and art critic of Polish descent.

Apollinaire is considered one of the foremost poets of the early 20th century, as well as one of the most impassioned defenders of Cubism and a forefather of Surrealism. He is credited with coining the term &quot;Cubism&quot; in 1911 to describe the emerging art movement, the term Orphism in 1912, and the term &quot;Surrealism&quot; in 1917 to describe the works of Erik Satie. He wrote poems without punctuation, in his attempt to be resolutely modern in both form and subject. Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist literary works, the play &quot;The Breasts of Tiresias&quot; (1917), which became the basis for Francis Poulenc&#x27;s 1947 opera &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot;.

Influenced by Symbolist poetry in his youth, he was admired during his lifetime by the young poets who later formed the nucleus of the Surrealist group (Breton, Aragon, Soupault). He revealed very early on an originality that freed him from any school of influence and made him one of the precursors of the literary revolution of the first half of the 20th century. His art is not based on any theory, but on a simple principle: the act of creating must come from the imagination, from intuition, because it must be as close as possible to life, to nature, to the environment, and to the human being.

Apollinaire was also active as a journalist and art critic for &quot;Le Matin&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit nouveau&quot;, &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, and &quot;Paris Journal&quot;. In 1912 Apollinaire cofounded &quot;Les Soirées de Paris&quot;, an artistic and literary magazine.

Two years after being wounded in World War I, Apollinaire died during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and was recognized as &quot;Fallen for France&quot; (&quot;Mort pour la France&quot;) because of his commitment during the war.

==Life==
===Family and early life===

Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki was born in Rome, Italy, and was raised speaking French, Italian, and Polish. He emigrated to France in his late teens and adopted the name Guillaume Apollinaire. His mother, born Angelika Kostrowicka, was a Polish-Lithuanian noblewoman born near Navahrudak, Grodno Governorate (former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, present-day Belarus). His maternal grandfather participated in the 1863 uprising against occupying Russia and had to emigrate when the uprising failed. Apollinaire&#x27;s father is unknown but may have been Francesco Costantino Camillo Flugi d&#x27;Aspermont (born 1835), a Graubünden aristocrat who disappeared early from Apollinaire&#x27;s life. Francesco Flugi d&#x27;Aspermont was a nephew of Conradin Flugi d&#x27;Aspermont (1787–1874), a poet who wrote in Ladin Putèr (an official language dialect of Switzerland spoken in Upper Engadin), and perhaps also descendant of the Minnesänger Oswald von Wolkenstein (born c. 1377, died 2 August 1445; see &quot;Les ancêtres Grisons du poète Guillaume Apollinaire&quot; at Geneanet).

===Paris===
Apollinaire eventually moved from Rome to Paris in 1900 and became one of the most popular members of the artistic community of Paris (both in Montmartre and Montparnasse). His friends and collaborators in that period included Pablo Picasso, Henri Rousseau, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, André Salmon, André Breton, André Derain, Faik Konitza, Blaise Cendrars, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Alexandra Exter, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Ossip Zadkine, Marc Chagall, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. He became romantically involved with Marie Laurencin, who is often identified as his muse. While there, he dabbled in anarchism and spoke out as a Dreyfusard in defense of Dreyfus&#x27;s innocence.

Metzinger painted the first Cubist portrait of Apollinaire. In his &quot;Vie anecdotique&quot; (16 October 1911), the poet proudly writes: &quot;I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants.&quot; It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by Louis Marcoussis, Amedeo Modigliani, Mikhail Larionov and Picasso.
In 1911 he joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the Cubist movement soon to be known as the Section d&#x27;Or. The opening address of the 1912 Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or—the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition—was given by Apollinaire.

On 7 September 1911, police arrested and jailed him on suspicion of aiding and abetting the theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and a number of Egyptian statuettes from the Louvre, but released him a week later. The theft of the statues had been committed in 1907 by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, who had recently returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the &quot;Paris-Journal&quot;. Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who had bought Iberian statues from Pieret, and who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, but he was also exonerated. The theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was perpetrated by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence.

===Cubism===
Apollinaire wrote the preface for the first Cubist exposition outside of Paris; &quot;VIII Salon des Indépendants&quot;, Brussels, 1911. In an open-handed preface to the catalogue of the Brussels Indépendants show, Apollinaire stated that these &#x27;new painters&#x27; accepted the name of Cubists which has been given to them. He described Cubism as a new manifestation and high art [&quot;manifestation nouvelle et très élevée de l&#x27;art&quot;], not a system that constrains talent [&quot;non-point un système contraignant les talents&quot;], and the differences which characterize not only the talents but even the styles of these artists are an obvious proof of this. The artists involved with this new movement, according to Apollinaire, included Pablo Picasso (who represented Apollinaire in his &quot;Three Musicians&quot; painting), Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, and Henri Le Fauconnier. By 1912 others had joined the Cubists: Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Francis Picabia, Juan Gris, and Roger de La Fresnaye, among them.

===Orphism===
The term Orphism was coined by Apollinaire at the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or in 1912, referring to the works of Robert Delaunay and František Kupka. During his lecture at the Section d&#x27;Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka&#x27;s abstract works as perfect examples of &quot;pure painting&quot;, as anti-figurative as music.

In &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques&quot; (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as &quot;the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter&#x27;s works should convey an &quot;untroubled aesthetic pleasure&quot;, but at the same time a &quot;meaningful structure and sublime significance&quot;. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature.

===Surrealism===
The term Surrealism was first used by Apollinaire concerning the ballet &quot;Parade&quot; in 1917. The poet Arthur Rimbaud wanted to be a visionary, to perceive the hidden side of things within the realm of another reality. In continuity with Rimbaud, Apollinaire went in search of a hidden and mysterious reality. The term &quot;surrealism&quot; appeared for the first time in March 1917 (Chronologie de Dada et du surréalisme, 1917) in a letter by Apollinaire to Paul Dermée: &quot;All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used&quot; [&quot;Tout bien examiné, je crois en effet qu&#x27;il vaut mieux adopter surréalisme que surnaturalisme que j&#x27;avais d&#x27;abord employé&quot;].

He described &quot;Parade&quot; as &quot;a kind of surrealism&quot; (&quot;une sorte de surréalisme&quot;) when he wrote the program note the following week, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.

===World War I and death===
Apollinaire served as an infantry officer in World War I and, in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple, from which he would never fully recover. He wrote &quot;Les Mamelles de Tirésias&quot; while recovering from this wound. During this period he coined the word &quot;Surrealism&quot; in the programme notes for Jean Cocteau&#x27;s and Erik Satie&#x27;s ballet &quot;Parade&quot;, first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an artistic manifesto, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit nouveau et les poètes&quot;. Apollinaire&#x27;s status as a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the Marquis de Sade, whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in popularity as an influence upon the Dada and Surrealist art movements going on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, &quot;The freest spirit that ever existed.&quot; 

The war-weakened Apollinaire died at the age of 38 on 9 November 1918 of influenza during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 ravaging Europe at the time, two years after being wounded in World War I. Due to his military service for the duration of the war, he was declared to have &quot;Died for France&quot; (&quot;Mort pour la France&quot;) by the French government. He was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

==Works==
In 1900 he wrote his first novel &quot;Mirely, ou le petit trou pas cher&quot; (pornographic), which was eventually lost. Apollinaire&#x27;s first collection of poetry was &quot;L&#x27;enchanteur pourrissant&quot; (1909), but &quot;Alcools&quot; (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced in part by the Symbolists, juxtapose the old and the new, combining traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published the essay &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques&quot; on the Cubist painters, a movement which he helped to define. He also coined the term &quot;orphism&quot; to describe a tendency towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of Robert Delaunay and others. In 1917, Apollinaire produced &quot;Peintures de Léopold Survage; Dessins et aquarelles d’Irène Lagut (Paintings by Léopold Survage; Drawings and Watercolors by Irène Lagut),&quot; which is included in the permanent collection of Pérez Art Museum Miami, in the United States. 

In 1907 Apollinaire published the well-known erotic novel, &quot;The Eleven Thousand Rods&quot; (&quot;Les Onze Mille Verges&quot;). Officially banned in France until 1970, various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel attributed to him was &quot;The Exploits of a Young Don Juan (Les exploits d&#x27;un jeune Don Juan)&quot;, in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with various members of his entourage, including his aunt. Apollinaire&#x27;s gift to Picasso of the original 1907 manuscript was one of the artist&#x27;s most prized possessions. The book was made into a movie in 1986.

Shortly after his death, Mercure de France published &quot;Calligrammes&quot;, a collection of his concrete poetry (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall effect), and more orthodox, though still modernist poems informed by Apollinaire&#x27;s experiences in the First World War and in which he often used the technique of automatic writing.

In his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in Belgium, mastering the Walloon dialect sufficiently to write poetry, some of which has survived.

<text>Amedeo Clemente Modigliani (; ; 12 July 1884 – 24 January 1920) was an Italian painter and sculptor of the École de Paris who worked mainly in France. He is known for portraits and nudes in a modern style characterized by a surreal elongation of faces, necks, and figures — works that were not received well during his lifetime, but later became much sought-after. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906, he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brâncuși. By 1912, Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the Section d&#x27;Or group at the Salon d&#x27;Automne.

Modigliani&#x27;s oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914, he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subjects were portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive but after his death achieved great popularity. He died of tubercular meningitis, at the age of 35, in Paris.

==Family and early life==
Modigliani was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Livorno, Italy. A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large Jewish community. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.

Modigliani&#x27;s mother, Eugénie Garsin, born and raised in Marseille, was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of Talmudic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. The family business was money lending, with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.

Modigliani&#x27;s father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining engineer. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost of timberland the family owned.

A reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani&#x27;s mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.

Amedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father&#x27;s business interests. Amedeo&#x27;s birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family&#x27;s home just as Eugénie went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.

Modigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of pleurisy when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of typhoid fever. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the tuberculosis which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: Naples, Capri, Rome and Amalfi, then north to Florence and Venice.

His mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his ability to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: &quot;The child&#x27;s character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?&quot;

==Art student years==
Modigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself &quot;already a painter&quot;, his mother wrote, even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani&#x27;s passion for the subject.

At the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno&#x27;s local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.

===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===

Modigliani worked in Micheli&#x27;s Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been Llewelyn Lloyd, Giulio Cesare Vinzio, Manlio Martinelli, Gino Romiti, Renato Natali, and Oscar Ghiglia. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of Renaissance art, can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as Giovanni Boldini and Toulouse-Lautrec.

Modigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.

In 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of Domenico Morelli, a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title &quot;the Macchiaioli&quot; (from &quot;macchia&quot; —&quot;dash of colour&quot;, or, more derogatively, &quot;stain&quot;), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized landscape movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the French Impressionists, the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of Monet, and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.

Modigliani&#x27;s connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli&#x27;s work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint &quot;en plein air&quot;, but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.

While with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.

Despite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as &quot;Superman&quot;, a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist&#x27;s innovations.

In 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with life drawing, enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or &quot;Free School of Nude Studies&quot;, of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti. It is in Venice that he first smoked hashish and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple teenage rebellion, or the clichéd hedonism and bohemianism that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche.
===Early literary influences===
Having been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, Baudelaire, Carducci, Comte de Lautréamont, and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.

Letters that he wrote from his &#x27;sabbatical&#x27; in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;

(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.

The work of Lautréamont was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet&#x27;s &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot; became the seminal work for the Parisian Surrealists of Modigliani&#x27;s generation, and the book became Modigliani&#x27;s favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart. The poetry of Lautréamont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and D&#x27;Annunzio similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through Symbolist imagery.

Modigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani&#x27;s mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani&#x27;s senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia&#x27;s role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.

Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself. I am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate ... A bourgeois told me today–insulted me–that I or at least my brain was lazy. It did me good. I should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life...

==Paris==

=== Arrival ===
In 1906, Modigliani moved to Paris, then the focal point of the avant-garde. In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: Gino Severini and Juan Gris.

He later befriended Jacob Epstein, with whom he aimed to set up a studio or Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all. Modigliani himself intended to create the drawings and paintings of the stone caryatids for &#x27;The Pillars of Tenderness&#x27; which would support the imagined temple.
Modigliani squatted in the Bateau-Lavoir, a commune for penniless artists in Montmartre, renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists&#x27; quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.

When he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and drank wine in moderation. At that time, he was considered, by those who knew him, to be a bit reserved, verging on the asocial, and is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso, who at the time was wearing his trademark workmen&#x27;s clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.

===Transformation===
Within a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.

The poet and journalist Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist&#x27;s previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani&#x27;s behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.

Not only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as &quot;Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois&quot;.

The motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.

Modigliani&#x27;s use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.

He sought the company of artists such as Utrillo and Soutine, seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues. Modigliani&#x27;s behavior stood out even in these Bohemian surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used absinthe and hashish. While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings. He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of Vincent van Gogh.

During the 1920s, in the wake of Modigliani&#x27;s career and spurred on by comments by André Salmon crediting hashish and absinthe with the genesis of Modigliani&#x27;s style, many hopefuls tried to emulate his &quot;success&quot; by embarking on a path of substance abuse and bohemian excess. Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, &quot;...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.&quot;

Some art historians suggest that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.

===Output===
During his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost—destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.

He was first influenced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of Paul Cézanne. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.

He met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair. Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani&#x27;s aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.

===Sculpture===

In 1909, Modigliani returned home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. But soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a studio in Montparnasse. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after Paul Guillaume, an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He was Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s disciple for one year.

Although a series of Modigliani&#x27;s sculptures were exhibited in the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1912, by 1914 he abandoned sculpting and focused solely on his painting, a move precipitated by the difficulty in acquiring sculptural materials due to the outbreak of war, and by Modigliani&#x27;s physical debilitation.

In June 2010 Modigliani&#x27;s &quot;Tête&quot;, a limestone carving of a woman&#x27;s head, became the third most expensive sculpture ever sold.

===Friends and influences===
Modigliani painted a series of portraits of contemporary artists and friends in Montparnasse: Chaïm Soutine, Moïse Kisling, Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Marie &quot;Marevna&quot; Vorobyev-Stebeslka, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, Jacques Lipchitz, Blaise Cendrars, and Jean Cocteau, all sat for stylized renditions. Modigliani painted Soutine&#x27;s portrait several times, when they lived together in the Cité Falguière around 1916.

==War years==
At the outset of World War I, Modigliani tried to enlist in the army but was refused because of his poor health.

Known as &quot;Modì&quot; (which plays on the French word &#x27;maudit&#x27;, meaning &#x27;cursed&#x27;) by many Parisians, but as &quot;Dedo&quot; to his family and friends, Modigliani was a handsome man, and attracted much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot;, and the object of much of his drunken wrath.

When the British painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the café introduced himself as &quot;Modigliani, painter and Jew&quot;. They became great friends.

In 1916, Modigliani befriended the Polish poet and art dealer Léopold Zborowski and his wife Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani&#x27;s primary art dealer and friend during the artist&#x27;s final years, helping him financially, and also organizing his show in Paris in 1917.

== Patronage of Léopold Zborowski ==
===1917 Paris Show===
The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani&#x27;s dealer and friend Léopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.

The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their &quot;commercial potential&quot;, rather than originating from the artist&#x27;s personal circle of acquaintances.

The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani&#x27;s only solo exhibition during his life, and is &quot;notorious&quot; in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity. The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery&#x27;s streetfront window.

&quot;Nude Sitting on a Divan&quot; is one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale of the painting at Sotheby&#x27;s, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show.

&quot;Nu couché&quot; realized $170,405,000 at a Christie&#x27;s, New York, sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold.

===Nice===
On a trip to Nice which had been conceived and organized by Zborowski, Modigliani, Foujita and other artists tried to sell their works to rich tourists. Modigliani managed to sell a few pictures, but only for a few francs each. Despite this, during this time he produced most of the paintings that later became his most popular and valued works.

During his lifetime, he sold a number of his works, but never for any great amount of money. What funds he did receive soon vanished for his habits.

==Jeanne Hébuterne==

In the spring of 1917, the Ukrainian sculptor Chana Orloff introduced him to a 19-year-old art student named Jeanne Hébuterne who had posed for Tsuguharu Foujita. From a conservative bourgeois background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout Roman Catholic family for her liaison with Jewish Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family&#x27;s objections, soon they were living together.

Modigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings. A short time later Hébuterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumière. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne Hébuterne became a principal subject for Modigliani&#x27;s art. Modigliani was known to be abusive towards his lovers, Hébuterne was suffering from depression after becoming pregnant for the second time.

Towards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with Hébuterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico and André Derain. After he and Hébuterne moved to Nice on 29 November 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named Jeanne (1918–1984). Modigliani already had a son from his relationship with Simone Thiroux, Gérard Thiroux (1917–2004), and at least two other extramarital children. In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumière. 
Hébuterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne&#x27;s parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani&#x27;s reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne&#x27;s parents&#x27; resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.

==Death and funeral==

Although he continued to paint, Modigliani&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.

In 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto Hébuterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, tubercular meningitis. He died on 24 January 1920, at the Hôpital de la Charité.

There was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, 21-year-old Hébuterne was eight months pregnant with their second child. The day after Modigliani&#x27;s death, Hébuterne was taken to her parents&#x27; home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, killing herself and her unborn child.

Modigliani was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Hébuterne was buried at the Cimetière de Bagneux near Paris, and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: &quot;Struck down by death at the moment of glory&quot;. Hers reads: &quot;Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice&quot;.

Managing only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.

==Legacy==

===Influences===
The linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative Renaissance painters informed his work. Working during that fertile period of &quot;isms&quot;, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas and creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, &quot;This is what I see.&quot;

More appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual avant-garde of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s proclamation: &quot;Ne t&#x27;attardes pas avec l&#x27;avant-garde&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t wait with the avant-garde&quot;). Pseudo-goitre, a medical condition, is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani&#x27;s paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.
Since his death, Modigliani&#x27;s reputation has soared. Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani&#x27;s sister in Florence adopted his daughter, Jeanne (1918–1984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled &quot;Modigliani: Man and Myth&quot;.

===Catalogues raisonnés===
The Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world. There are at least five catalogues raisonnés of the artist&#x27;s work including two volumes by Ambrogio Ceroni, last updated in 1972. Arthur Pfannstiel (1929 and 1956) and Joseph Lanthemann&#x27;s (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar Osvaldo Patani produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the Paul Alexandre period (1994), while Christian Parisot has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné.

In 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to be the only ones existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Légales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani&#x27;s work. In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian Art forgery unit after a two-year investigation (following a largely advertised exhibition in Catania, presenting original artworks); the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.

The French art historian Marc Restellini is preparing Modigliani&#x27;s catalogue raisonné.

The Modigliani Project, headed by Dr. Kenneth Wayne, was founded in 2012 to aid in the researching of Modigliani artworks. As part of this endeavor the organization is preparing a new catalogue raisonné of Modigliani&#x27;s artwork.

===Art market===
In November 2010, a painting of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist&#x27;s work. Bidding for &quot;La Belle Romaine&quot; pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani&#x27;s previous auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—Jeanne Hébuterne (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).

On 9 November 2015 the 1917 painting &quot;Nu couché&quot;, sold at Christie&#x27;s in New York for US$170.4 million. On 14 May 2018 the 1917 painting &quot;Nu couché (sur le côté gauche)&quot; sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York for $157.2 million. This was the highest auction price in Sotheby&#x27;s history.

===Forgeries===
Modigliani is one of the most faked artists in the world. Rising prices for works attributed to him as well as the legend surrounding his short life have fueled a market for forgeries of both paintings and sculptures. In 1984, students carved three stone heads in a Modigliani style, causing a sensation when they were &quot;discovered&quot; in a canal in Livorno, Italy. Experts claimed they were authentic until the students released a video they had filmed of themselves making the heads with a Black and Decker drill. In 2018 twenty fake Modiglianis were seized at an exhibition in Genoa. Famous art forgers such as Elmyr de Hory admitted to creating many fake Modiglianis. Experienced art dealers such as Klaus Perls were tricked into purchasing fake Modigliani statues. It has been estimated that most artworks attributed to Modigliani are actually forgeries.

===Cinema===
Two films have been made about Modigliani: &quot;Les Amants de Montparnasse&quot; (1958), directed by Jacques Becker and starring Gérard Philipe as Modigliani; and &quot;Modigliani&quot; (2004), directed by Mick Davis and starring Andy García as Modigliani. In August 2022, Johnny Depp directed &quot;Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness&quot;, which he co-produced alongside Al Pacino and Barry Navidi, from a screenplay by Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski. Principal photography commenced in September 2023. In February 2025, it was announced that The Curse of Modigliani will be released in summer 2025. Directed by Diana Ringo and starring Edward Pishiyski, the film presents a modernized take on Modigliani’s life.

==Critical reactions==
In 2011, Peter Schjeldahl, reviewing Meryle Secrest&#x27;s book &quot;Modigliani: A Life&quot;, wrote:

I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, to one of his long-necked women, with their piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the succulent color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani&#x27;s value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.

Schjeldahl reports Secrest&#x27;s speculation that Modigliani was happy to let people consider him an alcoholic and drug addict, &quot;and thus to mistake the symptoms of his tuberculosis, which he kept a secret. Drunks were tolerated; carriers of infectious diseases were not.&quot;

<text>Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (; 24 January 1732 – 18 May 1799) was a French polymath. At various times in his life, he was a watchmaker, inventor, playwright, musician, diplomat, spy, publisher, horticulturist, arms dealer, satirist, financier and revolutionary (both French and American).

Born a Parisian watchmaker&#x27;s son, Beaumarchais rose in French society and became influential in the court of Louis XV as an inventor and music teacher. He made a number of important business and social contacts, played various roles as a diplomat and spy, and had earned a considerable fortune before a series of costly court battles jeopardized his reputation.

An early French supporter of American independence, Beaumarchais lobbied the French government on behalf of the American rebels during the American War of Independence. Beaumarchais oversaw covert aid from the French and Spanish governments to supply arms and financial assistance to the rebels in the years before France&#x27;s formal entry into the war in 1778. He later struggled to recover money he had personally invested in the scheme. Beaumarchais was also a participant in the early stages of the 1789 French Revolution.

Beaumarchais is probably best known for his theatrical works, especially the three Figaro plays.

==Early life==
Beaumarchais was born Pierre-Augustin Caron in the Rue Saint-Denis, Paris, on 24 January 1732. He was the only boy among the six surviving children of André-Charles Caron, a watchmaker from Meaux. The family had previously been Huguenots, but had converted to Roman Catholicism in the wake of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the increased persecution of Protestants that followed. The family was comfortably middle-class and Beaumarchais had a peaceful and happy childhood. As the only son, he was spoiled by his parents and sisters. He took an interest in music and played several instruments. Though born a Catholic, Beaumarchais retained a sympathy for Protestants and would campaign throughout his life for their civil rights. One of his sisters, Marie-Josèphe Caron, later became an artist; their cousin was the artist Suzanne Caron.

From the age of ten, Beaumarchais had some schooling at a &quot;country school&quot; where he learned some Latin. Two years later, Beaumarchais left school at twelve to work as an apprentice under his father and learn the art of watchmaking. He may have used his own experiences during these years as the inspiration for the character of Cherubin when he wrote the &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot;. He generally neglected his work, and at one point was evicted by his father, only to be later allowed back after apologising for his poor behaviour.

At the time, pocket watches were commonly unreliable for timekeeping and were worn more as fashion accessories. In response to this, Beaumarchais spent nearly a year researching improvements. In July 1753, at the age of twenty-one, he invented an escapement for watches that allowed them to be made substantially more accurate and compact.

The first man to take an interest in this new invention was Jean-André Lepaute, the royal clockmaker in France, whose clocks could be found in the Palais du Luxembourg, Tuileries Palace, the Palais-Royal, and the Jardin des plantes. Lepaute had been a mentor to Beaumarchais after discovering the boy&#x27;s talent in a chance encounter in the Caron family&#x27;s shop. He encouraged him as he worked on the new invention, earned his trust, and promptly stole the idea for himself, writing a letter to the French Academy of Sciences describing the &quot;Lepaute system&quot;. Beaumarchais was outraged when he read in the September issue of &quot;Le Mercure de France&quot; that M. Lepaute had just invented the most wonderful mechanism for a more portable clock and wrote a strongly-worded letter to that same newspaper defending the invention as his own and urging the French Academy of Sciences to see the proof for themselves. &quot;In the interests of truth and my reputation,&quot; he says, &quot;I cannot let such an infidelity go by in silence and must claim as mine the invention of this device.&quot; Lepaute defended himself with a statement by three Jesuits that claimed he had shown them such a mechanism in May 1753.

The following February, the Academy indeed ruled that the mechanism was Beaumarchais&#x27; and not Lepaute&#x27;s, catapulting Beaumarchais to stardom and relegating Lepaute to infamy, as &quot;l&#x27;affaire Lepaute&quot; had been the talk of Paris. Soon afterwards, he was asked by King Louis XV to create a watch mounted on a ring for his mistress Madame de Pompadour. Louis was so impressed by the result that he named Beaumarchais &quot;Purveyor to the King&quot;, and the Caron family business became prosperous.

==Rise to influence==
===Marriage and new name===
In 1755 Beaumarchais met Madeleine-Catherine Aubertin, a widow, and married her the following year. She helped Beaumarchais secure a royal office, and he gave up watchmaking. Shortly after his marriage, he adopted the name &quot;Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais&quot;, which he derived from &quot;le Bois Marchais&quot;, the name of a piece of land belonging to his new wife. He believed the name sounded grander and more aristocratic and adopted at the same time an elaborate coat of arms. His wife died less than a year later, which plunged him into financial problems, and he ran up large debts.

===Royal patronage===
Beaumarchais&#x27; problems were eased when he was appointed to teach Louis XV&#x27;s four daughters the harp. His role soon grew and he became a musical advisor for the royal family. In 1759, Caron met Joseph Paris Duverney, an older and wealthy entrepreneur. Beaumarchais assisted him in gaining the King&#x27;s approval for the new military academy he was building, the École Royale Militaire, and in turn Duverney promised to help make him rich. The two became very close friends and collaborated on many business ventures. Assisted by Duverney, Beaumarchais acquired the title of Secretary-Councillor to the King in 1760–61, thereby gaining access to French nobility. This was followed by the purchase in 1763 of a second title, the office of Lieutenant General of Hunting, a position which oversaw the royal parks. Around this time, he became engaged to Pauline Le Breton, who came from a plantation-owning family from Saint-Domingue, but broke it off when he discovered she was not as wealthy as he had been led to believe.

===Visit to Madrid===

In April 1764, Beaumarchais began a ten-month sojourn in Madrid, ostensibly to help his sister, Lisette, who had been abandoned by her fiancé, Clavijo, an official at the Ministry of War. While in Spain, he was mostly concerned with striking business deals for Duverney. They sought exclusive contracts for the newly acquired Spanish colony of Louisiana and attempted to gain the right to import slaves to the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Beaumarchais went to Madrid with a letter of introduction from the Duc de Choiseul, who was now his political patron. Hoping to secure Clavijo&#x27;s support for his business deals by binding him by marriage, Beaumarchais initially shamed Clavijo into agreeing to marry Lisette, but when further details emerged about Clavijo&#x27;s conduct, the marriage was called off.

Beaumarchais&#x27;s business deals dragged on, and he spent much of his time soaking up the atmosphere of Spain, which would become a major influence on his later writings. Although he befriended important figures such as the foreign minister Grimaldi, his attempts to secure the contracts for Duverney eventually came to nothing and he went home in March 1765. Although Beaumarchais returned to France with little profit, he had managed to acquire new experience, musical ideas, and ideas for theatrical characters. Beaumarchais considered turning the affair into a play, but decided to leave it to others—including Goethe, who wrote &quot;Clavigo&quot; in 1774.

==Playwright==
Beaumarchais hoped to be made consul to Spain, but his application was rejected. Instead he concentrated on developing his business affairs and began to show an interest in writing plays. He had already experimented in writing short farces for private audiences, but he now had ambitions to write for the theatre.

His name as a writer was established with his first dramatic play, &quot;Eugénie&quot;, which premiered at the Comédie-Française in 1767. This was followed in 1770 by another drama, &quot;&quot;.

=== Figaro plays===

Beaumarchais&#x27;s Figaro plays are &quot;Le Barbier de Séville&quot;, &quot;Le Mariage de Figaro&quot;, and &quot;La Mère coupable&quot;. Figaro and Count Almaviva, the two characters Beaumarchais most likely conceived in his travels in Spain, are (with Rosine, later the Countess Almaviva) the only ones present in all three plays. They are indicative of the change in social attitudes before, during, and after the French Revolution. Prototypes of Almaviva and Rosine first appeared under the names Lindor and Pauline in the short and incomplete play &quot;Le Sacristain&quot;, in which Lindor disguises himself as a monk and music teacher in order to meet Pauline under the watchful eyes of her elderly husband. Beaumarchais wrote it around 1765 and dubbed it &quot;an interlude, imitating the Spanish style.&quot; Naturally, this thinly veiled government criticism did not go without opposition. Upon first reading a manuscript of Beaumarchais&#x27;s play, King Louis XVI stated that &quot;this man mocks everything that must be respected in a government&quot; and refused to let it be performed.
To a lesser degree, the Figaro plays are semi-autobiographical. Don Guzman Brid&#x27;oison (&quot;Le Mariage&quot;) and Bégearss (&quot;La Mère&quot;) were caricatures of two of Beaumarchais&#x27;s real-life adversaries, Goezman and Bergasse. The page Chérubin (&quot;Le Mariage&quot;) resembled the youthful Beaumarchais, who did contemplate suicide when his love was to marry another. Suzanne, the heroine of &quot;Le Mariage&quot; and &quot;La Mère&quot;, was modelled after Beaumarchais&#x27;s third wife, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz. Meanwhile, some of the Count&#x27;s monologues reflect on the playwright&#x27;s remorse over his numerous sexual exploits.

&quot;Le Barbier&quot; premiered in Paris in 1775. An English translation premiered in London a year later, and that was followed by performances in other European countries.

The sequel, &quot;Le Mariage&quot;, was initially passed by the censor in 1781, but was soon banned from performance by Louis XVI after a private reading. Queen Marie-Antoinette lamented the ban, as did various influential members of her entourage. Nonetheless, the King was unhappy with the play&#x27;s satire on the aristocracy and overruled the Queen&#x27;s entreaties to allow its performance. Over the next three years, Beaumarchais gave many private readings of the play, as well as making revisions to try to pass the censor. The King finally relented and lifted the ban in 1784. The play premiered that year and was enormously popular even with aristocratic audiences. Mozart&#x27;s opera based on the play, &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot; premiered just two years later in Vienna.

Beaumarchais&#x27;s final play, &quot;La Mère coupable&quot;, premiered in 1792 in Paris. In homage to the great French playwright Molière, Beaumarchais also dubbed &quot;La Mère coupable&quot; &quot;The Other &quot;Tartuffe&quot;&quot;.

All three Figaro plays enjoyed great success, and are still frequently performed today in theatres and opera houses.

== Court battles==
The death of Duverney on 17 July 1770 triggered a decade of turmoil for Beaumarchais. A few months earlier, the two had signed a statement cancelling all debts that Beaumarchais owed Duverney (about 75,000 pounds), and granting Beaumarchais the modest sum of 15,000 pounds. Duverney&#x27;s sole heir, Count de la Blache, took Beaumarchais to court, claiming the signed statement was a forgery. Although the 1772 verdict favoured Beaumarchais, it was overturned on appeal the following year by a judge, a magistrate named Goezman, whom Beaumarchais tried in vain to bribe. At the same time, Beaumarchais was also involved in a dispute with the Duke de Chaulnes over the Duke&#x27;s mistress, with the result that Beaumarchais was thrown in jail from February to May 1773. La Blache took advantage of Beaumarchais&#x27; court absence and persuaded Goezman to order Beaumarchais to repay all his debts to Duverney, plus interest and all legal expenses.

To garner public support, Beaumarchais published a four-part pamphlet entitled &quot;Mémoires contre Goezman&quot;. The action made Beaumarchais an instant celebrity, for the public at the time saw Beaumarchais as a champion for social justice and liberty. Goezman countered Beaumarchais&#x27;s accusations by launching a lawsuit of his own. The verdict was equivocal. On 26 February 1774, both Beaumarchais and Mme. Goezman (who had taken the bribe from Beaumarchais) were sentenced to &quot;blâme&quot; meaning they were nominally deprived of their civil rights. Naturally, Beaumarchais followed few of the restrictions placed upon him. Magistrate Goezman was removed from his post. At the same time, Goezman&#x27;s verdict in the La Blache case was overturned. The Goezman case was so sensational that the judges left the courtroom through a back door to avoid the large, angry mob waiting in front of the court house.

==American Revolution==
Before France officially entered the war in 1778, Beaumarchais played a major role in delivering French munitions, money and supplies to the American army. In order to secretly funnel aid to the rebels, he helped set up a fictitious business called Roderigue Hortalez and Company.

To restore his civil rights, Beaumarchais pledged his services to Louis XV. He traveled to London, Amsterdam and Vienna on various secret missions. His first mission was to travel to London to destroy a pamphlet, &quot;Les mémoires secrets d&#x27;une femme publique&quot;, which Louis XV considered a libel of one of his mistresses, Madame du Barry. Beaumarchais was sent to London to persuade the French spy Chevalier d&#x27;Éon to return home, but while there he began gathering information on British politics and society. Britain&#x27;s colonial situation was deteriorating and in 1775 fighting broke out between British troops and American rebels. Beaumarchais became a major source of information about the rebellion for the French government and sent a regular stream of reports with exaggerated rumours of the size of the success of the rebel forces blockading Boston.

Once back in France, Beaumarchais began work on a new operation. Louis XVI, who did not want to break openly with Britain, allowed Beaumarchais to found a commercial enterprise, Roderigue Hortalez and Company, supported by the French and Spanish crowns, that supplied the American rebels with weapons, munitions, clothes and provisions, all of which would never be paid for. In an August 18, 1776, letter from Beaumarchais to the Committee of Secret Correspondence and under the signature of Roderique Hortales &amp; Co., he wrote This policy came to fruition in 1777 when John Burgoyne&#x27;s army capitulated at Saratoga to a rebel force largely clothed and armed by the supplies Beaumarchais had been sending; it marked a personal triumph for him. Beaumarchais was injured in a carriage accident while racing into Paris with news of Saratoga. In April 1777, Beaumarchais purchased the old 50-gun ship of the line &quot;Hippopotame&quot;, and used her, renamed to &quot;Fier Rodrigue&quot;, to ferry arms to the insurgents.

Beaumarchais had dealt with Silas Deane, an acting member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence in the Second Continental Congress. For these services, the French Parliament reinstated Beaumarchais&#x27;s civil rights in 1776. In 1778, Beaumarchais&#x27; hopes were fulfilled when the French government agreed to the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the Treaty of Alliance. France officially entered the American War of Independence soon after, followed by Spain in 1779 and the Dutch Republic in 1780.

== The Voltaire revival ==
Shortly after the death of Voltaire in 1778, Beaumarchais set out to publish Voltaire&#x27;s complete works, many of which were banned in France. He bought the rights to most of Voltaire&#x27;s many manuscripts from the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckoucke in February 1779. To evade French censorship, he set up the Société littéraire typographique de Kehl in nearby Germany. The company, at its peak, became the largest printing works in Europe. He bought the complete foundry of the famous English type designer John Baskerville from his widow and also purchased three paper mills. Seventy volumes were published between 1783 and 1790. While the venture proved a financial failure, Beaumarchais was instrumental in preserving many of Voltaire&#x27;s later works which otherwise might have been lost.

== More court battles and the French Revolution ==

It was not long before Beaumarchais crossed paths again with the French legal system. In 1787, he became acquainted with Mme. Kornmann, who was implicated and imprisoned in an adultery suit, which was filed by her husband to expropriate her dowry. The matter went to court, with Beaumarchais siding with Mme. Kornmann, and M. Kornmann assisted by a celebrity lawyer, Nicolas Bergasse. On 2 April 1790, M. Kornmann and Bergasse were found guilty of calumny (slander), but Beaumarchais&#x27;s reputation was also tarnished.

Meanwhile, the French Revolution broke out. Beaumarchais was no longer quite the idol he had been a few years before, as he thought the excesses of the revolution were endangering liberty. He was financially successful, mainly from supplying drinking water to Paris, and had acquired ranks in the French nobility. In 1791, he took up a lavish residence across from where the Bastille once stood. He spent under a week in prison during August 1792 for criticising the government, and was released only three days before a massacre took place in the prison where he had been detained.

Nevertheless, he pledged his services to the new republic. He attempted to purchase 60,000 rifles for the French Revolutionary army from Holland, but was unable to complete the deal.

==Exile and death==
While he was out of the country, Beaumarchais was falsely declared an &quot;émigré&quot; (a loyalist of the old regime) by his enemies. He spent two and a half years in exile, mostly in Germany, before his name was removed from the list of proscribed émigrés. He returned to Paris in 1796, where he lived out the remainder of his life in relative peace. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Boulevard Beaumarchais in Paris is named after him.

== Operas ==
In 1786, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed an opera, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, based on &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte based on the play. Several composers including Paisiello in 1782 wrote operas based on &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. Although not received well at first, Rossini&#x27;s 1816 version of &quot;Barber&quot; is his most successful work and still often performed. In 1966, Darius Milhaud composed an opera, &quot;La mère coupable&quot;, based on &quot;The Guilty Mother&quot;.

Beaumarchais was also the librettist for Antonio Salieri&#x27;s opera &quot;Tarare&quot;, which premiered in Paris in 1787.

== Private life ==
Beaumarchais married three times. His first wife was Madeleine-Catherine Franquet (née Aubertin), whom he married on 22 November 1756; she died under mysterious circumstances only 10 months later. He married Geneviève-Madeleine Lévêque (née Wattebled) in 1768. Again, the second Mme. de Beaumarchais died under mysterious circumstances two years later, though most scholars believed she actually suffered from tuberculosis. Before her death in 1770, she bore a son, Augustin, but he died in 1772. Beaumarchais lived with his lover, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz, for 12 years before she became his third wife in 1786. Together they had a daughter, Eugénie.

Beaumarchais was accused by his enemies of poisoning his first two wives in order to lay claim to their family inheritance. Beaumarchais, though having no shortage of lovers throughout his life, was known to care deeply for both his family and close friends. However, Beaumarchais also had a reputation of marrying for financial gain, and both Franquet and Lévêque had previously married into wealthy families. While there was insufficient evidence to support the accusations, whether or not the poisonings took place is still the subject of debate.

<doc id="62018" wikidata="Q215551" url="?curid=62018" title="Comparative advantage">
<text>Comparative advantage in an economic model is the advantage over others in producing a particular good. A good can be produced at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade. Comparative advantage describes the economic reality of the gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress.

David Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country&#x27;s workers are more efficient at producing &quot;every&quot; single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market (albeit with the assumption that the capital and labour do not move internationally), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries. Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter-intuitive insights in economics, Ricardo&#x27;s theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade.

==Classical theory and David Ricardo&#x27;s formulation==

Adam Smith first alluded to the concept of &quot;absolute advantage&quot; as the basis for international trade in 1776, in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;:
Writing several decades after Smith in 1808, Robert Torrens articulated a preliminary definition of comparative advantage as the loss from the closing of trade:
In 1814 the anonymously published pamphlet &quot;Considerations on the Importation of Foreign Corn&quot; featured the earliest recorded formulation of the concept of comparative advantage. Torrens would later publish his work &quot;External Corn Trade&quot; in 1815 acknowledging this pamphlet author&#x27;s priority. 
In 1817, David Ricardo published what has since become known as the theory of comparative advantage in his book &quot;On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;.

===Ricardo&#x27;s example===

In a famous example, Ricardo considers a world economy consisting of two countries, Portugal and England, each producing two goods of identical quality. In Portugal, the &quot;a priori&quot; more efficient country, it is possible to produce wine and cloth with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However, the relative costs or ranking of cost of producing those two goods differ between the countries.

In this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 100 hours of labor to produce units of cloth, or produce units of wine. Portugal possesses an &quot;absolute advantage&quot; in producing both cloth and wine due to more produced per hour (since &gt; 1). If the capital and labour were mobile, both wine and cloth should be made in Portugal, with the capital and labour of England removed there. If they were not mobile, as Ricardo believed them to be generally, then England&#x27;s &quot;comparative advantage&quot; (due to lower opportunity cost) in producing cloth means that it has an incentive to produce more of that good which is relatively cheaper for them to produce than the other—assuming they have an advantageous opportunity to trade in the marketplace for the other more difficult to produce good.

In the absence of trade, England requires 220 hours of work to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal requires 170 hours of work to produce and consume the same quantities. England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient at producing wine than cloth. So, if each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, then the global production of both goods increases, for England can spend 220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine. Moreover, if both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for to units of Portugal&#x27;s wine, then both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine, with 0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported. Consequently, both England and Portugal can consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in autarky.

===Ricardian model===
The Ricardian model is a general equilibrium mathematical model of international trade. Although the idea of the Ricardian model was first presented in the &quot;Essay on Profits&quot; (a single-commodity version) and then in the &quot;Principles&quot; (a multi-commodity version) by David Ricardo, the first mathematical Ricardian model was published by William Whewell in 1833. The earliest test of the Ricardian model was performed by G.D.A. MacDougall, which was published in &quot;Economic Journal&quot; of 1951 and 1952. In the Ricardian model, trade patterns depend on productivity differences.

The following is a typical modern interpretation of the classical Ricardian model. In the interest of simplicity, it uses notation and definitions, such as opportunity cost, unavailable to Ricardo.

The world economy consists of two countries, Home and Foreign, which produce wine and cloth. Labor, the only factor of production, is mobile domestically but not internationally; there may be migration between sectors but not between countries. We denote the labor force in Home by formula_1, the amount of labor required to produce one unit of wine in Home by formula_2, and the amount of labor required to produce one unit of cloth in Home by formula_3. The total amount of wine and cloth produced in Home are formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. We denote the same variables for Foreign by appending a prime. For instance, formula_6 is the amount of labor needed to produce a unit of wine in Foreign.

We do not know if Home can produce cloth using fewer hours of work than Foreign. That is, we do not know if formula_7. Similarly, we do not know if Home can produce wine using fewer hours of work. However, we assume Home is &quot;relatively&quot; more productive than Foreign in making in cloth vs. wine:
:formula_8

Equivalently, we may assume that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth in the sense that it has a lower opportunity cost for cloth in terms of wine than Foreign:
:formula_9

In the absence of trade, the relative price of cloth and wine in each country is determined solely by the relative labor cost of the goods. Hence the relative autarky price of cloth is formula_10 in Home and formula_11 in Foreign. With free trade, the price of cloth or wine in either country is the world price formula_12 orformula_13.

Instead of considering the world demand (or supply) for cloth and wine, we are interested in the world &quot;relative demand&quot; (or &quot;relative supply&quot;) for cloth and wine, which we define as the ratio of the world demand (or supply) for cloth to the world demand (or supply) for wine. In general equilibrium, the world relative price formula_14 will be determined uniquely by the intersection of world relative demand formula_15 and world relative supply formula_16 curves.
We assume that the relative demand curve reflects substitution effects and is decreasing with respect to relative price. The behavior of the relative supply curve, however, warrants closer study. Recalling our original assumption that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth, we consider five possibilities for the relative quantity of cloth supplied at a given price.

* If formula_17, then Foreign specializes in wine, for the wage formula_18 in the wine sector is greater than the wage formula_19 in the cloth sector. However, Home workers are indifferent between working in either sector. As a result, the quantity of cloth supplied can take any value.
* If formula_20, then both Home and Foreign specialize in wine, for similar reasons as above, and so the quantity of cloth supplied is zero.
* If formula_21, then Home specializes in cloth whereas Foreign specializes in wine. The quantity of cloth supplied is given by the ratio formula_22 of the world production of cloth to the world production of wine.
* If formula_23, then both Home and Foreign specialize in cloth. The quantity of cloth supplied tends to infinity as the quantity of wine supplied approaches zero.
* If formula_24, then Home specializes in cloth while Foreign workers are indifferent between sectors. Again, the relative quantity of cloth supplied can take any value.
As long as the relative demand is finite, the relative price is always bounded by the inequality
:formula_25

In autarky, Home faces a production constraint of the form
:formula_26
from which it follows that Home&#x27;s cloth consumption at the production possibilities frontier is
:formula_27.

With free trade, Home produces cloth exclusively, an amount of which it exports in exchange for wine at the prevailing rate. Thus Home&#x27;s overall consumption is now subject to the constraint
:formula_28
while its cloth consumption at the &quot;consumption possibilities&quot; frontier is given by
:formula_29.

A symmetric argument holds for Foreign. Therefore, by trading and specializing in a good for which it has a comparative advantage, each country can expand its consumption possibilities. Consumers can choose from bundles of wine and cloth that they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.

There is another way to prove the theory of comparative advantage, which requires less assumption than the above-detailed proof, and in particular does not require for the hourly wages to be equal in both industries, nor requires any equilibrium between offer and demand on the market. Such a proof can be extended to situations with many goods and many countries, non constant returns and more than one factor of production.

=== Terms of trade ===
Terms of trade is the rate at which one good could be traded for another. If both countries specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage then trade, the terms of trade for a good (that benefit both entities) will fall between each entities opportunity costs. In the example above one unit of cloth would trade for between formula_30 units of wine and formula_31 units of wine.

==Haberler&#x27;s opportunity costs formulation==
In 1930 Austrian-American economist Gottfried Haberler detached the doctrine of comparative advantage from Ricardo&#x27;s labor theory of value and provided a modern opportunity cost formulation. Haberler&#x27;s reformulation of comparative advantage revolutionized the theory of international trade and laid the conceptual groundwork of modern trade theories.

Haberler&#x27;s innovation was to reformulate the theory of comparative advantage such that the value of good X is measured in terms of the forgone units of production of good Y rather than the labor units necessary to produce good X, as in the Ricardian formulation. Haberler implemented this opportunity-cost formulation of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory.

Since 1817, economists have attempted to generalize the Ricardian model and derive the principle of comparative advantage in broader settings, most notably in the neoclassical &quot;specific factors&quot; Ricardo-Viner (which allows for the model to include more factors than just labour) and &quot;factor proportions&quot; Heckscher–Ohlin models. Subsequent developments in the new trade theory, motivated in part by the empirical shortcomings of the H–O model and its inability to explain intra-industry trade, have provided an explanation for aspects of trade that are not accounted for by comparative advantage. Nonetheless, economists like Alan Deardorff, Avinash Dixit, Gottfried Haberler, and Victor D. Norman have responded with weaker generalizations of the principle of comparative advantage, in which countries will only &quot;tend&quot; to export goods for which they have a comparative advantage.

===Dornbusch et al.&#x27;s continuum of goods formulation===
In both the Ricardian and H–O models, the comparative advantage theory is formulated for a 2 countries/2 commodities case. It can be extended to a 2 countries/many commodities case, or a many countries/2 commodities case. Adding commodities in order to have a smooth continuum of goods is the major insight of the seminal paper by Dornbusch, Fisher, and Samuelson. In fact, inserting an increasing number of goods into the chain of comparative advantage makes the gaps between the ratios of the labor requirements negligible, in which case the three types of equilibria around any good in the original model collapse to the same outcome. It notably allows for transportation costs to be incorporated, although the framework remains restricted to two countries. But in the case with many countries (more than 3 countries) and many commodities (more than 3 commodities), the notion of comparative advantage requires a substantially more complex formulation.

===Deardorff&#x27;s general law of comparative advantage===
Skeptics of comparative advantage have underlined that its theoretical implications hardly hold when applied to individual commodities or pairs of commodities in a world of multiple commodities. Deardorff argues that the insights of comparative advantage remain valid if the theory is restated in terms of averages across all commodities. His models provide multiple insights on the correlations between vectors of trade and vectors with relative-autarky-price measures of comparative advantage. &quot;Deardorff&#x27;s general law of comparative advantage&quot; is a model incorporating multiple goods which takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.

===Alternative approaches===
Recently, Y. Shiozawa succeeded in constructing a theory of international value in the tradition of Ricardo&#x27;s cost-of-production theory of value. This was based on a wide range of assumptions: Many countries; Many commodities; Several production techniques for a product in a country; Input trade (intermediate goods are freely traded); Durable capital goods with constant efficiency during a predetermined lifetime; No transportation cost (extendable to positive cost cases).

In a famous comment, McKenzie pointed that &quot;A moment&#x27;s consideration will convince one that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if the cotton had to be grown in England.&quot; However, McKenzie and later researchers could not produce a general theory which includes traded input goods because of the mathematical difficulty. As John Chipman points it, McKenzie found that &quot;introduction of trade in intermediate product necessitates a fundamental alteration in classical analysis.&quot; Durable capital goods such as machines and installations are inputs to the productions in the same title as part and ingredients.

In view of the new theory, no physical criterion exists. Deardorff examines 10 versions of definitions in two groups but could not give a general formula for the case with intermediate goods. The competitive patterns are determined by the traders trials to find cheapest products in a world. The search of cheapest product is achieved by world optimal procurement. Thus the new theory explains how the global supply chains are formed.

==Empirical approach to comparative advantage==
Comparative advantage is a theory about the benefits that specialization and trade would bring, rather than a strict prediction about actual behavior. (In practice, governments restrict international trade for a variety of reasons; under Ulysses S. Grant, the US postponed opening up to free trade until its industries were up to strength, following the example set earlier by Britain.) Nonetheless there is a large amount of empirical work testing the predictions of comparative advantage. The empirical works usually involve testing predictions of a particular model. For example, the Ricardian model predicts that technological differences in countries result in differences in labor productivity. The differences in labor productivity in turn determine the comparative advantages across different countries. Testing the Ricardian model for instance involves looking at the relationship between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns. A country that is relatively efficient in producing shoes tends to export shoes.

===Direct test: natural experiment of Japan===
Assessing the validity of comparative advantage on a global scale with the examples of contemporary economies is analytically challenging because of the multiple factors driving globalization: indeed, investment, migration, and technological change play a role in addition to trade. Even if we could isolate the workings of open trade from other processes, establishing its causal impact also remains complicated: it would require a comparison with a counterfactual world without open trade. Considering the durability of different aspects of globalization, it is hard to assess the sole impact of open trade on a particular economy.

Daniel Bernhofen and John Brown have attempted to address this issue, by using a natural experiment of a sudden transition to open trade in a market economy. They focus on the case of Japan. The Japanese economy indeed developed over several centuries under autarky and a quasi-isolation from international trade but was, by the mid-19th century, a sophisticated market economy with a population of 30 million. Under Western military pressure, Japan opened its economy to foreign trade through a series of unequal treaties.

In 1859, the treaties limited tariffs to 5% and opened trade to Westerners. Considering that the transition from autarky, or self-sufficiency, to open trade was brutal, few changes to the fundamentals of the economy occurred in the first 20 years of trade. The general law of comparative advantage theorizes that an economy should, on average, export goods with low self-sufficiency prices and import goods with high self-sufficiency prices. Bernhofen and Brown found that by 1869, the price of Japan&#x27;s main export, silk and derivatives, saw a 100% increase in real terms, while the prices of numerous imported goods declined of 30-75%. In the next decade, the ratio of imports to gross domestic product reached 4%.

===Structural estimation===
Another important way of demonstrating the validity of comparative advantage has consisted in &#x27;structural estimation&#x27; approaches. These approaches have built on the Ricardian formulation of two goods for two countries and subsequent models with many goods or many countries. The aim has been to reach a formulation accounting for both multiple goods and multiple countries, in order to reflect real-world conditions more accurately. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum underlined that a convincing model needed to incorporate the idea of a &#x27;continuum of goods&#x27; developed by Dornbusch et al. for both goods and countries. They were able to do so by allowing for an arbitrary (integer) number i of countries, and dealing exclusively with unit labor requirements for each good (one for each point on the unit interval) in each country (of which there are i).

===Earlier empirical work===
Two of the first tests of comparative advantage were by MacDougall (1951, 1952). A prediction of a two-country Ricardian comparative advantage model is that countries will export goods where output per worker (i.e. productivity) is higher. That is, we expect a positive relationship between output per worker and the number of exports. MacDougall tested this relationship with data from the US and UK, and did indeed find a positive relationship. The statistical test of this positive relationship was replicated with new data by Stern (1962) and Balassa (1963).

Dosi et al. (1988) conducted a book-length empirical examination that suggests that international trade in manufactured goods is largely driven by differences in national technological competencies.

One critique of the textbook model of comparative advantage is that there are only two goods. The results of the model are robust to this assumption. Dornbusch et al. (1977) generalized the theory to allow for such a large number of goods as to form a smooth continuum. Based in part on these generalizations of the model, Davis (1995) provides a more recent view of the Ricardian approach to explain trade between countries with similar resources.

More recently, Golub and Hsieh (2000) presents modern statistical analysis of the relationship between relative productivity and trade patterns, which finds reasonably strong correlations, and Nunn (2007) finds that countries that have greater enforcement of contracts specialize in goods that require relationship-specific investments.

Taking a broader perspective, there has been work about the benefits of international trade. Zimring &amp; Etkes (2014) finds that the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, which substantially restricted the availability of imports to Gaza, saw labor productivity fall by 20% in three years. Markusen et al. (1994) reports the effects of moving away from autarky to free trade during the Meiji Restoration, with the result that national income increased by up to 65% in 15 years.
===Criticism===
Several arguments have been advanced against using comparative advantage as a justification for advocating free trade, and they have gained an audience among economists. James Brander and Barbara Spencer demonstrated how, in a strategic setting where a few firms compete for the world market, export subsidies and import restrictions can keep foreign firms from competing with national firms, increasing welfare in the country implementing these so-called strategic trade policies.

There are some economists who dispute the claims of the benefit of comparative advantage. James K. Galbraith has stated that &quot;free trade has attained the status of a god&quot; and that &quot;... none of the world&#x27;s most successful trading regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now mainland China, reached their current status by adopting neoliberal trading rules.&quot; He argues that comparative advantage relies on the assumption of constant returns, which he states is not generally the case. According to Galbraith, nations trapped into specializing in agriculture are condemned to perpetual poverty, as agriculture is dependent on land, a finite non-increasing natural resource.

<doc id="62020" wikidata="Q632" url="?curid=62020" title="Jean Moulin">
<text>Jean Pierre Moulin (; 20 June 1899 – 8 July 1943) was a French civil servant and resistant who succeeded in unifying the main networks of the French Resistance in World War II, a unique act in Europe. He served as the first President of the National Council of the Resistance from 27 May 1943 until his death less than two months later.

A prefect in the Aveyron (1937–1939) and Eure-et-Loir (1939–1940) departments, he is remembered today as one of the main heroes of the French Resistance and for his efforts to unify it under Charles de Gaulle. He was tortured by German officer Klaus Barbie while in Gestapo custody. His death was registered at Metz railway station.

==Early life==

Jean Moulin was born at 6 Rue d&#x27;Alsace in Béziers, Hérault, son of Antoine-Émile Moulin and Blanche Élisabeth Pègue. He was the grandson of an insurgent opposing the coup d&#x27;état of 2 December 1851. His father was a lay teacher at the Université Populaire and a Freemason at the lodge Action Sociale.

Moulin was baptised on 6 August 1899 in the church of Saint-Vincentin in Saint-Andiol (Bouches-du-Rhône), the village his parents came from. He spent an uneventful childhood in the company of his brother, Joseph, and his sister, Laure. Joseph died of acute peritonitis in 1907.:27 Throughout his early years, Moulin was an average student, including at the Lycée Henri IV in Béziers. One of his report cards states that &quot;he would be an excellent student, if he were ever to start working.&quot;:33

In 1917, he enrolled at the Faculty of Law of Montpellier, where he was not a brilliant student though he did finish his legal studies with a diploma.:33 However, thanks to the influence of his father, he was appointed as attaché to the cabinet of the prefect of Hérault under the presidency of Raymond Poincaré.

==Military service during World War I==
Moulin was mobilised on 17 April 1918 as part of the age class of 1919, the last class to be mobilised in France. He was assigned to the 2nd Engineer Regiment of Montpellier. He did not At the beginning of September, after an accelerated training, he headed with his regiment to the front in the Vosges, where he was posted in the village of Socourt.:43

His regiment was preparing to go to the front lines as part of the attack planned by Foch for 13 November, but the Armistice was signed on 11 November.:43

Although Moulin did not fight directly on the front lines, he was nevertheless in a position to observe the horrors of war. He saw its aftermath on the battle fields and the devastation of villages. He helped to bury the war dead in the region around Metz.:47 He wrote home expressing his shock at seeing the starved state of British prisoners of war who had just been freed. Nevertheless, nothing in the documented history of Jean Moulin&#x27;s experience during World War I hinted at what his role would be during World War II.:34–35

While still enlisted after the War, he was posted successively to Seine-et-Oise, Verdun and Chalon-sur-Saône. He worked as a carpenter, a digger and later a telephonist for the 7th and 9th Engineer Regiments.

He was de-mobilised in November and, on 4 November 1919, resumed his post as attaché at the préfecture of Hérault, in Montpellier.:52

==Interwar years==
After World War I, Moulin resumed his studies of law. His position as attaché at the préfecture of Hérault allowed him to finance his university studies while also providing a useful apprenticeship in politics and government. He obtained his law degree in July 1921:52. He then entered the prefectural administration as chief of staff to the deputy of Savoie in 1922 and then &quot;sous-préfet&quot; of Albertville from 1925 to 1930.

After his proposal of marriage to Jeanette Auran was rejected, Moulin, then aged 27, married a 19-year-old professional singer, Marguerite Cerruti, in the town of Betton-Bettonet in September 1926. The marriage did not last long. Cerruti quickly became bored and Moulin responded by offering her further singing lessons in Paris, where she disappeared for two days. Biographer Patrick Marnham cites one of the causes of the divorce being Moulin&#x27;s mother-in-law, who had wanted to prevent her estate passing into Moulin&#x27;s control upon Cerruti&#x27;s 21st birthday. Moulin attempted to hide this rejection by excusing his wife&#x27;s disappearances and not informing his family until after his divorce.

Moulin was appointed &quot;sous-préfet&quot; of Châteaulin, Brittany in 1930. At the same time, he published political cartoons in the newspaper &quot;Le Rire&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Romanin&quot;. He also illustrated books by the Breton poet Tristan Corbière, including an etching for &quot;La Pastorale de Conlie&quot;, Corbière&#x27;s poem about Camp Conlie where many Boon soldiers died in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. He also made friends with the Breton poets Saint-Pol-Roux in Camaret and Max Jacob in Quimper.

In 1932, Pierre Cot, a Radical-Socialist politician, named Moulin his second in command or &quot;chef adjoint&quot; when he was serving as Foreign Minister under Paul Doumer&#x27;s presidency. In 1933, Moulin was appointed &quot;sous-préfet&quot; of Thonon-les-Bains, parallel to his function of head of Cot&#x27;s cabinet in the Air Ministry under President Albert Lebrun. On 19 January 1934, Moulin was appointed &quot;sous-préfet&quot; of Montargis, but he did not assume the office and chose to remain under Cot. In the first half of April, Moulin was appointed to the Seine &quot;préfecture&quot; and, on 1 July, he took his place as secretary general in Somme, in Amiens. In 1936, he was once more named chief of cabinet of Cot&#x27;s Air Ministry of the Popular Front. In that capacity, Moulin was involved in Cot&#x27;s efforts to assist the Second Spanish Republic by sending it planes and pilots. For the Istres-Damas-Le Bourget race, he presented the winners with their prize; Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son was one of those winners. He became France&#x27;s youngest &quot;préfet&quot; in the Aveyron &quot;département&quot;, based in the commune of Rodez, in January 1937. It has been claimed that during the Spanish Civil War, Moulin assisted with the shipment of arms from the Soviet Union to Spain. A more commonly-accepted version of events is that he used his position in the French air ministry to deliver planes to the Spanish Republican forces.

==Experience as prefect during the early part of World War II==

In January 1939, Moulin was appointed prefect of the Eure-et-Loir department, based in Chartres. After war against Germany was declared, he asked multiple times to be demoted because &quot;[his] place is not at the rear, at the head of a rural departement&quot;. Against the advice of the Minister of the Interior, he asked to be transferred to the military school of Issy-Les-Moulineaux, near Paris. The minister forced him to return to Chartres, where the War quickly made its way to him in the form of German air strikes and columns of distressed and sometimes wounded refugees. As the Germans approached Chartres, he wrote to his parents, &quot;If the Germans – who are capable of anything – make me say dishonorable words, you already know, it is not the truth&quot;. In mid-June, German troops entered Chartres.

Moulin was arrested by the Germans on 17 June 1940 because he refused to sign a false declaration that three Senegalese &quot;tirailleurs&quot; had committed atrocities, killing civilians in La Taye. In fact, those civilians had been killed by German bombings.

Beaten and imprisoned because he refused to comply, Moulin attempted suicide by cutting his own throat with a piece of broken glass. This act left him with a scar he would often hide with a scarf, giving us the image of Jean Moulin by which he often is remembered today. The suicide attempt did not succeed because he was discovered by a guard and taken to a hospital for treatment.

Because he was a Radical, he was dismissed by the Vichy regime, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain on 2 November 1940, along with other left-wing préfets. He then began writing his diary, First Battle, in which he relates his resistance against the Nazis in Chartres, which was later published at the Liberation and prefaced by de Gaulle.

== The Resistance ==
Having decided not to collaborate, Moulin left Chartres for his parents&#x27; home town, Saint-Andiol, Bouches-du-Rhône, and joined the French Resistance, specifically, the organisation Free France. Under the name &quot;Joseph Jean Mercier,&quot; he went to Marseille, where he met other résistants, including Henri Frenay and Antoine Sachs.

Moulin travelled to London in September 1941 after passing through Spain and Portugal. He was received on 24 October by Charles de Gaulle, who wrote about Moulin, &quot;A great man. Great in every way&quot;.

Moulin summarised the state of the French Resistance to de Gaulle. Part of the Resistance considered him too ambitious, but de Gaulle had confidence in his network and skills. He gave Moulin the assignment of co-ordinating and unifying the various Resistance groups, a difficult mission that would take time and effort to accomplish. On 1 January 1942, Moulin parachuted into the Alpilles and met with the leaders of the resistance groups, under the codenames &quot;Rex&quot; and &quot;Max&quot;:

*Henri Frenay (&quot;Combat&quot;)
*Emmanuel d&#x27;Astier (&quot;Libération&quot;)
*Jean-Pierre Lévy (&quot;Francs-tireurs&quot;)
*Pierre Villon (&quot;Front national&quot;, not to be confused with the later political party of the same name)
*Pierre Brossolette (&quot;Comité d&#x27;action socialiste&quot;)

He succeeded to the extent that the first three of these resistance leaders and their groups came together to form the United Resistance Movement (Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, MUR) in January 1943. The next month, Moulin returned to London, accompanied by Charles Delestraint, who led the new &quot;Armée secrète&quot;, which grouped together the MUR&#x27;s military wings. Moulin left London on 21 March 1943, with orders to unify the French resistance by forming the National Resistance Council (Conseil national de la Résistance); CNR). Again, this was a difficult task since the other resistance movements, besides the three already in the MUR, wanted to retain their independence.

== Creation of the Conseil National de la Résistance ==
Moulin succeeded in this task by obtaining unanimous adoption of a unified ‘Program’ and recognition of Charles de Gaulle as their leader by disparate elements of the French resistance, including by various resistance units as well as by outlawed labour unions and political parties. Because he was known as a left-wing republican, he also succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Communist resistance groups, which had been reluctant to accept de Gaulle as their leader. The unifying Program was set forth in a document called the &#x27;Program of the National Council of the Resistance.&#x27;

Adopted on March 15, 1944,:62–63 the Program is a text of fewer than ten pages. It consists of two parts: an &quot;immediate action plan&quot;, which concerns resistance action prior to the Liberation of France. The second part describes &quot;measures to be applied after the territory is liberated&quot;, a kind of government program describing how Nazi influence should be purged from French society as well as longer-term measures, such as the restoration of universal suffrage, liberty of the press, the right to unionise and social security. The first meeting of the CNR took place in Paris on 27 May 1943. The meeting was attended by representatives of eight resistance movements, two major labour unions and the six most important political parties of the Third Republic.

This show of unity consolidated the position of de Gaulle vis-à-vis the allied forces, who were considering a plan to administer post-War France themselves. The Conseil National de la Résistance – by bringing together (both symbolically and as a context for meetings) major resistance units, labour unions and political parties – enhanced the credibility of the French Resistance as a unified movement. With Charles de Gaulle as its recognised head, it also fortified de Gaulle’s position as a national leader who could govern France after the war. Thus, while it is not clear that the CNR actually managed to create a unified military force from the various resistance movements, it did play a role in consolidating the role of France as a politically and militarily viable force within post-War French society and as ally of the Allied Forces.

In his work in shepherding the Resistance, Moulin was aided by his private administrative assistant, Laure Diebold.

==Betrayal and death==

On 21 June 1943, Moulin was arrested by the Sicherheitsdienst (a branch of the Nazi Secret Service) while holding a meeting with fellow Resistance leaders in the home of Dr. Frédéric Dugoujon in Caluire-et-Cuire, a suburb of Lyon, as were Dugoujon, Henri Aubry (alias Avricourt and Thomas), Raymond Aubrac, Bruno Larat (alias Xavier-Laurent Parisot), André Lassagne (alias Lombard), Colonel Albert Lacaze and Colonel Émile Schwarzfeld (alias Blumstein). René Hardy (alias Didot), a member of the resistance movement &quot;Combat&quot; and a specialist in railroads, was also present for reasons that are not clear and in what appears to have been a breach of good security practice.:157

Moulin and the other Resistance leaders were sent to Montluc Prison in Lyon (but not René Hardy, who either escaped or was allowed to flee). They were detained there until the beginning of July. While there, he was tortured by Klaus Barbie, head of the Gestapo in Lyon and, later, briefly in Paris. According to witnesses, Moulin and his men had their fingernails removed using hot needles as spatulas. In addition, his fingers were placed in the door frame of the interrogation cell, with the door then repeatedly closed until his knuckles were shattered. They increasingly tightened his handcuffs until they penetrated the skin, breaking the bones in his wrists. He was beaten until his face was unrecognizable and he fell into a coma.

After the torture sessions, Barbie ordered that Moulin be displayed as an object lesson to other imprisoned members of the Resistance. The last time he was seen alive he was still in a coma, his head swollen and yellow from bruising and wrapped in bandages, according to the description given by Christian Pineau, fellow prisoner and member of the Resistance. There is some uncertainty surrounding the exact circumstances of Moulin&#x27;s death, including about the view that he died while being transported by train to Germany. According to his death certificate (established by the occupying force), he died near or in the train station of Metz, but there are conflicting reports as to when and where he died.:429, 
== Theories about who betrayed Moulin ==
The question of who betrayed Jean Moulin has attracted much research, speculation, judicial scrutiny and media coverage. Many members of the resistance who could have provided a first hand account of what happened died during the War. Furthermore, internecine tensions within the resistance movement are well documented and have left fertile ground for speculation about who within the movement might have provided the information to the Nazis. 

Regarding Moulin&#x27;s arrest, suspicions have focused on resistance member René Hardy, who, prior to accusations that he betrayed Mouline, was known to be a reliable resistance fighter. Hardy was arrested on 7 June 1943 by the Sicherheitsdienst on the Paris-Lyon night train. This arrest took place in the context of a wave of arrests of resistance fighters, including resistance leader General Charles Delestraint. After his arrest, Hardy was subjected to torture or threats of torture. It is suspected, and some Nazi documentation supports this, that he became a Nazi agent after his arrest. In any case, at the insistence of many of his colleagues in the Resistance, Hardy was present at the house in Caluire-et-Cuire at the time of Moulin&#x27;s arrest.:404–409 However, either Hardy escaped or was allowed to flee. He was injured during the escape (though some suspected that the wound was self-inflicted), and he also managed to escape from his hospital, scaling a high wall despite having his arm in a cast. In two post-war trials that examined his alleged role in the arrest, Hardy was acquitted for lack of evidence.:404–409

Communists have also been the target of allegations, though no hard evidence has ever backed up that claim. Marnham looked into these assertions but found no evidence to support them (although Communist Party members could easily have seen Moulin as a &quot;fellow traveller&quot; because he had communist friends and supported the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War). As &quot;préfet&quot;, Moulin even ordered the repression of communist &#x27;agitators&#x27; and went so far as to have police keep some of them under surveillance. At the trial of Klaus Barbie in 1987, his lawyer, Jacques Vergès, made much out of speculation that Moulin was betrayed by either Communists and/or Gaullists as part of an attempt to distract attention away from the actions of his client, by making the true authors of Moulin&#x27;s arrest his fellow &quot;résistants&quot;, rather than Barbie. Vergès failed in his effort to acquit Barbie but succeeded in creating a vast industry of various conspiracy theories, many very fanciful, about who betrayed Moulin. Leading historians, such as Henri Noguères and Jean-Pierre Azéma, rejected Vergès&#x27;s conspiracy theories under which Barbie was somehow less culpable than the supposed traitors who tipped him off.

The British intelligence officer Peter Wright, in his 1987 book &quot;Spy Catcher&quot;, wrote that Pierre Cot was an &quot;active Russian agent&quot; and called his protégé Moulin a &quot;dedicated Communist&quot;. Clinton wrote that Wright based his allegations against Moulin entirely on secret documents that he claimed to have seen but which no historian has ever seen, and on conversations that he is supposed to have had decades ago with others long dead, which made his case against Moulin very &quot;dubious&quot;. Henri-Christian Giraud, the grandson of General Henri Giraud (who had been outmaneuvered by de Gaulle for the leadership of the Free French movement), hit back in his two-volume work &quot;De Gaulle et les communistes&quot;, published in 1988 and 1989, which outlined a conspiracy theory suggesting that de Gaulle had been &quot;manipulated&quot; by the &quot;Soviet agent&quot; Moulin into following the PCF&#x27;s line of &quot;national insurrection&quot; and thereby eclipsed his grandfather, who, he maintained, should have been the rightful leader of Free France. Taking up Giraud&#x27;s theories, the lawyer Charles Benfredj argued in his 1990 book &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Jean Moulin: Le contre-enquête&quot; that Moulin was a Soviet agent who had not been killed by Barbie but allowed by the German government to go to the Soviet Union in 1943, where Moulin supposedly died sometime after the war. Benfredj&#x27;s book was published with an introduction with Jacques Soustelle, the archaeologist of Mexico and wartime Gaullist whose commitment to &quot;Algérie française&quot; had made him a bitter enemy of de Gaulle by 1959. The essence of all theories about Moulin, the alleged Soviet agent, was that because de Gaulle had agreed to co-operate with the Communists during the war, all of which was Moulin&#x27;s work, he had set France on the wrong course and led to him granting Algeria independence in 1962, instead of keeping Algeria in France.

It has also been suggested, principally in Marnham&#x27;s biography, that Moulin was betrayed by communists. Marnham points the finger specifically at Raymond Aubrac and possibly his wife, Lucie. He alleges that communists at times betrayed non-communists to the Gestapo and that Aubrac was linked to harsh actions during the purge of collaborators after the war. In 1990, Barbie, by then &quot;a bitter dying Nazi&quot;, named Aubrac as the traitor. To counteract the accusations levelled at Moulin, Daniel Cordier, his personal secretary during the war, wrote a biography of his former leader. In April 1997, Vergès produced a &quot;Barbie Testament&quot;, which he claimed that Barbie had given him ten years earlier and purported to show the Aubracs had tipped off Barbie. It was timed for the publication of the book &quot;Aubrac Lyon 1943&quot; by Gérard Chauvy, who meant to prove that the Aubracs were the ones who informed Barbie about the fateful meeting at Caluire on 21 June 1943. On 2 April 1998, following a civil suit launched by the Aubracs, a Paris court fined Chauvy and his publisher, Albin Michel, for &quot;public defamation&quot;. In 1998, the French historian Jacques Baynac, in his book &quot;Les Secrets de l&#x27;affaire Jean Moulin&quot;, claimed that Moulin was planning to break with de Gaulle to recognise General Giraud, which led the Gaullists to tip off Barbie before that could happen.

==Legacy==

Ashes that are thought to be those of Jean Moulin were buried in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and later transferred to the Panthéon on 19 December 1964. The speech given at the transfer site by André Malraux, a writer and cabinet minister, is one of the most famous speeches in French history.

France&#x27;s French education curriculum commemorates Moulin as a symbol of the French resistance and a model of civic virtue, moral rectitude and patriotism. As of 2015, Jean Moulin was the fifth most popular name for a French school, and as of 2016 his is the third most popular French street name of which 98 percent are male. Lyon 3 university and a Paris tramway station have also been named after him.

The photograph with a fedora and scarf has become a popular representation of Jean Moulin and more generally the Resistance movement; in it, Jean Moulin seems to hide from onlookers to protect his clandestine life. However, the photograph itself was taken in Montpellier in February 1940 during a family visit, before his first arrest in June 1940 and subsequent decision to join the Resistance.

In 1967, the Centre national Jean-Moulin de Bordeaux was created in Bordeaux. Its archives contain documents on the Second World War and the Resistance. The Centre provides pedagogical supports and research material on the involvement of Jean Moulin in the Resistance. Another member of the resistance, Antoinette Sasse, created a bequest in her will to found The Musée Jean Moulin in 1994.

The 1969 Jean Pierre Melville fictional film &quot;Army of Shadows&quot;, based on a book of the same name, depicts, through the character of Luc Jardie, played by Paul Meurisse, several events in Moulin&#x27;s war experience but with some inaccuracy; in the film, his homosexual male secretary is replaced by a female assistant. Two French made-for-television films deal with Jean Moulin: in 2002, &quot;Jean Moulin&quot;, by Yves Boisset and, in 2003, &quot;Jean Moulin, une affaire française&quot;, by Pierre Aknine.

In 1993, commemorative French 2, 100 and 500 franc coins were issued, showing a partial image of Moulin against the Croix de Lorraine and using a fedora-and-scarf photograph, which is well recognised in France.

<doc id="62021" wikidata="Q1110643" url="?curid=62021" title="Colonel Bogey March">
<text>The &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; is a British march that was composed in 1914 by Lieutenant F. J. Ricketts (1881–1945) (pen name Kenneth J. Alford), a British Army bandmaster who later became the director of music for the Royal Marines at Plymouth. The march is often whistled. During the Second World War, British soldiers sang the lyrics &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; to accompany the tune.

The march first appeared in film when it was hummed by Michael Redgrave in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; in 1938. English composer Malcolm Arnold added a counter-march, which he titled &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;, for David Lean&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, set during World War II. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine included the tune in its list of 25 of Cinema&#x27;s Catchiest Earworms.

==History==
Since service personnel were, at that time, not encouraged to have professional lives outside the armed forces, British Army bandmaster F. J. Ricketts published &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; and his other compositions under the pseudonym Kenneth J. Alford in 1914. One supposition is that the tune was inspired by a British military officer who &quot;preferred to whistle a descending minor third&quot; rather than shout &quot;Fore!&quot; when playing golf. It is this descending interval that begins each line of the melody. The name &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; began in the late 19th century as an imaginary &quot;standard opponent&quot; in assessing a player&#x27;s performance, and by Edwardian times the Colonel had been adopted by the golfing world as the presiding spirit of the course. Edwardian golfers on both sides of the Atlantic often played matches against &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot;. Bogey is now a golfing term meaning &quot;one over par&quot;.

==Legacy==
At the start of World War II, &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; became a British institution when a popular song was set to the tune: &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; (originally &quot;Göring Has Only Got One Ball&quot; after the Luftwaffe leader suffered a groin injury), essentially exalting rudeness.

In 1951, during the first computer conference held in Australia, the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; was the first music played by a computer, by CSIRAC, a computer developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

The march first appeared in film when it was hummed by Michael Redgrave (playing the Gilbert in his film debut) in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; in 1938. The 1957 David Lean epic film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; popularized &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;, a counter-march to Colonel Bogey March. In the 1961 film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, the campers at an all-girls summer camp whistle the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; as they march through camp, mirroring the scene from &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.

In episode 28 of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; from 1976, the march was used in the Sale of the Half-Century game show sketch during a Name That Tune-style question. One of the contestants&#x27; answers was &quot;After the Ball&quot; after which the host (Benny Hill) responded with, &quot;well, you&#x27;re sort of half-right&quot; referring to the anti-Hitler slur.

In &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the fourth incarnation of the Time Lord whistled the tune in &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;, &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; and &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart also whistled it in &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;.

In the 1985 film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, all the teenage main characters are whistling the tune during their Saturday detention when Principal Vernon (played by Paul Gleason) walks into the room. It was also used in &quot;Short Circuit&quot; and &quot;Spaceballs&quot;.

The Jawa-like creatures called Dinks from the 1987 film &quot;Spaceballs&quot; whistled Colonel Bogey in three scenes. 

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;, Bart initially writes a verse to a birthday song for Lisa to the tune of &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; albeit with jokey lyrics.

In &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; episode &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Screams&quot;, the fictional ULA Peacocks have a fight song to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. 

In 2019, the Colonel Bogey March was used in the TV series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, in episode 8 of season 4. The song was featured in episode 5 of season 6 of &quot;Outlander&quot;, revealing a returning character from season 5. The song also continued through the credits. The Colonel Bogey March was used in the 2024 neo-noir television series &quot;Monsieur Spade&quot; from AMC and Canal+. Perhaps coincidentally, the main character, Sam Spade, was previously played by Humphrey Bogart, often called &quot;Bogie&quot;.

At the end of the &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; episode &quot;On the Hoof&quot;, Paul and Barry have to put on a marching band for a pompous government minister at an MI7 camp only for it to go awry. The latter brother plays the tune on a kazoo while the former just hits a tambourine.

The march has been used in German commercials for Underberg digestif bitter since the 1970s, and has become a classic jingle there. A parody titled &quot;Comet&quot; is a humorous song about the ill effects of consuming the cleaning product of the same name. In Indonesia this march became the jingle tune for a medicine brand called Bodrex

==&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;==
English composer Malcolm Arnold added a counter-march, which he titled &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;, for the 1957 dramatic film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, set during World War II. The two marches were recorded together by Mitch Miller as &quot;March from the River Kwai – Colonel Bogey&quot; and it reached #20 in the US in 1958. 
The Arnold march forms part of the orchestral concert suite made of the Arnold film score by Christopher Palmer published by Novello &amp; Co in London.

On account of the movie, the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; is often miscredited as the &quot;River Kwai March&quot;. While Arnold did use &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; in his score for the movie, it was only the first theme and a bit of the second theme of &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot;, whistled unaccompanied by the British prisoners several times as they marched into the prison camp. The British actor Percy Herbert, who appeared in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, suggested the use of the song in the movie. According to Kevin Brownlow&#x27;s interviews with the film&#x27;s director David Lean, it was actually Lean who knew of the song and fought during the screenwriting process to have it whistled by the troops. He realized it had to be whistled rather than sung because the World War II-era lyrics (see &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot;) were racy and would not get past the censors. Percy Herbert was used as a consultant on the film because he had first-hand experience of Japanese POW camps; he was paid an extra £5 per week by Lean.

Since the movie depicted prisoners of war held under inhumane conditions by the Japanese, Canadian officials were embarrassed in May 1980, when a military band played &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; during a visit to Ottawa by Japanese prime minister Masayoshi Ōhira.

== &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967) ==
S.D. Burman used this composition in the 1967 Hindi spy thriller heist film &quot;Jewel Thief&quot;. The opening lines of &quot;Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechaara&quot; draw inspiration from the marching song.

<text>Imre Nagy ( ; ; 7 June 1896 – 16 June 1958) was a Hungarian communist politician who served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (&quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister) of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 Nagy became leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the Soviet-backed government, for which he was sentenced to death and executed two years later. He was not related to previous agrarianist Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy.

Born to a peasant family, Nagy was apprenticed as a locksmith before being drafted in World War I. Nagy was a committed communist from soon after the Russian Revolution, and through the 1920s he engaged in underground party activity in Hungary. Living in the Soviet Union from 1930, he served the Soviet NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941. Nagy returned to Hungary shortly before the end of World War II, and served in various offices as the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP) took control of Hungary in the late 1940s and the country entered the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1944 and 1945, he was Hungary&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture, where he carried out land divisions that won him widespread popularity among the peasantry. He served as Interior Minister of Hungary from 1945 to 1946. Nagy became prime minister in 1953 and attempted to relax some of the harshest aspects of Mátyás Rákosi&#x27;s Stalinist regime, but was subverted and eventually forced out of the government in 1955 by Rákosi&#x27;s continuing influence as General Secretary of the MDP. Nagy remained popular with writers, intellectuals, and the common people, who saw him as an icon of reform against the hard-line elements in the Soviet-backed regime.

The outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 23 October 1956 saw Nagy elevated to the position of Prime Minister on 24 October as a central demand of the revolutionaries and common people. Nagy&#x27;s reformist faction gained full control of the government, admitted non-communist politicians, dissolved the ÁVH secret police, promised democratic reforms, and unilaterally withdrew Hungary from the Warsaw Pact on 1 November. The Soviet Union launched a massive military invasion of Hungary on 4 November, forcibly deposing Nagy, who fled to the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Budapest. Nagy was lured out of the embassy under false promises on 22 November and was arrested and deported to Romania. On 16 June 1958, Nagy was tried and executed for treason alongside his closest allies, and his body was buried in an unmarked grave.

In June 1989, Nagy and other prominent figures of the 1956 Revolution were rehabilitated and reburied with full honours, an event that played a key role in the collapse of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party regime.

==Early life and World War I==
Imre Nagy was born prematurely on 7 June 1896 in the town of Kaposvár in the Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary, to a small-town family of peasant origin. His father, József Nagy (1869–1929), was a Lutheran and a carriage driver for the lieutenant-general of Somogy county. His mother, Rozália Szabó (1877–1969), served as a maid for the lieutenant-general&#x27;s wife. They both had left the countryside in their youth to work in Kaposvár. Nagy and Szabó married in January 1896. In 1902, József became a postal worker and began building a house for the family in 1907 but lost his job in 1911 and had to sell the house. He was an unskilled worker for the rest of his life.

In 1904 Nagy&#x27;s family moved to Pécs before returning to Kaposvár the following year. Nagy attended a gymnasium in Kaposvár from 1907 to 1912, performing poorly. The gymnasium cancelled his tuition due to his lack of accomplishment and funding. He apprenticed as a locksmith in a small metalworking firm in Kaposvár, before moving to a factory for agricultural machinery in Losonc in northern Hungary in 1912. He returned to Kaposvár in 1913 and was given a journeyman&#x27;s certificate as a metal fitter in 1914. He abandoned the job in the summer of 1914 and became a clerk at a lawyer&#x27;s office, while simultaneously attending a commercial high school in Kaposvár, where his student performance was good.

After the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Nagy was called up for military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in December 1914 and found fit for service. He reported for duty at the 17th Royal Hungarian Honvéd Infantry Regiment in May 1915, after the end of the school year and before he had graduated. After three months of basic training in Székesfehérvár, his unit was sent to the Italian Front in August 1915, where he was wounded in his leg at the Third Battle of the Isonzo. After convalescing in a field hospital, he was trained as a machine gunner in the 19th Machine Gun Battalion, promoted to corporal and sent to the Eastern Front in the summer of 1916.

Nagy was wounded in the leg by shrapnel and taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army during the Brusilov Offensive in Galicia on 29 July 1916. After healing his leg wound in a field hospital, he was taken first to Darnitsa, then to Ryazan and finally on a train transport to Siberia.

==Early political career==
In captivity in Camp Berezovka near Lake Baikal in Siberia he participated in a Marxist discussion group until 1917. In 1918, he joined the Communist (Social Democratic) Party of the Foreign Workers of Siberia, a sub-group of the Russian Communist Party. He fought in the ranks of the Red Army from February to September 1918 during the Russian Civil War. Some sources, including the so-called &quot;Yurovsky Document&quot; allege Nagy and his unit were tasked with guarding the former Russian Imperial Family in Yekaterinburg. Though some historians have speculated Nagy himself was among the men in the firing squad that executed the Romanovs, Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Ural State University, stated per his research that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, Grigory Nikulin, Mikhail Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, Stepan Vaganov, Alexey Kabanov, Pavel Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. The White Army investigator Nikolai Sokolov claimed that the execution of the Imperial Family was carried out by a group of &quot;Latvians led by a Jew&quot;. However, in light of Plotnikov&#x27;s research, the group that carried out the execution consisted almost entirely of ethnic Russians (Nikulin, Kudrin, Ermakov, Vaganov, Kabanov, Medvedev and Netrebin) with the participation of one Jew (Yurovsky) and possibly, one Latvian (Tselms). Allegations of Nagy&#x27;s presence at the Ipatiev House remains a controversial matter among biographers, and has contributed to his divisive legacy in modern Hungary.

Nagy and his unit were later encircled and he was ultimately taken prisoner by the Czechoslovak Legion in early September 1918. He escaped captivity and spent the period until February 1920 holding odd jobs in White-controlled territory near Lake Baikal. The Red Army reached Irkutsk on 7 February 1920, ending Nagy&#x27;s participation in the Civil War. On 12 February 1920 he became a candidate member of the Russian Communist Party and a full-time member on 10 May. He served the rest of 1920 as a clerk for the communist Cheka secret police on matters related to prisoners of war.

After a month of training by the Cheka in subversive activities, the Hungarian Communist Party (KMP) sent Nagy along with 277 other Hungarian communists to Hungary in April 1921 to build up an underground conspiratorial network in a country where the Communist Party had been banned since 1919. Nagy reached Kaposvár in late May 1921. Upon arrival, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP). After working temporary jobs in the rest of 1921 and early 1922, he joined the First Hungarian Insurance Company and became an office worker in Kaposvár. He became severely overweight around this time. He helped to build up the socialist movement in his hometown, to his parents&#x27; disapproval. He became secretary of the MSZDP&#x27;s local branch in 1924. He was expelled from the party for advocating revolution and was placed under police surveillance. He married Mária Égető on November 28, 1925.
In January 1926, Nagy and István Sinkovics established the Kaposvár office of the Socialist Workers’ Party of Hungary (MSZMP), a semi-communist left-wing splinter group from the MSZDP. Nagy was successful in gaining 700 voters for the MSZMP Kaposvár parliamentary candidate, one of the party&#x27;s few successes in the countryside west of Budapest. By this time Nagy had begun to prioritize his interest in agriculture over political leadership and rejected an offer from communist cadres from Vienna to build up the illegal KMP in western Hungary. The MSZMP in Kaposvár was prohibited and Nagy was fired from his insurance job in February 1927 and arrested on 27 February. He was released after two months in prison. While under police surveillance, Nagy found a job as an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company. He was arrested again in December 1927 for three days and was called to Vienna by the KMP, arriving in March 1928. He became head of the KMP&#x27;s agrarian section and was sent back to Hungary in September 1928 under a false identity to build up underground communist networks. His efforts were largely a failure, his largest successes being the publishing of three issues of a small journal and his avoidance of arrest. His advocacy of legal political activity over the party&#x27;s preference for largely impotent clandestine work in villages was dismissed as &quot;right-deviancy&quot; by the ultra-left KMP leadership.

==Years in Moscow==
In December 1929, he traveled to the Soviet Union, arriving in Moscow in February 1930 to participate in the KMP&#x27;s second congress. He rejoined the Communist Party, also becoming a Soviet citizen. He was engaged in agricultural research at the International Agrarian Institute for six years, but also worked in the Hungarian section of the Comintern. He was expelled from the party on 8 January 1936 and worked for the Soviet Statistical Service from the summer of 1936 onward. Under the codename &quot;Volodia&quot;, Nagy served the NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941. The NKVD praised him as a &quot;qualified agent, who shows great initiative and an ability to approach people&quot;. The support that Nagy received from the Soviet leadership after the Second World War was to some extent a result of his loyal service as a foreigner and denouncer to the NKVD.

==Minister in Communist Hungary==

After the Second World War, Nagy returned to Hungary. He was the Minister of Agriculture in the government of Béla Miklós de Dálnok, delegated by the Hungarian Communist Party. He distributed land among the peasant population. In the next government, led by Tildy, he was the Minister of Interior. At this period he played an active role in the expulsion of the Hungarian Germans.

In the communist government, he served as Minister of Agriculture and in other posts. He was also Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from 1947 to 1949, a largely ceremonial position. In 1951, he signed, with the rest of the Politburo, the note ordering János Kádár&#x27;s arrest, resulting in Kádár&#x27;s sentencing to life in prison after a show trial.

After two years as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (1953–1955), during which he promoted his &quot;New Course&quot; in Socialism, Nagy fell out of favour with the Soviet Politburo. He was deprived of his Hungarian Central Committee, Politburo, and all other Party functions and, on 18 April 1955, he was sacked as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

==1956 Revolution==
Following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; denouncing the crimes of Stalin on 25 February 1956, dissent began to grow in Eastern Bloc against the ruling Stalinist-era party leaders. In Hungary, Mátyás Rákosi—who self-styled as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s greatest disciple&quot;—came under increasingly intense criticism for his policies from both the Party and general populace, with more and more prominent voices calling for his resignation. This public criticism often took the form of the Petőfi Circle—a debating club established by the DISZ student youth union to discuss Communist policy—which soon became one of the foremost outlets of dissent against the regime. While Nagy himself never attended a Petőfi Circle meeting, he was kept well informed of events by his close associates Miklós Vásárhelyi and Géza Losonczy, who informed him of the vast popular support expressed for him at the meetings and the widespread desire for his restoration to the leadership.

In the face of widespread public pressure on Rákosi, the Soviets forced the unpopular leader to resign from power on 18 July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union. However, they replaced him with his equally hard-line second in command Ernő Gerő, a change which did little to mollify public dissent. Nagy was a prominent guest at the 6 October reburial of former secret police chief László Rajk, who had been purged by the Rákosi regime and later rehabilitated. He was readmitted to the Party on 13 October in the midst of growing revolutionary fervor. On 22 October, students from the Technical University in Budapest compiled a list of sixteen national policy demands, the third of which was Nagy&#x27;s restoration to the premiership.

In the afternoon of 23 October, students and workers gathered in Budapest for a massive opposition demonstration arranged by the Technical University students, chanting—among other things—slogans of support for Imre Nagy. While the ex-premier sympathized with their reformist demands, he was hesitant to support the movement, believing it to be too radical in its demands. While he was in favor of changes to the system, he preferred those to be made within the framework of his &quot;New Course&quot; of 1953–55 and not a revolutionary upheaval. He also feared that the demonstration was a provocation by Gerő and Hegedüs to frame him as inciting rebellion and to crack down on the opposition.

His associates ultimately convinced him to travel to the Parliament Building and give a speech to the demonstrators to calm the unrest. While no accurate record of this speech exists, it did not have its intended effect; Nagy essentially told the protesters to go home and let the Party handle things. The demonstrations soon escalated into a full-scale revolt as ÁVH secret policemen opened fire on the protesting citizens. Hungarian soldiers sent to crush the demonstrators instead sided with them, and Gerő soon called in Soviet intervention.

Early in the morning of 24 October, Nagy was renamed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic again, in an attempt to appease the populace. However, he was initially isolated within the government, and powerless to stop the Soviet invasion of the capital that day. The decision to call in Soviet forces had already been made by Gerő and outgoing Prime Minister András Hegedüs the previous night, but many suspected that Nagy had signed the order. This perception was not helped by the fact that Nagy declared martial law on that same day and offered an &quot;amnesty&quot; to all rebels who laid down their arms, weakening the public&#x27;s trust in him. The next day (25 October) he announced he would begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops after order was restored. On 26 October, he began to meet with delegations from the Writers&#x27; Union and student groups, as well as from the Borsod Workers&#x27; Council in Miskolc.

On 27 October, Nagy announced a major reformation of his government, to include several non-communist politicians including former president Zoltán Tildy as a Minister of State. At negotiations with Soviet representatives Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov, Nagy and the Hungarian government delegation pushed for a ceasefire and political solution.

In the morning of 28 October, Nagy successfully prevented a massive attack on the main rebel strongholds at the Corvin Cinema and Kilián Barracks by Soviet troops and pro-regime Hungarian units. He negotiated a ceasefire with the Soviets, which came into effect at 12:15 and fighting began to die down across the city and country. Later that day, he gave a speech on the radio assessing the events as a &quot;national democratic movement,&quot; proclaiming his full support of the Revolution and agreeing to fulfill some of the public&#x27;s demands. He announced the dissolution of the ÁVH and his intention to negotiate the full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the city. Nagy also supported the creation of a National Guard, a force of combined soldiers and armed civilians to maintain order amidst the chaos of the Revolution.

On 29 October, as fighting died down across Budapest and Soviet troops began to withdraw, Nagy moved his office from the Party headquarters to the Parliament Building. He also began to meet and negotiated with several representatives of the armed groups that day, as well as the representatives of the workers&#x27; councils that had been formed over the course of the previous week.

By 30 October, Nagy&#x27;s reformist faction had gained full control of the Hungarian government. Ernő Gerő and the other Stalinist hard-liners had left for the Soviet Union, and Nagy&#x27;s government announced its intent to restore a multi-party system based on the coalition parties from 1945. Throughout this period, Nagy remained steadfastly committed to Marxism; but his conception of Marxism was as &quot;a science that cannot remain static&quot;, and he railed against the &quot;rigid dogmatism&quot; of &quot;the Stalinist monopoly&quot;. He did not intend a full return to multi-party liberal democracy but a limited one within a socialist framework, and was willing to allow the function of the pre-1948 coalition parties.

Nagy was appointed to the temporary leadership committee of the newly formed Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, which replaced the disintegrated Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party on 31 October. This was originally intended as a &quot;national communist&quot; party that would preserve the gains of the Revolution. However, at a meeting of the Soviet Politburo that day, the Kremlin leaders decided that the Revolution had gone too far and needed to be crushed. On the night of 31 October – 1 November, Soviet troops began crossing back into Hungary, contrary to their declaration of 30 October expressing willingness to withdraw from the country entirely. Nagy protested this action to Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov; the latter replied that the new troops were only there to cover the full withdrawal and protect Soviet citizens living in Hungary. This likely prompted Nagy to make his most controversial decision. In response to a major demand of the revolutionaries, he announced Hungary&#x27;s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and appealed through the UN for the great powers, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, to recognise Hungary&#x27;s status as a neutral state. Late that night, General Secretary János Kádár went to the Soviet embassy, and the next day he was taken to Moscow.

Between 1–3 November, Nikita Khrushchev traveled to various Warsaw Pact countries as well as to Yugoslavia to inform them of his plans to attack Hungary. On the advice of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, he selected the then-Party General Secretary János Kádár as the country&#x27;s new leader on 2 November, and was willing to let Nagy remain in the government if he cooperated. On 3 November, Nagy formed a new government, this time with a Communist minority. It included members of the Communists, Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party, Peasants&#x27; Party, and Social Democrats. However, it would only be in office for less than a day.

In the early morning hours of 4 November, the USSR launched &quot;Operation Whirlwind,&quot; a massive military attack on Budapest and on rebel strongholds throughout the country. Nagy made a dramatic announcement to the country and the world about this operation. However, to minimize damage he ordered the Hungarian Army not to resist the invaders. Soon after, he fled to the Yugoslav Embassy, where he and many of his followers were given sanctuary.

In spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by János Kádár, on 22 November, Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy and taken to Snagov, Romania.

==Secret trial and execution==

Subsequently, the Soviets returned Nagy to Hungary, where he was secretly charged with organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic and with treason. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. His trial and execution were made public only after the sentence had been carried out. According to Fedor Burlatsky, a Kremlin insider, Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed, &quot;as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries&quot;. American journalist John Gunther described the events leading to Nagy&#x27;s death as &quot;an episode of unparalleled infamy&quot;.

Nagy was buried, along with his co-defendants, in the prison yard where the executions were carried out and years later was removed to a distant corner (section 301) of the New Public Cemetery, Budapest, face-down, and with his hands and feet tied with barbed wire. Next to his grave stands a memorial bell inscribed in Latin, Hungarian, German and English. The Latin reads: &quot;Vivos voco / Mortuos plango / Fulgura frango&quot;, which is translated as: &quot;I call the living, I mourn the dead, I break the thunderbolts&quot;.

==Memorials and political rehabilitation==

During the time when the Stalinist leadership of Hungary would not permit Nagy&#x27;s death to be commemorated, or permit access to his burial place, a cenotaph in his honour was erected in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 16 June 1988.

In 1989, Imre Nagy was rehabilitated and his remains reburied on the 31st anniversary of his execution in the same plot after a funeral organised in part by the democratic opposition to the country&#x27;s Stalinist regime. Over 200,000 people are estimated to have attended Nagy&#x27;s reinterment. The occasion of Nagy&#x27;s funeral was an important factor in the end of the communist government in Hungary.

On 28 December 2018 a popular statue of Nagy, inaugurated in 1996, was removed from central Budapest to a less central location, in order to make way for a reconstructed memorial to the victims of the 1919 Red Terror that originally stood in the same place from 1934 to 1945, during Miklós Horthy&#x27;s pro-Nazi regime. Opposition parties, mainly liberal, socialist and the remaining communists, accused Viktor Orbán&#x27;s right-wing government of historical revisionism; his supporters, however, argued that the initiative was taken as an attempt to restore the city landscape to its pre–World War II form and to &quot;erase the traces of the communist era&quot;.

==Writings==
Nagy&#x27;s collected writings, most of which he wrote after his dismissal as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1955, were smuggled out of Hungary and published in the West in 1957 under the title &quot;On Communism: In Defense of the New Course&quot;.

==Family==
Nagy was married to Mária Égető. The couple had one daughter, Erzsébet Nagy (1927–2008), a Hungarian writer and translator. Erzsébet Nagy married Ferenc Jánosi. Imre Nagy did not object to his daughter&#x27;s romance and eventual marriage to a Protestant minister, attending their religious wedding ceremony in 1946 without Politburo permission. In 1982, Erzsébet Nagy married János Vészi.

<text>Cop Rock is an American police procedural musical television series created by Steven Bochco and William M. Finkelstein for the American Broadcasting Company. It premiered on September 26, 1990, and broadcast eleven episodes before concluding on December 26. It was both a critical and commercial failure.

In its main storyline, Captain John Hollander (Larry Joshua) investigates the involvement of Detective Vincent LaRusso (Peter Onorati) in the execution of murder suspect Tyrone Weeks (Art Kimbro). Subplots include Detective Ralph Ruskin&#x27;s (Ron McLarty) growing jealousy of his wife Officer Vicki Quinn (Anne Bobby), and her friendship with Officer Andy Campo (David Gianopoulos); Quinn helping drug addict Patricia Spence (Kathleen Wilhoite) recover her baby which Spence had sold for $200; and the relationship between corrupt Mayor Louise Plank (Barbara Bosson) and Chief Roger Kendrick (Ronny Cox).

=== Development ===

In the early 1980s, a Broadway producer offered Steven Bochco a proposal to convert his series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; into a musical. As the plan was not practical, the proposal was declined, but Bochco kept the idea in mind and thought about doing the opposite instead, converting a Broadway show into a police procedural television series. In 1987, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) gave Bochco a production commitment for ten of his future shows, and wanting to experiment, he developed &quot;Cop Rock&quot; as a &quot;bold and adventurous&quot; idea. The head of ABC Entertainment at the time, Bob Iger, was one of the only people willing to give him a chance, allowing the creation of the series. On the opportunity, James McDaniel stated that, &quot;the media said it was impossible and that it was ridiculous, but nothing&#x27;s impossible and ridiculous if you have the right pieces in place.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Over 200 people auditioned for &quot;Cop Rock&quot;; Peter Onorati, who portrays Detective Vincent LaRusso, was introduced to the series by his wife after she talked with Howard McGillin, who had also auditioned. Jokingly stating that he had experience singing at weddings, Onorati&#x27;s agent, Kay Liberman, set up an audition, where Onorati performed Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;.

One of the only actors with singing experience, Teri Austin graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and performed &quot;Lover Man&quot; and &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; at her audition. Kathleen Wilhoite, who portrays Patricia Spence, had a record deal at the time, and decided to audition with &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;, finding her casting as a &quot;good gig for me, because singing is kind of my thing&quot;. McDaniel, on the other hand, turned down an offer to join the series but changed his mind after finding out it was created by Bochco, who he had worked with on the last season of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

Mick Murray was searching for an acting job in New York and was going through multiple pilots from ABC before hearing about &quot;Cop Rock&quot; and Bochco&#x27;s involvement. At his audition, the casting director was Alexa Fogel, who was not of fan of his following a failed audition for the film &quot;Young Guns&quot;. As a result, Murray decided to perform a cappella by Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, which Fogel responded to with &quot;the warmest smile&quot;. At night, Murray received a phone call from his agent and was told that the production crew had expanded a small role for him so he could join as a series regular.

Larry Joshua brought his own guitar to his audition and performed &quot;When She Wants Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye&quot;. During this time, David Gianopoulos heard about the series after running into Joshua near 42nd Street. Revealing to his agent that he had been secretly singing in several bands for over six years, Gianopoulos auditioned with Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot; at Lincoln Center, where several other cast members also had their auditions. Originally, Gianopoulos had auditioned for the role of LaRusso before being told by Bochco to audition for the role of Officer Andy Campo. The following day, he performed Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; and received the part.

Ronny Cox was told by pilot director Gregory Hoblit that he would get the role of Chief Roger Kendrick whether or not he could sing. Broadway performer Anne Bobby, however, had to audition, doing so on a Saturday where she said she saw her friend Jane Krakowski. Furthermore, Paul McCrane was told by Hoblit and Bochco that they did not have a part for him at the moment and reassured him that they would write a new character once the show entered production; McCrane was later cast as Detective Bob McIntire.

== Reception ==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 53% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.33/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Cop Rock&quot;″s ambition to innovate the police procedural is admirable, but the contrast of grit and glam proves too jarring with unmemorable music throwing the series&#x27; more promising dramatic beats askew.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The show was a critical and commercial failure and was canceled by ABC after 11 episodes. The combination of a fusion of musical performances with serious police drama and dark humor with its high-powered production talent, made it infamous as one of the biggest television failures of the 1990s. &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot; ranked it #8 on its List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list in 2002 and dubbed it &quot;the single most bizarre TV musical of all time&quot;.

Despite an overwhelmingly negative reception and short run, the series has been rebroadcast in later years, with VH1 and A&amp;E Network airing it on separate occasions later in the 1990s, and Trio in the 2000s.

== Home media ==
On May 17, 2016, Shout! Factory released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.

== Awards and nominations ==
== International broadcasts ==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Cop Rock&quot; was televised on BBC1 and premiered on Monday 30 September 1991. The show premiered on Australian television via the Ten Network on Thursday 23 January 1992 at 11:00 PM.

<text>The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast television and radio network that serves as the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of the Walt Disney Company. ABC is headquartered on Riverside Drive in Burbank, California, directly across the street from Walt Disney Studios and adjacent to the Team Disney – Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network maintains secondary offices at 77 West 66th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, which houses its broadcast center and the headquarters of its news division, ABC News.

Since 2007, when ABC Radio (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. The youngest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; American television networks, the network is sometimes referred to as the Alphabet Network, as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet in order.

ABC launched as a radio network in 1943, as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC, as well as the lesser-known DuMont. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres (UPT), a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the then-new television network profitable by helping to develop and green-light many successful television series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network&#x27;s corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several television and radio stations and print publications, to form Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which in turn merged into Disney in 1996.

ABC has eight owned-and-operated and more than 230 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the Canada–United States border, although most of its prime time programming is subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to protect rights held by domestically based networks. ABC News provides news and feature content for select radio stations owned by Cumulus Media, as these stations are former ABC Radio properties.

==History==

In 1927, NBC operated a radio network called the NBC Blue Network. It became an independent radio (and eventually television) network known as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1943. ABC later joined United Paramount Theatres forming American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (later American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.).

After its venture into radio and television throughout the 1960s and 1970s and the purchase of ESPN in 1982, the company was acquired and merged with Capital Cities, forming Capital Cities/ABC in 1986. The company was sold to the Walt Disney Company in 1995.

==Programming==
The ABC television network currently provides an average of 89 hours of network programming each week. It also offers 22 hours of prime-time programming to affiliated stations from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday (Eastern and Pacific Time) and 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Sundays.

Daytime programming is also provided from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific weekdays (subtract 1 hour for all other time zones) (with a one-hour break at 12:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, locally produced programming or syndicated programs) featuring the talk-lifestyle shows &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;GMA3: What You Need to Know&quot;, and the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In addition, ABC News programming includes &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. weekdays and Saturdays (along with one-hour Sunday editions), nightly editions of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program&#x27;s timeslot), the Sunday political talk show &quot;This Week&quot;, early morning news programs &quot;World News Now&quot; and &quot;America This Morning&quot; and the late-night newsmagazine &quot;Nightline&quot;. Late nights feature the weeknight talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

The network&#x27;s three-hour Weekend morning children&#x27;s programming timeslot is programmed by syndication distributor Litton Entertainment, which produces &quot;Litton&#x27;s Weekend Adventure&quot; under an arrangement in which the programming block is syndicated exclusively to ABC owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than being leased out directly by the network to Litton.

===Daytime===

ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule currently features the talk show &quot;The View&quot;, news show &quot;GMA3&quot;, and the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Originally premiering in 1963, &quot;General Hospital&quot; is ABC&#x27;s longest-running entertainment program.

In addition to the long-running &quot;All My Children&quot; (1970–2011) and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;Loving&quot;, &quot;The City&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;. ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter &amp; Gamble-produced soap &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired several game shows, including &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Split Second&quot;, &quot;The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;The Better Sex&quot;, &quot;Trivia Trap&quot;, &quot;All-Star Blitz&quot; and &quot;Hot Streak&quot;.

=== Sports ===

Sports programming is provided on occasion, primarily on weekend afternoons and Saturday evenings. In 2006, the ABC Sports division was shut down, with all sports telecasts on ABC since then being produced in association with sister cable network ESPN under the branding ESPN on ABC. General industry trends and changes in rights have prompted reductions in sports on broadcast television, with Disney preferring to schedule the majority of its sports rights on the networks of ESPN (until 2020). Since 2020 ESPN has prioritized ABC with airings of its sports telecasts with occasional simulcasts and exclusive games of ESPN &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts on ABC.

Since 2006, ABC has at least aired ten weeks of primetime sports programming, and since 2020 has aired sports programming almost every week from September to May each year (with primetime encores and movies airing the remainder of the year).

ABC is the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Basketball Association (NBA), with its package (under the &quot;NBA on ESPN&quot; branding) traditionally beginning with its Christmas Day games, followed by a series of Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games through the remainder of the season, weekend playoff games, and all games of the NBA Finals. ABC is also the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Hockey League (NHL), with its package (under the &quot;NHL on ESPN&quot; branding). In this deal, ABC broadcasts at least 10 regular season games (mostly afternoon), the NHL All-Star Game, the NHL Stadium Series, and four Stanley Cup Finals. During college football season, ABC typically carries an afternoon doubleheader on Saturdays, along with the primetime &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot;. ABC also airs coverage of selected bowl games, ABC is also the secondary broadcast partner of Major League Baseball (MLB) with the network at least airing wild card series games since 2020 (except for 2021) and select Sunday Night Baseball games by sister network ESPN. Beginning in the 2015 NFL season, ESPN agreed to begin simulcasting/exclusively airing NFL games on ABC. Thus, ABC is the only major broadcast network that carries games from all of the traditional &quot;big four&quot; sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL).

During the late winter months, ABC airs both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college basketball games on weekend afternoons. In the spring and summer months, ABC also airs games (usually on weekends) from the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), and is the broadcast home of the X Games and Little League World Series.

In 2015, ESPN&#x27;s annual ESPY Awards presentation moved to ABC from ESPN. Bolstered by Caitlyn Jenner accepting the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the ceremony, the 2015 ESPY Awards&#x27; viewership was roughly tripled over the 2014 ceremony on ESPN.

After the NFL signed a new contract with the Walt Disney Company, ABC will air Super Bowl LXI in 2027 and Super Bowl LXV in 2031. The network has not aired a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006.

===Specials===
ABC currently holds the broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards, and the Country Music Association Awards. ABC has also aired the Miss America competition from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2004, and 2011 to 2018.

From February 2001 to February 14, 2020, ABC held the television rights to most of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (other &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials broadcast annually by ABC, in addition to &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, include &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!&quot;, &quot;The Mayflower Voyagers&quot;, &quot;A Charlie Brown Valentine&quot;, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Christmas Tales&quot; and &quot;I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown&quot;). ABC also broadcasts the annual &quot;Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade&quot; special on Christmas morning.

Since 1974, ABC has generally aired &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; – a New Year&#x27;s Eve special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York&#x27;s Times Square. ABC is also among the broadcasters of the Tournament of Roses Parade (although as mentioned, the Rose Bowl Game now airs exclusively on ESPN as a College Football Playoff &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowl).

===Programming library===
ABC owns nearly all of its in-house television and theatrical productions made since the 1970s, except certain co-productions (for example, &quot;The Commish&quot; is now owned by the estate of its producer, Stephen Cannell). Worldwide video rights are currently owned by various companies, for example, Kino Lorber owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser-known live-action films from Disney&#x27;s library, mostly from Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures and 20th Century Studios).

When the FCC imposed its Financial Interest and Syndication Rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network&#x27;s catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Media Ventures (formerly CBS Television Distribution), a unit of Paramount Global, which owns the competitor CBS. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System (now a part of Warner Bros. parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) in 1991. With Disney&#x27;s 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.

Also part of the library are most films in the David O. Selznick library, productions from their previous motion picture divisions ABC Pictures International, Selmur Productions, and Palomar Pictures International (before its takeover by Bristol-Myers-Squibb) released by Cinerama Productions (films produced by the company themselves are now under the control of Pacific Theatres), their later theatrical division ABC Motion Pictures, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, ABC News productions, and series from Disney Television Studios (ABC Signature and 20th Television). Disney–ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television and 20th Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney–ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.

==Stations==

Since its inception, ABC has had over 300 television stations that have carried programming from the network at various times throughout its history, including its first two owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, founding O&amp;O WABC-TV and inaugural affiliate WPVI-TV. , ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda, and Saba. This makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by the total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set).

Currently, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Delaware are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&amp;O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&amp;O WPVI-TV in the south, Rhode Island is served by New Bedford, Massachusetts-licensed WLNE, though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in Providence, and Delaware is served by WPVI in the northern two thirds and Salisbury, Maryland, affiliate WMDT in the southern third of the state). ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Birmingham, Alabama (WBMA-LD), Lima, Ohio (WPNM-LD) and South Bend, Indiana (WBND-LD). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.

The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned-and-operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Boston, Massachusetts (WCVB-TV and WMUR-TV), Lincoln, Nebraska (KLKN and KHGI-TV), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV). KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, which Nielsen designates as a separate market from Kansas City, despite a mere distance between the two cities and the Kansas City-based stations (including KMBC) providing better city-grade to Grade B coverage to the area compared to the signals of the primary ABC affiliates in the other aforementioned dual-affiliate markets. (KQTV was St. Joseph&#x27;s lone major network affiliate until 2011, when locally based News-Press &amp; Gazette Company began establishing low-power affiliates of ABC&#x27;s four English-language competitors and Telemundo on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph&#x27;s dependence on Kansas City.) WWSB, KHGI, and WOTV, meanwhile, serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market&#x27;s primary ABC affiliate. (Of note, ABC initially affiliated with WWSB to cover southern portions of the Tampa–St. Petersburg market—including WWSB&#x27;s city of license, Sarasota—as the transmitters of WTSP, the market&#x27;s former primary ABC affiliate from 1965 to 1994, and Miami affiliate WPLG had been short-spaced to avoid interference between their respective analog-VHF channel 10 signals, WWSB remained an ABC affiliate after its Tampa affiliation moved from WTSP to WFTS in December 1994, even though WFTS&#x27;s signal reaches Sarasota and some surrounding areas.) WCVB-TV is licensed to Boston while WMUR-TV is licensed to Manchester, New Hampshire (which is officially part of the Boston market). WCVB is easily receivable in Manchester with a good antenna as well as having its news department that covers New Hampshire; it is the only station licensed to the state that does such. Both WCVB and WMUR are owned by Hearst Television.

The Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two subchannel-only affiliates. Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market, which serves as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW, owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings). The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit and Denver), and through its ownership of Phoenix affiliate KNXV, Las Vegas affiliate KTNV-TV and Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV, it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of Arizona (outside the Yuma-El Centro market) and Southern Nevada. Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, San Diego, Bakersfield, California, and Boise, Idaho, and when combined with the ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles, Fresno, and San Francisco, the affiliations from the News-Press &amp; Gazette Company in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, Yuma-El Centro, and Colorado Springs-Pueblo, and Sinclair&#x27;s affiliations in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.

==Facilities and studios==
All of ABC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as ABC Studios in February 2007 and later renamed to its current name ABC Signature in August 2020. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California, shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999, and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.

In addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as &#x27;Burbank Center&#x27;, which is primarily associated with Walt Disney Television and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FX, National Geographic, and Radio Disney. Additionally, Disney Television Animation has a facility on Empire Avenue near the Hollywood Burbank Airport. In nearby Glendale, Disney/ABC also maintains the Grand Central Creative Campus, which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.

ABC owns several facilities in New York, grouped mainly on West 66th Street, with the main set of facilities on the corner of Columbus Avenue. These facilities occupy a combined across two blocks with a total area of . This main set of buildings includes:
* 77 West 66th Street, a 22-story building built in 1988 on a plot;
* A pair of buildings at 147–155 Columbus Avenue (ten and seven stories) connected by glass bays, constructed on a plot;
* 30 West 67th Street, a 15-story building with a facade on 67th Street on a plot;
* 56 West 66th Street, the former First Battery Armory of the New York National Guard, a five-story building on a plot.
ABC also owns 7, 17 and 47 West 66th Street, three buildings on a plot. The block of West 66th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, which houses the ABC News building, was renamed Peter Jennings Way in 2006 in honor of the then-recently deceased news anchor.

Disney formerly leased at 157 Columbus Avenue, on the northern side of 67th Street.

ABC also owns the Times Square Studios at 1500 Broadway, on land owned by a development fund for the 42nd Street Project. Opened in 1999, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; is broadcast from this facility. ABC News has premises on West 66th Street, in a six-story building occupying a plot at 121–135 West End Avenue.

On July 9, 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced that it was selling its two West 66th Street campuses (except for the National Guard Amory) to Silverstein Properties and purchasing one square block of property in lower Manhattan to build a new New York-based broadcast center.

===Video-on-demand services===

ABC maintains several video-on-demand (VOD) services for delayed viewing of the network&#x27;s programming, including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers. The Walt Disney Company is also a part-owner of Hulu, and has offered full-length episodes of most of ABC&#x27;s programming through this streaming service since July 6, 2009.

In May 2013, ABC launched &quot;WatchABC&quot;, a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network&#x27;s existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers. This service provides full-length episodes of ABC programs and live streams of local affiliates in select markets (this was the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network). Live streams are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers. WABC-TV New York and WPVI-TV Philadelphia were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service, with the six remaining ABC O&amp;Os offering streams by the start of the 2013–14 season. Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates on the service, though these stations are only available for live-streaming for DirecTV subscribers.

In November 2015, it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service, internally codenamed ABC3. In July 2016, ABC re-launched its streaming platforms, dropping the WatchABC brand, adding a streaming library of 38 classic ABC series, and introducing 7 original short-form series under the blanket branding ABCd.

The most recent episodes of the network&#x27;s shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu, and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand disallows fast forwarding of accessed content.

In 2021, ABC updated the app to allow app users to watch shows from ABC&#x27;s sister networks: Freeform, FX, and National Geographic. Free ad-supported streaming television channels were added to the ABC app in 2022 and 2023, including a 24-hour version of ESPN8 The Ocho and a seasonal channel dedicated to Freeform&#x27;s 25 Days of Christmas original content.

On August 23, 2024, it was announced on the network&#x27;s website that the ABC app would be shut down a month later, on September 23. It was later reported that it would be shut down along with all of Disney&#x27;s other TV Everywhere apps, including those of ABC&#x27;s sister networks, except for ESPN&#x27;s. However, the websites belonging to said networks will still operate after September 23, and users will still be able to log in with their TV providers to watch full episodes.

===ABC HD===

ABC&#x27;s master feed is transmitted in 720p high-definition, the native resolution format for the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s American television properties. However, most of Hearst Television&#x27;s ABC-affiliated stations and some of Tegna&#x27;s ABC affiliates transmit the network&#x27;s programming in 1080i, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD. Although ABC has not fully transitioned to 1080p or ultra HD, some stations such as ABC affiliate station KNXV-TV in Phoenix, Arizona, transmit the network&#x27;s programming at 1080p via an ATSC 3.0 multiplex stations, such as KASW with KNXV-TV.

ABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September 16, 2001, at the start of the 2001–02 season, with its scripted prime-time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format, the simulcast feed was launched first on ABC&#x27;s owned television stations that same date with many major affiliates following after that. Both new and returning scripted series were broadcast in high definition. In 2011, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; was the last program on the network&#x27;s schedule that was broadcast in 4:3 standard definition. All of the network&#x27;s new programming has been presented in HD since January 2012. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning educational and informative (E/I) block &quot;Litton&#x27;s Weekend Adventure&quot; was the first children&#x27;s program block on U.S. network television to feature programs available in HD upon its September 2011 debut. The HD programming is broadcast in 5.1 surround sound.

On September 1, 2016, ABC began to use 16:9 framing for its most graphical imaging (primarily the network&#x27;s bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the bottom line and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory widescreen format, either in high definition or standard definition. With this change, some programs also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio.

==Visual identity==

The ABC logo has evolved many times since the network&#x27;s creation in 1943. The network&#x27;s first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, with a vertical &quot;ABC&quot; microphone in the center, referencing the network&#x27;s roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the FCC seal, with the letters &quot;ABC&quot; enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by a bald eagle. In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase &quot;abc&quot; in the center of a large lowercase letter &quot;a&quot;, a design known as the ABC Circle A. 
In 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo (nicknamed the &quot;ABC Circle&quot;) into its current and best-known form, with the lowercase letters &quot;abc&quot; enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air on October 19 of the same year, but it was not until the following spring that it was fully adopted. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo&#x27;s simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which was beneficial before the advent of computer graphics. A color version of the logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC &quot;Laramie&quot; peacock intro used during that era). The &quot;a&quot; was rendered in red, the &quot;b&quot; in blue, and the &quot;c&quot; in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo&#x27;s setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon, and glittering dotted lines. Among the ABC Circle logo&#x27;s many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and was the first ABC identification card to simulate a three-dimensional appearance.

In 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network&#x27;s founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan &quot;That Special Feeling&quot; in a script font. Ten years later, in 1993, the &quot;ABC Circle&quot; logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle. The ABC logo first appeared as an on-screen bug in the 1993–94 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, then appearing throughout programs beginning in the 1995–96 season, the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011–12 season.

During the 1997–98 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white &quot;ABC Circle&quot; logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night&#x27;s prime time lineup). A new four-note theme tune (composed by Mad Bus Music) was introduced alongside the package, based around the network&#x27;s then-new &quot;We Love TV&quot; image campaign from the 1998–99 season, creating an audio signature in comparative parlance to the NBC chimes, CBS&#x27;s various sound marks (including the current five-note version introduced in 2020) and the Fox fanfare (which was phased out by the Fox network in 2019). The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter until the 2020–21 season.

In 1999, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called &#x27;the dot&#x27;, in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to &quot;download the dot&quot;, a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner. The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001–02 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.

On June 10, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007–08 season, &quot;Start Here&quot;, accompanied by a glassy version of the ABC logo. Also developed by Troika, marketing used a series of icons intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms, and sought to &quot;simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC.&quot; On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.ABC introduced a revision to its logo and branding by Loyalkaspar for the 2013–14 season, the logo carried a simpler gloss design than the 2007 version, and had lettering closer-resembling Paul Rand&#x27;s original version of the circle logo. A custom typeface inspired by the ABC logotype, ABC Modern, was also created for use in advertising and other promotional elements. The logo was used in various color schemes, with a gold version used primarily for ABC&#x27;s entertainment divisions, a red version used primarily for ESPN on ABC, steel blue and dark grey versions used primarily by ABC News, and all four colors used interchangeably in promotions.

Upon a reimaging by The New Blank for the 2018–19 season, the blue, red, and yellow variants were dropped, with the dark grey version becoming ABC&#x27;s main logo. Surrounding promotional elements adopted a circular &quot;echo&quot; motif and the new slogan &quot;America&#x27;s Network&quot;.
Another revision to the logo was introduced on August 9, 2021, ahead of the 2021–22 season. Designed by Trollbäck &amp; Company, it is designed to adhere to flat design trends, and returns to a solid, two-dimensional design with smaller and bolder lettering. The main logo is rendered in a dark, blue-gray color, outlined and black-on-red variations are also used, such as for the on-screen bug and promotional usage respectively. The 2021 rebrand also introduced a sonic logo that retains three out of the four notes of ABC&#x27;s prior audio logo and was composed by YouTooCanWoo.
The Circle 7 logo, designed in 1962, is also commonly associated with ABC affiliates who broadcast on channel 7, including its flagship local stations WABC-TV (New York City), KABC-TV (Los Angeles), KGO-TV (San Francisco) and WLS-TV (Chicago). This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network. KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August 27, 1962, by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.

==International broadcasts ==
The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network dates to the 1950s, when Goldenson tried to use the same strategies he had in expanding UPT&#x27;s theater operation to the international market. Goldenson said that ABC&#x27;s first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953, CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays. Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America and in 1959 established program distributor Worldvision Enterprises. Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and TV Asahi in 1957. Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid-1960s.

The goal was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels and affiliates to rebroadcast the network&#x27;s programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries, many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s; a partial stake in ABS-CBN in the Philippines was forcibly removed in 1974 with the declaration of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos.

The second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks. These policies included the expansion of several of the company&#x27;s U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix, although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. In contrast to Disney&#x27;s other channels, ABC broadcasts in the United States with programming syndicated in other countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived and on September 27, 2004, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, ABC1 could not attain sustainable viewership and was shut down in October 2007.

Prior to the ABC1 closure, on October 10, 2006, Disney–ABC Television Group entered into an agreement with satellite provider Dish TV to carry its ABC News Now channel in India. However, this operation was not put into effect.

===Australia===
In Australia, the Nine Network maintained close ties with ABC and has used a majority of the U.S. network&#x27;s image campaigns and slogans since the 1970s, in particular, &quot;Still the One&quot;, ABC&#x27;s slogan it adopted for the 1977–78 television season and again for the 1979–80 television season, was adopted by Nine for the 1978 Australian television season (before, Nine also used ABC&#x27;s &quot;Let Us Be the One&quot; slogan), and lasted longer ever since it was re-adopted in 1980, it was Nine&#x27;s main slogan until it was replaced in December 2006, only to be reintroduced in November 2021. ABC&#x27;s other slogans were also adopted by Nine during the 1980–2006 period, as secondary slogans complementing the &quot;Still the One&quot; slogan.

===Canada===
Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity of the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider. Most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the CRTC, which require television service providers to replace an American station&#x27;s signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster carrying the same syndicated program to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.

===Mexico===
Like Canada, ABC programming is available in Mexico through free-to-air affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico–United States border whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.

<text>Cable News Network (CNN) is a multinational news organization operating, most notably, a website and a TV channel headquartered in Atlanta. Founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel, and presently owned by the Manhattan-based media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and the first all-news television channel in the United States.

As of December 2023, CNN had 68,974,000 television households as subscribers in the US. According to Nielsen, down from 80 million in March 2021. In June 2021, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021 and had further declined to number 21 in 2022.

Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories. Since May 2019, however, the American domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, and some islands in the Caribbean. CNN also licenses its brand and content to other channels, such as CNN-News18 in India. In Japan it broadcasts CNNj which started in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.

==History==
The Cable News Network launched at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel&#x27;s first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN, hired most of the channel&#x27;s first 200 employees, including the network&#x27;s first news anchor, former ABC News Capitol Hill senior correspondent Bernard Shaw.

Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to several cable and satellite television providers, websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (12 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel&#x27;s success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner&#x27;s (later WarnerMedia which merged with Discovery Inc. forming Warner Bros. Discovery) eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.

==Programming==
===Current schedule===

CNN&#x27;s current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs with a focus on political news and discussion during the evening and primetime hours. The network&#x27;s morning programming consists of &quot;Early Start&quot;, an early-morning news program now hosted by Kasie Hunt at 5–6 a.m. ET. This is followed by &quot;CNN This Morning&quot;, the network&#x27;s morning show, hosted by Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly, at 6–9 a.m. ET. Since April 2023, &quot;CNN News Central&quot; has served as the network&#x27;s rolling news block on weekdays, with its morning edition from 9 a.m. to noon ET anchored by John Berman, Kate Bolduan, and Sara Sidner, and its afternoon edition from 1–4 p.m. ET anchored by Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez. In the noon hour is &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, hosted by Dana Bash.

CNN&#x27;s late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot; at 4–5 p.m. ET and &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer&quot; at 5–7 p.m. ET. The network&#x27;s evening and prime time lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including &quot;Erin Burnett OutFront&quot; at 7 p.m. ET, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; at 8 p.m. ET, and &quot;The Source with Kaitlan Collins&quot; at 9 p.m. ET. The 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. hours are filled by &quot;CNN Newsnight&quot; with Abby Phillip and &quot;Laura Coates Live&quot; respectively. From November 2023, the Wednesday edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; has been replaced with &quot;King Charles&quot;, a limited-run late-night talk show helmed by Gayle King and Charles Barkley.

The network&#x27;s weekend morning programming begins with &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; (simulcast from CNN International) at 4–6 a.m. ET every Saturday and 3–6 a.m. ET every Sunday. &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; also airs throughout the day between noon and 8 p.m. ET with hosts Fredricka Whitfield and Jim Acosta. Each weekend day from 6 a.m. ET, until 8 a.m. ET Saturday and 9 a.m. ET Sunday are the weekend editions of &quot;CNN This Morning&quot;, hosted by Amara Walker and Victor Blackwell. On Saturdays, &quot;First of All with Victor Blackwell&quot; airs at 8 a.m. ET, followed by &quot;Smerconish&quot; with Michael Smerconish at 9 a.m. ET, &quot;The Chris Wallace Show&quot; at 10 a.m. ET and &quot;The Amanpour Hour&quot; with Christine Amanpour at 11 a.m. ET. The Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, starting with &quot;State of the Union&quot; co-hosted by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash at 9 a.m. ET followed by the international affairs program &quot;Fareed Zakaria GPS&quot; at 10 a.m. ET and &quot;Inside Politics&quot; with Manu Raju at 11 a.m. ET.

Weekend primetime, starting at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday and 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as documentary specials and miniseries like &quot;The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper&quot;. Documentary-style reality series, such as &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot; and &quot;United Shades of America,&quot; and acquired documentary films presented under the banner &quot;CNN Films&quot; may also air during weekend primetime. The documentary anthology series &quot;How It Really Happened&quot; relocated from HLN to air its eighth season.

===Past programming===

For the 2014–15 season, after canceling &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; (which, itself, replaced the long-running &quot;Larry King Live&quot;), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00 p.m. ET hour, such as John Walsh&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt&quot;, &quot;This Is Life with Lisa Ling&quot;, and Mike Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Do It&quot;. Then-president Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00 p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan &quot;Go there&quot;. In May 2014, CNN premiered &quot;The Sixties&quot;, a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades. &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; was expanded to run two hours long, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

By 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off &quot;1968&quot;), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and US policies, such as &quot;The Bush Years&quot;, and &quot;American Dynasties: The Kennedys&quot;—which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7-million viewers. &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; concluded after the 2018 suicide of its host Anthony Bourdain; CNN announced several new miniseries and docuseries for 2019, including &quot;American Style&quot; (a miniseries produced by the digital media company Vox Media), &quot;The Redemption Project with Van Jones&quot;, &quot;Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta&quot;, &quot;Tricky Dick&quot; (a miniseries chronicling Richard Nixon), &quot;The Movies&quot; (a spin-off of the Hanks/Goetzman decades miniseries), and &quot;Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962–64&quot;.

With the takeover of CNN by Chris Licht and Warner Bros. Discovery, it was announced in October 2022 that CNN would cut back on acquisitions and commissions from third-parties as a cost-cutting measure, but Licht stressed that &quot;longform content remains an important pillar of our programming&quot;, while the network announced a slate for 2023 that would include commissions such as &quot;Giuliani: What Happened to America&#x27;s Mayor?&quot;, &quot;United States of Scandal&quot;, and &quot;The 2010s&quot;. In May 2024, CNN ordered a American version of the long-running British news comedy panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

===On-air presentation===

CNN began broadcasting in the high-definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007. This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.

CNN&#x27;s political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel&#x27;s CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.

In December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static &quot;flipper&quot;, which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or &quot;topical&quot; details related to a story.

CNN&#x27;s next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue-and-white color scheme, moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen, and framing its graphics for the 16:9 aspect ratio (which is downscaled to a letterboxed format for standard definition feeds). On February 18, 2013, following Jeff Zucker&#x27;s arrival as head of the network, the &quot;flipper&quot; was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker.

On August 11, 2014, CNN introduced a new graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker alternated between general headlines and financial news from CNN Business, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displayed either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor. In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as &quot;CNN Sans&quot;, across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums. CNN International would also adopt these graphics, but with the CNN logo bug having a white on red color scheme to differentiate it from the domestic network.

In August 2016, CNN announced the launch of CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR), a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.

On June 1, 2023, CNN refreshed its graphics to mark the 43rd anniversary of its launch, using gradients and rounded corners, thinner fonts, and a modified layout that moved the show title to a secondary tab on the lower third next to the segment title, and replaced the ticker with a static &quot;flipper&quot; for the first time since 2013, among other changes. Amid poor internal reception to the redesign and the firing of Chris Licht as head of CNN, elements of the prior graphics began to be reinstated later that month, including the bolder typography previously used for lower third headlines. Further changes were made on August 14, 2023, with the return of the scrolling ticker and the show title box to make it closer resemble the 2014–23 graphics, but maintaining most of the other visual changes.

On June 27, 2024, CNN hosted the first presidential debate for former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. CNN claimed that more people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history.

==Staff==
On July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year. In January 2013, former NBCUniversal President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.

On January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.

In February 2022, Zucker was asked to resign by Jason Kilar, the chief executive of CNN&#x27;s owner WarnerMedia, after Zucker&#x27;s relationship with one of his lieutenants was discovered during the investigation into former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo&#x27;s efforts to control potentially damaging reporting regarding his brother Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York. Kilar announced that the interim co-heads would be executive vice presidents Michael Bass, Amy Entelis, and Ken Jautz. On February 26, 2022, it was announced that Chris Licht—known for his work at MSNBC and CBS—would be the next president of CNN; he was planned to be instated after the spin off and merger of WarnerMedia into Discovery Inc. Licht started his tenure in May 2022, and his tenure ended in June 2023.

A trio of EVPs, Entelis, Virginia Moseley and Eric Sherling, formed an interim management group, until October 2023, when Mark Thompson, formerly of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; became CEO. In one of his first major moves, he kept the executive team under Chris Licht—the &quot;Quad&quot;, composed of David Leavy, COO, and three EVPs (Moseley for editorial, Entelis for talent, and Sherling for programming)— all in place, and expanded their responsibilities. Moseley became the network&#x27;s first executive editor and would have both national and international news. Adding their ranks, Thompson made Alex MacCallum, who worked with Thompson at The New York Times, executive vice president of digital products. In highlighting these moves, Thompson emphasized existing staff would need to get used to change. 

In July 2024, CNN announced that it was cutting one hundred jobs, or about 3% of its total workforce. The company also announced that it was consolidating three newsrooms into one, namely, its US news gathering, international news gathering and digital news gathering operations. CNN&#x27;s global workforce, in July 2024, included roughly 3,500 people.

==Other platforms==
===Website===

CNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially known as &quot;CNN Interactive&quot;), on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs, in particular, have focused CNN&#x27;s previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.

In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the US, according to Nielsen/NetRatings; this is an increase of 11% over the previous year.

CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or &quot;pipes&quot;), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up &quot;news alerts&quot; to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based &quot;web client&quot; that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.

On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel&#x27;s coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack.

The company was honored at the 2008 Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the US Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.

On October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new &quot;sign up&quot; option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new &quot;CNN Pulse&quot; (beta) feature, along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted.

===Blogs===

The topical news program &quot;Judy Woodruff&#x27;s Inside Politics&quot; was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when &quot;Inside Politics&quot; was folded into &quot;The Situation Room&quot; (&quot;Inside Politics&quot; later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network&#x27;s chief national correspondent John King.). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent in first-hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.

In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called &quot;Eatocracy&quot;, which will &quot;cover all news related to food—from recalls to health issues to culture&quot;. CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.

CNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers&#x27; questions online at CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Chart&quot; blog website. Contributors include Sanjay Gupta (Chief Medical Correspondent), Charles Raison (Mental Health Expert), Otis Brawley (Conditions Expert), Melina Jampolis (Diet and Fitness Expert), Jennifer Shu (Living Well Expert), and Elizabeth Cohen (Senior Medical Correspondent).

===Other digital offerings===

In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner&#x27;s incorporation of the medium). CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the US. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.

CNN also has multiple channels in the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but those videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their television programming on TuneIn Radio.

On March 7, 2017, CNN announced the official launch of its virtual reality unit named CNNVR. It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital. It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.
CNN Newsource is a subscription-based affiliation video service that provides CNN content to television station affiliates with CNN, including terrestrial stations and international stations. Newsource allows affiliates to download videos from CNN, as well as from other affiliates who upload their video to Newsource.

CNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire.

CNN&#x27;s digital storefront, which sells branded merchandise, household goods, and software, is operated by StackCommerce via partnership.

In 2021, CNN Digital had an average of 144-million unique visitors in the United States according to Comscore, making it the most viewed digital news outlet, ahead of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, NBC News, Fox News, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

====CNN-10====

The network also hosts CNN-10, a daily 10-minute video show visible at the CNN website or YouTube. It replaced the long-running show CNN Student News which had been aired since 1989. It is aimed at a global audience of students, teachers, and adults, and was hosted by Carl Azuz. In the fall of 2022, Carl Azuz was replaced by Coy Wire as the host of CNN 10, after leaving CNN due to a &quot;personal decision&quot; according to a CNN spokesperson in a newsletter published on September 18, 2022.

===Beme===
On November 28, 2016, CNN announced the acquisition of Beme for a reported . On November 29, 2016, Matt Hackett, co-founder of Beme, announced via an email to its users that the Beme app would be shutting down on January 31, 2017. Since the shutdown of the app, it was announced that CNN intended to use the current talent behind Beme to work on a separate start-up endeavor. Beme&#x27;s current team will retain full creative control of the new project, which was slated to be released in the summer of 2017. Beme have also brought on other internet stars such as the host of Vsauce 3, Jake Roper, as head of production, who features prominently in Beme co-founder Casey Neistat&#x27;s vlogs. Beme News has since begun uploading news related video on YouTube.

===Films===
In October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled &quot;Girl Rising&quot;, a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls&#x27; education.

===Radio===
In July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. The service was unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their news brands. On July 9, 2020, citing &quot;extraordinary circumstances in the current marketplace&quot; and a need to prioritize the company&#x27;s resources, Westwood One announced that the service would be discontinued on August 30.

The audio simulcast of CNN is distributed on Entercom&#x27;s Radio.com website and app.

==Controversies and criticisms==
CNN has been involved in various controversies, criticisms, and allegations since its inception in 1980. The channel is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic.

CNN claims to be &quot;The Most Trusted Name in News&quot;, but its efforts to be nonpartisan have led to accusations of false balance. One study measured airtime of guests on major news networks between 2010 and 2021 and compared that to the guests&#x27; campaign donations. It found guests on CNN to have a liberal bias (a &quot;campaign finance score&quot; of −9.7, where 0 is equal airtime, compared to −14.1 for MSNBC and 49.8 for Fox News), which became more pronounced during the Trump administration. The same study found that some popular primetime news shows on CNN, such as &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot; or &quot;CNN Tonight&quot;, are more left-leaning than popular MSNBC shows such as &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; or &quot;The 11th Hour with Brian Williams&quot;.

In January 2020, CNN settled a multi-million dollar defamation lawsuit from Nick Sandmann, a Covington Catholic High School student involved in an encounter with Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

When Chris Licht took over the network in 2022, he expressed an intention to have more Republicans on the air and cut down on opinion-related content.

After being fired in December 2021, former host Chris Cuomo was reported to be seeking in damages, alleging a breach of agreement. In April 2023, host Don Lemon announced that he had been fired.

<text>Georges Pierre Seurat ( , ; ; 2 December 1859 – 29 March 1891) was a French post-Impressionist artist. He devised the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism and pointillism and used conté crayon for drawings on paper with a rough surface.

Seurat&#x27;s artistic personality combined qualities that are usually thought of as opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility, on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind. His large-scale work &quot;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; (1884–1886) altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-Impressionism, and is one of the icons of late 19th-century painting.

==Biography==
===Family and education===
Seurat was born on 2 December 1859 in Paris, at 60 rue de Bondy (now rue René Boulanger). The Seurat family moved to 136 boulevard de Magenta (now 110 boulevard de Magenta) in 1862 or 1863. His father, Antoine Chrysostome Seurat, originally from Champagne, was a former legal official who had become wealthy from speculating in property, and his mother, Ernestine Faivre, was from Paris. Georges had a brother, Émile Augustin, and a sister, Marie-Berthe, both older. His father lived in Le Raincy and visited his wife and children once a week at boulevard de Magenta.

Georges Seurat first studied art at the École Municipale de Sculpture et Dessin, near his family&#x27;s home in the boulevard Magenta, which was run by the sculptor Justin Lequien. In 1878, he moved on to the École des Beaux-Arts where he was taught by Henri Lehmann, and followed a conventional academic training, drawing from casts of antique sculpture and copying drawings by old masters. Seurat&#x27;s studies resulted in a well-considered and fertile theory of contrasts: a theory to which all his work was thereafter subjected. His formal artistic education came to an end in November 1879, when he left the École des Beaux-Arts for a year of military service.

After a year at the Brest Military Academy, he returned to Paris where he shared a studio with his friend Aman-Jean, while also renting a small apartment at 16 rue de Chabrol. For the next two years, he worked at mastering the art of monochrome drawing. His first exhibited work, shown at the Salon, of 1883, was a Conté crayon drawing of Aman-Jean. He also studied the works of Eugène Delacroix carefully, making notes on his use of color.

===&quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot;===
He spent 1883 working on his first major paintinga large canvas titled &quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot;, a monumental work showing young men relaxing by the Seine in a working-class suburb of Paris. Although influenced in its use of color and light tone by Impressionism, the painting with its smooth, simplified textures and carefully outlined, rather sculptural figures, shows the continuing impact of his neoclassical training; the critic Paul Alexis described it as a &quot;faux Puvis de Chavannes&quot;. Seurat also departed from the Impressionist ideal by preparing for the work with a number of drawings and oil sketches before starting on the canvas in his studio.

&quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot; was rejected by the Paris Salon, and instead he showed it at the Groupe des Artistes Indépendants in May 1884. Soon, however, disillusioned by the poor organization of the Indépendants, Seurat and some other artists he had met through the group – including Charles Angrand, Henri-Edmond Cross, Albert Dubois-Pillet and Paul Signac – set up a new organization, the Société des Artistes Indépendants. Seurat&#x27;s new ideas on pointillism were to have an especially strong influence on Signac, who subsequently painted in the same idiom.

===&quot;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot;===
In summer 1884, Seurat began work on &quot;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot;.

The painting shows members of each of the social classes participating in various park activities. The tiny juxtaposed dots of multi-colored paint allow the viewer&#x27;s eye to blend colors optically, rather than having the colors physically blended on the canvas. It took Seurat two years to complete this painting, much of which he spent in the park sketching in preparation for the work. There are about 60 studies for the large painting, including a smaller version, &quot;Study for A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; (1884–1885), which is now in the collection of The Art Institute of Chicago. The full work is also part of the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

The painting was the inspiration for James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; and played a significant symbolic role in John Hughes&#x27; &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

===Later career and personal life===

Seurat concealed his relationship with Madeleine Knobloch (or Madeleine Knoblock, 1868–1903), an artist&#x27;s model whom he portrayed in his painting &quot;Jeune femme se poudrant&quot;. In 1889, she moved in with Seurat in his studio on the seventh floor of 128 bis Boulevard de Clichy.

When Madeleine became pregnant, the couple moved to a studio at 39 passage de l&#x27;Élysée-des-Beaux-Arts (now rue André Antoine). There she gave birth to their son, who was named Pierre-Georges, on 16 February 1890.

Seurat spent the summer of 1890 on the coast at Gravelines, where he painted four canvases including &quot;The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe&quot;, as well as eight oil panels, and made a few drawings.

===Death===
Seurat died in Paris in his parents&#x27; home on 29 March 1891 at the age of 31. The cause of his death is uncertain, and has been variously attributed to a form of meningitis, pneumonia, infectious angina, and diphtheria. His son died two weeks later from the same disease. His last ambitious work, &quot;The Circus&quot;, was left unfinished at the time of his death.

On 30 March 1891 a funeral Mass was held in the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. Seurat was interred 31 March 1891 at Cimetière du Père-Lachaise.

At the time of Seurat&#x27;s death, Madeleine was pregnant with a second child who died during or shortly after birth.

==Colour theory==
===Contemporary ideas===
During the 19th century, scientist-writers such as Michel Eugène Chevreul, Ogden Rood and David Sutter wrote treatises on colour, optical effects and perception. They adapted the scientific research of Hermann von Helmholtz and Isaac Newton into a form accessible to laypeople. Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.

Chevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a colour wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colours around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colours juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another colour when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neo-Impressionist painters.

Chevreul also realized that the &quot;halo&quot; that one sees after looking at a colour is the opposing colour (also known as complementary color). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary colour (as an example, cyan for red) is due to retinal persistence. Neo-Impressionist painters interested in the interplay of colours made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the colour of the central object, but to add colours and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colours. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call &quot;emotion&quot;.

It is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul&#x27;s book on colour contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read Charles Blanc&#x27;s &quot;Grammaire des arts du dessin&quot; (1867), which cites Chevreul&#x27;s work. Blanc&#x27;s book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of colour&#x27;s emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neo-Impressionists. He said that colour should not be based on the &quot;judgment of taste&quot;, but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of colour, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.

While Chevreul based his theories on Newton&#x27;s thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as primary colors red, green and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colours are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive colour. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing colour, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of colour, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:

*Material pigments: Red + Yellow + Blue = Black ( Magenta, Yellow and Cyan give a true black when mixed; Red, Yellow and Blue generally do not.)
*Optical / Light : Red + Green + Blue = White

Seurat was also influenced by Sutter&#x27;s &quot;Phenomena of Vision&quot; (1880), in which he wrote that &quot;the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music&quot;. He heard lectures in the 1880s by the mathematician Charles Henry at the Sorbonne, who discussed the emotional properties and symbolic meaning of lines and colour. There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry&#x27;s ideas were adopted by Seurat.

===Language of colour===

Seurat took to heart the colour theorists&#x27; notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use colour to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses counterpoint and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of colour was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of heuristics and he set out to show this language using lines, colour intensity and colour schema. Seurat called this language Chromoluminarism.

In a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: &quot;Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle. The frame is in a harmony that opposes those of the tones, colours and lines of the picture, these aspects are considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm or sad combinations&quot;.

Seurat&#x27;s theories can be summarized as follows: The emotion of gaiety can be achieved by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colours, and by the use of lines directed upward. Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm and cold colours, and by lines that are horizontal. Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colours and by lines pointing downward.

==Influence==

Where the dialectic nature of Paul Cézanne&#x27;s work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911. Seurat in his few years of activity, was able, with his observations on irradiation and the effects of contrast, to create afresh without any guiding tradition, to complete an esthetic system with a new technical method perfectly adapted to its expression.

&quot;With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910–1911,&quot; writes art historian Robert Herbert, &quot;questions of form displaced color in the artists&#x27; attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. &quot;The Chahut&quot; [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon &#x27;one of the great icons of the new devotion&#x27;, and both it and the &quot;Cirque (Circus)&quot;, Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris, according to Guillaume Apollinaire, &#x27;almost belong to Synthetic Cubism&#x27;.&quot;

The concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling &quot;objective truth&quot;, perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.

Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Dancers&quot;). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics; Orphism would do so with color too.

On 2 December 2021, Google honored Seurat with a Google Doodle on his 162nd birthday.

<text>Simone Signoret (; born Simone Henriette Charlotte Kaminker; 25 March 1921 – 30 September 1985) was a French actress. She received various accolades, including an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, a César Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for two Golden Globe Awards.

== Early life ==
Signoret was born Simone Henriette Charlotte Kaminker in Wiesbaden, Germany, to Georgette (née Signoret) and André Kaminker. She was the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers. Her father, a pioneering interpreter who worked in the League of Nations, was a French-born army officer from an assimilated and middle-class Polish-Jewish and Hungarian-Jewish family, who brought the family to Neuilly-sur-Seine on the outskirts of Paris. Her mother, Georgette, from whom she acquired her stage name, was a French Catholic.

Signoret grew up in Paris in an intellectual atmosphere and studied English, German and Latin. After completing secondary school during the Nazi occupation, Simone was responsible for supporting her family and forced to take work as a typist for a French collaborationist newspaper &quot;Les nouveaux temps&quot;, run by Jean Luchaire.

== Career ==
During the occupation of France, Signoret mixed with an artistic group of writers and actors who met at the Café de Flore in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés quarter. By this time, she had developed an interest in acting and was encouraged by her friends, including her lover Daniel Gélin to follow her ambition. In 1942, she began appearing in bit parts and was able to earn enough money to support her mother and two brothers as her father, who was a French patriot, had fled the country in 1940 to join General De Gaulle in England. She took her mother&#x27;s maiden name for the screen to help hide her Jewish roots.

Signoret&#x27;s sensual features and earthy nature led to type-casting and she was often seen in roles as a prostitute. She won considerable attention in &quot;La Ronde&quot; (1950), a film which was banned briefly in New York City as immoral. She won further acclaim, including an acting award from the British Film Academy, for her portrayal of another prostitute in Jacques Becker&#x27;s &quot;Casque d&#x27;or&quot; (1951). She appeared in many French films during the 1950s, including &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (1953), directed by Marcel Carné, &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Crucible&quot; (&quot;Les Sorcières de Salem&quot;; 1956), based on Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.
In 1958, Signoret acted in the English independent film &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959), and her performance won numerous awards, including the Best Female Performance Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was offered films in Hollywood, but turned them down for several years, continuing to work in France and England—for example, with Laurence Olivier in &quot;Term of Trial&quot; (1962). She earned another Oscar nomination for her work on &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965), appeared in a few other Hollywood films, and returned to France in 1969.

In 1962, Signoret translated Lillian Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; into French for a production in Paris that ran for six months at the Theatre Sarah-Bernhardt. She played the Regina role as well. Hellman was displeased with the production, although the translation was approved by scholars selected by Hellman.

Signoret&#x27;s one attempt at Shakespeare, performing Lady Macbeth with Alec Guinness at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1966 proved to be ill-advised, with some harsh critics; one referred to her English as &quot;impossibly Gallic&quot;.

Signoret won acclaim for her portrayal of a weary madam in &quot;Madame Rosa&quot; (1977) and as an unmarried sister who unknowingly falls in love with her paralyzed brother via anonymous correspondence in &quot;&quot; (1980). She continued to appear in many movies before her death in 1985.

== Personal life ==
Signoret&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Nostalgia Isn&#x27;t What It Used to Be&quot;, were published in 1978. She also wrote the novel &quot;Adieu Volodya&quot;, published in 1985, the year of her death.

Signoret first married filmmaker Yves Allégret (1944–1949), with whom she had a daughter Catherine Allégret. Her second marriage was to the Italian-born French actor Yves Montand in 1951, a union which lasted until her death; the couple had no children.

Signoret died of pancreatic cancer in Autheuil-Authouillet, France, aged 64. She was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, and Yves Montand later was buried next to her.

Signoret identified as Jewish. She was a supporter of a variety of Jewish causes, including the Zionist movement and the Soviet Jewry movement. She maintained relationships with many Israeli leaders and was critical of antisemitism in the French Communist Party. Because she was of patrilineal Jewish ancestry and was therefore not considered Jewish under traditional halakha, there was no religious ceremony at her funeral.

== Popular culture ==
*&quot;Marilyn&quot; (2011) by Sue Glover premiered at the Citizens&#x27; Theatre, Glasgow on 17 February 2011. The play charted the deteriorating relationship between Signoret and Marilyn Monroe during the filming of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;. Unable to achieve the recognition of Oscar-winning Signoret, Monroe begins an affair with Signoret&#x27;s husband, Yves Montand.
* Singer Nina Simone (Born Eunice Waymon) took her last name from Simone Signoret.

<text>Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (, ; ; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French existentialist philosopher, writer, social theorist, and feminist activist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, nor was she considered one at the time of her death, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.

Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, short stories, biographies, autobiographies, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She was best known for her &quot;trailblazing work in feminist philosophy&quot;, &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949), a detailed analysis of women&#x27;s oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. She was also known for her novels, the most famous of which were &quot;She Came to Stay&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Mandarins&quot; (1954). 

Her most enduring contribution to literature are her memoirs, notably the first volume, &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;une jeune fille rangée&quot; (1958). She received the 1954 Prix Goncourt, the 1975 Jerusalem Prize, and the 1978 Austrian State Prize for European Literature. She was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, 1969 and 1973. However, Beauvoir generated controversy when she briefly lost her teaching job after being accused of sexually abusing some of her students.

==Personal life==

=== Early years ===
Beauvoir was born on 9 January 1908, into a bourgeois Parisian family in the 6th arrondissement. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a lawyer who once aspired to be an actor, and Françoise Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker&#x27;s daughter and devout Catholic. Simone had a sister, Hélène, who was born two years later, on June 6, 1910. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after World War I, and Françoise insisted the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school.

Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fueled by her father&#x27;s encouragement; he reportedly would boast, &quot;Simone thinks like a man!&quot; Because of her family&#x27;s straitened circumstances, she could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. She took this opportunity to take steps towards earning a living for herself.

She first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the École Normale Supérieure in preparation for the &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination that serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for it that she met École Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and René Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname &quot;Castor&quot;, or &quot;beaver&quot;). The jury for the &quot;agrégation&quot; narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam. Additionally, Beauvoir finished an exam for the certificate of &quot;General Philosophy and Logic&quot; second to Simone Weil. Her success as the eighth woman to pass the &quot;agrégation&quot; solidified her economic independence and furthered her feminist ideology.

Writing of her youth in &quot;Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter,&quot; she said:
&quot;...my father&#x27;s individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother&#x27;s teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.&quot;

==== Education ====
Beauvoir pursued post-secondary education after completing her high school years at . After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy at the age of seventeen in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the . She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, wrote her &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures spécialisées&quot; (roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis) on Leibniz for Léon Brunschvicg in 1929 (the topic was &quot;Le concept chez Leibniz&quot; [&quot;The Concept in Leibniz&quot;]).

==== Religious upbringing ====
Beauvoir was raised in a Catholic household. In her youth, she was sent to convent schools. She was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. At age 14, Beauvoir questioned her faith as she saw many changes in the world after witnessing tragedies throughout her life. Consequently, she abandoned her faith in her early teens and remained an atheist for the rest of her life. To explain her atheist beliefs, Beauvoir stated, &quot;Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all, the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself.&quot;

=== Middle years ===

From 1929 through 1943, Beauvoir taught at the lycée level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the (Marseille), the , and the (1936–39).

During the trial of Robert Brasillach Beauvoir was among a small number of prominent intellectuals advocating for his execution for &#x27;intellectual crimes&#x27;. She defended this decision in her 1946 essay &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;.

==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====
Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre met during her college years. Intrigued by her determination as an educator, he intended to make their relationship romantic. However, she had no interest in doing so. She later changed her mind, and in October 1929, Jean-Paul Sartre and Beauvoir became a couple for the next 51 years, until his death in 1980. After they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him on a provisional basis. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, &quot;Let&#x27;s sign a two-year lease&quot;. Though Beauvoir wrote, &quot;Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry&quot;, scholars point out that her ideal relationships described in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; and elsewhere bore little resemblance to the marriage standards of the day.
I think marriage is a very alienating institution, for men as well as for women. I think it&#x27;s a very dangerous institution—dangerous for men, who find themselves trapped, saddled with a wife and children to support; dangerous for women, who aren&#x27;t financially independent and end up by depending on men who can throw them out when they are 40; and very dangerous for children, because their parents vent all their frustrations and mutual hatred on them. The very words &#x27;conjugal rights&#x27; are dreadful. Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one.
Instead, she and Sartre entered into a lifelong &quot;soul partnership&quot;, which was sexual but not exclusive, nor did it involve living together. She chose never to marry and never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, write and teach, and take lovers. Unfortunately, Beauvoir&#x27;s prominent open relationships at times overshadowed her substantial academic reputation. A scholar who was lecturing with her chastised their &quot;distinguished [Harvard] audience [because] every question asked about Sartre concerned his work, while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life.&quot;

Sartre and Beauvoir always read each other&#x27;s work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; and Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;She Came to Stay&quot; and &quot;Phenomenology and Intent&quot;. However, recent studies of Beauvoir&#x27;s work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz. The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. However, Beauvoir, reading Hegel in German during the war, produced an original critique of his dialectic of consciousness.

==== Allegations of sexual abuse ====
Beauvoir was bisexual, and her relationships with young women were controversial. French author Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;une jeune fille dérangée&quot; (Memoirs of a deranged girl, published in English under the title &quot;A Disgraceful Affair&quot;) that, while a student at Lycée Molière, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s. Sartre and Beauvoir both groomed and sexually abused Lamblin. Bianca wrote her &quot;Mémoires&quot; in response to the posthumous 1990 publication of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Lettres au Castor et à quelques autres: 1926-1963&quot; (Letters to Castor and other friends), in which she noted that she was referred to by the pseudonym Louise Védrine.

In 1943, Beauvoir was suspended again from her teaching position when she was accused of seducing her 17-year-old lycée pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939. Sorokine&#x27;s parents laid formal charges against Beauvoir for debauching a minor (the age of consent in France at the time was 13 until 1945, when it became 15) and Beauvoir&#x27;s licence to teach in France was revoked, although it was subsequently reinstated.

Beauvoir described in &quot;La Force de l&#x27;âge&quot; (&quot;The Prime of Life&quot;) a relationship of simple friendship with Nathalie Sorokine (in the book referred to as &quot;Lise Oblanoff&quot;). Sorokine, along with Bianca Lamblin and Olga Kosakiewicz, later stated that their relationships with Beauvoir damaged them psychologically.

=== Later years ===

Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Her 1955 travels in China were the basis of her 1957 travelogue &quot;The Long March&quot;, in which she praised the efforts of the Chinese communists to emancipate women.

She published several volumes of short stories, including &quot;The Woman Destroyed&quot;, which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.
She lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959, but perhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren. Beauvoir met Algren in Chicago in 1947, while she was on a four-month &quot;exploration&quot; trip of the United States using various means of transport: automobile, train, and Greyhound. She kept a detailed diary of the trip, which was published in France in 1948 with the title &quot;America Day by Day&quot;. She wrote to him across the Atlantic as &quot;my beloved husband.&quot; Algren won the National Book Award for &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; in 1950, and in 1954, Beauvoir won France&#x27;s most prestigious literary prize for &quot;The Mandarins,&quot; in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.
When Beauvoir visited Algren in Chicago, Art Shay took well-known nude and portrait photos of Beauvoir. Shay also wrote a play based on Algren, Beauvoir, and Sartre&#x27;s triangular relationship. The play was stage read in 1999 in Chicago.

Beauvoir also wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of &quot;Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Prime of Life&quot;, &quot;Force of Circumstance&quot; (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: &quot;After the War&quot; and &quot;Hard Times&quot;), and &quot;All Said and Done&quot;. In 1964 Beauvoir published a novella-length autobiography, &quot;A Very Easy Death&quot;, covering the time she spent visiting her aging mother, who was dying of cancer. The novella brings up questions of ethical concerns with truth-telling in doctor-patient relationships.

Her 1970 long essay La Vieillesse (&quot;The Coming of Age&quot;) is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In the 1970s Beauvoir became active in France&#x27;s women&#x27;s liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig, and Beauvoir&#x27;s sister Hélène. In 1974, abortion was legalized in France.

When asked in a 1975 interview with Betty Friedan if she would support a minimum wage for women who do housework, Beauvoir answered: &quot;No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction&quot;, further stating that motherhood &quot;should be a choice, and not a result of conditioning”.

In about 1976, Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.

In 1977, Beauvoir signed a petition along with other French intellectuals that supported the freeing of three arrested paedophiles. The petition explicitly addresses the &#x27;Affaire de Versailles&#x27;, where three adult men, Dejager (age 45), Gallien (age 43), and Burckhardt (age 39) had sexual relations with minors of both sexes aged 12–13.

&quot;When Things of the Spirit Come First&quot;, a set of short stories Beauvoir had written decades previously but had not considered worth publishing, was released in 1980.
In 1981 she wrote &quot;La Cérémonie des adieux&quot; (&quot;A Farewell to Sartre&quot;), a painful account of Sartre&#x27;s last years. In the opening of &quot;Adieux&quot;, Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.|

She contributed the piece &quot;Feminism - Alive, Well, and in Constant Danger&quot; to the 1984 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women&#x27;s Movement Anthology&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

After Sartre died in 1980, Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After Beauvoir&#x27;s death, Sartre&#x27;s adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre&#x27;s letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre&#x27;s letters available today have Beauvoir&#x27;s edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. Beauvoir&#x27;s adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published Beauvoir&#x27;s unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

==== Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir ====
Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir and Simone de Beauvoir met in the 1960s, when Beauvoir was in her fifties and Sylvie was a teenager. In 1980, Beauvoir, 72, legally adopted Sylvie, who was in her late thirties, by which point they had already been in an intimate relationship for decades. Although Beauvoir rejected the institution of marriage her entire life, this adoption was like a marriage for her. Some scholars argue that this adoption was not to secure a literary heir for Beauvoir, but as a form of resistance to the bio-heteronormative family unit.

==== Death ====
Beauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78. She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. She was honored as a figure at the forefront of the struggle for women&#x27;s rights around the time of her passing.

==&quot;The Second Sex&quot;==
&quot;The Second Sex&quot;, first published in 1949 in French as &quot;Le Deuxième Sexe&quot;, turns the existentialist mantra that &quot;existence precedes essence&quot; into a feminist one: &quot;One is not born but becomes a woman&quot; (French: &quot;On ne naît pas femme, on le devient&quot;). With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes. Beauvoir argues that &quot;the fundamental source of women&#x27;s oppression is its [femininity&#x27;s] historical and social construction as the quintessential&quot; Other.

Beauvoir defines women as the &quot;second sex&quot; because women are defined as inferior to men. She pointed out that Aristotle argued women are &quot;female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities&quot;, while Thomas Aquinas referred to women as &quot;imperfect men&quot; and the &quot;incidental&quot; being. She quotes &quot;In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.&quot;

Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the &quot;immanence&quot; to which they were previously resigned and reaching &quot;transcendence&quot;, a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one&#x27;s freedom.

Chapters of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; were originally published in &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;, in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France. It was published soon after in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at Smith College), much of Beauvoir&#x27;s book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of Beauvoir&#x27;s work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.

Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.

In the chapter &quot;Woman: Myth and Reality&quot; of &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, Beauvoir argued that men had made women the &quot;Other&quot; in society by the application of a false aura of &quot;mystery&quot; around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class, and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women&#x27;s liberation movement, and her beliefs in women&#x27;s economic independence and equal education, Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women&#x27;s liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;.

In 2018, the manuscript pages of &quot;Le Deuxième Sexe&quot; were published.

==Other notable works==

===&quot;She Came to Stay&quot;===
Beauvoir published her first novel &quot;She Came to Stay&quot; in 1943. It has been assumed that it is inspired by her and Sartre&#x27;s sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a lover of Beauvoir. However, the main thrust of the novel is philosophical, a scene in which to situate Beauvoir&#x27;s abiding philosophical pre-occupation – the relationship between the self and the other.

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of World War II, Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ménage à trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into Beauvoir and Sartre&#x27;s complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

&quot;She Came to Stay&quot; was followed by many others, including &quot;The Blood of Others&quot;, which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.

===Existentialist ethics===
In 1944, Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, &quot;Pyrrhus et Cinéas&quot;, a discussion on existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay &quot;The Ethics of Ambiguity&quot; (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. In &quot;The Ethics of Ambiguity&quot;, Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.

===&quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;===
At the end of World War II, Beauvoir and Sartre edited &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, a political journal that Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others. Beauvoir used &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot; to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. Beauvoir remained an editor until her death. However, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;. Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In Beauvoir&#x27;s later years, she hosted the journal&#x27;s editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.

===&quot;The Mandarins&quot;===

Published in 1954, &quot;The Mandarins&quot; won France&#x27;s highest literary prize, the &quot;Prix Goncourt&quot;. It is a roman à clef set after the end of World War II and follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre&#x27;s and Beauvoir&#x27;s intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren, to whom the book is dedicated.

Algren was outraged by the frank way Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both &quot;The Mandarins&quot; and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of Beauvoir&#x27;s work. Much material bearing on this episode in Beauvoir&#x27;s life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.

===&quot;Les Inséparables&quot;===
Beauvoir&#x27;s early novel &quot;Les Inséparables&quot;, long suppressed, was published in French in 2020 and two different English translations in 2021, by Sandra Smith in the US and Lauren Elkin in the UK. Written in 1954, the book describes her first love, a classmate named Elisabeth Lacoin (&quot;Zaza&quot;) who died before age 22 of viral encephalitis, and had as a teenager a &quot;passionate and tragic&quot; relationship with Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty, then teaching at the same school. According to Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, Beauvoir never forgave Madame Lacoin for what happened, believing that Elisabeth-Zaza was murdered by the oppressive socio-cultural environment in which she had been raised. Disapproved by Sartre, the novel was deemed &quot;too intimate&quot; to be published during Beauvoir&#x27;s lifetime.

==Legacy==
Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot; is considered a foundational work in the history of feminism. Beauvoir had denied being feminist multiple times but ultimately admitted that she was one after &quot;The Second Sex&quot; became crucial in the world of feminism. The work has had a profound influence, opening the way for second-wave feminism in the United States, Canada, Australia, and around the world. Although Beauvoir has been quoted as saying &quot;There is a certain unreasonable demand that I find a little stupid because it would enclose me, immobilize me completely in a sort of feminist concrete block,&quot; her works on feminism have paved the way for all future feminists. The founders of the second-wave read &quot;The Second Sex&quot; in translation, including Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Juliet Mitchell, Ann Oakley and Germaine Greer. All acknowledged their profound debt to Beauvoir, including visiting her in France, consulting with her at crucial moments, and dedicating works to her. Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; is often regarded as the opening salvo of second-wave feminism in the United States, later said that reading &quot;The Second Sex&quot; in the early 1950s &quot;led me to whatever original analysis of women&#x27;s existence I have been able to contribute to the Women&#x27;s movement and its unique politics. I looked to Simone de Beauvoir for a philosophical and intellectual authority.&quot;

At one point in the early 1970s, Beauvoir also aligned herself with the French League for Women&#x27;s Rights as a means to campaign and fight against sexism in French society. Beauvoir&#x27;s influence goes beyond just her impact on second-wave founders, and extends to numerous aspects of feminism, including literary criticism, history, philosophy, theology, criticism of scientific discourse, and psychotherapy. When Beauvoir first became involved with the feminism movement, one of her objectives was legalizing abortion. Donna Haraway wrote that, &quot;despite important differences, all the modern feminist meanings of gender have roots in Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s claim that &#x27;one is not born a woman [one becomes one].&#x27;&quot; This &quot;most famous feminist sentence ever written&quot; is echoed in the title of Monique Wittig&#x27;s 1981 essay &quot;One Is Not Born a Woman&quot;. Judith Butler took the concept a step further, arguing that Beauvoir&#x27;s choice of the verb &quot;to become&quot; suggests that gender is a process, constantly being renewed in an ongoing interaction between the surrounding culture and individual choice.

In Paris, Place Jean-Paul-Sartre-et-Simone-de-Beauvoir is a square where Beauvoir&#x27;s legacy lives on. It is one of the few squares in Paris to be officially named after a couple. The pair lived close to the square at 42 rue Bonaparte.

<text>Year 227 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Flaccus and Regulus (or, less frequently, year 527 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 227 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

* Queen Teuta of Illyria finally surrenders to Roman forces and is forced by the Romans to accept an ignominious peace. The Romans allow her to continue her reign but restrict her to a narrow region around the Illyrian capital, Shkodra, deprive her of all her other territory, and forbid her to sail an armed ship below Lissus just south of the capital. They also require her to pay an annual tribute and to acknowledge the final authority of Rome.

==== Greece ====
* The Macedonian regent, Antigonus III, marries the former king Demetrius II&#x27;s widow, Phthia, and assumes the crown thus deposing the young Philip V.
* The Spartan King Cleomenes III imposes reforms on his kingdom which include the cancelling of debts, providing land for 4,000 citizens, and restoring the training of youth in the martial arts. The Ephorate, five elected magistrates who, with the King, form the main executive body of the state, is abolished (four of the five ephors being executed); the powers of the Gerousia, the oligarchic council of elders, is curtailed; and the (the board of six elders) is introduced. Cleomenes&#x27; changes are designed to make the monarchy supreme and re-create a society of aristocrats, while neglecting Sparta&#x27;s helots (serfs) and perioikoi (free but non-citizen inhabitants). Eighty opponents of the reforms are exiled, while his brother Eucleidas is installed as co-ruler in the place of the murdered Archidamus V.
* Cleomenes III defeats the Achaeans under Aratus of Sicyon at Mount Lycaeum and at Ladoceia near Megalopolis.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Sardinia and Corsica are made a combined province. Rome appoints, and in the future annually elects, two praetors (with autocratic consular powers) for this province and for Sicily.
* Gaius Flaminius becomes Rome&#x27;s first governor of Sicily.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Antiochus Hierax tries to raise revolts against his brother Seleucus II in Syria and the east of the Seleucid kingdom. However, he is captured and exiled to Thrace, where he lives as a virtual prisoner.

==== China ====
* The Qin generals Wang Jian, Li Xin and Wang Ben invade the State of Yan in vengeance for an assassination attempt against the king of Qin, Ying Zheng, that had been organized by Crown Prince Dan.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>Man Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890 – November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his pioneering photography, and was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. He is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called &quot;rayographs&quot; in reference to himself.

==Biography==
===Background and early life===
During his career, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray, and his 1963 autobiography &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; contains few dates.

Man Ray was born Emmanuel Radnitzky in South Philadelphia on August 27, 1890. He was the eldest child of Russian Jewish immigrants Melach &quot;Max&quot; Radnitzky, a tailor, and Manya &quot;Minnie&quot; Radnitzky (née Lourie or Luria). He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dorothy &quot;Dora&quot; and Essie (or Elsie), the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled at 372 Debevoise St. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray; Sam chose this surname in reaction to the antisemitism prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was nicknamed &quot;Manny&quot;, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.
Man Ray&#x27;s father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray&#x27;s mother enjoyed designing the family&#x27;s clothes and inventing patchwork items from scraps of fabric. Man Ray wished to distance himself from his family background, but tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. Mannequins, flat irons, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, swatches of fabric, and other items related to tailoring appear in much of his work, and art historians have noted similarities between Ray&#x27;s collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.

Mason Klein, curator of the exhibition &quot;Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York, suggests that Man Ray may have been &quot;the first Jewish avant-garde artist.&quot;

Man Ray was the uncle of the photographer Naomi Savage, who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.

===First artistic endeavors===
Man Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn&#x27;s Boys&#x27; High School from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to local art museums. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray&#x27;s parents were disappointed by their son&#x27;s decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family&#x27;s modest living quarters so that Ray&#x27;s room could be his studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a commercial artist and was a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.

The surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at Alfred Stieglitz&#x27;s 291 gallery and works by the Ashcan School. However, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into much of his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled at the Ferrer Centre in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development. The Centre, established and run by anarchists in memory of the executed Catalan anarchist educationalist Francisco Ferrer, provided classes in drawing and lectures on art-criticism. There Emma Goldman noted &quot;a spirit of freedom in the art class which probably did not exist anywhere else in New York at that time.&quot; Man Ray exhibited works in the Centre&#x27;s 1912-13 group exhibition, with his painting &quot;A Study in Nudes&quot; reproduced in a review of the show in the Centre&#x27;s associated magazine &quot;The Modern School&quot;. This may have been Man Ray&#x27;s first published art work, and the magazine would go on to print his first published poem (&quot;Travail&quot;) in 1913. During this period he also contributed illustrations to radical publications, including providing the cover-art for two 1914 issues of Emma Goldman&#x27;s journal Mother Earth.

Man Ray&#x27;s work at this time was influenced by the avant-garde practices of European contemporary artists he was introduced to at the 1913 Armory Show. His early paintings display facets of cubism. After befriending Marcel Duchamp, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer&#x27;s skirts in &quot;The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows&quot; (1916).

In 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after taking up residence at an art colony in Grantwood, New Jersey. His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918, after initially picking up the camera to document his own artwork.

Man Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with the radical Dada movement. He published two Dadaist periodicals, that each only had one issue, &quot;The Ridgefield Gazook&quot; (1915) and &quot;TNT&quot; (1919), the latter co-edited by Adolf Wolff and Mitchell Dawson. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of &quot;Rope Dancer&quot;, he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he worked with readymades—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His readymade &quot;The Gift&quot; (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and &quot;Enigma of Isidore Ducasse&quot; is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. &quot;Aerograph&quot; (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.

In 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make his &quot;Rotary Glass Plates&quot;, one of the earliest examples of kinetic art. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, and Duchamp founded the Société Anonyme, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of modern art in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to Yale University Art Gallery.

Man Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of &quot;New York Dada&quot; in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada&#x27;s experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York. He wrote that &quot;Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival.&quot;

In 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.

===Paris===
In July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, settling in the Montparnasse quarter favored by many artists. His accidental rediscovery of the cameraless photogram, which he called &quot;rayographs&quot;, resulted in mysterious images hailed by Tristan Tzara as &quot;pure Dada creations&quot;.

Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Alice Prin (popularly known as &quot;Kiki de Montparnasse&quot;), an artists&#x27; model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Prin was Man Ray&#x27;s companion for most of the 1920s, and became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images. She also starred in his experimental films &quot;Le Retour à la raison&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de mer&quot;.

In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer Lee Miller. She was also his photographic assistant and, together, they reinvented the photographic technique of solarization. Miller left him in 1932.

From late 1934 until August 1940, Man Ray was in a relationship with Adrienne Fidelin. She was a Guadeloupean dancer and model and she appears in many of his photographs. When Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family. Unlike the artist&#x27;s other significant muses, Fidelin had until 2022 largely been written out of his life story.

Man Ray was a pioneering photographer in Paris for two decades between the wars. Many significant members of the art world, such as Pablo Picasso, Tristan Tzara, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Salvador Dalí, Peggy Guggenheim, Bridget Bate Tichenor, Luisa Casati, and Antonin Artaud, posed for his camera. His international fame as a portrait photographer is reflected in a series of photographs of Maharajah Yashwant Rao Holkar II and his wife Sanyogita Devi from their visit to Europe in 1927. In the winter of 1933, surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim, known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a printing press.

His practice of photographing African objects in the Paris collections of Paul Guillaume and Charles Ratton and others led to several iconic photographs, including &quot;Noire et blanche&quot;. As Man Ray scholar Wendy A. Grossman has illustrated, &quot;no one was more influential in translating the vogue for African art into a Modernist photographic aesthetic than Man Ray.&quot;

Man Ray was represented in the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Georges Malkine, André Masson, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled &quot;Object to Be Destroyed&quot;, and the &quot;Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot;, a stunning photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse, styled after the painter/musician Ingres. &quot;Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot; is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.

Man Ray directed a number of influential avant-garde short films, known as &quot;Cinéma Pur&quot;. He directed &quot;Le Retour à la Raison&quot; (2 mins, 1923); &quot;Emak-Bakia&quot; (16 mins, 1926); &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de Mer&quot; (15 mins, 1928); and &quot;Les Mystères du Château de Dé&quot; (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film &quot;Anemic Cinema&quot; (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on Fernand Léger&#x27;s &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; (1924). In René Clair&#x27;s film &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing chess with Duchamp. Duchamp, Man Ray, and Francis Picabia were all friends and collaborators, connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.

===Hollywood===
The Second World War forced Man Ray to return to the United States. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951, where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, he met Juliet Browner, a first-generation American of Romanian-Jewish lineage. She was a trained dancer who studied dance with Martha Graham, and an experienced artists&#x27; model. They married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning. They were also close friends with Black Dahlia suspect George Hodel and his second wife Dorothy Harvey (also known as Dorero). George Hodel’s son Steve Hodel even proposes that the staging of the murder was an homage to Man Ray’s surrealist creations. In 1948 Ray had a solo exhibition at the Copley Galleries in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the &quot;Shakespearean Equations&quot; series.

===Later life===
Man Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Férou near the Jardin du Luxembourg, where he continued his creative practice across mediums. During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later Arturo Schwarz.

In 1963, he published his autobiography, &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (republished in 1999).
Ray continued to work on new paintings, photographs, collages and art objects until his death from a lung infection, in Paris, on November 18, 1976. He was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris, his epitaph reads &quot;Unconcerned, but not indifferent&quot;. When Juliet died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads &quot;Together again&quot;. Juliet organized a trust for Ray&#x27;s work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure&#x27;s disrepair. Most of its contents were stored at the Centre Pompidou museum.

==Innovations==
Man Ray was responsible for several technical innovations in modern art, filmmaking, and photography. These included his use of photograms to produce surrealist images he called &quot;Rayograms&quot;, and solarization (rediscovered with Lee Miller). His 1923 experimental film &quot;Le Retour à la raison&quot; was the first &#x27;cine-rayograph&#x27;, a motion picture made without the use of a camera. Ray&#x27;s 1935 &quot;Space Writing (Self-Portrait)&quot; was the first light painting, predating Picasso&#x27;s 1949 light paintings, photographed by Gjon Mili, by fourteen years.

==Accolades==
In 1974, Man Ray received the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship &quot;in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.&quot; In 1999, &quot;ARTnews&quot; magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, &quot;his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, collage, assemblage and prototypes of what would eventually be called performance art and conceptual art.&quot; &quot;ARTnews&quot; further stated that &quot;Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a creative intelligence that, in its &#x27;pursuit of pleasure and liberty&#x27;, unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would.&quot;

==Art market==
Man Ray&#x27;s &quot;Le Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot; (1924), a famed photograph depicting a nude Alice Prin&#x27;s back overlaid with a violin&#x27;s f-holes, sold for $12.4 million on May 14, 2022, setting a new world record as the most expensive photograph ever to be sold at auction. The sale came after a drawn-out bidding period that lasted nearly ten minutes during Christie&#x27;s New York&#x27;s auction dedicated to Surrealist art.

On November 9, 2017, Man Ray&#x27;s &quot;Noire et Blanche&quot; (1926), formerly in the collection of Jacques Doucet, was purchased at Christie&#x27;s Paris for €2,688,750 (US$3,120,658), becoming (at that time) the 14th most expensive photograph to ever sell at auction. This was a record not only for Man Ray&#x27;s work in the photographic medium but also for the sale at auction of any vintage photograph.

Only two other works by Man Ray in any medium have commanded more at auction than the price captured by the 2017 sale of &quot;Noire et blanche.&quot; His 1916 canvas &quot;Promenade&quot; sold for $5,877,000 on November 6, 2013, at the Sotheby&#x27;s New York Impressionist &amp; Modern Art Sale. And on November 13, 2017, his assemblage titled &quot;Catherine Barometer&quot; (1920), sold for $3,252,500 at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

==Legacy==
&quot;Self-Portrait&quot; was republished in 1999.

In March 2013, Man Ray&#x27;s photograph &quot;Noire et Blanche&quot; (1926) was featured in the US Postal Service&#x27;s &quot;Modern Art in America&quot; series of stamps.

Irish actor Frank Bourke is set to play Man Ray in the 2025 television series This Is Not A Murder Mystery.

<text>The North Island ( , &#x27;the fish of Māui&#x27;, officially North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui or historically New Ulster) is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the larger but less populous South Island by Cook Strait. With an area of , it is the world&#x27;s 14th-largest island, constituting 43% of New Zealand&#x27;s land area. It has a population of which is % of New Zealand&#x27;s residents, making it the most populous island in Polynesia and the 28th-most-populous island in the world.

Twelve main urban areas (half of them officially cities) are in the North Island. From north to south, they are Whangārei, Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Gisborne, New Plymouth, Napier, Hastings, Whanganui, Palmerston North, and New Zealand&#x27;s capital city Wellington, which is located at the south-west tip of the island.

==Naming and usage==
The island has been known in English as the North Island for many years. The official Māori name for it, (&quot;the fish of Māui&quot;), also has official recognition but it remains seldom used by most residents. Other Māori names include &quot;Te Ahi no Māui&quot; (&quot;the fire of Māui&quot;, as first recorded by Captain James Cook in 1770) and &quot;Aotearoa&quot; (&quot;land of the long white cloud&quot;), which is more frequently applied to New Zealand as a whole. On some 19th-century maps, the North Island was named New Ulster (named after Ulster province in northern Ireland), which was also a province of New Zealand that included the North Island.

In 2009 the New Zealand Geographic Board found that, along with the South Island, the North Island had no official name. After a public consultation, the board officially named it &quot;North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui&quot; in October 2013. The official Māori name was chosen on the basis that it was &quot;most common and consistent usage in oral tradition by Māori living on the island&quot;.

In prose, the two main islands of New Zealand are called &quot;the North Island&quot; and &quot;the South Island&quot;, with the definite article. It is also normal to use the preposition &quot;in&quot; rather than &quot;on&quot;, for example &quot;Hamilton is in the North Island&quot;, &quot;my mother lives in the North Island&quot;. Maps, headings, tables, and adjectival expressions use &quot;North Island&quot; without &quot;the&quot;.

==Māori mythology==

According to Māori mythology, the North and South Islands of New Zealand arose through the actions of the demigod Māui. Māui and his brothers were fishing from their canoe (the South Island) when he caught a great fish and pulled it right up from the sea. While he was not looking, his brothers fought over the fish and chopped it up. This great fish became the North Island, and thus a Māori name for the North Island is Te Ika-a-Māui (&quot;The Fish of Māui&quot;). The mountains and valleys are believed to have been formed as a result of Māui&#x27;s brothers&#x27; hacking at the fish.

During Captain James Cook&#x27;s voyage between 1769 and 1770, Tahitian navigator Tupaia accompanied the circumnavigation of New Zealand. The maps described the North Island as &quot;Ea Heinom Auwe&quot; and &quot;Aeheinomowe&quot;, which recognises the &quot;Fish of Māui&quot; element. Names of certain tribes like Muaūpoko (&quot;mua upoko&quot; &quot;front of the head&quot;) and Muriwhenua (&quot;muri whenua&quot;, &quot;backland&quot;) also reflect the locations of their settlement in this &quot;fish&quot; as well as levels of seniority between tribes.

Another Māori name that was given to the North Island, but is now used less commonly, is Aotearoa. Use of Aotearoa to describe the North Island fell out of favour in the early 20th century, and it is now a collective Māori name for New Zealand as a whole.

== Geography ==

During the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the North and South islands were connected by a vast coastal plain which formed at the South Taranaki Bight. During this period, most of the North Island was covered in thorn scrubland and forest, while the modern-day Northland Peninsula was a subtropical rainforest. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking the Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.

== Demographics ==
The North Island has an estimated population of as of .

The North Island had a population of 3,808,005 at the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 213,453 people (5.9%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 570,957 people (17.6%) since the 2013 census. Of the total population, 733,893 people (19.3%) were aged under 15 years, 743,154 (19.5%) were 15 to 29, 1,721,427 (45.2%) were 30 to 64, and 609,534 (16.0%) were 65 or older.

Ever since the conclusion of the Otago gold rush in the 1860s, New Zealand&#x27;s European population growth has experienced a steady &#x27;Northern drift&#x27; as population centres in the North Island have grown faster than those of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. This population trend has continued into the twenty-first century, but at a much slower rate. While the North Island&#x27;s population continues to grow faster than the South Island, this is solely due to the North Island having higher natural increase (i.e. births minus deaths) and international migration; since the late 1980s, the internal migration flow has been from the North Island to the South Island. In the year to June 2020, the North Island gained 21,950 people from natural increase and 62,710 people from international migration, while losing 3,570 people from internal migration.

=== Culture and identity ===
At the 2023 census, 63.1% of North Islanders identified as European (Pākehā), 19.8% as Māori, 10.6% as Pacific peoples, 19.3% as Asian, 1.9% as Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, and 1.1% as other ethnicities. Percentages add to more than 100% as people can identify with more than one ethnicity.

Māori form the majority in three districts of the North Island: Kawerau (63.2%), Ōpōtiki (66.2%) and Wairoa (68.5%). Europeans formed the plurality in the Auckland region (49.8%) and are the majority in the remaining 39 districts.

The proportion of North Islanders born overseas at the 2018 census were 29.3%. The most common foreign countries of birth were England (15.4% of overseas-born residents), Mainland China (11.3%), India (10.1%), South Africa (5.9%), Australia (5.5%) and Samoa (5.3%).

===Cities and towns===

The North Island has a larger population than the South Island, with the country&#x27;s largest city, Auckland, and the capital, Wellington, accounting for nearly half of it.

There are 30 urban areas in the North Island with a population of 10,000 or more:
==Economy==
The sub-national GDP of the North Island was estimated at NZ$ 282.355 billion in 2021 (78% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP).

== Governance ==

=== Regions ===
Nine local government regions cover the North Island and its adjacent islands and territorial waters.

*Northland
*Auckland
*Waikato
*Bay of Plenty
*Gisborne
*Taranaki
*Manawatū-Whanganui
*Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region
*Wellington Region

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in the North Island is provided by fifteen District Health Boards (DHBs). Organised around geographical areas of varying population sizes, they are not coterminous with the Local Government Regions.

<doc id="62047" wikidata="Q6929825" url="?curid=62047" title="Mrs. Miniver's problem">
<text>Mrs. Miniver&#x27;s problem is a geometry problem about the area of circles. It asks how to place two circles formula_1 and formula_2 of given radii in such a way that the lens formed by intersecting their two interiors has equal area to the symmetric difference of formula_1 and formula_2 (the area contained in one but not both circles). It was named for an analogy between geometry and social dynamics enunciated by fictional character Mrs. Miniver, who &quot;saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles&quot;. Its solution involves a transcendental equation.

==Origin==
The problem derives from &quot;A Country House Visit&quot;, one of Jan Struther&#x27;s newspaper articles appearing in the &quot;Times of London&quot; between 1937 and 1939 featuring her character Mrs. Miniver. According to the story:

She saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles. It would seem at first glance that the more they overlapped the better the relationship; but this is not so. Beyond a certain point the law of diminishing returns sets in, and there are not enough private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is shared. Probably perfection is reached when the area of the two outer crescents, added together, is exactly equal to that of the leaf-shaped piece in the middle. On paper there must be some neat mathematical formula for arriving at this; in life, none.

Louis A. Graham and Clifton Fadiman formalized the mathematics of the problem and popularized it among recreational mathematicians.

==Solution==
The problem can be solved by cutting the lune along the line segment between the two crossing points of the circles, into two circular segments, and using the formula for the area of a circular segment to relate the distance between the crossing points to the total area that the problem requires the lune to have. This gives a transcendental equation for the distance between crossing points but it can be solved numerically. There are two boundary conditions whose distances between centers can be readily solved: the farthest apart the centers can be is when the circles have equal radii, and the closest they can be is when one circle is contained completely within the other, which happens when the ratio between radii is formula_5. If the ratio of radii falls beyond these limiting cases, the circles cannot satisfy the problem&#x27;s area constraint.

In the case of two circles of equal size, these equations can be simplified somewhat. The rhombus formed by the two circle centers and the two crossing points, with side lengths equal to the radius, has an angle formula_6 radians at the circle centers, found by solving the equation formula_7 from which it follows that the ratio of the distance between their centers to their radius is formula_8.

<doc id="62049" wikidata="Q120755" url="?curid=62049" title="South Island">
<text>The South Island ( , &#x27;the waters of Greenstone&#x27;) is the largest of the three major islands of New Zealand in surface area, the others being the smaller but more populous North Island and sparsely populated Stewart Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, to the south by the Foveaux Strait and Southern Ocean, and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers , making it the world&#x27;s 12th-largest island, constituting 56% of New Zealand&#x27;s land area. At low altitudes, it has an oceanic climate. The major centres are Christchurch, with a metropolitan population of 521,881, and the smaller Dunedin (population 134,600). The economy relies on agriculture, fishing, tourism, and general manufacturing and services.

Prior to European settlement, Te Waipounamu was sparsely populated by three major iwi, Kāi Tahu, Kāti Māmoe, and the historical Waitaha, with major settlements including in Kaiapoi Pā near modern-day Christchurch. During the Musket Wars expanding iwi colonised Te Tau Ihu, a region comprising parts of modern-day Tasman, Nelson and Malborough, including Ngāti Kuia, Rangitāne, Ngāti Tama, and later Ngāti Toarangatira after Te Rauparaha&#x27;s wars of conquest. British settlement began with expansive and cheap land purchases early on, and settlers quickly outnumbered Māori. As a result the Wairau Affray was the only conflict of the New Zealand Wars to occur in the South Island. The island became rich and prosperous and Dunedin boomed during the 1860s Otago gold rush, which was shaped by extensive Chinese immigration. After the gold rush the &quot;drift to the north&quot; meant the North Island displaced the South as the most populous.

The South Island is shaped by the Southern Alps, which run along the island from north to south. They include New Zealand&#x27;s highest peak, Aoraki / Mount Cook, at . The high Kaikōura Ranges lie to the northeast. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains, while the West Coast is renowned for its rough coastlines, such as Fiordland, a very high proportion of native bush and national parks, and the Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers. 

With a population of as of the South Island is home to % of New Zealand&#x27;s million inhabitants. After the 1860s gold rushes in the early stages of European settlement of the country, the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth. The North Island&#x27;s population overtook the South Island&#x27;s in the early 20th century, with 56% of the New Zealand population living in the North Island in 1911. The drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the twentieth century.

==Naming and usage==
The island has been known in English as the South Island for many years. The Te Reo Māori name for it now also has official recognition. The name is most often translated to mean &quot;the water(s) of pounamu&quot;, but possibly evolved from &quot;Te Wāhi Pounamu&quot; (&quot;the place of pounamu&quot;). It was first recorded in English by Captain James Cook on his voyage to New Zealand in 1769. North Island iwi alternatively used the name &quot;Te Waka-a-Māui&quot; (&quot;the canoe of Māui&quot;) for the South Island.

In the 19th century, some maps identified the South Island as &quot;Middle Island&quot; or &quot;New Munster&quot; (named after Munster province in Southern Ireland) with the name &quot;South Island&quot; or &quot;New Leinster&quot; was used for today&#x27;s Stewart Island / Rakiura. In 1907, the Minister for Lands gave instructions to the Land and Survey Department that the name Middle Island was not to be used in the future. &quot;South Island will be adhered to in all cases&quot;.

Although the island had been known as the South Island for many years, in 2009 the New Zealand Geographic Board found that along with the North Island, the South Island had no official name. After a public consultation, the board officially named the island &quot;South Island or Te Waipounamu&quot; in October 2013.

In prose, the two main islands of New Zealand are called &quot;the North Island&quot; and &quot;the South Island&quot;, with the definite article. It is also normal to use the preposition &quot;in&quot; rather than &quot;on&quot;, for example &quot;Christchurch is in the South Island&quot;, &quot;my mother lives in the South Island&quot;. Maps, headings, tables, and adjectival expressions use &quot;South Island&quot; without &quot;the&quot;.

As it is 32% larger than the North Island but contains less than a quarter of the country&#x27;s population, the South Island is sometimes humorously nicknamed the &quot;mainland&quot; of New Zealand by its residents.

==Māori mythology==

The island is also known as &quot;Te Waka a Māui&quot; which means &quot;Māui&#x27;s Canoe&quot;. In some modern alliterations of Māori legends, the South Island existed first, as the boat of Māui, while the North Island was the fish that he caught. 

Various Māori iwi sometimes use different names, with some preferring to call the South Island &quot;Te Waka o Aoraki&quot;, referring to another Māori legend called the story of Aoraki, as after the world was created, Aoraki and his three brothers came down in a waka to visit their mother, Papatūānuku the earth mother, only to crash after failing to perform a karakia on their way back home to their father, Ranginui (also known as Raki) the sky father, in turn causing the waka to transform into an island and the four brothers into the mountain ranges on top of it.

==History==





=== Pre-history ===
Charcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in over 550 different locations across the South Island. Stretching from Kaikōura to North Otago, the drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles. Some of the birds pictured are long extinct, including moa and Haast&#x27;s eagles. They were drawn by early Māori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local Māori did not know the origins of the drawings.

=== Classical Māori period ===
Early inhabitants of the South Island were the Waitaha. They were largely absorbed via marriage and conquest by the Kāti Māmoe in the 16th century.

Kāti Māmoe were in turn largely absorbed via marriage and conquest by the Kāi Tahu who migrated south in the 17th century. While today there is no distinct Kāti Māmoe organisation, many Kāi Tahu have Kāti Māmoe links in their whakapapa and especially in the far south of the island.

Around the same time, a group of Māori migrated to &quot;Rēkohu&quot; (the Chatham Islands), where, in adapting to the local climate and the availability of resources, they eventually evolved into a separate people known as the Moriori with its own distinct language – closely related to the parent culture and language in mainland New Zealand. One notable feature of the Moriori culture, an emphasis on pacifism, proved disadvantageous when Māori warriors arrived in the 1830s aboard a chartered European ship.

In the early 18th century, Kāi Tahu, a Māori tribe who originated on the east coast of the North Island, began migrating to the northern part of the South Island. There they and Kāti Māmoe fought Ngāi Tara and Rangitāne in the Wairau Valley. Ngāti Māmoe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River to Kāi Tahu. Kāi Tahu continued to push south, conquering Kaikōura. By the 1730s, Kāi Tahu had settled in Canterbury, including Banks Peninsula. From there they spread further south and into the West Coast.

In 1827–28, Ngāti Toa under the leadership of Te Rauparaha successfully attacked Kāi Tahu at Kaikōura. Ngāti Toa then visited Kaiapoi Pā, ostensibly to trade. When they attacked their hosts, the well-prepared Kāi Tahu killed all the leading Ngāti Toa chiefs except Te Rauparaha. Te Rauparaha returned to his Kapiti Island stronghold. In November 1830, Te Rauparaha persuaded Captain John Stewart of the brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot; to carry him and his warriors in secret to Akaroa, whereby in subterfuge they captured the leading Kāi Tahu chief, Tama-i-hara-nui, and his wife and daughter. After destroying Tama-i-hara-nui&#x27;s village, they took their captives to Kapiti and killed them. John Stewart, though arrested and sent to trial in Sydney as an accomplice to murder, nevertheless escaped conviction.

In the summer of 1831–32 Te Rauparaha attacked the Kaiapoi pā (fortified village). Kaiapoi was engaged in a three-month siege by Te Rauparaha, during which his men successfully sapped the pā. They then attacked Kāi Tahu on Banks Peninsula and took the pā at Onawe. In 1832–33 Kāi Tahu retaliated under the leadership of Tūhawaiki and others, attacking Ngāti Toa at Lake Grassmere. Kāi Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ngāti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped. Fighting continued for a year or so, with Kāi Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ngāti Toa never again made a major incursion into Kāi Tahu territory.

In 1836, the Ngāti Tama chief Te Pūoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass. They fell on the Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and Lake Hāwea, capturing ten people and killing and eating two children. Te Puoho took his captives over the Crown Range to Lake Wakatipu and thence to Southland, where he was killed, and his war party destroyed by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Tūhawaiki.

Kāi Tahu and Ngāti Toa established peace by 1839, with Te Rauparaha releasing the Kāi Tahu captives he held. Formal marriages between the leading families in the two tribes sealed the peace.

=== European contact ===
The first Europeans known to reach the South Island were the crew of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman who arrived in his ships &quot;Heemskerck&quot; and &quot;Zeehaen&quot;. In December 1642, Tasman anchored at the northern end of the island in Golden Bay / Mohua which he named Moordenaar&#x27;s Bay (Murderers Bay) before sailing northward to Tonga following a clash with Māori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands&#x27; west coasts. Tasman called them &quot;Staten Landt&quot;, after the &quot;States General of the Netherlands&quot;, and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. Dutch cartographers changed the name to &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot; in Latin, from &quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot;, after the Dutch province of &quot;Zeeland&quot;. It was subsequently Anglicised as &quot;New Zealand&quot; by British naval captain James Cook of HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; who visited the islands more than 100 years after Tasman during (1769–70).

The first European settlement in the South Island was founded at Bluff in 1823 by James Spencer, a veteran of the Battle of Waterloo.

In January 1827, the French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville arrived in Tasman Bay on the corvette Astrolabe. A number of landmarks around Tasman Bay were named by d&#x27;Urville and his crew, including d&#x27;Urville Island, French Pass and Torrent Bay.

=== European settlement ===
Following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840, Lieutenant-Governor Captain William Hobson declared British sovereignty over New Zealand in May 1840 and the South Island, along with the rest of New Zealand, briefly became a part of the Colony of New South Wales. This declaration was in response to France&#x27;s attempts to colonise the South Island at Akaroa and the New Zealand Company attempts to establish a separate colony in Wellington, and so Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840 (the North Island by treaty and the South by discovery). Seven days after the declaration, the Treaty was signed at Akaroa on 28 May.

On 17 June 1843, Māori and British settlers clashed at Wairau in what became known as the Wairau Affray. Also known as the Wairau Massacre in most older texts, it was the first serious clash of arms between the two parties after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and the only one to take place in the South Island. Four Māori died and three were wounded in the incident, while among the Europeans the toll was 22 dead and five wounded. Twelve of the Europeans were shot dead or clubbed to death after surrendering to Māori who were pursuing them.

The Otago Settlement, sponsored by the Free Church of Scotland, took concrete form in Otago in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from Greenock (on the Firth of Clyde) – the &quot;John Wickliffe&quot; and the &quot;Philip Laing&quot;. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the Peninsular War, served as the colony&#x27;s first leader: Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of Superintendent of the Province of Otago.

While the North Island was convulsed by the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s, the South Island, with its low Māori population, was generally peaceful. In 1861, gold was discovered at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully in Central Otago, sparking a gold rush. Dunedin became the wealthiest city in the country, and many in the South Island resented financing the North Island&#x27;s wars.

In the 1860s, several thousand Chinese men, mostly from the Guangdong province, migrated to New Zealand to work on the South Island goldfields. Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the Otago Provincial government, they quickly became the target of hostility from white settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand.

==Government and politics==


The South Island has no separately represented country subdivision, but is guaranteed 16 of the electorates in the New Zealand House of Representatives. A two-tier structure constituted under the Local Government Act 2002 gives the South Island (and its adjacent islands) seven regional councils for the administration of regional environmental and transport matters and 25 territorial authorities that administer roads, sewerage, building consents, and other local matters. Four of the territorial councils (one city and three districts) also perform the functions of a regional council and are known as unitary authorities under the New Zealand government.

When New Zealand was separated from the colony of New South Wales in 1841 and established as a Crown colony in its own right, the Royal Charter effecting this provided that &quot;the principal Islands, heretofore known as, or commonly called, the &#x27;Northern Island&#x27;, the Middle Island&#x27;, and &#x27;Stewart&#x27;s Island&#x27;, shall henceforward be designated and known respectively as &#x27;New Ulster&#x27;, &#x27;New Munster&#x27;, and &#x27;New Leinster&#x27;&quot;.

These divisions were of geographical significance only, not used as a basis for the government of the colony, which was centralised in Auckland. New Munster consisted of the South Island. The name New Munster was given by the Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, in honour of Munster, the Irish province in which he was born.

The situation was altered in 1846 when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 divided the colony into two provinces: New Ulster Province (the North Island north of the mouth of the Patea River), and New Munster Province (and the southern portion of the North Island, up to the mouth of the Patea River, the South Island and Stewart Island). Each province had a Governor and Legislative and Executive Council, in addition to the Governor-in-Chief and Legislative and Executive Council for the whole colony. The 1846 Constitution Act was later suspended, and only the provincial government provisions were implemented. Early in 1848 Edward John Eyre was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster.

The Provincial Council of New Munster had only one legislative session, in 1849, before it succumbed to the virulent attacks of settlers from Wellington. Governor Sir George Grey, sensible to the pressures, inspired an ordinance of the General Legislative Council under which new Legislative Councils would be established in each province with two-thirds of their members elected on a generous franchise. Grey implemented the ordinance with such deliberation that neither Council met before advice was received that the United Kingdom Parliament had passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852.

This act dissolved these provinces in 1853, after only seven years&#x27; existence, and New Munster was divided into the provinces of Wellington Province, Canterbury, Nelson, and Otago. Each province had its own legislature known as a Provincial Council that elected its own Speaker and Superintendent.

Secession movements have surfaced several times in the South Island. A Premier of New Zealand, Sir Julius Vogel, was amongst the first people to make this call, which was voted on by the New Zealand Parliament as early as 1865. The desire for the South Island to form a separate colony was one of the main factors in moving the capital of New Zealand from Auckland to Wellington that year.

Several South Island nationalist groups emerged at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st. The South Island Party fielded candidates in the 1999 general election but cancelled its registration in 2002. Several internet-based groups advocate their support for greater self-determination.

On 13 October 2010, South Island Mayors led by Bob Parker of Christchurch displayed united support for a Southern Mayoral Council. Supported by Waitaki Mayor Alex Familton and Invercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt, Bob Parker said that increased cooperation and the forming of a new South Island-wide mayoral forum were essential to representing the island&#x27;s interests in Wellington and countering the new Auckland Council.

===Administrative divisions===
There are 23 territorial authorities within the South Island: 4 city councils and 19 district councils. Three territorial authorities (Nelson City Council, and the Tasman and Marlborough District Councils) also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are known as unitary authorities.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===

Compared to the more populated and multi-ethnic North Island, the South Island has a smaller, more homogeneous resident population of 

The South Island had a population of 1,185,282 at the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 80,745 people (7.3%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 180,882 people (18.0%) since the 2013 census. Of the total population, 202,311 people (17.1%) were aged under 15 years, 225,048 (19.0%) were 15 to 29, 538,965 (45.5%) were 30 to 64, and 218,958 (18.5%) were 65 or older.

At the 2018 census, there were 571,656 males and 577,914 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female.

In the early years of European settlement in New Zealand, the South Island&#x27;s overall percentage of the New Zealand population was far higher, equalling or even exceeding the population of the North Island. This was exacerbated by the New Zealand Wars and the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. Since that time, the South Island&#x27;s population as a percentage of the country&#x27;s total population has steadily decreased, with the population of the South island now being less than that of the North Island&#x27;s largest city, Auckland. This growing disparity has stabilised in recent years, with both the 2013 and 2018 censuses showing the South Island to have a very similar percentage of the national population (around 23%–24%).

=== Culture and identity ===

At the 2023 census, 82.8% of South Islanders identified as European (Pākehā), 11.3% as Māori, 3.4% as Pacific peoples, 10.5% as Asian, 1.6% as Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, 1.4% as other ethnicities. Percentages add to more than 100% as people can identify with more than one ethnicity. 

Europeans form the majority in all districts of the South Island, ranging from 75.9% in Christchurch City to 92.1% in the Waimakariri district. 

The proportion of South Islanders born overseas at the 2018 census was 21.4%. The most common foreign countries of birth are England (22.0% of overseas-born residents), Australia (8.8%), the Philippines (7.9%), Mainland China (6.5%) and India (5.4%).

Around 48.6 percent of South Islanders affiliate with Christianity and 3.1 percent affiliate with non-Christian religions, while 45.8 percent are irreligious. Anglicanism is the largest Christian denomination in the South Island with 12.7 percent affiliating, closely followed by Catholicism at 12.1 percent and Presbyterianism at 11.7 percent. These figures are somewhat skewed between the regions of the south, due largely to the original settlement of southern cities (Dunedin, for example, was founded by Scottish Presbyterians, whereas Christchurch was founded by English Anglicans).
===Urbanisation===
The South Island is sparsely populated and still predominantly rural areas or nature reserves. However, there are 15 urban areas in the South Island with a population of 10,000 or more:


==Economy==


The South Island economy is strongly focused on tourism and primary industries like agriculture. The other main industry groups are manufacturing, mining, construction, energy supply, education, health and community services.

The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the South Island was estimated at NZ$78.94 billion in the year to March 2022, 21.9% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $65,875 in the same period.

===Energy===

The South Island is a major centre for electricity generation, especially in the southern half of the island, and especially from hydroelectricity. In 2010, the island generated of electricity, 41.5% of New Zealand&#x27;s total electricity generation. Nearly all (98.7%) of the island&#x27;s electricity is generated by hydroelectricity, primarily from the Waitaki, Clutha, and Manapouri schemes, with most of the remainder coming from wind generation. While the majority of electricity is consumed within the island, a significant percentage is exported to the North Island via the HVDC Inter-Island link.

Offshore oil and gas is likely to become an increasingly important part of the South Island economy into the future. Origin Energy has formed a joint venture with Anadarko Petroleum, the second-largest independent U.S. natural gas producer, to begin drilling for oil in the Canterbury Basin off the coast of Dunedin. The 390 km2, Carrack/Caravel prospect has the potential to deliver more than the equivalent of of oil and gas. Market analyst, Greg Easton from Craigs Investment Partners commented that such a substantial find it could well turn Dunedin from the Edinburgh of the south to the Aberdeen of the south.

The Great South Basin off the coast of Otago and Southland at over (covering an area 1.5 times New Zealand&#x27;s landmass) is one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest undeveloped offshore petroleum basins with prospects for both oil and gas. In July 2007, the New Zealand Government awarded oil and gas exploration permits for four areas of the Great South Basin, situated in the volatile waters off the Southern Coast of New Zealand. The three successful permit holders are:
* a consortium led by ExxonMobil New Zealand (Exploration) Limited (United States) which includes local company Todd Exploration Limited (New Zealand);
* a consortium led by OMV New Zealand Limited (Austria) which includes PTTEP Offshore Investment Company Ltd (Thailand), Mitsui Exploration and Production Australia Pty Ltd (Japan); and
* Greymouth Petroleum Limited (New Zealand)

===Stock exchanges===
Due to the gold rushes of the 1860s, the South Island had regional stock exchanges in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill – all of which were affiliated to the Stock Exchange Association of New Zealand. However, in 1974 these regional exchanges were amalgamated to form one national stock exchange, the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). Separate trading floors operated in both Christchurch and Dunedin until the late 1980s. On 30 May 2003, New Zealand Stock Exchange Limited formally changed its name to New Zealand Exchange Limited, trading as NZX.

Today, the Deloitte South Island Index is compiled quarterly from publicly available information provided by NZX, Unlisted and Bloomberg. It is a summary of the movements in market capitalisation of each South Island-based listed company. A company is included in the Index where either its registered office and/or a substantial portion of its operations are focused on the South Island.

===Trade unions===

There are several South Island-based trade union organisations. They are:

* Furniture, Manufacturing &amp; Associated Workers Union
* New Zealand Building Trades Union
* New Zealand Meat &amp; Related Trades Workers Union
* Southern Amalgamated Workers&#x27; Union

==Tourism==

Tourism is a huge earner for the South Island. Popular tourist activities include sightseeing, adventure tourism, such as glacier climbing and Bungee jumping, tramping (hiking), kayaking, and camping. Numerous walking and hiking paths, including six of the New Zealand Great Walks, are located in the South Island and are renowned internationally.

An increase in direct international flights to Christchurch, Dunedin and Queenstown has boosted the number of overseas tourists.

Fiordland National Park, Abel Tasman National Park, Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, Queenstown, Kaikōura, and the Marlborough Sounds are regarded as the main tourism destinations in the South Island and amongst the Top 10 destinations in New Zealand.

==Transport==


===Road transport===

The South Island has a State Highway network of .

===Rail transport===

The South Island&#x27;s railway network has two main lines, two secondary lines, and a few branch lines. The Main North Line from Picton to Christchurch and the Main South Line from Lyttelton to Invercargill via Dunedin together constitute the South Island Main Trunk Railway. The secondary Midland Line branches from the Main South Line in Rolleston and passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel to the West Coast and its terminus in Greymouth. In Stillwater, it meets the other secondary route, the Stillwater - Westport Line, which now includes the Ngakawau Branch.

A number of other secondary routes are now closed, including the Otago Central Railway, the isolated Nelson Section, and the interdependent Waimea Plains Railway and Kingston Branch. An expansive network of branch lines once existed, especially in Canterbury, Otago, and Southland, but these are now almost completely closed. The branch lines that remain in operation serve ports (Bluff Branch and Port Chalmers Branch), coal mines (Ohai Branch and Rapahoe Branch), and a dairy factory (Hokitika Branch). The first 64 km of the Otago Central Railway remain in operation for tourist trains run by Dunedin Railways (formerly Taieri Gorge Railway). The most significant freight is coal from West Coast mines to the port of Lyttelton for export.

Passenger services were once extensive. Commuter trains operated multiple routes around Christchurch and Dunedin, plus a service between Invercargill and Bluff. Due to substantial losses, these were cancelled between the late 1960s and early 1980s. The final services to operate ran between Dunedin&#x27;s City Centre and the suburb of Mosgiel, and they ceased in 1982. Regional passenger trains were once extensive, but are now limited to the Coastal Pacific from Christchurch to Picton and the TranzAlpine from Christchurch to Greymouth.

The Southerner between Christchurch and Invercargill, once the flagship of the network, was cancelled on 10 February 2002. Subsequently, the architecturally significant Dunedin Railway Station has been used solely by the TGR&#x27;s tourist trains, the Taieri Gorge Limited along the Otago Central Railway and the Seasider to Palmerston. Rural passenger services on branch lines were provided by mixed trains and Vulcan/88 seater railcars but the mixeds had largely ceased to exist by the 1950s and the railcars were withdrawn in the mid-1970s.

The South Island saw the final use of steam locomotives in New Zealand. Locomotives belonging to classes long withdrawn elsewhere continued to operate on West Coast branches until the very late 1960s, when they were displaced by DJ class diesels. In comparison to most countries, where steam locomotives were last used on insubstantial rural and industrial operations, the last services run by steam locomotives were the premier expresses between Christchurch and Invercargill: the South Island Limited until 1970 and the Friday and Sunday night services until 1971. This was due to the carriages being steam-heated. The final steam-hauled service in New Zealand, headed by a member of the JA class, ran on 26 October 1971.

===Water transport===

The South Island is separated from the North Island by Cook Strait, which is wide at its narrowest point, and requires a ferry trip to cross.

Dunedin was the headquarters of the Union Steam Ship Company, once the largest shipping company in the Southern Hemisphere.

====Ports and harbours====
*Container ports: Lyttelton (Christchurch), Port Chalmers (Dunedin)
*Other ports: Nelson, Picton, Westport, Greymouth, Timaru, Bluff.
*Harbours: Akaroa Harbour, Otago Harbour, Halfmoon Bay (Stewart Island / Rakiura), Milford Sound / Piopiotahi.
*Freshwater: Queenstown and Kingston (Lake Wakatipu), Te Anau and Manapouri (Lake Manapouri)

==Geography==

The South Island, with an area of , is the largest landmass of New Zealand; it contains about one-quarter of the New Zealand population and is the world&#x27;s 12th-largest island. It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps, the highest peak of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at , making it 9th-highest island, with the high Kaikōura Ranges to the northeast. There are eighteen peaks of more than in the South Island. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains while the West Coast is renowned for its rough coastlines such as Fiordland, a very high proportion of native bush, and Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers.
The dramatic landscape of the South Island has made it a popular location for the production of several films, including &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. It lies at similar latitudes to Tasmania (an island south of the Australian mainland), and parts of Patagonia in South America.

===Geology===

On 4 September 2010, the South Island was struck by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, which caused extensive damage, several power outages, and many reports of aftershocks. Five and a half months later, 22 February Christchurch earthquake of 6.3 magnitude caused far more additional damage in Christchurch, resulting in 181 deaths. This quake struck at about lunchtime and was centred closer at Lyttelton, and shallower than the prior quake, consequently causing extensive damage.

===Climate===

The climate in the South Island is mostly temperate. The mean temperature for the South Island is . January and February are the warmest months, while July is the coldest. Historical maxima and minima are in Rangiora, Canterbury and in Ranfurly, Otago.

Conditions vary sharply across the regions, from extremely wet on the West Coast to semi-arid in the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury. Most areas have between of rainfall with the most rain along the West Coast and the least rain on the East Coast, predominantly on the Canterbury Plains. Christchurch is the driest city, receiving about of rain per year, while Invercargill is the wettest, receiving about . The southern and south-western parts of South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours of sunshine annually; the northern and north-eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours.

===Natural geographic features===

====Fiords====

The South Island has 15 named maritime fiords which are all located in the southwest of the island in a mountainous area known as Fiordland. The spelling &#x27;fiord&#x27; is used in New Zealand rather than &#x27;fjord&#x27;, although all the maritime fiords use the word Sound in their name instead.

A number of lakes in the Fiordland and Otago regions also fill glacial valleys. Lake Te Anau has three western arms, which are fiords (and are named so). Lake McKerrow / Whakatipu Waitai to the north of Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is a fiord with a silted-up mouth. Lake Wakatipu fills a large glacial valley, as do lakes Hakapoua, Poteriteri, Monowai and Hauroko in the far south of Fiordland. Lake Manapouri has fiords as its west, north and south arms.

The Marlborough Sounds, a series of deep indentations in the coastline at the northern tip of the South Island, are in fact rias, drowned river valleys.

====Glaciers====


Most of New Zealand&#x27;s glaciers are in the South Island. They are generally found in the Southern Alps near the Main Divide.

An inventory of South Island glaciers during the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least . About a sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10 hectares. These include the Fox and Franz Josef glaciers on the West Coast, and the Haupapa / Tasman, Hooker, Mueller and Murchison glaciers in the east.

====Lakes====


There are some 3,820 lakes in New Zealand with a surface area larger than one hectare. Much of the higher country in the South Island was covered by ice during the glacial periods of the last two million years. Advancing glaciers eroded large steep-sided valleys, and often carried piles of moraine (rocks and soil) that acted as natural dams. When the glaciers retreated, they left basins that are now filled by lakes. The level of most glacial lakes in the upper parts of the Waitaki and Clutha / Mata-Au rivers are controlled for electricity generation. Hydroelectric reservoirs are common in South Canterbury and Central Otago, the largest of which is Lake Benmore, on the Waitaki River.

The South Island has 8 of New Zealand&#x27;s 10 biggest lakes. They were formed by glaciers and include Lake Wakatipu, Lake Tekapo and Lake Manapouri. The deepest (462 m) is Lake Hauroko, in western Southland. It is the 16th deepest lake in the world. Millions of years ago, Central Otago had a huge lake – Lake Manuherikia. It was slowly filled in with mud, and fossils of fish and crocodiles have been found there.

====Volcanoes====

There are four extinct volcanoes in the South Island, all located on the east coast.

Banks Peninsula forms the most prominent of these volcanic features. Geologically, the peninsula comprises the eroded remnants of two large shield volcanoes (Lyttelton formed first, then Akaroa). These formed due to intraplate volcanism between about eleven and eight million years ago (Miocene) on a continental crust. The peninsula formed as offshore islands, with the volcanoes reaching to about 1,500 m above sea level. Two dominant craters formed Lyttelton / Whakaraupō and Akaroa Harbours.

The Canterbury Plains formed from the erosion of the Southern Alps (an extensive and high mountain range caused by the meeting of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates) and from the alluvial fans created by large braided rivers. These plains reach their widest point where they meet the hilly sub-region of Banks Peninsula. A layer of loess, a rather unstable fine silt deposited by the foehn winds which bluster across the plains, covers the northern and western flanks of the peninsula. The portion of the crater rim lying between Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō and Christchurch city forms the Port Hills.

The Otago Harbour was formed from the drowned remnants of a giant shield volcano, centred close to what is now the town of Port Chalmers. The remains of this violent origin can be seen in the basalt of the surrounding hills. The last eruptive phase ended some ten million years ago, leaving the prominent peak of Mount Cargill.

Timaru was constructed on rolling hills created from the lava flows of the extinct Mount Horrible, which last erupted many thousands of years ago.

====Te Wāhipounamu World Heritage Site====

Te Wāhipounamu (Māori for &quot;the place of greenstone&quot;) is a World Heritage Site in the south-west corner of the South Island.

Inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1990, it covers and incorporates the Aoraki / Mount Cook, the Fiordland, the Mount Aspiring and the Westland Tai Poutini National Parks.

It is thought to contain some of the best modern representations of the original flora and fauna present in Gondwanaland, one of the reasons for listing as a World Heritage Site.

===Protected areas===

====Forest parks====

There are six forest parks in the South Island that are on public land administered by the Department of Conservation.
; Catlins Forest Park : Situated in the Southland region.
; Craigieburn Forest Park : Situated in the Canterbury Region, its boundaries lie in part alongside and is adjacent to the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps. The Broken River Ski Area and the Craigieburn Valley Ski Area lie within its borders. The New Zealand Forest Service had used the area as an experimental forestry area and there is now an environmental issue with the spread of wilding conifers.
; Hanmer Forest Park : Situated in the Canterbury Region.
; Lake Sumner Forest Park : Situated in the Canterbury Region.
; Mount Richmond Forest Park : Situated in the Marlborough region.
; Victoria Forest Park : Situated in the West Coast region.

====National parks====
The South Island has ten national parks established under the National Parks Act 1980 and which are administered by the Department of Conservation.

From north to south, the National Parks are:
; Kahurangi National Park : (4,520 km2, established 1996) Situated in the north-west of the South Island, Kahurangi comprises spectacular and remote country and includes the Heaphy Track. It has ancient landforms and unique flora and fauna. It is New Zealand&#x27;s second-largest national park.
; Abel Tasman National Park : (225 km2, established 1942) Has numerous tidal inlets and beaches of golden sand along the shores of Tasman Bay. It is New Zealand&#x27;s smallest national park.
; Nelson Lakes National Park : (1,018 km2, established 1956) A rugged, mountainous area in Nelson Region. It extends southwards from the forested shores of Lake Rotoiti and Rotoroa to the Lewis Pass National Reserve.
; Paparoa National Park : (306 km2, established 1987) On the West Coast of the South Island between Westport and Greymouth. It includes the celebrated Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki.
; Arthur&#x27;s Pass National Park : (1,144 km2, established 1929) A rugged and mountainous area straddling the main divide of the Southern Alps.

==Natural history==

During the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the North and South Islands were connected by a vast coastal plain which formed at the South Taranaki Bight. Similarly, the South Island and Stewart Island / Rakiura were connected by coastal plains which covered modern-day Foveaux Strait. During this period, most of the South Island was covered in grassland and glaciers, compared to the woodlands and rainforest which grew in the more temperate North Island. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking the Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.

===Birds===

There are several bird species which are endemic to the South Island. They include the kea, great spotted kiwi, Okarito brown kiwi, South Island kōkako, South Island pied oystercatcher, Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet, king shag, takahē, black-fronted tern, South Island robin, rock wren, wrybill, and yellowhead.

Many South Island bird species are now extinct, mainly due to hunting by humans and predation by cats and rats introduced by humans. Extinct species include the South Island goose, South Island giant moa, Haast&#x27;s eagle and South Island piopio.

==Tertiary education==
The South Island has three universities, and five polytechnic schools. 

* Ara Institute of Canterbury (the result of a merger between Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) and Aoraki Polytechnic)

Since 2020, the polytechnics are branches of the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology.

==Healthcare==


Healthcare in the South Island is provided by five District Health Boards (DHBs). Organised around geographical areas of varying population sizes, they are not coterminous with the Local Government Regions.
There are six major hospitals in the South Island: Christchurch Hospital, Dunedin Hospital, Grey Base Hospital (Greymouth), Nelson Hospital, Southland Hospital (Invercargill), and Timaru Hospital. Christchurch Hospital, Dunedin Hospital and Wellington Hospital (in the North Island) are the main tertiary hospitals serving the South Island.

Anglicanism is strongest in Canterbury (the city of Christchurch having been founded as an Anglican settlement).

Catholicism still has a noticeably strong presence on the West Coast, and in Kaikōura. The territorial authorities with the highest proportion of Catholics are Kaikōura (where they are 18.4% of the total population), Westland (18.3%), and Grey (17.8%).

Presbyterianism is strong in the lower South Island – the city of Dunedin was founded as a Presbyterian settlement, and many of the early settlers in the region were Scottish Presbyterians. The territorial authorities with the highest proportion of Presbyterians are Gore (where they are 30.9% of the total population), Clutha District (30.7%), and Southland (29.8%).

The first Muslims in New Zealand were Chinese gold diggers working in the Dunstan gold fields of Otago in the 1860s. Dunedin&#x27;s Al-Huda mosque is the world&#x27;s southernmost, and the farthest from Mecca.

===Law enforcement===

====Police====


The New Zealand Police is the primary law enforcement agency of New Zealand, including the South Island. Three decentralised Police Districts cover the entire South Island, with each being commanded by a Superintendent and having a central station from which subsidiary and suburban stations are managed. The Christchurch Police Communications Centre handles all emergency and general calls within the South Island.

The Tasman Police District covers 70,000 kilometres of territory, encompassing the northern and most of the western portion of the South Island. The West Coast alone spans the distance between Wellington and Auckland. There are 22 police stations in the Tasman District, with 6 being sole-charge – or one-person – stations. The Tasman Police District has a total of 302 sworn police officers and 57 civilian or nonsworn staff. Organisationally, the district has its headquarters in Nelson and has three distinct Areas, each headed by an Inspector as its commander. The areas are Nelson Bays, West Coast and Marlborough.

The Canterbury Police District is based in Christchurch the largest city in the South Island and covers an area extending from the Conway River, (just south of Kaikōura), to the Waitaki River, south of Timaru.

The Southern Police District with its headquarters in Dunedin spans from Oamaru in the North through to Stewart Island in the far South covers the largest geographical area of any of the 12 police districts in New Zealand. The Southern District has three distinct Areas headed by Inspectors; Otago Rural, Southland and Dunedin.

<doc id="62062" wikidata="Q1413317" url="?curid=62062" title="Sacred prostitution">
<text>Sacred prostitution, temple prostitution, cult prostitution, and religious prostitution are purported rites consisting of paid intercourse performed in the context of religious worship, possibly as a form of fertility rite or divine marriage (). Scholars prefer the terms &quot;sacred sex&quot; or &quot;sacred sexual rites&quot; in cases where payment for services is not involved.

The historicity of literal sacred prostitution, particularly in some places and periods, is a controversial topic within the academic world. Historically mainstream historiography has considered it a probable reality, based on the abundance of ancient sources and chroniclers detailing its practices, although it has proved harder to differentiate between true prostitution and sacred sex without remuneration. Beginning in the late 20th century, a number of scholars have challenged the veracity of sacred prostitution as a concept, suggesting that the claims are based on mistranslations, misunderstandings or outright inventions of ancient authors. Authors have also interpreted evidence as secular prostitution administered in the temple under the patronage of fertility deities, not as an act of religious worship by itself.

== Definitions ==
Sacred prostitution has many different characteristics depending on the region, class and the religious ideals of the period and the place, and consequently can have many different definitions. One definition that was developed was due to the common types of sacred prostitution that are recorded in Classical sources: sale of a woman&#x27;s virginity or rinni in honor of a goddess or a once-in-a-lifetime prostitution, professional prostitutes or slaves owned by a temple or sanctuary, and temporary prostitution that occurs before a marriage or during certain rituals.

==Ancient Near East==

Ancient Near Eastern societies along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers featured many shrines and temples or &quot;houses of heaven&quot; dedicated to various deities. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus&#x27;s account and some other testimony from the Hellenistic Period and Late Antiquity suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in Babylonia and Cyprus, but throughout the Near East.

The work of gender researchers like Daniel Arnaud, Julia Assante and Stephanie Budin has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth, arguing that the practices described in the sources were misunderstandings of either non-remunerated ritual sex or non-sexual religious ceremonies, or possibly even invented as rhetorical devices.

===Sumer===
Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite (&quot;hieros gamos&quot;) was staged between the kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of Sumer and the high priestesses of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, later called Ishtar. The king would have sex with the priestess to represent the union of Dumuzid with Inanna. According to the noted Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer, the kings would further establish their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival Akitu.

However, no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included, despite many popular descriptions of the habit. It is possible that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Ancient Near Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess Ishtar often speak of them as running , offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god Utu, and receiving a royal crown from An, all in a single day. Some modern historians argue in the same direction, though their posture has been disputed.

===Babylonia===
According to Herodotus, the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:

The British anthropologist James Frazer accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890–1915), and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public defloration of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite. However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of Late Antiquity (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or Hellenistic periods. This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalised to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did.

In Hammurabi&#x27;s code of laws, the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected. The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.

===Terms associated with temple prostitution in Sumer and Babylonia===
All translations are sourced from the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary. Akkadian terms were used in the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, and Babylonia. The terms themselves come from lexical profession lists on tablets dating back to the Early Dynastic period.
Notes on the cuneiform: by convention Akkadian is italicised, spoken Sumerian is lowercase and cuneiform sign transliteration is uppercase. In addition, a determinative sign is written as a superscript. Determinatives are only written and never spoken. In spoken Sumerian homophones are distinguished by a numerical subscript.

===Hittites===
The Hittites practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.

===Phoenicia===
It has been argued that sacred prostitution, worked by both males and females, was a custom of ancient Phoenicians. It would be dedicated to the deities Astarte and Adonis, and sometimes performed as a festival or social rite in the cities of Byblos, Afqa and Baalbek (later named Heliopolis) as well as the nearby Syrian city of Palmyra.

At the Etruscan site of Pyrgi, a center of worship of the eastern goddess Astarte, archaeologists identified a temple consecrated to her and built with at least 17 small rooms that may have served as quarters for temple prostitutes. Similarly, a temple dedicated to her equated goddess Atargatis in Dura-Europos, was found with nearly a dozen small rooms with low benches, which might have used either for sacred meals or sacred services of women jailed in the temple for adultery. Pyrgi&#x27;s sacred prostitutes were famous enough to be apparently mentioned in a lost fragment of Lucilius&#x27;s works.

In northern Africa, the area of influence of the Phoenician colony of Carthage, this service was associated to the city of Sicca, a nearby city that received the name of &quot;Sicca Veneria&quot; for its temple of Astarte or Tanit (called Venus by Roman authors). Valerius Maximus describes how their women gained gifts by engaging in prostitution with visitors.

Phoenicio-Punic settlements in Hispania, like Cancho Roano, Gadir, Castulo and La Quéjola, have suggested this practice through their archaeology and iconography. In particular, Cancho Roano features a sanctuary built with multiple cells or rooms, which has been identified as a possible place of sacred prostitution in honor to Astarte. A similar institution might have been found in Gadir. Its posterior, renowned erotic dancers called &quot;puellae gaditanae&quot; in Roman sources (or &quot;cinaedi&quot; in the case of male dancers) might have been desecrated heirs of this practice, considering the role occupied by sex and dance on Phoenician culture.

Another center of cult to Astarte was Cyprus, whose main temples were located in Paphos, Amathus and Kition. The epigraphy of the Kition temple describes personal economic activity on the temple, as sacred prostitution would have been taxed as any other occupation, and names possible practitioners as &quot;grm&quot; (male) and &quot;lmt&quot; (female).

===Ancient Israel===
The Hebrew Bible uses two different words for prostitute, &quot;zonah&quot; (זונה)‎ and &quot;kedeshah&quot; (or &quot;qedesha&quot;) (קדשה)‎. The word &quot;zonah&quot; simply meant an ordinary prostitute or &quot;loose woman&quot;. But the word &quot;kedeshah&quot; literally means &quot;set apart&quot; (in feminine form), from the Semitic root &quot;Q-D-Sh&quot; (קדש)‎ meaning &quot;holy&quot;, &quot;consecrated&quot; or &quot;set apart&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;zonah&quot; and &quot;qedeshah&quot; are not interchangeable terms: the former occurs 93 times in the Bible, whereas the latter is only used in three places, conveying different connotations.

This double meaning has led to the belief that &quot;kedeshah&quot; were not ordinary prostitutes, but sacred harlots who worked out of fertility temples. However, the lack of solid evidence has indicated that the word might refer to prostitutes who offered their services in the vicinity of temples, where they could attract a larger number of clients. The term might have originated as consecrated maidens employed in Canaanite and Phoenician temples, which became synonymous with harlotry for Biblical writers.

In any case, the translation of sacred prostitute has continued, however, because it explains how the word can mean such disparate concepts as &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;prostitute&quot;. As put by DeGrado, &quot;neither the interpretation of the קדשה as a &#x27;priestess-not-prostitute&#x27; (according to Westenholz) nor as a &#x27;prostitute-not-priestess&#x27; (according to Gruber) adequately represents the semantic range of Hebrew word in biblical and post-biblical Hebrew.&quot;

Male prostitutes were called &quot;kadesh&quot; or &quot;qadesh&quot; (literally: male who is &quot;set apart&quot;). The Hebrew word &quot;keleb&quot; (dog) may also signify a male dancer or prostitute.

The Mosaic Law as outlined in the Book of Deuteronomy was not universally observed in Israelite culture under the Davidic line in the Kingdom of Israel, as recorded in the Books of Kings. According to 2 Kings 22, the Kingdom of Judah had lost &quot;the Book of the Law&quot;. During the reign of King Josiah, Hilkiah, the High Priest of Israel, discovered it in &quot;the House of the Lord&quot; and realized that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding prostitution.

== Ancient Greece and Hellenistic world ==

===Ancient Greece===
The Greek term &quot;hierodoulos&quot; or &quot;hierodule&quot; has sometimes been taken to mean &quot;sacred holy woman&quot;, but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be dedicated to a god.

There were different levels of prostitutes within Ancient Greek society, but two categories are specifically related to sacred or temple prostitution. The first category are &quot;hetaires&quot;, also known as courtesans, typically more educated women that served within temples. The second category are known as &quot;hierodoules&quot;, slave women or female priests who worked within temples and served the sexual requests of visitors to the temple.

While there may not be a direct connection between temples and prostitution, many prostitutes and courtesans worshipped Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Prostitutes would use their earnings to pay for dedications and ritualistic celebrations in honour of Aphrodite. Some prostitutes also viewed the action of sexual service and sexual pleasure as an act of devotion to the goddess of love, worshipping Aphrodite through an act rather than a physical dedication.

In the temple of Apollo at Bulla Regia, a woman was found buried with an inscription reading: &quot;Adulteress. Prostitute. Seize [me], because I fled from Bulla Regia.&quot; It has been speculated she might have been a woman forced into sacred prostitution as a punishment for adultery.

==== Temple(s) of Aphrodite ====
The act of sacred prostitution within the Temples of Aphrodite in the city of Corinth was well-known and well-spread. Greek writer-philosopher Strabo comments, &quot;the Temple of Aphrodite was so rich that it owned a thousand temple-slaves, courtesans, whom both men and women had dedicated to the goddess&quot;. Within the same work, Strabo compares Corinth to the city of Comana, confirming the belief that temple prostitution was a notable characteristic of Corinth.

Prostitutes performed sacred functions within the temple of Aphrodite. They would often burn incense in honor of Aphrodite. Chameleon of Heracleia recorded in his book, &quot;On Pindar&quot;, that whenever the city of Corinth prayed to Aphrodite in manners of great importance, many prostitutes were invited to participate in the prayers and petitions.

The girls involved in temple prostitution were typically slaves owned by the temple. However, some of the girls were gifted to the temple from other members of society in return for success in particular endeavors. One example that shows the gifting of girls to the temple is the poem of Athenaeus, which explores an athlete Xenophon’s actions of gifting a group of courtesans to Aphrodite as a thanks-offering for his victory in a competition.

Specifically in 464 BC, Xenophon was victorious in the Olympic Games and donated 100 slaves to Aphrodite’s temple. Pindar, a famous Greek poet, was commissioned to write a poem that was to be performed at Xenophon’s victory celebration in Corinth. The poet acknowledged that the slaves would serve Aphrodite as sacred prostitutes within her temple at Corinth.

Another temple of Aphrodite was named Aphrodite Melainis, located near the city gates in an area known as “Craneion”. It is the resting place of Lais, who was a famous prostitute in Greek history. This suggests that there was a connection with ritual prostitution within temples of Aphrodite.

There is a report that was found of an epigram of Simonides commemorating the prayer of the prostitutes of Corinth on behalf of the salvation of the Greeks from the invading Achaemenid Empire in the Greco-Persian Wars of the early fifth century BCE. Both temple prostitutes and priestesses prayed to Aphrodite for help, and were honoured for their potent prayers, which Greek citizens believed contributed to the repelling of the Persians.

Athenaeus also alludes to the idea that many of Aphrodite’s temples and sanctuaries were occupied by temple prostitutes. These prostitutes were known to practise sexual rituals in different cities which included Corinth, Magnesia, and Samos.

==== Signs of sacred prostitution within Minoan Crete ====
Some evidence of sacred prostitution was evident in Minoan Crete. The building in question is known as the &quot;East Building&quot;, but was also referred to as &quot;the House of the Ladies&quot; by the excavator of the building. Some believe that the architecture of this building seemed to reflect the grooming needs of women, but could also have been a brothel for high status individuals.

The structure of the interior of the building seemed to suggest that the building was used for prostitution. Large clay vats typically used for bathing were found within the building, along with successive doors within the corridors. The successive doors suggested privacy, and within the time period, was associated with two functions: storage of valuable goods and protection of the private moments of its residents. Because the ground floors were found practically empty, the possibility that the building was used for prostitution increases.

There were also religious embellishments found within the &quot;East Building&quot;, such as vases and other vessels that seemed to be connected to religious rituals. The vessels were covered in motifs related to sacrilegious rituals, such as the sacral knot and the image of birds flying freely. The functions of the vessels would have been offering food or liquid in relation to the rituals. Combining these two factors, it is a possibility that sacred prostitution existed within this building.

===Hellenistic world===
In the Greek-influenced and colonised world, &quot;sacred prostitution&quot; was known in Cyprus (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), Sicily (Hellenised since 750 BC), in the Kingdom of Pontus (8th century BC) and in Cappadocia (c. 330 BC hellenised). 2 Maccabees () describes sacred prostitution in the Second Temple under the reign of the Hellenistic ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

==== Cyprus ====
A passage in Herodotus explains a Babylonian custom where before marriage, girls had to offer themselves for sex, presumably within a temple, as required by rites of a goddess equivalent to Aphrodite in their culture. Herodotus records that a similar practice or custom took place within Cyprus, with girls offering themselves up for sex as required by the rites of Aphrodite. Ennius and Ovid corroborate each other on the idea that Aphrodite established the act of prostitution within the city of Cyprus.

A temple of Kition also shows evidence of sacred prostitution. On a marble plaque, it lists sacred prostitutes among other professions (bakers, scribes, barbers) that were part of ritual personnel at some Cypriot temples.

==== Temple of Aphaca ====
The temple of Aphaca may be another source of evidence for temple prostitution. The process is similar to regular prostitution, where male customers paid two or three obol in the form of or in addition to dedications to Aphrodite in exchange for sex with a temple prostitute. In the temple of Aphaca specifically, the men would dedicate their payment to &quot;Cyprian Aphrodite&quot; before engaging in sex with a temple prostitute.

==Ancient Rome and late antiquity==
===Ancient Rome===
===Late antiquity===
The Roman emperor Constantine closed down a number of temples to Venus or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian Eusebius proudly noted. Eusebius also writes that the Phoenician cities of Aphaca and Heliopolis (Baalbek) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor Constantine put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.

==Asia==

===India===

People in some Indian states practice hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi, and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a Hindu deity or a Hindu temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. The Devadasis were originally seen as intercessors who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. Before Muslim rule in the 14th century, they could live an existence apart from the men, with inheritance rights, wealth and influence, as well as living outside of the dangers of marriage.

The system was criticised by British colonial government while defended by Brahmins, leading to a decline in support for the system and the devadasis soon turned to prostitution. Many scholars have stated that the Hindu scriptures do not mention the system. Human Rights Watch also reports claims that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practise prostitution for upper-caste members. Various state governments in India enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India&#x27;s independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988. However, the tradition continues in certain regions of India, particularly the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

=== Indonesia ===
===Japan===
During the Kamakura period, many shrines and temples, which provided for , fell into bankruptcy. Some miko started travelling in search of livelihood and came to be known as (歩き巫女 lit. walking shrine-maiden). While aruki miko primarily provided religious services, they were also widely associated with prostitution. However, no religious reasons for miko prostitution are known, and hence the act might be unrelated to sacred prostitution.

=== Nepal ===

The Deukis are temple prostitutes in Nepal. The practice is banned but still exists. Wealthier families from the Kanari, Thakuri and Bista buy girls from poorer families to be dedicated to a temple and are not allowed to marry.

==Mesoamerica and South America==
===Maya===
The Maya maintained several phallic religious cults, possibly involving homosexual temple prostitution.

===Aztec===
Much evidence for the religious practices of the Aztec culture was destroyed during the Spanish conquest, and almost the only evidence for the practices of their religion is from Spanish accounts. The Franciscan Spanish Friar Bernardino de Sahagún learned their language and spent more than 50 years studying the culture. He wrote that they participated in religious festivals and rituals, as well as performing sexual acts as part of religious practice. This may be evidence for the existence of sacred prostitution in Mesoamerica, or it may be either confusion, or accusational polemic. He also speaks of kind of prostitutes named &quot;ahuianime&quot; (&quot;pleasure girls&quot;), whom he described as &quot;an evil woman who finds pleasure in her body... [A] dissolute woman of debauched life.&quot;

It is agreed that the Aztec god Xochipili (taken from both Toltec and Maya cultures) was both the patron of homosexuals and homosexual prostitutes. Xochiquetzal was worshiped as goddess of sexual power, patroness of prostitutes and artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.

===Inca===
The Inca sometimes dedicated young boys as temple prostitutes. The boys were dressed in girl&#x27;s clothing, and chiefs and head men would have ritual sexual intercourse with them during religious ceremonies and on holy days.

==Recent Western occurrences==
In the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practised sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts. Among them was the cult Children of God, also known as The Family, who called this practice &quot;Flirty Fishing&quot;. They later abolished the practice due to the growing AIDS epidemic.

In Ventura County, California, Wilbur and Mary Ellen Tracy established their own temple, the &quot;Church Of The Most High Goddess&quot;, in the wake of what they described as a divine revelation. Sexual acts played a fundamental role in the church&#x27;s sacred rites, which were performed by Mary Ellen Tracy herself in her assumed role of High Priestess. Local newspaper articles about the Neopagan church quickly got the attention of local law enforcement officials, and in April 1989, the Tracys&#x27; house was searched and the couple arrested on charges of pimping, pandering and prostitution. They were subsequently convicted in a trial in state court and sentenced to jail terms: Wilbur Tracy for 180 days plus a $1,000.00 fine; Mary Ellen Tracy for 90 days plus mandatory screening for STDs.

Some modern sacred prostitutes act as sexual surrogates as a form of therapy. In places where prostitution is illegal, sacred prostitutes may be paid as therapists, escorts, or performers.

==Modern views==
According to Avaren Ipsen, from University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women, the myth of sacred prostitution works as &quot;an enormous source of self-esteem and as a model of sex positivity&quot; to many sex workers. She compared this situation to the figure of Mary Magdalene, whose status as a prostitute, though short-lived according to Christian texts and disputed among academics, has been celebrated by sex working collectives (among them Sex Workers Outreach Project USA) in an effort to de-stigmatize their job. Ipsen speculated that academic currents trying to deny sacred prostitution are ideologically motivated, attributing them to the &quot;desires of feminists, including myself, to be &#x27;decent.&#x27;&quot;

In her book &quot;The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine&quot;, psychoanalyst Nancy Qualls-Corbett praised sacred prostitution as an expression of female sexuality and a bridge between the latter and the divine, as well as a rupture from mundane sexual degradation. &quot;[The sacred prostitute] did not make love in order to obtain admiration or devotion from the man who came to her... She did not require a man to give her a sense of her own identity; rather this was rooted in her own womanliness.&quot; Qualls also equated censuring sacred prostitution to demonize female sexuality and vitality. &quot;In her temple, men and women came to find life and all that it had to offer in sensual pleasure and delight. But with the change in cultural values and the institutionalization of monotheism and patriarchy, the individual came to the House of God to prepare for death.&quot;

This opinion is shared by several schools of modern Paganism, among them Wicca, for whom sacred prostitution, independently from its historical backing, embodies the sacralization of sex and a celebration of the communion between female and male sexuality. This practice is associated to spiritual healing and sex magic. Within secular thinking, philosopher Antonio Escohotado is a popular adept of this current, favoring particularly the role of ancient sacred prostitutes and priestesses of Ishtar. In his seminal work &quot;Rameras y esposas&quot;, he extols them and their cult as symbols of female empowerment and sexual freedom.

Actress Susie Lamb approached sacred prostitution in her 2014 performance &quot;Horae: Fragments of a Sacred History of Prostitution&quot;, in which she points out its value to challenge gender roles. &quot;The idea of sacred prostitution is almost entirely incomprehensible to the modern imagination. It involved women having sex as an act of worship... The relationship between men and women in this ancient tradition is based on respect for the woman. She was seen as a powerful person.&quot;

<doc id="62063" wikidata="Q391632" url="?curid=62063" title="Cher Ami">
<text>Cher Ami (French for &quot;dear friend&quot;, in the masculine) was a male homing pigeon known for his military service during World War I, especially the Meuse-Argonne offensive in October 1918. He is famous for delivering a message alerting American forces to the location of the Lost Battalion, despite sustaining severe injuries. To American school children of the 1920s and 1930s, Cher Ami was as well known as any human World War I hero.

== Background and early life ==
Homing pigeons have been used for millennia to carry messages due to their innate ability to navigate home. They were used extensively as messengers during World War I, with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom having established pigeon messenger services before World War I broke out. 

At the request of General John Pershing, the U.S. Army Signal Corps&#x27; Pigeon Service was established in November 1917. Cher Ami was one of 600 English-bred birds donated to the Pigeon Service on May 20, 1918. 

It is unknown exactly when Cher Ami hatched, though it was likely in late March or early April of 1918. Cher Ami&#x27;s identification band is stamped with &quot;NURP 18 EAD 615,&quot; meaning he was a &quot;National Union Racing Pigeon&quot; and born in 1918. EAD refers to the registered breeder&#x27;s loft, and may suggest he hatched at the loft of E. A. Davidson in Norfolk, England. 

==World War I service==
After arriving at the Pigeon Service&#x27;s headquarters, Cher Ami was one of 60 pigeons assigned to Mobile Loft No. 11. On September 21, the loft was relocated to Rampont, France in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The birds of Mobile Loft No. 11 supported the 77th Infantry Division into and through the Argonne Forest.

On October 4, 1918, Major Charles White Whittlesey and more than 550 men were trapped in a small depression on the side of the hill behind enemy lines without food or ammunition. They were also beginning to receive friendly fire from allied troops who did not know their location. Surrounded by the Germans, many were killed and wounded and only 194 men were still alive and not captured or wounded by the end of the engagement. Because his runners were consistently intercepted or killed by the Germans, Whittlesey began dispatching messages by pigeon. The pigeon carrying the first message, &quot;Many wounded. We cannot evacuate.&quot; was shot down. A second bird was sent with the message, &quot;Men are suffering. Can support be sent?&quot; That pigeon also was shot down. The artillery batteries supporting Whittlesey&#x27;s men attempted to provide a &quot;barrage of protection&quot; for Whittlesey&#x27;s men on the northern slope of the Charlevaux Ravine, but believed Whittlesey was on the southern slope of the ravine, resulting in a barrage inadvertently targeting the battalion. &quot;Cher Ami&quot; was dispatched with a note, written on onion paper, in a canister on his right leg,

As Cher Ami tried to fly back home, the Germans saw him rising out of the brush and opened fire. After several seconds, he was shot down but managed to take flight again. He arrived back at his loft at division headquarters 25 miles (40 km) to the rear in just 25 minutes, about 5 minutes after the shelling had ceased. He had been shot through the breast, blinded in one eye, and had a leg hanging only by a tendon.

Cher Ami became the hero of the 77th Infantry Division. Army medics worked to save his life. When he recovered enough to travel, the now one-legged bird was put on a boat to the United States, with General John J. Pershing seeing him off.

== Retirement ==
On April 16, 1919, Cher Ami arrived in the United States.

== Death and legacy ==
Cher Ami died at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, on June 13, 1919, from the wounds he received in battle. Following his death, the U.S. Army Signal Corps donated his remains to the Smithsonian Institution. Taxidermist Nelson R. Wood at the National Museum of Natural History prepared Cher Ami for display.

When the Smithsonian requested information about Cher Ami, the Signal Corps reported they could not find any war record of Cher Ami being the pigeon &quot;which carried the message from The Lost Battalion.&quot; Listing the known details of the bird, the Army, without explanation, described Cher Ami as &quot;he&quot; and the Smithsonian&#x27;s label reflected the bird&#x27;s sex as a cock bird.

In 2021, the National Museum of American History, together with the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Zoo, had DNA samples from Cher Ami analyzed which concluded the bird is a cock bird. 

Since 1921, Cher Ami has been on display at the Smithsonian Institution, then the United States National Museum. Today, he is on display in the National Museum of American History exhibit &quot;The Price of Freedom: Americans at War.&quot;

==Awards==
The pigeon was awarded the Croix de Guerre Medal with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for his heroic service in delivering 12 important messages in Verdun and was later inducted into the Racing Pigeon Hall of Fame in 1931. He also received a gold medal from the Organized Bodies of American Racing Pigeon Fanciers in recognition of his service during World War I.

In November 2019, he became the second recipient of the Animals in War &amp; Peace Medal of Bravery, bestowed posthumously at a ceremony on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

<text>In computer programming, the scope of a name binding (an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable) is the part of a program where the name binding is valid; that is, where the name can be used to refer to the entity. In other parts of the program, the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). Scope helps prevent name collisions by allowing the same name to refer to different objects – as long as the names have separate scopes. The scope of a name binding is also known as the visibility of an entity, particularly in older or more technical literature—this is in relation to the referenced entity, not the referencing name.

The term &quot;scope&quot; is also used to refer to the set of &quot;all&quot; name bindings that are valid within a part of a program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as &quot;context&quot; or &quot;environment&quot;.

Strictly speaking and in practice for most programming languages, &quot;part of a program&quot; refers to a portion of source code (area of text), and is known as lexical scope. In some languages, however, &quot;part of a program&quot; refers to a portion of run time (period during execution), and is known as dynamic scope. Both of these terms are somewhat misleading—they misuse technical terms, as discussed in the definition—but the distinction itself is accurate and precise, and these are the standard respective terms. Lexical scope is the main focus of this article, with dynamic scope understood by contrast with lexical scope.

In most cases, name resolution based on lexical scope is relatively straightforward to use and to implement, as in use one can read backwards in the source code to determine to which entity a name refers, and in implementation one can maintain a list of names and contexts when compiling or interpreting a program. Difficulties arise in name masking, forward declarations, and hoisting, while considerably subtler ones arise with non-local variables, particularly in closures.

== Definition ==
The strict definition of the (lexical) &quot;scope&quot; of a name (identifier) is unambiguous: lexical scope is &quot;the portion of source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies&quot;. This is virtually unchanged from its 1960 definition in the specification of ALGOL 60. Representative language specifications follow:

; ALGOL 60 (1960)
: The following kinds of quantities are distinguished: simple variables, arrays, labels, switches, and procedures. The scope of a quantity is the set of statements and expressions in which the declaration of the identifier associated with that quantity is valid.
; C (2007)
: An identifier can denote an object; a function; a tag or a member of a structure, union, or enumeration; a typedef name; a label name; a macro name; or a macro parameter. The same identifier can denote different entities at different points in the program. [...] For each different entity that an identifier designates, the identifier is &quot;visible&quot; (i.e., can be used) only within a region of program text called its &quot;scope.&quot;
; Go (2013)
: A declaration binds a non-blank identifier to a constant, type, variable, function, label, or package. [...] The scope of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.

Most commonly &quot;scope&quot; refers to when a given name can refer to a given variable—when a declaration has effect—but can also apply to other entities, such as functions, types, classes, labels, constants, and enumerations.

=== Lexical scope vs. dynamic scope ===
A fundamental distinction in scope is what &quot;part of a program&quot; means. In languages with lexical scope (also called static scope), name resolution depends on the location in the source code and the &quot;lexical context&quot; (also called &quot;static context&quot;), which is defined by where the named variable or function is defined. In contrast, in languages with dynamic scope, the name resolution depends upon the program state when the name is encountered which is determined by the &quot;execution context&quot; (also called &quot;runtime context&quot;, &quot;calling context&quot; or &quot;dynamic context&quot;). In practice, with lexical scope a name is resolved by searching the local lexical context, then if that fails, by searching the outer lexical context, and so on; whereas with dynamic scope, a name is resolved by searching the local execution context, then if that fails, by searching the outer execution context, and so on, progressing up the call stack.

Most modern languages use lexical scope for variables and functions, though dynamic scope is used in some languages, notably some dialects of Lisp, some &quot;scripting&quot; languages, and some template languages. Perl 5 offers both lexical and dynamic scope. Even in lexically scoped languages, scope for closures can be confusing to the uninitiated, as these depend on the lexical context where the closure is defined, not where it is called.

Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as &quot;early binding&quot;, while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus is known as &quot;late binding&quot;.

=== Related concepts ===
In object-oriented programming, dynamic dispatch selects an object method at runtime, though whether the actual name binding is done at compile time or run time depends on the language. De facto dynamic scope is common in macro languages, which do not directly do name resolution, but instead expand in place.

Some programming frameworks like AngularJS use the term &quot;scope&quot; to mean something entirely different than how it is used in this article. In those frameworks, the scope is just an object of the programming language that they use (JavaScript in case of AngularJS) that is used in certain ways by the framework to emulate dynamic scope in a language that uses lexical scope for its variables. Those AngularJS scopes can themselves be in context or not in context (using the usual meaning of the term) in any given part of the program, following the usual rules of variable scope of the language like any other object, and using their own inheritance and transclusion rules. In the context of AngularJS, sometimes the term &quot;$scope&quot; (with a dollar sign) is used to avoid confusion, but using the dollar sign in variable names is often discouraged by the style guides.

== Use ==
Scope is an important component of name resolution, which is in turn fundamental to language semantics. Name resolution (including scope) varies between programming languages, and within a programming language, varies by type of entity; the rules for scope are called scope rules (or scoping rules). Together with namespaces, scope rules are crucial in modular programming, so a change in one part of the program does not break an unrelated part.

== Overview ==

When discussing scope, there are three basic concepts: &quot;scope,&quot; &quot;extent,&quot; and &quot;context.&quot; &quot;Scope&quot; and &quot;context&quot; in particular are frequently confused: scope is a property of a name binding, while context is a property of a part of a program, that is either a portion of source code (&quot;lexical context&quot; or &quot;static context&quot;) or a portion of run time (&quot;execution context,&quot; &quot;runtime context,&quot; &quot;calling context&quot; or &quot;dynamic context&quot;). Execution context consists of lexical context (at the current execution point) plus additional runtime state such as the call stack. Strictly speaking, during execution a program enters and exits various name bindings&#x27; scopes, and at a point in execution name bindings are &quot;in context&quot; or &quot;not in context&quot;, hence name bindings &quot;come into context&quot; or &quot;go out of context&quot; as the program execution enters or exits the scope. However, in practice usage is much looser.

Scope is a source-code level concept, and a property of name bindings, particularly variable or function name bindings—names in the source code are references to entities in the program—and is part of the behavior of a compiler or interpreter of a language. As such, issues of scope are similar to pointers, which are a type of reference used in programs more generally. Using the value of a variable when the name is in context but the variable is uninitialized is analogous to dereferencing (accessing the value of) a wild pointer, as it is undefined. However, as variables are not destroyed until they go out of context, the analog of a dangling pointer does not exist.

For entities such as variables, scope is a subset of lifetime (also known as extent)—a name can only refer to a variable that exists (possibly with undefined value), but variables that exist are not necessarily visible: a variable may exist but be inaccessible (the value is stored but not referred to within a given context), or accessible but not via the given name, in which case it is not in context (the program is &quot;out of the scope of the name&quot;). In other cases &quot;lifetime&quot; is irrelevant—a label (named position in the source code) has lifetime identical with the program (for statically compiled languages), but may be in context or not at a given point in the program, and likewise for static variables—a static global variable is in context for the entire program, while a static local variable is only in context within a function or other local context, but both have lifetime of the entire run of the program.

Determining which entity a name refers to is known as name resolution or name binding (particularly in object-oriented programming), and varies between languages. Given a name, the language (properly, the compiler or interpreter) checks all entities that are in context for matches; in case of ambiguity (two entities with the same name, such as a global and local variable with the same name), the name resolution rules are used to distinguish them. Most frequently, name resolution relies on an &quot;inner-to-outer context&quot; rule, such as the Python LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule: names implicitly resolve to the narrowest relevant context. In some cases name resolution can be explicitly specified, such as by the codice_1 and codice_2 keywords in Python; in other cases the default rules cannot be overridden.

When two identical names are in context at the same time, referring to different entities, one says that &quot;name masking&quot; is occurring, where the higher-priority name (usually innermost) is &quot;masking&quot; the lower-priority name. At the level of variables, this is known as variable shadowing. Due to the potential for logic errors from masking, some languages disallow or discourage masking, raising an error or warning at compile time or run time.

Various programming languages have various different scope rules for different kinds of declarations and names. Such scope rules have a large effect on language semantics and, consequently, on the behavior and correctness of programs. In languages like C++, accessing an unbound variable does not have well-defined semantics and may result in undefined behavior, similar to referring to a dangling pointer; and declarations or names used outside their scope will generate syntax errors.

Scopes are frequently tied to other language constructs and determined implicitly, but many languages also offer constructs specifically for controlling scope.

== Levels of scope ==
Scope can vary from as little as a single expression to as much as the entire program, with many possible gradations in between. The simplest scope rule is global scope—all entities are visible throughout the entire program. The most basic modular scope rule is two-level scope, with a global scope anywhere in the program, and local scope within a function. More sophisticated modular programming allows a separate module scope, where names are visible within the module (private to the module) but not visible outside it. Within a function, some languages, such as C, allow block scope to restrict scope to a subset of a function; others, notably functional languages, allow expression scope, to restrict scope to a single expression. Other scopes include file scope (notably in C) which behaves similarly to module scope, and block scope outside of functions (notably in Perl).

A subtle issue is exactly when a scope begins and ends. In some languages, such as C, a name&#x27;s scope begins at the name declaration, and thus different names declared within a given block can have different scopes. This requires declaring functions before use, though not necessarily defining them, and requires forward declaration in some cases, notably for mutual recursion. In other languages, such as Python, a name&#x27;s scope begins at the start of the relevant block where the name is declared (such as the start of a function), regardless of where it is defined, so all names within a given block have the same scope. In JavaScript, the scope of a name declared with codice_3 or codice_4 begins at the name declaration, and the scope of a name declared with codice_5 begins at the start of the function where the name is declared, which is known as &quot;variable hoisting&quot;. Behavior of names in context that have undefined value differs: in Python use of undefined names yields a runtime error, while in JavaScript undefined names declared with codice_5 are usable throughout the function because they are implicitly bound to the value codice_7.

=== Expression scope ===
The scope of a name binding is an expression, which is known as expression scope. Expression scope is available in many languages, especially functional languages which offer a feature called &quot;let expressions&quot; allowing a declaration&#x27;s scope to be a single expression. This is convenient if, for example, an intermediate value is needed for a computation. For example, in Standard ML, if codice_8 returns codice_9, then codice_10 is an expression that evaluates to codice_11, using a temporary variable named codice_12 to avoid calling codice_8 twice. Some languages with block scope approximate this functionality by offering syntax for a block to be embedded into an expression; for example, the aforementioned Standard ML expression could be written in Perl as do { my $x = f(); $x * $x }, or in GNU C as ({ int x = f(); x * x; }).

In Python, auxiliary variables in generator expressions and list comprehensions (in Python 3) have expression scope.

In C, variable names in a function prototype have expression scope, known in this context as function protocol scope. As the variable names in the prototype are not referred to (they may be different in the actual definition)—they are just dummies—these are often omitted, though they may be used for generating documentation, for instance.

=== Block scope ===
The scope of a name binding is a block, which is known as block scope. Block scope is available in many, but not all, block-structured programming languages. This began with ALGOL 60, where &quot;[e]very declaration ... is valid only for that block.&quot;, and today is particularly associated with languages in the Pascal and C families and traditions. Most often this block is contained within a function, thus restricting the scope to a part of a function, but in some cases, such as Perl, the block may not be within a function.
unsigned int sum_of_squares(const unsigned int N) {
 unsigned int ret = 0;
 for (unsigned int n = 1; n &lt;= N; n++) {
 const unsigned int n_squared = n * n;
 ret += n_squared;
 return ret;


A representative example of the use of block scope is the C code shown here, where two variables are scoped to the loop: the loop variable n, which is initialized once and incremented on each iteration of the loop, and the auxiliary variable n_squared, which is initialized at each iteration. The purpose is to avoid adding variables to the function scope that are only relevant to a particular block—for example, this prevents errors where the generic loop variable i has accidentally already been set to another value. In this example the expression codice_14 would generally not be assigned to an auxiliary variable, and the body of the loop would simply be written codice_15 but in more complicated examples auxiliary variables are useful.

Blocks are primarily used for control flow, such as with if, while, and for loops, and in these cases block scope means the scope of variable depends on the structure of a function&#x27;s flow of execution. However, languages with block scope typically also allow the use of &quot;naked&quot; blocks, whose sole purpose is to allow fine-grained control of variable scope. For example, an auxiliary variable may be defined in a block, then used (say, added to a variable with function scope) and discarded when the block ends, or a while loop might be enclosed in a block that initializes variables used inside the loop that should only be initialized once.

A subtlety of several programming languages, such as Algol 68 and C (demonstrated in this example and standardized since C99), is that block-scope variables can be declared not only within the body of the block, but also within the control statement, if any. This is analogous to function parameters, which are declared in the function declaration (before the block of the function body starts), and in scope for the whole function body. This is primarily used in for loops, which have an initialization statement separate from the loop condition, unlike while loops, and is a common idiom.

Block scope can be used for shadowing. In this example, inside the block the auxiliary variable could also have been called n, shadowing the parameter name, but this is considered poor style due to the potential for errors. Furthermore, some descendants of C, such as Java and C#, despite having support for block scope (in that a local variable can be made to go out of context before the end of a function), do not allow one local variable to hide another. In such languages, the attempted declaration of the second n would result in a syntax error, and one of the n variables would have to be renamed.

If a block is used to set the value of a variable, block scope requires that the variable be declared outside of the block. This complicates the use of conditional statements with single assignment. For example, in Python, which does not use block scope, one may initialize a variable as such:

if c:
 a = &quot;foo&quot;
else:
 a = &quot;&quot;

where codice_16 is accessible after the codice_17 statement.

In Perl, which has block scope, this instead requires declaring the variable prior to the block:

my $a;
if (c) {
 $a = &#x27;foo&#x27;;
} else {
 $a = &quot;;

Often this is instead rewritten using multiple assignment, initializing the variable to a default value. In Python (where it is not necessary) this would be:

a = &quot;&quot;
if c:
 a = &quot;foo&quot;

while in Perl this would be:

my $a = &quot;;
if (c) {
 $a = &#x27;foo&#x27;;

In case of a single variable assignment, an alternative is to use the ternary operator to avoid a block, but this is not in general possible for multiple variable assignments, and is difficult to read for complex logic.

This is a more significant issue in C, notably for string assignment, as string initialization can automatically allocate memory, while string assignment to an already initialized variable requires allocating memory, a string copy, and checking that these are successful.
{
 my $counter = 0;
 sub increment_counter {
 return ++$counter;
}
Some languages allow the concept of block scope to be applied, to varying extents, outside of a function. For example, in the Perl snippet at right, codice_18 is a variable name with block scope (due to the use of the codice_19 keyword), while codice_20 is a function name with global scope. Each call to codice_20 will increase the value of codice_18 by one, and return the new value. Code outside of this block can call codice_20, but cannot otherwise obtain or alter the value of codice_18. This idiom allows one to define closures in Perl.

=== Function scope ===
When the scope of variables declared within a function does not extend beyond that function, this is known as function scope. Function scope is available in most programming languages which offer a way to create a &quot;local variable&quot; in a function or subroutine: a variable whose scope ends (that goes out of context) when the function returns. In most cases the lifetime of the variable is the duration of the function call—it is an automatic variable, created when the function starts (or the variable is declared), destroyed when the function returns—while the scope of the variable is within the function, though the meaning of &quot;within&quot; depends on whether scope is lexical or dynamic. However, some languages, such as C, also provide for static local variables, where the lifetime of the variable is the entire lifetime of the program, but the variable is only in context when inside the function. In the case of static local variables, the variable is created when the program initializes, and destroyed only when the program terminates, as with a static global variable, but is only in context within a function, like an automatic local variable.

Importantly, in lexical scope a variable with function scope has scope only within the &quot;lexical context&quot; of the function: it goes out of context when another function is called within the function, and comes back into context when the function returns—called functions have no access to the local variables of calling functions, and local variables are only in context within the body of the function in which they are declared. By contrast, in dynamic scope, the scope extends to the &quot;execution context&quot; of the function: local variables &quot;stay in context&quot; when another function is called, only going out of context when the defining function ends, and thus local variables are in context of the function in which they are defined &quot;and all called functions&quot;. In languages with lexical scope and nested functions, local variables are in context for nested functions, since these are within the same lexical context, but not for other functions that are not lexically nested. A local variable of an enclosing function is known as a non-local variable for the nested function. Function scope is also applicable to anonymous functions.
def square(n):
 return n * n

def sum_of_squares(n):
 total = 0 
 i = 0
 while i &lt;= n:
 total += square(i)
 i += 1
 return total
For example, in the snippet of Python code on the right, two functions are defined: codice_25 and codice_26. codice_25 computes the square of a number; codice_26 computes the sum of all squares up to a number. (For example, codice_29 is 42 = codice_30, and codice_31 is 02 + 12 + 22 + 32 + 42 = codice_32.)

Each of these functions has a variable named n that represents the argument to the function. These two n variables are completely separate and unrelated, despite having the same name, because they are lexically scoped local variables with function scope: each one&#x27;s scope is its own, lexically separate function and thus, they don&#x27;t overlap. Therefore, codice_26 can call codice_25 without its own n being altered. Similarly, codice_26 has variables named total and i; these variables, because of their limited scope, will not interfere with any variables named total or i that might belong to any other function. In other words, there is no risk of a &quot;name collision&quot; between these names and any unrelated names, even if they are identical.

No name masking is occurring: only one variable named n is in context at any given time, as the scopes do not overlap. By contrast, were a similar fragment to be written in a language with dynamic scope, the n in the calling function would remain in context in the called function—the scopes would overlap—and would be masked (&quot;shadowed&quot;) by the new n in the called function.

Function scope is significantly more complicated if functions are first-class objects and can be created locally to a function and then returned. In this case any variables in the nested function that are not local to it (unbound variables in the function definition, that resolve to variables in an enclosing context) create a closure, as not only the function itself, but also its context (of variables) must be returned, and then potentially called in a different context. This requires significantly more support from the compiler, and can complicate program analysis.

=== File scope ===
The scope of a name binding is a file, which is known as file scope. File scope is largely particular to C (and C++), where scope of variables and functions declared at the top level of a file (not within any function) is for the entire file—or rather for C, from the declaration until the end of the source file, or more precisely translation unit (internal linking). This can be seen as a form of module scope, where modules are identified with files, and in more modern languages is replaced by an explicit module scope. Due to the presence of include statements, which add variables and functions to the internal context and may themselves call further include statements, it can be difficult to determine what is in context in the body of a file.

In the C code snippet above, the function name codice_26 has global scope (in C, extern linkage). Adding static to the function signature would result in file scope (internal linkage).

=== Module scope ===
The scope of a name binding is a module, which is known as module scope. Module scope is available in modular programming languages where modules (which may span various files) are the basic unit of a complex program, as they allow information hiding and exposing a limited interface. Module scope was pioneered in the Modula family of languages, and Python (which was influenced by Modula) is a representative contemporary example.

In some object-oriented programming languages that lack direct support for modules, such as C++ before C++20, a similar structure is instead provided by the class hierarchy, where classes are the basic unit of the program, and a class can have private methods. This is properly understood in the context of dynamic dispatch rather than name resolution and scope, though they often play analogous roles. In some cases both these facilities are available, such as in Python, which has both modules and classes, and code organization (as a module-level function or a conventionally private method) is a choice of the programmer.

=== Global scope ===
The scope of a name binding is an entire program, which is known as global scope. Variable names with global scope—called &quot;global variables&quot;—are frequently considered bad practice, at least in some languages, due to the possibility of name collisions and unintentional masking, together with poor modularity, and function scope or block scope are considered preferable. However, global scope is typically used (depending on the language) for various other sorts of names, such as names of functions, names of classes and names of other data types. In these cases mechanisms such as namespaces are used to avoid collisions.

== Lexical scope vs. dynamic scope ==
The use of local variables — of variable names with limited scope, that only exist within a specific function — helps avoid the risk of a name collision between two identically named variables. However, there are two very different approaches to answering this question: What does it mean to be &quot;within&quot; a function?

In lexical scope (or lexical scoping; also called static scope or static scoping), if a variable name&#x27;s scope is a certain function, then its scope is the program text of the function definition: within that text, the variable name exists, and is bound to the variable&#x27;s value, but outside that text, the variable name does not exist. By contrast, in dynamic scope (or dynamic scoping), if a variable name&#x27;s scope is a certain function, then its scope is the time-period during which the function is executing: while the function is running, the variable name exists, and is bound to its value, but after the function returns, the variable name does not exist. This means that if function codice_37 invokes a separately defined function codice_38, then under lexical scope, function codice_38 does &quot;not&quot; have access to codice_37&#x27;s local variables (assuming the text of codice_38 is not inside the text of codice_37), while under dynamic scope, function codice_38 &quot;does&quot; have access to codice_37&#x27;s local variables (since codice_38 is invoked during the invocation of codice_37).
$ # bash language
$ x=1
$ function g() { echo $x ; x=2 ; }
$ function f() { local x=3 ; g ; }
$ f # does this print 1, or 3?
3
$ echo $x # does this print 1, or 2?
1
Consider, for example, the program on the right. The first line, x=1, creates a global variable codice_12 and initializes it to codice_48. The second line, function g() { echo $x ; x=2 ; }, defines a function codice_38 that prints out (&quot;echoes&quot;) the current value of codice_12, and then sets codice_12 to codice_52 (overwriting the previous value). The third line, function f() { local x=3 ; g ; } defines a function codice_37 that creates a local variable codice_12 (hiding the identically named global variable) and initializes it to codice_55, and then calls codice_38. The fourth line, f, calls codice_37. The fifth line, echo $x, prints out the current value of codice_12.

So, what exactly does this program print? It depends on the scope rules. If the language of this program is one that uses lexical scope, then codice_38 prints and modifies the global variable codice_12 (because codice_38 is defined outside codice_37), so the program prints codice_48 and then codice_52. By contrast, if this language uses dynamic scope, then codice_38 prints and modifies codice_37&#x27;s local variable codice_12 (because codice_38 is called from within codice_37), so the program prints codice_55 and then codice_48. (As it happens, the language of the program is Bash, which uses dynamic scope; so the program prints codice_55 and then codice_48. If the same code was run with ksh93 which uses lexical scope, the results would be different.)

== Lexical scope ==
With lexical scope, a name always refers to its lexical context. This is a property of the program text and is made independent of the runtime call stack by the language implementation. Because this matching only requires analysis of the static program text, this type of scope is also called static scope. Lexical scope is standard in all ALGOL-based languages such as Pascal, Modula-2 and Ada as well as in modern functional languages such as ML and Haskell. It is also used in the C language and its syntactic and semantic relatives, although with different kinds of limitations. Static scope allows the programmer to reason about object references such as parameters, variables, constants, types, functions, etc., as simple name substitutions. This makes it much easier to make modular code and reason about it, since the local naming structure can be understood in isolation. In contrast, dynamic scope forces the programmer to anticipate all possible execution contexts in which the module&#x27;s code may be invoked.
program P;
var I:integer;
 K:char;

 procedure A;
 var K:real;
 L:integer;

 procedure B;
 var M:real;
 begin
 (*scope P+A+B*)
 end;

 (*scope P+A*)
 end;

 (*scope P*)
end.
For example, Pascal is lexically scoped. Consider the Pascal program fragment at right. The variable codice_74 is visible at all points, because it is never hidden by another variable of the same name. The codice_75 variable codice_76 is visible only in the main program because it is hidden by the codice_77 variable codice_76 visible only in procedures codice_79 and codice_80. Variable codice_81 is also visible only in procedure codice_79 and codice_80 but it does not hide any other variable. Variable codice_84 is only visible in procedure codice_80 and therefore not accessible either from procedure codice_79 or the main program. Also, procedure codice_80 is visible only in procedure codice_79 and can therefore not be called from the main program. There could have been another procedure namedcodice_80 declared in the program outside of procedure codice_80. The place in the program where &quot;codice_80&quot; is mentioned then determines which of the two procedures named codice_80 it represents, analogous with the scope of variables.

Correct implementation of lexical scope in languages with first-class nested functions is not trivial, as it requires each function value to carry with it a record of the values of the variables that it depends on (the pair of the function and this context is called a closure). Depending on implementation and computer architecture, variable lookup &quot;may&quot; become slightly inefficient when very deeply lexically nested functions are used, although there are well-known techniques to mitigate this. Also, for nested functions that only refer to their own arguments and (immediately) local variables, all relative locations can be known at compile time. No overhead at all is therefore incurred when using that type of nested function. The same applies to particular parts of a program where nested functions are not used, and, naturally, to programs written in a language where nested functions are not available (such as in the C language).

=== History ===
Lexical scope was first used in the early 1960s for the imperative language ALGOL 60 and has been picked up in most other imperative languages since then.

Languages like Pascal and C have always had lexical scope, since they are both influenced by the ideas that went into ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68 (although C did not include lexically nested functions).

Perl is a language with dynamic scope that added static scope afterwards.

The original Lisp interpreter (1960) used dynamic scope. &quot;Deep binding&quot;, which approximates static (lexical) scope, was introduced around 1962 in LISP 1.5 (via the Funarg device developed by Steve Russell, working under John McCarthy).

All early Lisps used dynamic scope, when based on interpreters. In 1982, Guy L. Steele Jr. and the Common LISP Group published &quot;An overview of Common LISP&quot;, a short review of the history and the divergent implementations of Lisp up to that moment and a review of the features that a &quot;Common Lisp&quot; implementation should have. On page 102, we read:

Most LISP implementations are internally inconsistent in that by default the interpreter and compiler may assign different semantics to correct programs; this stems primarily from the fact that the interpreter assumes all variables to be dynamically scoped, while the compiler assumes all variables to be local unless forced to assume otherwise. This has been done for the sake of convenience and efficiency, but can lead to very subtle bugs. The definition of Common LISP avoids such anomalies by explicitly requiring the interpreter and compiler to impose identical semantics on correct programs.

Implementations of Common LISP were thus required to have lexical scope. Again, from &quot;An overview of Common LISP&quot;:

In addition, Common LISP offers the following facilities (most of which are borrowed from MacLisp, InterLisp or Lisp Machines Lisp): (...) Fully lexically scoped variables. The so-called &quot;FUNARG problem&quot; is completely solved, in both the downward and upward cases.

By the same year in which &quot;An overview of Common LISP&quot; was published (1982), initial designs (also by Guy L. Steele Jr.) of a compiled, lexically scoped Lisp, called &quot;Scheme&quot; had been published and compiler implementations were being attempted. At that time, lexical scope in Lisp was commonly feared to be inefficient to implement. In &quot;A History of T&quot;, Olin Shivers writes:

&quot;All&quot; serious Lisps in production use at that time were dynamically scoped. No one who hadn&#x27;t carefully read the Rabbit thesis (written by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. in 1978) believed lexical scope would fly; even the few people who &quot;had&quot; read it were taking a bit of a leap of faith that this was going to work in serious production use.

The term &quot;lexical scope&quot; dates at least to 1967, while the term &quot;lexical scoping&quot; dates at least to 1970, where it was used in Project MAC to describe the scope rules of the Lisp dialect MDL (then known as &quot;Muddle&quot;).

== Dynamic scope ==
With dynamic scope, a name refers to execution context. In technical terms, this means that each name has a global stack of bindings. Introducing a local variable with name codice_12 pushes a binding onto the global codice_12 stack (which may have been empty), which is popped off when the control flow leaves the scope. Evaluating codice_12 in any context always yields the top binding. Note that this cannot be done at compile-time because the binding stack only exists at run-time, which is why this type of scope is called &quot;dynamic&quot; scope.

Dynamic scope is uncommon in modern languages.

Generally, certain blocks are defined to create bindings whose lifetime is the execution time of the block; this adds some features of static scope to the dynamic scope process. However, since a section of code can be called from many different locations and situations, it can be difficult to determine at the outset what bindings will apply when a variable is used (or if one exists at all). This can be beneficial; application of the principle of least knowledge suggests that code avoid depending on the &quot;reasons&quot; for (or circumstances of) a variable&#x27;s value, but simply use the value according to the variable&#x27;s definition. This narrow interpretation of shared data can provide a very flexible system for adapting the behavior of a function to the current state (or policy) of the system. However, this benefit relies on careful documentation of all variables used this way as well as on careful avoidance of assumptions about a variable&#x27;s behavior, and does not provide any mechanism to detect interference between different parts of a program. Some languages, like Perl and Common Lisp, allow the programmer to choose static or dynamic scope when defining or redefining a variable. Examples of languages that use dynamic scope include Logo, Emacs Lisp, LaTeX and the shell languages bash, dash, and PowerShell.

Dynamic scope is fairly easy to implement. To find an name&#x27;s value, the program could traverse the runtime stack, checking each activation record (each function&#x27;s stack frame) for a value for the name. In practice, this is made more efficient via the use of an association list, which is a stack of name/value pairs. Pairs are pushed onto this stack whenever declarations are made, and popped whenever variables go out of context. &quot;Shallow binding&quot; is an alternative strategy that is considerably faster, making use of a &quot;central reference table&quot;, which associates each name with its own stack of meanings. This avoids a linear search during run-time to find a particular name, but care should be taken to properly maintain this table. Note that both of these strategies assume a last-in-first-out (LIFO) ordering to bindings for any one variable; in practice all bindings are so ordered.

An even simpler implementation is the representation of dynamic variables with simple global variables. The local binding is performed by saving the original value in an anonymous location on the stack that is invisible to the program. When that binding scope terminates, the original value is restored from this location. In fact, dynamic scope originated in this manner. Early implementations of Lisp used this obvious strategy for implementing local variables, and the practice survives in some dialects which are still in use, such as GNU Emacs Lisp. Lexical scope was introduced into Lisp later. This is equivalent to the above shallow binding scheme, except that the central reference table is simply the global variable binding context, in which the current meaning of the variable is its global value. Maintaining global variables isn&#x27;t complex. For instance, a symbol object can have a dedicated slot for its global value.

Dynamic scope provides an excellent abstraction for thread-local storage, but if it is used that way it cannot be based on saving and restoring a global variable. A possible implementation strategy is for each variable to have a thread-local key. When the variable is accessed, the thread-local key is used to access the thread-local memory location (by code generated by the compiler, which knows which variables are dynamic and which are lexical). If the thread-local key does not exist for the calling thread, then the global location is used. When a variable is locally bound, the prior value is stored in a hidden location on the stack. The thread-local storage is created under the variable&#x27;s key, and the new value is stored there. Further nested overrides of the variable within that thread simply save and restore this thread-local location. When the initial, outermost override&#x27;s context terminates, the thread-local key is deleted, exposing the global version of the variable once again to that thread.

With referential transparency the dynamic scope is restricted to the argument stack of the current function only, and coincides with the lexical scope.

=== Macro expansion ===

In modern languages, macro expansion in a preprocessor is a key example of de facto dynamic scope. The macro language itself only transforms the source code, without resolving names, but since the expansion is done in place, when the names in the expanded text are then resolved (notably free variables), they are resolved based on where they are expanded (loosely &quot;called&quot;), as if dynamic scope were occurring.

The C preprocessor, used for macro expansion, has de facto dynamic scope, as it does not do name resolution by itself and it is independent of where the macro is defined. For example, the macro:

#define ADD_A(x) x + a

will expand to add codice_16 to the passed variable, with this name only later resolved by the compiler based on where the macro codice_97 is &quot;called&quot; (properly, expanded). Properly, the C preprocessor only does lexical analysis, expanding the macro during the tokenization stage, but not parsing into a syntax tree or doing name resolution.

For example, in the following code, the name codice_16 in the macro is resolved (after expansion) to the local variable at the expansion site:
#define ADD_A(x) x + a

void add_one(int *x) {
 const int a = 1;
 *x = ADD_A(*x);

void add_two(int *x) {
 const int a = 2;
 *x = ADD_A(*x);


== Qualified names ==
As we have seen, one of the key reasons for scope is that it helps prevent name collisions, by allowing identical names to refer to distinct things, with the restriction that the names must have separate scopes. Sometimes this restriction is inconvenient; when many different things need to be accessible throughout a program, they generally all need names with global scope, so different techniques are required to avoid name collisions.

To address this, many languages offer mechanisms for organizing global names. The details of these mechanisms, and the terms used, depend on the language; but the general idea is that a group of names can itself be given a name — a prefix — and, when necessary, an entity can be referred to by a &quot;qualified name&quot; consisting of the name plus the prefix. Normally such names will have, in a sense, two sets of scopes: a scope (usually the global scope) in which the qualified name is visible, and one or more narrower scopes in which the &quot;unqualified name&quot; (without the prefix) is visible as well. And normally these groups can themselves be organized into groups; that is, they can be &quot;nested&quot;.

Although many languages support this concept, the details vary greatly. Some languages have mechanisms, such as &quot;namespaces&quot; in C++ and C#, that serve almost exclusively to enable global names to be organized into groups. Other languages have mechanisms, such as &quot;packages&quot; in Ada and &quot;structures&quot; in Standard ML, that combine this with the additional purpose of allowing some names to be visible only to other members of their group. And object-oriented languages often allow classes or singleton objects to fulfill this purpose (whether or not they &quot;also&quot; have a mechanism for which this is the primary purpose). Furthermore, languages often meld these approaches; for example, Perl&#x27;s packages are largely similar to C++&#x27;s namespaces, but optionally double as classes for object-oriented programming; and Java organizes its variables and functions into classes, but then organizes those classes into Ada-like packages.

== By language ==

Scope rules for representative languages follow.

=== C ===

In C, scope is traditionally known as linkage or visibility, particularly for variables. C is a lexically scoped language with global scope (known as &quot;external linkage&quot;), a form of module scope or file scope (known as &quot;internal linkage&quot;), and local scope (within a function); within a function scopes can further be nested via block scope. However, standard C does not support nested functions.

The lifetime and visibility of a variable are determined by its storage class. There are three types of lifetimes in C: static (program execution), automatic (block execution, allocated on the stack), and manual (allocated on the heap). Only static and automatic are supported for variables and handled by the compiler, while manually allocated memory must be tracked manually across different variables. There are three levels of visibility in C: external linkage (global), internal linkage (roughly file), and block scope (which includes functions); block scopes can be nested, and different levels of internal linkage is possible by use of includes. Internal linkage in C is visibility at the translation unit level, namely a source file after being processed by the C preprocessor, notably including all relevant includes.

C programs are compiled as separate object files, which are then linked into an executable or library via a linker. Thus name resolution is split across the compiler, which resolves names within a translation unit (more loosely, &quot;compilation unit&quot;, but this is properly a different concept), and the linker, which resolves names across translation units; see linkage for further discussion.

In C, variables with block scope enter context when they are declared (not at the top of the block), go out of context if any (non-nested) function is called within the block, come back into context when the function returns, and go out of context at the end of the block. In the case of automatic local variables, they are also allocated on declaration and deallocated at the end of the block, while for static local variables, they are allocated at program initialization and deallocated at program termination.

The following program demonstrates a variable with block scope coming into context partway through the block, then exiting context (and in fact being deallocated) when the block ends:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 char x = &#x27;m&#x27;;
 printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, x);
 printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, x);
 char x = &#x27;b&#x27;;
 printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, x);
 printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, x);


The program outputs:
There are other levels of scope in C. Variable names used in a function prototype have function prototype visibility, and exit context at the end of the function prototype. Since the name is not used, this is not useful for compilation, but may be useful for documentation. Label names for GOTO statement have function scope.

=== C++ ===
All the variables that we intend to use in a program must have been declared with its type specifier in an earlier
point in the code, like we did in the previous code at the beginning of the body of the function main when we
declared that a, b, and result were of type int.
A variable can be either of global or local scope. A global variable is a variable declared in the main body of the
source code, outside all functions, while a local variable is one declared within the body of a function or a block.

Modern versions allow nested lexical scope.

=== Swift ===
Swift has a similar rule for scopes with C++, but contains different access modifiers.
=== Go ===
Go is lexically scoped using blocks.

=== Java ===
Java is lexically scoped.

A Java class has several kinds of variables:

; Local variables: are defined inside a method, or a particular block. These variables are local to where they were defined and lower levels. For example, a loop inside a method can use that method&#x27;s local variables, but not the other way around. The loop&#x27;s variables (local to that loop) are destroyed as soon as the loop ends.

; Member variables: also called &quot;fields&quot; are variables declared within the class, outside of any method. By default, these variables are available for all methods within that class and also for all classes in the package.

; Parameters: are variables in method declarations.

In general, a set of brackets defines a particular scope, but variables at top level within a class can differ in their behavior depending on the modifier keywords used in their definition.
The following table shows the access to members permitted by each modifier.
=== JavaScript ===
JavaScript has simple &quot;scope rules&quot;, but variable initialization and name resolution rules can cause problems, and the widespread use of closures for callbacks means the lexical context of a function when defined (which is used for name resolution) can be very different from the lexical context when it is called (which is irrelevant for name resolution). JavaScript objects have name resolution for properties, but this is a separate topic.

JavaScript has lexical scope nested at the function level, with the global context being the outermost context. This scope is used for both variables and for functions (meaning function declarations, as opposed to variables of function type). Block scope with the codice_3 and codice_100 keywords is standard since ECMAScript 6. Block scope can be produced by wrapping the entire block in a function and then executing it; this is known as the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) pattern.

While JavaScript scope is simple—lexical, function-level—the associated initialization and name resolution rules are a cause of confusion. Firstly, assignment to a name not in scope defaults to creating a new global variable, not a local one. Secondly, to create a new local variable one must use the codice_5 keyword; the variable is then created at the top of the function, with value codice_7 and the variable is assigned its value when the assignment expression is reached:
:A variable with an &quot;Initialiser&quot; is assigned the value of its &quot;AssignmentExpression&quot; when the &quot;VariableStatement&quot; is executed, not when the variable is created.

This is known as &quot;variable hoisting&quot;—the declaration, but not the initialization, is hoisted to the top of the function. Thirdly, accessing variables before initialization yields codice_7, rather than a syntax error. Fourthly, for function declarations, the declaration and the initialization are both hoisted to the top of the function, unlike for variable initialization. For example, the following code produces a dialog with output &lt;samp&gt;undefined&lt;/samp&gt;, as the local variable declaration is hoisted, shadowing the global variable, but the initialization is not, so the variable is undefined when used:

a = 1;
function f() {
 alert(a);
 var a = 2;
f();
Further, as functions are first-class objects in JavaScript and are frequently assigned as callbacks or returned from functions, when a function is executed, the name resolution depends on where it was originally defined (the lexical context of the definition), not the lexical context or execution context where it is called. The nested scopes of a particular function (from most global to most local) in JavaScript, particularly of a closure, used as a callback, are sometimes referred to as the scope chain, by analogy with the prototype chain of an object.

Closures can be produced in JavaScript by using nested functions, as functions are first-class objects. Returning a nested function from an enclosing function includes the local variables of the enclosing function as the (non-local) lexical context of the returned function, yielding a closure. For example:

function newCounter() {
 // return a counter that is incremented on call (starting at 0)
 // and which returns its new value
 var a = 0;
 var b = function() { a++; return a; };
 return b;
c = newCounter();
alert(c() + &#x27; &#x27; + c()); // outputs &quot;1 2&quot;
Closures are frequently used in JavaScript, due to being used for callbacks. Indeed, any hooking of a function in the local context as a callback or returning it from a function creates a closure if there are any unbound variables in the function body (with the context of the closure based on the nested scopes of the current lexical context, or &quot;scope chain&quot;); this may be accidental. When creating a callback based on parameters, the parameters must be stored in a closure, otherwise it will accidentally create a closure that refers to the variables in the enclosing context, which may change.

Name resolution of properties of JavaScript objects is based on inheritance in the prototype tree—a path to the root in the tree is called a &quot;prototype chain&quot;—and is separate from name resolution of variables and functions.

=== Lisp ===
Lisp dialects have various rules for scope.

The original Lisp used dynamic scope; it was Scheme, inspired by ALGOL, that introduced static (lexical) scope to the Lisp family.

Maclisp used dynamic scope by default in the interpreter and lexical scope by default in compiled code, though compiled code could access dynamic bindings by use of codice_104 declarations for particular variables. However, Maclisp treated lexical binding more as an optimization than one would expect in modern languages, and it did not come with the closure feature one might expect of lexical scope in modern Lisps. A separate operation, codice_105, was available to somewhat clumsily work around some of that issue.

Common Lisp adopted lexical scope from Scheme, as did Clojure.

ISLISP has lexical scope for ordinary variables. It also has dynamic variables, but they are in all cases explicitly marked; they must be defined by a codice_106 special form, bound by a codice_107 special form, and accessed by an explicit codice_108 special form.

Some other dialects of Lisp, like Emacs Lisp, still use dynamic scope by default. Emacs Lisp now has lexical scope available on a per-buffer basis.

=== Python ===
For variables, Python has function scope, module scope, and global scope. Names enter context at the start of a scope (function, module, or global scope), and exit context when a non-nested function is called or the scope ends. If a name is used prior to variable initialization, this raises a runtime exception. If a variable is simply accessed (not assigned to), name resolution follows the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule which resolves names to the narrowest relevant context. However, if a variable is assigned to, it defaults to declaring a variable whose scope starts at the start of the level (function, module, or global), not at the assignment. Both these rules can be overridden with a codice_1 or codice_2 (in Python 3) declaration prior to use, which allows accessing global variables even if there is a masking nonlocal variable, and assigning to global or nonlocal variables.

As a simple example, a function resolves a variable to the global scope:

»&gt; def f():
... print(x)
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; f()
global

Note that codice_12 is defined before codice_37 is called, so no error is raised, even though it is defined after its reference in the definition of codice_37. Lexically this is a forward reference, which is allowed in Python.

Here assignment creates a new local variable, which does not change the value of the global variable:

»&gt; def f():
... x = &quot;f&quot;
... print(x)
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; print(x)
global
»&gt; f()
f
»&gt; print(x)
global
Assignment to a variable within a function causes it to be declared local to the function, hence its scope is the entire function, and thus using it prior to this assignment raises an error. This differs from C, where the scope of the local variable start at its declaration. This code raises an error:

»&gt; def f():
... print(x)
... x = &quot;f&quot;
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; f()
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in f
UnboundLocalError: local variable &#x27;x&#x27; referenced before assignment
The default name resolution rules can be overridden with the codice_1 or codice_2 (in Python 3) keywords. In the below code, the codice_116 declaration in codice_38 means that codice_12 resolves to the global variable. It thus can be accessed (as it has already been defined), and assignment assigns to the global variable, rather than declaring a new local variable. Note that no codice_1 declaration is needed in codice_37—since it does not assign to the variable, it defaults to resolving to the global variable.

»&gt; def f():
... print(x)
»&gt; def g():
... global x
... print(x)
... x = &quot;g&quot;
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; f()
global
»&gt; g()
global
»&gt; f()
g
codice_1 can also be used for nested functions. In addition to allowing assignment to a global variable, as in an unnested function, this can also be used to access the global variable in the presence of a nonlocal variable:

»&gt; def f():
... def g():
... global x
... print(x)
... x = &quot;f&quot;
... g()
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; f()
global
For nested functions, there is also the codice_2 declaration, for assigning to a nonlocal variable, similar to using codice_1 in an unnested function:

»&gt; def f():
... def g():
... nonlocal x # Python 3 only
... x = &quot;g&quot;
... x = &quot;f&quot;
... g()
... print(x)
»&gt; x = &quot;global&quot;
»&gt; f()
g
»&gt; print(x)
global
=== R ===
R is a lexically scoped language, unlike other implementations of S where the values of free variables are determined by a set of global variables, while in R they are determined by the context in which the function was created. The scope contexts may be accessed using a variety of features (such as codice_124) which can simulate the experience of dynamic scope should the programmer desire.

There is no block scope:

a &lt;- 1
 a &lt;- 2
message(a)
## 2
Functions have access to scope they were created in:

a &lt;- 1
f &lt;- function() {
 message(a)
f()
## 1
Variables created or modified within a function stay there:

a &lt;- 1
f &lt;- function() {
 message(a)
 a &lt;- 2
 message(a)
f()
## 1
## 2
message(a)
## 1
Variables created or modified within a function stay there unless assignment to enclosing scope is explicitly requested:

a &lt;- 1
f &lt;- function() {
 message(a)
 a «- 2
 message(a)
f()
## 1
## 2
message(a)
## 2
Although R has lexical scope by default, function scopes can be changed:

a &lt;- 1
f &lt;- function() {
 message(a)
my_env &lt;- new.env()
my_env$a &lt;- 2
f()
## 1
environment(f) &lt;- my_env
f()
## 2
