<text>Sichuan is a province in Southwestern China, occupying the Sichuan Basin and Tibetan Plateau—between the Jinsha River to the west, the Daba Mountains to the north, and the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau to the south. Its capital city is Chengdu, and its population stands at 83 million. Sichuan neighbors Qinghai and Gansu to the north, Shaanxi and Chongqing to the east, Guizhou and Yunnan to the south, and Tibet to the west.

During antiquity, Sichuan was home to the kingdoms of Ba and Shu until their incorporation by the Qin. During the Three Kingdoms era (220–280), Liu Bei&#x27;s state of Shu was based in Sichuan. The area was devastated in the 17th century by Zhang Xianzhong&#x27;s rebellion and the area&#x27;s subsequent Manchu conquest, but recovered to become one of China&#x27;s most productive areas by the 19th century. During World War II, Chongqing served as the temporary capital of the Republic of China, and was heavily bombed. It was one of the last mainland areas captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War, and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952, with Chongqing restored two years later. It suffered gravely during the Great Chinese Famine (1959–1961) but remained China&#x27;s most-populous province until Chongqing was again separated from it in 1997.

The Sichuanese people speak distinctive dialects of Mandarin Chinese. The Sichuan pepper, with its distinctive flavor and numbing effect, is prominent in modern Sichuan cuisine, featuring dishes, including Kung Pao chicken and mapo tofu, that have become staples of Chinese cuisine around the world. 
There are many panda stations in the province and large reserves for these creatures, such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

Sichuan is the 6th-largest provincial economy of China, the largest in Western China, and the second-largest among inland provinces after Henan. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was (US$847.68 billion), ahead of that of Turkey ($815 billion). If it were its own country, Sichuan would be the 18th-largest economy and 19th-most populous as of 2021.

== Names==
It is commonly assumed that the name &quot;Sichuan&quot; means &#x27;four rivers&#x27;; in folk etymology, this is usually taken to mean four of the province&#x27;s major rivers: the Jialing, Jinsha (or Wu), Min, and Tuo. According to historical geographer Tan Qixiang, &#x27;four rivers&#x27; is an erroneous interpretation of the name. The name of the province is a contraction of the phrases &#x27;Four Plain Circuits&#x27; () and &#x27;Four Circuits of Chuanxia&#x27; (), referring to the division of the existing imperial administrative circuit in the area into four during the Northern Song dynasty, which were Yizhou, Lizhou, Zizhou, and Kuizhou. The word &quot;chuan&quot; () here means &#x27;plain&#x27;, not its typical meaning of &#x27;river&#x27; as popularly assumed. In addition to its postal map and Wade–Giles forms, the name has also been irregularly romanized as &quot;Szű-chuan&quot; and &quot;Szechuen&quot;.

In antiquity, the area of modern Sichuan including the now-separated Chongqing Municipality was known to the Chinese as &quot;Ba–Shu&quot;, in reference to the ancient state of Ba and the ancient kingdom of Shu that once occupied the Sichuan Basin. &quot;Shu&quot; continued to be used to refer to the region to the present day; several states formed in the area used the same name, for example, the Shu of the Three Kingdoms period (220–280), and Former Shu and Later Shu of the Ten Kingdoms period (907–979). Currently, both characters for &quot;Shu&quot; and &quot;Chuan&quot; are common abbreviations for Sichuan.

The region was formerly referred to as &quot;West China&quot; or &quot;Western China&quot; by Protestant missions.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The Sichuan Basin and adjacent areas of the Yangtze watershed were a cradle of indigenous civilizations dating back to at least the 15th century BC, coinciding with the Shang in northern China. The region had its own distinct religious beliefs and worldview. The earliest excavated culture found therein is the Baodun culture (2700–1750 BC) excavated in the Chengdu Plain.

===Ba and Shu Kingdoms===
The most important native states were those of Ba and Shu.

Ba stretched into Sichuan from the Han Valley in Shaanxi and Hubei down the Jialing River as far as its confluence with the Yangtze at Chongqing.

Shu occupied the valley of the Min, including Chengdu and other areas of western Sichuan. The existence of the early state of Shu was poorly recorded in the main historical records of China. It was, however, referred to in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; as an ally of the Zhou. Accounts of Shu exist mainly as a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends recorded in local annals such as the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; compiled in the Jin dynasty (266–420), and the Han-dynasty compilation &quot;&quot;. These contained folk stories such as that of who taught the people agriculture and transformed himself into a cuckoo after his death. The existence of a highly developed civilization with an independent bronze industry in Sichuan was excavated in 1986 at a small village named Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site, believed to be an ancient city of Shu, was initially discovered by a local farmer in 1929 who found jade and stone artifacts. Excavations by archeologists yielded few significant finds until 1986 when two major sacrificial pits were found with spectacular bronze items as well as artifacts in jade, gold, earthenware, and stone. This and other discoveries in Sichuan contest the conventional historiography that the local culture and technology of Sichuan were undeveloped in comparison to the technologically and culturally &quot;advanced&quot; Yellow River valley of north-central China.

===Qin dynasty===
The rulers of the expansionist state of Qin, based in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi, were the first strategists to realize that the area&#x27;s military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance. The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the Hengduan Mountains to the west, the Qin Mountains to the north, and Yungui Plateau to the south. Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Three Gorges to eastern and southern China, Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a haven for political refugees.

Qin armies finished their conquest of the kingdoms of Shu and Ba by 316 BC. Any written records and civil achievements of earlier kingdoms were destroyed. Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. Li Bing, engineered the Dujiangyan irrigation system to control the Min River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of movable weirs which could be adjusted for high or low water flow according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin&#x27;s unification of China.

===Han dynasty===

Sichuan was subjected to the autonomous control of kings named by the imperial family of the Han dynasty. During the 11 years hiatus between 25 and 36 AD, Sichuan was controlled by the Chengjia Kingdom. Following the declining central government of the Han dynasty in the second century, the Sichuan basin, surrounded by mountains and easily defensible, became a popular place for upstart generals to found kingdoms that challenged the authority of Yangtze Valley emperors over China.
===Three Kingdoms===
In 221, during the partition following the fall of the Eastern Han – the era of the Three Kingdoms – Liu Bei founded the southwest kingdom of Shu Han (; 221–263) in parts of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, with Chengdu as its capital. Shu-Han claimed to be the successor to the Han dynasty.

In 263, the Cao Wei of North China conquered the Kingdom of Shu-Han as a step on the path to reuniting China. Salt production becomes a major business in Ziliujing District. During the Six Dynasties period of Chinese disunity, Sichuan began to be populated by non-Han ethnic minority peoples, owing to the migration of Gelao people from the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau to the Sichuan basin.

===Tang dynasty===

Sichuan came under the firm control of a Chinese central government during the Sui dynasty, but it was during the subsequent Tang dynasty that Sichuan regained its previous political and cultural prominence for which it was known during the Han. Chengdu became nationally known as a supplier of armies and the home of Du Fu, who is sometimes called China&#x27;s greatest poet. During the An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled from Chang&#x27;an to Sichuan which became his refuge. The region was torn by constant warfare and economic distress as it was besieged by the Tibetan Empire.

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms===
In the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Sichuan became the heart of the Shu kingdom with its capital in Chengdu. In 925, the kingdom was absorbed into Later Tang but would regain independence under Meng Zhixiang who founded Later Shu in 934. Later Shu would continue until 965 when it was absorbed by the Song.

===Song and Yuan dynasties===
During the Song dynasty (960–1279), Sichuanese was able to protect themselves from Tibetan attacks with the help of the central government. There were rebellions against the Song by Li Shun in 994 and Wang Jun in 1000. Sichuan also saw cultural revivals like the great poets Su Xun (), Su Shi, and Su Zhe. Although paper currency was known in the Tang dynasty, in 1023 AD, the first true paper money in human history () was issued in Chengdu.

It was also during the Song dynasty that the bulk of the native Ba people of eastern Sichuan assimilated into the Han Chinese ethnicity.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Southern Song dynasty established coordinated defenses against the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, in Sichuan and Xiangyang. The Southern Song state monopolized the Sichuan tea industry to pay for warhorses, but this state intervention eventually brought devastation to the local economy. The line of defense was finally broken through after the first use of firearms in history during the six-year Battle of Xiangyang, which ended in 1273. Allegedly there were a million pieces of unspecified types of skeleton bones belonging to war animals and both Song and Yuan soldiers who perished in the fighting over the city, although the figure may have been grossly exaggerated. The recorded number of families in Sichuan dropped from 2,640,000 families, as recorded from the census taken in 1162 AD, to 120,000 families in 1282 AD. Possible causes include forced population transfer to nearby areas, evacuation to nearby provinces, census under-reporting or inaccuracy, and war-related deaths.
One instance of the deportation of Sichuanese civilians to Mongolia occurred in the aftermath of a battle in 1259 when more than 80,000 people were taken captive from one city in Sichuan and moved to Mongolia.

===Ming dynasty===

The Ming dynasty defeated Ming Yuzhen&#x27;s Xia polity which ruled Sichuan.

During the Ming dynasty, major architectural works were created in Sichuan. Buddhism remained influential in the region. Bao&#x27;en Temple is a well-preserved 15th-century monastery complex built between 1440 and 1446 during the Zhengtong Emperor&#x27;s reign (1427–64). Dabei Hall enshrines a thousand-armed wooden image of Guanyin and Huayan Hall is a repository with a revolving sutra cabinet. The wall paintings, sculptures, and other ornamental details are masterpieces of the Ming period.

In the middle of the 17th century, the peasant rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong (1606–1646) from Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi Province, nicknamed &quot;Yellow Tiger&quot;, led his peasant troop from north China to the south and conquered Sichuan. Upon capturing it, he declared himself emperor of the Daxi dynasty (). In response to the resistance from local elites, he massacred a large number of people in Sichuan, killing around one in three people. As a result of the massacre as well as years of turmoil during the Ming-Qing transition, the population of Sichuan fell sharply, requiring massive resettlement of people from the neighboring Huguang Province (modern Hubei and Hunan) and other provinces during the Qing dynasty.

===Qing dynasty===

Sichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty but during the Qing plan to increase the population in 1671 they came to Sichuan again. In 1904 Deng Xiaoping was born in Sichuan.

During the Qing dynasty, Sichuan was merged with Shaanxi and Shanxi to create &quot;Shenzhuan&quot; during 1680–1731 and 1735–1748. The current borders of Sichuan (which then included Chongqing) were established in the early 18th century. In the aftermath of the Sino-Nepalese War on China&#x27;s southwestern border, the Qing gave Sichuan&#x27;s provincial government direct control over the minority-inhabited areas of Sichuan west of Kangding, which had previously been handled by an amban.

A landslide dam on the Dadu River caused by an earthquake gave way on 10 June 1786. The resulting flood killed 100,000 people.

===Republic of China===

In the early 20th century, the newly founded Republic of China established the Chuanbian Special Administrative District () on the province&#x27;s territories to the west of the Sichuan Basin. The Special District later became the province of Xikang, incorporating the areas inhabited by Yi, Tibetan, and Qiang ethnic minorities to its west, and eastern part of today&#x27;s Tibet Autonomous Region.

In the 20th century, as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the capital of the Republic of China had been temporarily relocated to Chongqing, then a major city in Sichuan. An enduring legacy of this move is those nearby inland provinces, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, which previously never had modern Western-style universities, began to be developed in this regard. The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of the Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang government during 1938–45 and led to the Bombing of Chongqing.

The Second Sino-Japanese War was soon followed by the resumed Chinese Civil War, and the cities of East China are obtained by the Communists one after another, the Kuomintang government again tried to make Sichuan its stronghold on the mainland, although it already saw some Communist activity since it was one area on the road of the Long March. Chiang Kai-shek himself flew to Chongqing from Taiwan in November 1949 to lead the defense. But the same month Chongqing switched to the Communists, followed by Chengdu on 10 December. The Kuomintang general Wang Sheng wanted to stay behind with his troops to continue the anticommunist guerilla war in Sichuan, but was recalled to Taiwan. Many of his soldiers made their way there as well, via Burma.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded in 1949, and it split Sichuan into four areas and separated Chongqing municipality. Sichuan was reconstituted in 1952, with Chongqing added in 1954, while the former Xikang province was split between Tibet in the west and Sichuan in the east.

The province was deeply affected by the Great Chinese Famine of 1959–1961, during which period some 9.4 million people (13.07% of the population at the time) died.

In 1978, when Deng Xiaoping took power, Sichuan was one of the first provinces to experiment with the market economic enterprise.

From 1955 until 1997, Sichuan had been China&#x27;s most populous province; the population hit the 100 million mark shortly after the 1982 census figure of 99,730,000. This changed in 1997 when the Sub-provincial city of Chongqing as well as the three surrounding prefectures of Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang were split off into the new Chongqing Municipality. The new municipality was formed to spearhead China&#x27;s effort to economically develop its western provinces, as well as to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project.

In 1997, when Sichuan split, the sum of the two parts was recorded to be 114,720,000 people. As of 2010, Sichuan ranks as both the 3rd largest (the largest among Chinese provinces with a population greater than 50 million) and 4th most populous province in China.

On 12 May 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9/8.0 hit just northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu. Official figures recorded a death toll of over 87,000 people, and millions of people were left homeless.

==Administrative divisions==

Sichuan consists of twenty-one prefecture-level divisions: eighteen prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city) and three autonomous prefectures:

The twenty prefectures of Sichuan are subdivided into 183 county-level divisions (53 districts, 17 county-level cities, 109 counties, and 4 autonomous counties). At the end of the year 2017, the total population is 83.02 million.

=== Urban areas ===

==Geography and biodiversity==
Sichuan consists of two geographically very distinct parts. The eastern part of the province is mostly within the fertile Sichuan basin (which is shared by Sichuan with Chongqing Municipality). The western Sichuan consists of numerous mountain ranges forming the easternmost part of the Tibetan Plateau, which are known generically as the Hengduan Mountains. One of these ranges, the Daxue Mountains, contains the highest point of the province Gongga Shan, at above sea level. The mountains are formed by the collision of the Tibetan Plateau with the Yangtze Plate. Faults here include the Longmenshan Fault which ruptured during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Other mountain ranges surround the Sichuan Basin from north, east, and south. Among them are the Daba Mountains, in the province&#x27;s northeast.

The Yangtze River and its tributaries flow through the mountains of western Sichuan and the Sichuan Basin; thus, the province is upstream of the great cities that stand along the Yangtze River further to the east, such as Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. One of the major tributaries of the Yangtze within the province is the Min River of central Sichuan, which joins the Yangtze at Yibin. There are also a number of other rivers, such as the Jialing River, Tuo River, Yalong River, Wu River, and Jinsha River, and any four of the various rivers are often grouped as the &quot;four rivers&quot; that the name of Sichuan is commonly and mistakenly believed to mean.

Due to great differences in terrain, the climate of the province is highly variable. In general, it has strong monsoonal influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer. Under the Köppen climate classification, the Sichuan Basin (including Chengdu) in the eastern half of the province experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot; or &quot;Cfa&quot;), with long, hot, wet summers and short, mild to cool, dry, and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China&#x27;s lowest sunshine totals. The western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate. Having cool to very cold winters and mild summers, temperatures generally decrease with greater elevation. However, due to its high altitude and its inland location, many areas such as Garze County and Zoige County in Sichuan exhibit a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dwc&quot;)- featuring extremely cold winters down to −30 °C and even cold summer nights. The region is geologically active with landslides and earthquakes. Average elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 meters; average temperatures range from 0 to 15 °C. The southern part of the province, including Panzhihua and Xichang, has a sunny climate with short, very mild winters and very warm to hot summers.

Sichuan borders Qinghai to the northwest, Gansu to the north, Shaanxi to the northeast, Chongqing to the east, Guizhou to the southeast, Yunnan to the south, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the west.

===Giant panda===

Giant pandas live in bamboo forests and low mountainous areas such as the Minshan Mountains in Sichuan. The majority of the panda population lives in Sichuan, with their range spreading into Shaanxi and Gansu. As it is abundant where they live, pandas&#x27; diet consists of 99% bamboo, with small other plants, or small animals consisting of the other 1%. As the panda is native to China, they have become a national symbol of China.

==Politics==

The politics of Sichuan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The governor of Sichuan is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Sichuan. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Sichuan Communist Party of China&#x27;s Party Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the &quot;Sichuan CCP Party Chief&quot;.

==Economy==

Sichuan is the 6th-largest provincial economy of China, the largest in Western China and the second largest among inland provinces after Henan. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was 5,385 billion yuan (US$847.68 billion), ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion. Compared to a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as well as the 19th most populous as of 2021. As of 2021, its nominal GDP per capita was 64,357 RMB (US$10,120). In 2021, the per capita net income of rural residents was 17,575 yuan (US$2760). The per capita disposable income of the urbanites averaged 41,444 yuan (US$6510).

Sichuan has been historically known as the &quot;Province of Abundance&quot;. It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China. Grain, including rice and wheat, is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999. Commercial crops include citrus fruits, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, peaches, and grapes. Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999. Sichuan is rich in mineral resources. It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium, titanium, and lithium is the largest in China. The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3% of the reserves of iron, 93% of titanium, 69% of vanadium, and 83% of cobalt in the whole country. Sichuan also possesses China&#x27;s largest proven natural gas reserves (such as the Dazhou and Yuanba gas fields), the majority of which are transported to more developed eastern regions.

Sichuan is one of the major industrial centers of China. It was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign. In addition to heavy industries such as coal, energy, iron, and steel, the province has also established a light industrial sector comprising building materials, wood processing, food, and silk processing. Chengdu and Mianyang are the production centers for textiles and electronics products. Deyang, Panzhihua, and Yibin are the production centers for machinery, metallurgical industries, and wine, respectively. Sichuan&#x27;s wine production accounted for 21.9% of the country&#x27;s total production in 2000.

Great strides have been made in developing Sichuan into a modern hi-tech industrial base, by encouraging both domestic and foreign investments in electronics and information technology (such as software), machinery and metallurgy (including automobiles), hydropower, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.

The auto industry is an important and key sector of the machinery industry in Sichuan. Most of the auto manufacturing companies are located in Chengdu, Mianyang, Nanchong, and Luzhou.

Other important industries in Sichuan include aerospace and defense (military) industries. A number of China&#x27;s rockets (Long March rockets) and satellites were launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in the city of Xichang.

Sichuan&#x27;s landscapes and rich historical relics have also made the province a center for tourism.

The Three Gorges Dam, the largest dam ever constructed, was built on the Yangtze River in nearby Hubei province to control flooding in the Sichuan Basin, neighboring Yunnan province, and downstream. The plan is hailed by some as China&#x27;s efforts to shift towards alternative energy sources and to further develop its industrial and commercial bases, but has been denounced for mass resettlement, loss of archeological sites, and ecological damage.

===Economic development zones===

==== Chengdu Hi-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone ====
Chengdu Hi-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone was established with the approval of the State Council on October 18, 2010, and passed the national acceptance on February 25, 2011. It was officially operated in May 2011. Chengdu High-tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone is integrated and expanded from the former Chengdu Export Processing Zone and Chengdu Bonded Logistics Center. it is located in the Chengdu West High-tech Industrial Development Zone, with an area of 4.68 square kilometers and divided into three areas A, B, and C. The industries focus on notebook computer manufacturing, tablet computer manufacturing, wafer manufacturing, chip packaging testing, electronic components, precision machining, and the biopharmaceutical industry. Chengdu Hi-Tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone has attracted the top 500 multinational enterprises such as Intel, Foxconn, Texas Instruments, Dell, Morse, and so on.

In 2020, the Chengdu Hi-Tech Comprehensive Free Trade Zone achieved a total import and export volume of 549.1 billion yuan (including the Shuangliu Sub-zone), accounting for 68% of the province&#x27;s total foreign trade import and export volume, ranking first in the national comprehensive insurance zone import and export volume for three consecutive years.

====Chengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Chengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone () was approved as state-level development zone in February 2000. The zone now has a developed area of and a planned area of . Chengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone (CETDZ) lies east of Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province and the hub of transportation and communication in southwest China. The zone has attracted investors and developers from more than 20 countries to carry out their projects there. Industries encouraged in the zone include mechanical, electronic, new building materials, medicine, and food processing.

====Chengdu Export Processing Zone====
Chengdu Export Processing Zone ()) was ratified by the State Council as one of the first 15 export processing zones in the country in April 2000. In 2002, the state ratified the establishment of the Sichuan Chengdu Export Processing West Zone with a planned area of , located inside the west region of the Chengdu Hi-tech Zone.

====Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone====

Established in 1988, Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone () was approved as one of the first national hi-tech development zones in 1991. In 2000, it was open to APEC and has been recognized as a national advanced hi-tech development zone in successive assessment activities held by China&#x27;s Ministry of Science and Technology. It ranks 5th among the 53 national hi-tech development zones in China in terms of comprehensive strength.

Chengdu Hi-tech Development Zone covers an area of , consisting of South Park and West Park. By relying on the city sub-center, which is under construction, South Park is focusing on creating a modernized industrial park of science and technology with scientific and technological innovation, incubation R&amp;D, modern service industry, and Headquarters economy playing leading roles. Priority has been given to the development of the software industry. Located on both sides of the &quot;Chengdu-Dujiangyan-Jiuzhaigou&quot; golden tourism channel, the West Park aims at building a comprehensive industrial park targeting industrial clustering with complete supportive functions. West Park gives priority to three major industries i.e. electronic information, biomedicine, and precision machinery.

====Mianyang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone====
Mianyang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was established in 1992, with a planned area of . The zone is situated 96 kilometers away from Chengdu and is away from Mianyang Airport. Since its establishment, the zone accumulated 177.4 billion yuan of industrial output, 46.2 billion yuan of gross domestic product, and fiscal revenue of 6.768 billion yuan. There are more than 136 high-tech enterprises in the zone and they accounted for more than 90% of the total industrial output.

The zone is a leader in the electronic information industry, biological medicine, new materials, and the production of motor vehicles and parts.

==Transportation==
For millennia, Sichuan&#x27;s rugged and riverine landscape presented enormous challenges to the development of transportation infrastructure, and the lack of roads out of the Sichuan Basin contributed to the region&#x27;s isolation. Since the 1950s, numerous highways and railways have been built through the Qinling in the north and the Bashan in the east. Dozens of bridges across the Yangtze and its tributaries to the south and west have brought greater connectivity with Yunnan and Tibet.

===Airports===
Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the 4th-busiest airport in mainland China. It was among the world&#x27;s top 30 busiest airports in 2015, and the busiest in western and central China. It was also the fifth-busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic in China in 2013. Chengdu airport is the hub of Sichuan Airlines, Chengdu Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Tibet Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Lucky Air, and Air China. Alongside Shuangliu Airport, Chengdu Tianfu International Airport has opened in 2021.

Chengdu airports are also 144-hour transit visa-free airports for foreigners from 53 countries.

===Expressways===
On 3 November 2007, the Sichuan Transportation Bureau announced that the Suining-Chongqing Expressway was completed after three years of construction. After the completion of the Chongqing section of the road, the expressway connected Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway and formed the shortest expressway from Chengdu to Chongqing. The new expressway is shorter than the pre-existing road between Chengdu and Chongqing; thus journey time between the two cities was reduced by an hour, now taking two and a half hours. The Sui-Yu Expressway is a four-lane overpass with a speed limit of . The total investment was 1.045 billion yuan.

===Rail===
China Railway Chengdu Group is headquartered in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, managing railway systems in Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guizhou. Sichuan&#x27;s major railways in Sichuan include the Baoji–Chengdu, Chengdu–Chongqing, Chengdu–Kunming, Neijiang–Kunming, Suining–Chongqing, and Chengdu–Dazhou railways. High-speed railways in Sichuan include the Chengdu–Chongqing high-speed railway, Xi&#x27;an-Chengdu high-speed railway, Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway, and Chengdu–Kunming high-speed railway. A suburban railway connects Chengdu and Dujiangyan.

==Demographics==
The majority of the province&#x27;s population is Han Chinese (95% of the provincial population), who are found scattered throughout the region except for the far western areas. Thus, significant minorities of Tibetan, Yi, Qiang, and Nakhi people reside in the western portion that is impacted by inclement weather and natural disasters, environmentally fragile, and impoverished. Sichuan&#x27;s capital of Chengdu is home to a large community of Tibetans, with 30,000 permanent Tibetan residents and up to 200,000 Tibetan floating population. The Eastern Lipo, included with either the Yi or the Lisu people, as well as the A-Hmao, also are among the ethnic groups of the provinces.

Sichuan was China&#x27;s most populous province before Chongqing became a directly controlled municipality; it is currently the fourth most populous, after Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan. As of 1832, Sichuan was the most populous of the 18 provinces in China, with an estimated population at that time of 21 million. It was the third most populous sub-national entity in the world, after Uttar Pradesh, India, and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic until 1991, when the Soviet Union was dissolved. It is also one of the only eight subnational divisions to ever reach 100 million people (Uttar Pradesh, Russian RSFSR, Maharashtra, Sichuan, Bihar, Shandong, Guangdong, and Punjab). It is currently ranked 10th.

===Religion===


The predominant religions in Sichuan are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions, and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 10.6% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 0.68% of the population identifies as Christian. According to the Japanese publication &quot;Tokyo Sentaku&quot; in 1999, there were 2 million members of Yiguandao (Tiandao) in Sichuan, equal to 2.4% of the province&#x27;s population.

The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; the vast majority may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, etc. Tibetan Buddhism is widespread, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic Tibetans. Sichuan is one of the cradles of the early Heavenly Masters&#x27; Taoist religious movements.

According to &quot;Vestiges of Zoroastrianism in Medieval Sichuan&quot; by Yao Chongxin, professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Zoroastrianism flourished during the period of Tang (618–907), Former Shu (907–925), Later Shu (934–965), and Song (960–1279).

A Chabad Jewish Center was established in Chengdu in 2012, after moving five times, a permanent location was secured at Wuhou District.


==Culture==
The &quot;Sichuanese people&quot; (Sichuanese: Ba1su2ren2; IPA: ; alternatively , , or ) are a subgroup of Han Chinese living in mostly Sichuan province and the neighboring Chongqing municipality. Beginning from the 9th century BC, Shu (on the Chengdu Plain) and Ba (which had its first capital at Enshi City in Hubei and controlled part of the Han Valley) emerged as cultural and administrative centers where two rival kingdoms were established. Although eventually, the Qin dynasty destroyed the kingdoms of Shu and Ba, the Qin government accelerated the technological and agricultural advancements of Sichuan making it comparable to that of the Yellow River Valley. The now-extinct Ba–Shu language was derived from Qin-era settlers and represents the earliest documented division from what is now called Middle Chinese.

During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the population of the area was reduced through wars and the bubonic plague, and settlers arrived from the area of modern Hubei, replacing the earlier common Chinese with a new standard.

The Li Bai Memorial, located in Jiangyou, is a museum in memory of Li Bai, a Chinese poet of Tang China (618–907) built at the place where he grew up. The building was begun in 1962 on the occasion of the 1200th anniversary of his death, completed in 1981, and opened to the public in October 1982. The memorial is built in the style of the classic Tang garden.

In 2003, Sichuan had &quot;88 art performing troupes, 185 culture centers, 133 libraries, and 52 museums&quot;. Companies based in Sichuan also produced 23 television series and one film.

===Languages===
The Sichuanese once spoke their variety of Spoken Chinese called Ba-Shu Chinese, or Old Sichuanese before it became extinct during the Ming dynasty. Now most of them speak Sichuanese Mandarin. The Minjiang dialects are thought by some linguists to be a bona fide descendant of Old Sichuanese, but there is no conclusive evidence whether Minjiang dialects are derived from Old Sichuanese or Southwestern Mandarin.

The languages of Sichuan are primarily members of three subfamilies of the Sino-Tibetan languages.

The most widely used variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan is Sichuanese, which is the lingua franca in Sichuan, Chongqing, and parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Although Sichuanese is generally classified as a dialect of Mandarin Chinese, it is highly divergent in phonology, vocabulary, and even grammar from Standard Chinese. The Minjiang dialect is especially difficult for speakers of other Mandarin dialects to understand.

Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in western Sichuan are populated by Tibetans and Qiang people. Tibetans speak the Khams and Amdo Tibetan, which are Tibetic languages, as well as various Qiangic languages. The Qiang speak Qiangic languages and often Tibetic languages as well. The Yi people of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southern Sichuan speak the Nuosu language, which is one of the Lolo-Burmese languages; Yi is written using the Yi script, a syllabary standardized in 1974. The Southwest University for Nationalities has one of China&#x27;s most prominent Tibetology departments and the Southwest Minorities Publishing House prints literature in minority languages. In the minority-inhabited regions of Sichuan, there is bilingual signage and public school instruction in non-Mandarin minority languages.

=== Sichuan brocade ===
Commonly known as &quot;Shu brocade&quot; () in Chinese, Sichuan brocade is referred to as the &quot;mother of brocade in China&quot; given its age. This technique of embroidery originates in the capital city of Chengdu during the time of the Ancient Kingdom of Shu. It enjoyed high popularity throughout the regions along the Silk Road, which stimulated an &quot;exoticization&quot; of the embroidery designs during the 1st millennium, with most of the patterns imported from Sogdia and other parts of Central Asia. According to the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;, in the year 605 AD, the head of the Sichuan ateliers producing silks in the &quot;western style&quot; was a certain He Chou, a name which betrays his Sogdian origins. Most of the silk products unearthed in Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan) and Qinghai (Tuyuhun Kingdom) confirmed to be manufactured in Sichuan.

===Cuisine===

Sichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of Sichuan peppers due to its humid climate.
The Sichuanese are proud of their cuisine, known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine. The cuisine here is of &quot;one dish, one shape, hundreds of dishes, hundreds of tastes&quot;, as the saying goes, to describe its acclaimed diversity. The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh, and fragrant. Sichuan cuisine is popular in the whole nation of China, and so are Sichuan chefs.

Another famous Sichuan delicacy is hot pot. Hot pot is a Chinese soup containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce.

<doc id="65188" wikidata="Q843955" url="?curid=65188" title="Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum">
<text>The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum () is a museum in Hong Kong which houses an ancient Chinese tomb. It is believed to have been built during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220) for a Chinese officer attached to the local garrison. The museum is located at 41 Tonkin Street, in Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po District, in the northwestern part of the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.
==History==
According to the structure, calligraphy and content of the inscriptions on tomb bricks and to the tomb finds, the tomb is commonly believed to have been built during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220) although the Southern Dynasties period was also suggested. It was probably built for a Chinese officer attached to the local garrison.

The tomb is constructed of bricks (average size of 40×20×5 cm) and consists of four chambers set in the form of a cross. The dome vault at the center was constructed by laying bricks in a spiral, while the other chambers are barrel vaulted. Some bricks are stamped or carved with inscriptions or patterns on the exposed sides. It is believed that the rear chamber is the coffin chamber, that side chambers were used for storage, while ritual ceremonies were performed in the front chamber under the domed roof.

The tomb&#x27;s cross-shaped structure and the burial objects found inside show great similarities as compared to other Han tombs found in South China, serving proof that early Chinese civilisation had spread to Hong Kong 2,000 years ago. The inscription &quot;Panyu&quot; () on tomb bricks further confirms the dating, since, according to historical records, &quot;Panyu&quot; was the name of the county to which the present territory of Hong Kong belonged during the Han dynasty. Also, the style of the calligraphy used in the inscriptions was an angular version of &quot;lishu&quot; (clerical script) which was generally used in inscriptions on bronze wares and stones during the Han dynasty. There were no bodies found in the tomb.

==Discovery and preservation==
The tomb was accidentally discovered in August 1955, when the Hong Kong Government was levelling a hill slope for the construction of resettlement buildings at Lei Cheng Uk Village (present-day Lei Cheng Uk Estate). The tomb was then excavated by members of University of Hong Kong (HKU) and workers of the Public Works Department, under the supervision of Professor Frederick S. Drake, former head of the Chinese Department at HKU. After excavation, the government intended to demolish the tomb, but the tomb was eventually preserved due to high public interest. The tomb and its exhibition hall were formally opened to the public in 1957. In November 1988, the Han Tomb was declared as a gazetted monument by the Hong Kong Government, and is now protected and preserved permanently under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance.

Since the mid-1980s, visitors have no longer been allowed inside the tomb due to conservation concerns. It can instead only be viewed through glass panel at the entrance passage. The tomb is sealed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment, and is protected by concrete, waterproofing layers, topsoil, and turf. Following rainwater leakage problems, the tomb was renovated in 2005, with the addition of a canopy to cover the tomb.

3D laser scanning technology in the digital recording of the structures was applied to capture 3D images of the structure.

==The museum==

The tomb and gallery came under the management of the former Urban Council in 1969. The museum later became a branch of the Hong Kong Museum of History in 1975. As such, it is presently managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong government. 

An exhibition hall opened in 1988, when the tomb was declared a gazetted monument. The hall was refurbished in 2005. Details on the discovery and characteristics of the tomb, as well as bronze and pottery artefacts found in the tomb are on permanent display in the exhibition hall.

A 3D digital animation in the exhibition hall provides a detailed view of the interior of the tomb. Moreover, a 1:1 replica of the inside of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb is displayed at the Hong Kong Museum of History.

===Exhibition Hall===
The Exhibition Hall is located next to the tomb. The first section is about food and drink in Han as it seems because most of what was found in the Han tomb is related to food. The display of this section begins with the old Chinese adage, &#x27;food is the first necessity of the people&#x27;. There is a map depicting food distribution, a pictogram of rice distribution and a table of the major food groups. There are also three replicas of figurines. Two of the figurines are cooks, and another one is a farmer.

The second section is about the excavation of the Han tomb. The excavation process, the inside of the tomb and the archaeologists at work are shown with several photographs. The tomb&#x27;s structure and layout are shown with the models and plans. This displays also how the professionals dated the tomb by using the inscriptions on the bricks.

The third part of the gallery shows the artefacts found in the tomb. As the only Eastern Han dynasty brick tomb ever found in Hong Kong, the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb has invaluable historic value containing 58 items found on site. Objects include cooking utensils, food containers, storage jars and models (a house, a granary, a well and a stove) made of pottery (50), as well as bowls, basins, mirrors, and bells made of bronze (8). No human skeletal remains were found.

==Transportation==
The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum is served by the Cheung Sha Wan station of the MTR (exit A3).

==Surrounding==
The Han Garden, located next to the museum, was completed in December 1993. The features in this Chinese garden were built following the style of the Han dynasty and include pavilions, terraces, towers, fishponds and rock sculptures.

Once overlooking the seashore, the site of the tomb is now almost 2,000 m from the sea, following a series of land reclamations.

<text>The Three Gorges Dam () is a hydroelectric gravity dam that spans the Yangtze River near Sandouping in Yiling District, Yichang, Hubei province, central China, downstream of the Three Gorges. The world&#x27;s largest power station by installed capacity (22,500 MW), the Three Gorges Dam generates 95±20 TWh of electricity per year on average, depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin. After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam&#x27;s produced nearly 112 TWh in a year, breaking the previous world record of ~103 TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.

The dam&#x27;s body was completed in 2006; the power plant became fully operational in 2012, when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015. The dam, measuring 185 meters in height and 2,309 meters in width, significantly surpasses Brazil’s 12,600 MW Itaipu facility and is one of the world&#x27;s largest hydroelectric plants.

Each of the main water turbines, state-of-the-art at their installation, has a capacity of 700 MW. Combining the capacity of the dam&#x27;s 32 main turbines with the two smaller generators (50 MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500 MW with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. 

The dam enhances the Yangtze River&#x27;s shipping capacity and provides flood control, helping to protect millions of people from severe flooding on the Yangtze Plain. Additionally, its hydroelectric power generation has helped fueled China&#x27;s economic growth. As a result, the Chinese government considers the project a source of national pride and a major social and economic success. However, it is controversial domestically and abroad. Estimates of the number of people displaced by the dam&#x27;s construction range from 1.13 million to around 1.4 million, and inundated ancient and culturally significant sites. In operation, the dam has caused some ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides.

Sun Yat-sen envisioned a large dam across the Yangtze River in &quot;The International Development of China&quot; (1919). He wrote that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges. In 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.

In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for a &quot;Yangtze River Project&quot;. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the US for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships: the ships would enter locks at the dam&#x27;s lower and upper ends and then cranes would move them from each lock to the next. Groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods. No construction work was performed because of the Nationalists&#x27; worsening situation in the Chinese Civil War.

After the 1949 Communist Revolution, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress. After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao wrote &quot;Swimming&quot;, a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.

During China&#x27;s emphasis on the Four Modernizations during its early period of Reform and Opening Up, The Communist Party revived plans for the dam and proposed to start construction in 1986. It emphasized the need to develop hydroelectric power.

The Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference became a center of opposition to the proposed dam. It convened panels of experts who recommended delaying the project.

The National People&#x27;s Congress approved the dam in 1992: of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote, giving the legislation an unusually low 67.75% approval rate. Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until 2012. The ship lift was completed in 2015. The dam raised the water level in the reservoir to above sea level by 2008 and to the designed maximum level of by 2010.

== Composition and dimensions ==
Made of concrete and steel, the dam is long and above sea level at its top. The project used of concrete (mainly for the dam wall), used 463,000 tonnes of steel (enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers), and moved about of earth. The concrete dam wall is high above the rock basis.

When the water level is at its maximum of above sea level, higher than the river level downstream, the dam reservoir is on average about in length and in width. It contains of water and has a total surface area of . On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of of land, compared to the of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.

== Economics ==
The Chinese government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion). By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, of which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing. It was estimated in 2009 that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan; total cost recovery was thus expected to be completed ten years after the dam became fully operational. In fact, the entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.

Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam had become fully operational. Additional charges were assessed as follows: every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay an extra ¥7.00 per MWh, and the other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per MWh. No surcharge was imposed on the Tibet Autonomous Region.

== Power generation and distribution ==

=== Generating capacity ===
Power generation is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), a Central Enterprise administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world&#x27;s largest capacity hydroelectric power station, with 34 generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700 MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50 MW, for a total of 22,500 MW. Among the 32 main generators, 14 are installed on the dam&#x27;s north side, 12 on the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. Annual electricity generation in 2018 was 101.6 TWh, which is 20 times more than the Hoover Dam.

=== Generators ===
The main generators each weigh about 6,000 tonnes and are designed to produce more than 700 MW of power each. The designed hydraulic head of the generators is . The flow rate varies between depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4 m (VGS design/Alstom&#x27;s design) and a rotation speed of 75 revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50 Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840 MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20 kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generator&#x27;s stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9 m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, with a maximum efficiency of 96.5% reached.
The generators were manufactured by two joint ventures: Alstom, ABB, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Harbin Motor; and Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some of the newer ones are air-cooled, making them simpler in design and easier to manufacture and maintain.

=== Generator installation progress ===
The first north-side main generator (No. 2) started up on July 10, 2003. The north side became completely operational on September 7, 2005, with the implementation of generator No. 9. Full power (9,800 MW) was eventually achieved on October 18, 2006, after the water level reached 156 meters.

On the south side, main generator No. 22 started up on June 11, 2007, and No. 15 became operational on October 30, 2008. The sixth (No. 17) began operation on December 18, 2007, raising capacity to 14.1 GW, exceeding that of Itaipu dam (14.0 GW) to become the world&#x27;s largest hydro power plant by capacity.

When the last main generator (No. 27) finished its final test on May 23, 2012, the six underground main generators were all operational, raising the capacity to 22.5 GW. After nine years of construction, installation and testing, the power plant was fully operational by July 2012.

=== Output milestones ===


By August 16, 2011, the plant had generated 500 TWh of electricity. In July 2008 it generated 10.3 TWh of electricity, its first month over 10 TWh. On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000 m3/s, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100 MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient. During an August 2009 flood, the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period.

During the November to May dry season, power output is limited by the river&#x27;s flow rate, as seen in the diagrams on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175 m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.

The Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of for the first time on October 26, 2010, in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 TWh was realized. It has a combined generating capacity of 22.5 gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of 88.2 TWh. In 2012, the dam&#x27;s 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 TWh of electricity, which accounts for 14% of China&#x27;s total hydro generation. Between 2012 (first year with all 32 generating units operating) and 2021, the dam generated an average of 97.22 TWh of electricity per year, higher than Itaipu dam&#x27;s average of 89.22 TWh of electricity per year during the same period. Due to the extensive 2020 monsoon season rainfall, the annual production reached ~112 TWh that year, which broke the previous world record of annual production by Itaipu Dam equal to ~103 TWh.

=== Distribution ===
The State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid paid a flat rate of ¥250 per MWh (US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from ¥228.7 to ¥401.8 per MWh. Higher-paying customers, such as Shanghai, receive priority. Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.

Power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387 billion yuan. Construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.

Power is distributed over multiple 500 kV transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges – Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges – Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba – Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges – Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.

The dam was expected to provide 10% of China&#x27;s power. However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected. Even fully operational and despite its size, on average, it supported only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4,692.8 TWh.

== Environmental impact ==

=== Emissions ===
According to the National Development and Reform Commission, 366 grams of coal would produce 1 kWh of electricity during 2006. From 2003 to 2007, power production equaled that of 84 million tonnes of standard coal.

=== Erosion and sedimentation ===
Two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam: that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is eroding, depositing about 40 million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment settles there instead of flowing downstream, and there is less sediment downstream.

The absence of silt downstream has three effects:
* Some hydrologists expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to flooding.
* Shanghai, more than away, rests on a massive sedimentary plain. The &quot;arriving siltso long as it does arrivestrengthens the bed on which Shanghai is built ... the less the tonnage of arriving sediment the more vulnerable is this biggest of Chinese cities to inundation&quot;.
* Benthic sediment buildup causes biological damage and reduces aquatic biodiversity.

=== Landslides ===
Erosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River. In the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.

=== Waste management ===
The dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007, more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84 million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day. Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water stagnant, polluted and murky.

=== Forest cover ===
In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.

Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would gain about of forest by 2008. That is a significant change from the net loss of forest each year in the 1990s. This is largely due to China&#x27;s large reforestation effort. This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it should restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze&#x27;s basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.

=== Wildlife ===
Concerns about the dam&#x27;s impact on wildlife predate the National People&#x27;s Congress&#x27;s approval in 1992. This region has long been known for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 plant species, which belong to 238 families and 1,508 genera. Of these species, 57 are endangered. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. The proportion of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam dropped from 20% in 1950 to less than 10% as of 2002, adversely affecting all plant species there. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species. Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are injured in the hydroelectric plants&#x27; turbine blades. This is particularly detrimental to the region&#x27;s ecosystem because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for 27% of China&#x27;s endangered freshwater fish species. Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin, now extinct. In fact, Chinese Government scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.

Of the 3,000 to 4,000 remaining critically endangered Siberian crane, many spend the winter in wetlands that the Three Gorges Dam will destroy. Populations of the Yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be &quot;negatively affected&quot; by the dam. In 2022 the Chinese paddlefish was declared extinct, with the last confirmed sighting in 2003.

=== Terrestrial impact ===
In 2005, NASA scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the total length of the Earth&#x27;s day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles. A study published in 2022 in the journal Open Geosciences suggests that the change of reservoir water level affects the gravity field in western Sichuan, which in turn affects the seismicity in that area.
== Floods, agriculture, industry ==

An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai located adjacent to the river. Large areas of farmland and China&#x27;s most important industrial area are situated beside the river.

The reservoir&#x27;s flood storage capacity is . This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100 years. The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a &quot;super&quot; flood. The river flooded in 1954 over an area of , killing 33,169 people and forcing almost 18.9 million people to move. The flood waters covered Wuhan, a city of eight million people, for over three months, and the Jingguang Railway was out of service for more than 100 days. The 1954 flood carried of water. The dam could only divert the water above Chenglingji, leaving to be diverted. The dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream, including the Xiang, Zishui, Yuanshui, Lishui, Hanshui, and Gan.

In 1998, a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars worth of damage, when of farmland were flooded. The flood affected more than 2.3 million people, killing 1,526. In early August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. During this flood, the dam limited the water flow to less than per second, raising the upstream water level from on August 1, to on August 8. A full of flood water was captured and the river flow was cut by as much as per second.

The dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season every year, between December and March. This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, providing fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage, and improving shipping conditions. The water level upstream drops from , in preparation for the rainy season. The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.

Since the filling of the reservoir in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra of fresh water to downstream cities and farms over the course of the dry season.
During the South China floods in July 2010, inflows at the Three Gorges Dam reached a peak of , exceeding the peak inflow during the 1998 Yangtze River floods. The dam&#x27;s reservoir rose nearly in 24 hours and reduced the outflow to in discharges downstream, preventing any significant impact on the middle and lower river.

== Navigating the dam ==
=== Locks ===

The installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten million to 100 million tonnes annually; as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate.

There are two series of ship locks installed near the dam (). Each of them is made up of five stages, with transit time at around four hours. Maximum vessel size is 10,000 tons. The locks are 280 m long, 35 m wide, and 5 m deep (918 × 114 × 16.4 ft). That is longer than those on the St Lawrence Seaway, but half as deep. Before the dam was constructed, the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was 18.0 million tonnes per year. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198 million tonnes of freight passed through the locks. The freight capacity of the river increased six times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25%. Originally, the total capacity of the ship locks was expected to reach 100 million tonnes per year. In 2022, their cargo turnover reached 159.65 million tons, with an annual increase of 6% over the previous few years.

These locks are staircase locks, whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate of the chamber below and the lower gate of the chamber above. The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.

=== Ship lift ===
In addition to the canal locks, there is a ship lift, a kind of elevator for vessels. The ship lift can lift ships of up to 3,000 tons. The vertical distance traveled is , and the size of the ship lift&#x27;s basin is . The ship lift takes 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks. One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically. The ship lift must work even if water levels vary by on the lower side, and on the upper side.

The ship lift&#x27;s design uses a helical gear system, to climb or descend a toothed rack.

The ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on May 20, 2006.
In November 2007, it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in October 2007.

In February 2012, &quot;Xinhua&quot; reported that the four towers intended to support the ship lift were nearly complete. The report said that by that time, the towers had reached of the anticipated .

As of May 2014, the ship lift was expected to be completed by July 2015. It was tested in December 2015 and announced complete in January 2016. Lahmeyer, the German firm that designed the ship lift, said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift. An article in Steel Construction says the actual time of the lift will be 21 minutes. It says that the expected dimensions of the passenger vessels the ship lift&#x27;s basin was designed to carry will be . The moving mass (including counterweights) is 34,000 tonnes.

The trials of elevator finished in July 2016, the first cargo ship was lifted on July 15; the lift time comprised 8 minutes. &quot;Shanghai Daily&quot; reported that the first operational use of the lift was on September 18, 2016, when limited &quot;operational testing&quot; of the lift began.

=== Portage railways ===
Plans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether. Two short rail lines, one on each side of the river, are to be constructed. The northern portage railway () will run from the Taipingxi port facility () on the northern side of the Yangtze, just upstream from the dam, via Yichang East Railway Station to the Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town (白洋镇), below Yichang. The southern portage railway () will run from Maoping (upstream of the dam) via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng (on the Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway).

In late 2012, preliminary work started along both future railway routes.

== Displacement of residents ==
During planning, it was estimated that 13 cities, 140 towns and 1,350 villages would be partially or completely flooded by the reservoir, amounting to roughly 1.5% of Hubei&#x27;s 60.3 million people and Chongqing Municipality&#x27;s 31.44 million people. These people were moved to new homes by the Chinese government, which considered the displacement justified by the flood protection provided for the communities downstream of the dam.

Between 2002 and 2005, Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky documented the impact of the project on the surrounding areas, including the town of Wanzhou. Other photographers who recorded the change include Chengdu-based Muge, Paris-based Zeng Nian (originally from Jiangsu), and Israeli Nadav Kander. Living conditions deteriorated for many, and hundreds of thousands of people could not find work. The older generation was particularly affected, but younger generations benefited from the educational and career opportunities afforded by moving to large cities with new, modern companies and schools.

Some 2007 reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality would encourage four million more people to move away from the dam to Chongqing&#x27;s main urban area by 2020. The municipal government asserted that the relocation was driven by urbanization, rather than a direct result of the dam project, and that the people involved included other areas of the municipality.

By June 2008, China had moved 1.24 million residents as far as Gaoyang in Hebei Province, and the moves concluded the following month.

== Other effects ==
=== Cultural and history ===
The area which would fill with water behind the dam included locations with significant cultural history. The State Council authorized a ¥505 million archaeology salvage effort. Over the course of several years, archaeologists excavated 723 sites and conducted surface archaeology recovery missions at an additional 346 sites. Archaeologists recovered 200,000 artifacts of which 13,000 were considered as particularly historically or culturally notable. As part of this effort, the old Chongqing City Museum was replaced by the Chongqing China Sanxia Museum to house many of the recovered artifacts.

Recovered structures that were too large for museums were moved upland to reconstruction districts (&quot;fu jian qu&quot;), which are outdoor museum parks. Recovered structures placed in such parks include temples, pavilions, houses, and bridges, among others.

Some sites could not be moved because of their location, size, or design, such as the hanging coffins site high in the Shen Nong Gorge, part of the cliffs.

=== National security ===
The United States Department of Defense reported that in Taiwan, &quot;proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China&#x27;s urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion&quot;. Destroying the Three Gorges Dam has been a tactic discussed and debated in Taiwan since the early 1990s, when the dam was still in the planning phase. The notion that the military in Taiwan would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland Chinese media. People&#x27;s Liberation Army General Liu Yuan was quoted in the &quot;China Youth Daily&quot; saying that the People&#x27;s Republic of China would be &quot;seriously on guard against threats from Taiwan independence terrorists&quot;. Former Taiwanese Ministry of Defense advisor Sung Chao-wen, called the notion of using cruise missiles to destroy the Three Gorges Dam &quot;ridiculous&quot;, saying missiles would deliver minimal damage to the reinforced concrete, and any attack attempts would have to go through multiple layers of ground and air defenses.

The Three Gorges Dam is a steel-concrete gravity dam. The water is held back by the innate mass of the individual dam sections. As a result, damage to an individual section should not affect other parts of the dam. Zhang Boting, deputy secretary-general of China Society for Hydropower Engineering, suggested that concrete gravity dams such as the Three Gorges Dam are resistant to nuclear strikes.

Debate among Chinese scholars and analysts about the basic principles of China&#x27;s no first use of nuclear weapons policy includes whether to include narrow exceptions, such as acts that produce catastrophic consequences equivalent to that of a nuclear attack, including attacks intended to destroy the Three Gorges Dam.

=== Structural integrity ===
Immediately after the reservoir was first filled, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam&#x27;s structure. Still, an experts group gave the project overall a good-quality rating. The 163,000 concrete units all passed quality testing, with normal deformation within design limits.

== Upstream dams ==

In order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the Jinsha River, the upper course of the Yangtze River, authorities are building a series of dams on the Jinsha, including the now completed Wudongde, Baihetan, Xiluodu, and Xiangjiaba dams. The total capacity of those four dams is 38,500 MW, almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges.
Baihetan became fully operational in 2022. Wudongde was opened in June 2021. Another eight dams are in the midstream of the Jinsha and eight more upstream of it.

<text>Boston is a market town and inland port in the borough of the same name in the county of Lincolnshire, England. It lies to the south-east of Lincoln, east of Nottingham and north-east of Peterborough. The town had a population of 45,339 at the 2021 census, while the borough had an estimated population of 66,900 at the ONS mid-2015 estimates. The Haven in Boston flows about 5 miles away to the Lincolnshire coast at The Wash, a bay between Lincolnshire and Norfolk.

Boston&#x27;s most notable landmark is St Botolph&#x27;s Church, colloquially referred to as &#x27;The Stump&#x27;, the largest parish church in England, which is visible from miles away across the flat lands of Lincolnshire. Residents of Boston are known as Bostonians. Emigrants from Boston named several other settlements around the world after the town, most notably Boston, Massachusetts, then a colony and now part of the United States.
==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Boston&quot; is said to be a contraction of &quot;Saint Botolph&#x27;s town&quot;, &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;&quot; (Old English, Old Norse and modern Norwegian for a hamlet or farm; hence the Latin &quot;villa Sancti Botulfi&quot; &quot;St. Botulf&#x27;s village&quot;).
The name &quot;Botulfeston&quot; appears in 1460, with an alias &quot;Boston&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The town was once said to have been a Roman settlement, but no evidence shows this to be the case. Similarly, it is often linked to the monastery established by the Saxon monk Botolph at &quot;Icanhoe&quot; on the Witham in AD 654 and destroyed by the Vikings in 870, but this is doubted by modern historians. The early medieval geography of The Fens was much more fluid than it is today, and at that time, the Witham did not flow near the site of Boston. Botolph&#x27;s establishment is most likely to have been in Suffolk. However, he was a popular missionary and saint to whom many churches between Yorkshire and Sussex are dedicated.

The 1086 Domesday Book does not mention Boston by name, but nearby settlements of the tenant-in-chief Count Alan Rufus of Brittany are covered. Its present territory was probably then part of the grant of Skirbeck, part of the very wealthy manor of Drayton, which before 1066 had been owned by Ralph the Staller, Edward the Confessor&#x27;s Earl of East Anglia. Skirbeck had two churches and one is likely to have been that dedicated to St Botolph, in what was consequently Botolph&#x27;s town. Skirbeck is now considered part of Boston, but the name remains, as a church parish and an electoral ward.

The order of importance was the other way round, when the Boston quarter of Skirbeck developed at the head of the Haven, which lies under the present Market Place. At that stage, The Haven was the tidal part of the stream, now represented by the Stone Bridge Drain, which carried the water from the East and West Fens. The line of the road through Wide Bargate, to A52 and A16, is likely to have developed on its marine silt levees. It led, as it does now, to the relatively high ground at Sibsey, and thence to Lindsey.

The reason for the original development of the town, away from the centre of Skirbeck, was that Boston lay on the point where navigable tidal water was alongside the land route, which used the Devensian terminal moraine ridge at Sibsey, between the upland of East Lindsey and the three routes to the south of Boston:
* The coastal route, on the marine silts, crossed the mouth of Bicker Haven towards Spalding.
* The Sleaford route, into Kesteven, passed via Swineshead, thence following the old course of the River Slea, on its marine silt levee.
* The Salters&#x27; Way route into Kesteven, left Holland from Donington. This route was much more thoroughly developed, in the later Medieval period, by Bridge End Priory.

The River Witham seems to have joined The Haven after the flood of September 1014, having abandoned the port of Drayton, on what subsequently became known as Bicker Haven. The predecessor of Ralph the Staller owned most of both Skirbeck and Drayton, so it was a relatively simple task to transfer his business from Drayton, but Domesday Book in 1086 still records his source of income in Boston under the heading of Drayton, so Boston&#x27;s name is not mentioned. The Town Bridge still maintains the preflood route, along the old Haven bank.

===Growth===
After the Norman conquest, Ralph the Staller&#x27;s property was taken over by Count Alan. It subsequently came to be attached to the Earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire, and known as the Richmond Fee. It lay on the left bank of The Haven.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, Boston grew into a notable town and port. In 1204, King John vested sole control over the town in his bailiff. That year or the next, he levied a &quot;fifteenth&quot; tax (&quot;&quot;) of 6.67% on the moveable goods of merchants in the ports of England: the merchants of Boston paid £780, the highest in the kingdom after London&#x27;s £836. Thus, by the opening of the 13th century, Boston was already significant in trade with the continent of Europe and ranked as a port of the Hanseatic League. In the thirteenth century it was said to be the second port in the country. Edward III named it a staple port for the wool trade in 1369. Apart from wool, Boston also exported salt, produced locally on the Holland coast, grain, produced up-river, and lead, produced in Derbyshire and brought via Lincoln, up-river.

A quarrel between the local and foreign merchants led to the withdrawal of the Hansards around 1470. Around the same time, the decline of the local guilds and shift towards domestic weaving of English wool (conducted in other areas of the country) led to a near-complete collapse of the town&#x27;s foreign trade. The silting of the Haven only furthered the town&#x27;s decline.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII during the English Reformation, Boston&#x27;s Dominican, Franciscan, Carmelite, and Augustinian friaries—erected during the boom years of the 13th and 14th centuries—were all expropriated. The refectory of the Dominican friary was eventually converted into a theatre in 1965 and now houses the Blackfriars Arts Centre.

Henry VIII granted the town its charter in 1545 and Boston had two Members of Parliament from 1552.

===17th and 18th centuries===

The staple trade made Boston a centre of intellectual influence from the Continent, including the teachings of John Calvin that became known as Calvinism. This, in turn, revolutionised the Christian beliefs and practices of many Bostonians and residents of the neighbouring shires of England. In 1607, a group of pilgrims from Nottinghamshire led by William Brewster and William Bradford attempted to escape pressure to conform with the teaching of the English church by going to the Netherlands from Boston. At that time, unsanctioned emigration was illegal, and they were brought before the court in the Guildhall. Most of the pilgrims were released fairly soon, and the following year, set sail for the Netherlands, settling in Leiden. In 1620, several of these were among the group who moved to New England in the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

Boston remained a hotbed of religious dissent. In 1612, John Cotton became the Vicar of St Botolph&#x27;s and, although viewed askance by the Church of England for his nonconformist preaching, became responsible for a large increase in Church attendance. He encouraged those who disliked the lack of religious freedom in England to join the Massachusetts Bay Company, and later helped to found the city of Boston, Massachusetts, which he was instrumental in naming. Unable to tolerate the religious situation any longer, he eventually emigrated himself in 1633. 

At the same time, work on draining the fens to the west of Boston was begun, a scheme which displeased many whose livelihoods were at risk. (One of the sources of livelihood obtained from the fen was fowling, supplying ducks and geese for meat and in addition the processing of their feathers and down for use in mattresses and pillows. Until 2018, the feathery aspect of this was still reflected in the presence of the local bedding company named Fogarty.) This and the religious friction put Boston into the parliamentarian camp in the Civil War, which in England began in 1642. The chief backer of the drainage locally, Lord Lindsey, was shot in the first battle and the fens returned to their accustomed dampness until after 1750.

The later 18th century saw a revival when the Fens began to be effectively drained. The Act of Parliament permitting the embanking and straightening of the fenland Witham was dated 1762. A sluice, called for in the act, was designed to help scour out The Haven. The land proved to be fertile, and Boston began exporting cereals to London. In 1774, the first financial bank was opened, and in 1776, an act of Parliament allowed watchmen to begin patrolling the streets at night.

===Modern history===
In the 19th century, the names of Howden, a firm located near the Grand Sluice, and Tuxford, near the Maud Foster Sluice, were respected among engineers for their steam road locomotives, threshing engines, and the like. Howden developed his business from making steam engines for river boats, while Tuxford began as a miller and millwright. His mill was once prominent near Skirbeck Church, just to the east of the Maud Foster Drain.

The railway reached the town in 1848, and it was briefly on the main line from London to the north. The area between the Black Sluice and the railway station was mainly railway yard and the railway company&#x27;s main depot. The latter facility moved to Doncaster when the modern main line was opened. Boston remained something of a local railway hub well into the 20th century, moving the produce of the district and the trade of the dock, plus the excursion trade to Skegness.

Boston once again became a significant port in trade and fishing in 1884, when the new dock with its associated wharves on The Haven were constructed. It continued as a working port, exporting grain, fertiliser, and importing timber, although much of the fishing trade was moved out in the interwar period.

At the beginning of the First World War, a number of the town&#x27;s trawlermen, together with some from Grimsby, were taken prisoner after their ships were sunk by German raiders in the North Sea. Their families did not know what had happened to them until late September 1914. The men were taken to Sennelager camp, then on to Ruhleben POW camp, where most remained until repatriated in 1918. A full report of their homecoming is in the &quot;Lincolnshire Standard&quot; newspaper, January 1918. During the war the port was used by hospital ships and some 4,000 sick or wounded troops passed through Boston. The town was bombed by a Zeppelin on 2 September 1916, injuring three adults and killing a child.

The first cinema opened in 1910, and in 1913, a new town bridge was constructed. Central Park was purchased in 1919, and is now one of the focal points of the town. Electricity came to Boston during the early part of the century, and electrical street lighting was provided from 1924.

During the Second World War, 17 residents of the borough were killed by enemy air raids. A memorial in Boston Cemetery commemorates them.

The Haven Bridge, which now carries the two trunk roads over the river, was opened in 1966, and a new dual carriageway, John Adams Way, was built in 1976–8 to take traffic away from the town centre. A shopping centre, named the Pescod Centre, opened in 2004, bringing many new shops into the town.

== Healthcare ==
Boston Cottage Hospital opened in 1871, was rebuilt in the 1960s, and is now called the Pilgrim Hospital, having been officially opened by Princess Anne on 23 June 1977. The hospital is currently building a new Emergency Department extension next to the current one, costing £35 million and doubling the current department in size.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Boston railway station is a stop on the Poacher Line; East Midlands Railway operates a generally hourly service between , and . These services are run by the Class 170, 158 or the older Class 156 trains.

The railways came to Boston in 1848, following the building of the East Lincolnshire Railway from to Boston and the simultaneous building of the Lincolnshire Loop Line by the Great Northern Railway, which ran between and , via Boston, and . This line was built before the East Coast Main Line and, for a short while, put Boston on the map as the GNR&#x27;s main locomotive works before it was relocated to Doncaster in 1852.

Boston was the southern terminus of the East Lincolnshire Line to and Grimsby, until its closure in 1970.

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are operated predominantly by Stagecoach East, Stagecoach East Midlands and Brylaine Travel. Key routes link the town with Lincoln, Skegness and Spalding.

==Politics==

Boston residents voted strongly (75.6%) in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, the highest such vote in the country.

===Boston Borough Council===
In the 2019 Borough elections, the Conservatives were confirmed as the majority party on Boston Borough Council with 16 of the 30 seats, followed by independents with 11.

In May 2007, a single-issue political party, the Boston Bypass Independents campaigning for a bypass to be built around the town, took control of the council when they won 25 of the 32 council seats, losing all but four of them in the subsequent election in 2011.

===Governance===
Boston received its charter in 1546. It is the main settlement in the Boston local government district of Lincolnshire, which includes the unparished town of Boston and 18 other civil parishes. The borough council is based in the Municipal Buildings in West Street.

===Borough Council wards===
As of 2015, Boston Borough council consisted of 30 members:

*Coastal Ward elects two councillors

=== UK Parliament ===
The town is part of the Boston and Skegness parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Reform UK chairman, Richard Tice.

==Demography==

According to the 2021 Census, the population of Boston is around 70,500. This is 9.1% higher than the 64,600 reported in the 2011 Census. This was a higher percentage of growth than the 6.6% national average for England during the same period. Much of this population growth is due to high levels of immigration to the town, especially from eastern Europe. The 2021 Census states that 23.6% of Boston&#x27;s population was born outside of the UK. 5.6% of the population of Boston was born in Lithuania and 5.4% was born in Poland. This is the highest proportion of Lithuanians anywhere in the UK and the second highest number of Poles, behind Slough, Berkshire. Polish is the main language of 5.68% of the inhabitants.

==Arts and culture==

Boston has historically had strong cultural connections to the Netherlands, and Dutch influence can be found in its architecture.

===Landmarks===

The parish church of Saint Botolph is known locally as Boston Stump and is renowned for its size and its dominant appearance in the surrounding countryside.

The Great Sluice is disguised by railway and road bridges, but it is there, keeping the tide out of the Fens and twice a day, allowing the water from the upland to scour the Haven. Not far away, in the opposite direction, was the boyhood home of John Foxe, the author of &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;.

The Town Bridge maintains the line of the road to Lindsey and from its western end, looking at the river side of the Exchange Building to the right, it is possible to see how the two ends of the building, founded on the natural levees of The Haven, have stood firm while the middle has sunk into the infill of the former river.

From 1552, Bostonians used to have their jail near the Stump (about where the red car in the photograph is located). This is likely to be where the Scrooby Pilgrims were imprisoned in 1607.

There is a statue of Herbert Ingram, founder of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, in front of the Stump. The statue was designed by Alexander Munro and was unveiled in October 1862. The allegorical figure at the base of the monument is a reference to Ingram&#x27;s efforts to bring the first piped water to the town. He was also instrumental in bringing the railways to Boston. Born in nearby Paddock Grove, son of a butcher, he was also MP for Boston, from 1856 until his death in 1860, in a shipping accident on Lake Michigan.
The seven-storeyed Maud Foster Tower Windmill, completed in 1819 by millwrights Norman and Smithson of Kingston upon Hull for Issac and Thomas Reckitt, was extensively restored in the late 1980s and became a working mill again. It stands next to the drain after which it is named, and is unusual in having an odd number (five) of sails.

The Guildhall in which the Pilgrim Fathers were tried was converted into a museum in 1929. The cells in which the pilgrims are said to have been held at the time of their trial are on the ground floor. After a major refurbishment during which the museum was closed for several years, it reopened in 2008.

The Pilgrim Fathers Memorial is located on the north bank of The Haven a few miles outside the town. Here at Scotia Creek, the pilgrims made their first attempt to leave for the Dutch Republic in 1607.

The ruined Hussey Tower is all that remains of a medieval brick-fortified house, built in 1450, and occupied by John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford until he was executed in the wake of the Lincolnshire Rising. east, Rochford Tower is another medieval tower house.

In Skirbeck Quarter, on the right bank of The Haven, is the Black Sluice, the outfall of the South Forty-Foot Drain.

The Prime Meridian passes through the eastern side of Boston, marked by the fairly modern, suburban Meridian Road (), which straddles the line after which the road was named.

The annual Boston May Fair has been held in the town since at least 1125. This fair is held during the first week of May, and is one of the few remaining fairs in the country still held in the town centre. By tradition, the fair was officially opened by the mayor at midday on 3 May, although this date has varied in recent years.

The Haven Gallery, opened in 2005, was closed to the public in 2010 in a cost-cutting measure by Boston Borough Council.

Blackfriars is a theatre and arts centre that was formerly the refectory of the Benedictine friary, built in the 13th century and once visited by King Edward I.

Frampton Marsh and Freiston Shore are two nature reserves, managed by the RSPB, which lie on The Wash coast on either side of the mouth of The Haven.

The Boston Preservation Trust has recently extended its Blue Plaque Trail to include a total of 27 examples (as of 2024) of significant heritage to the town and its place in the world. The 2024 additions include:
*Lindum House, the former home of Sir George Gilbert Scott
*Scott House (Boston Workhouse entrance building), designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott
*The Arbor Club
*The Warehouse, former home and workshops of Mary Farmer and Terry Moores 

==Local economy==

Boston&#x27;s most important industries are food production, including vegetables and potatoes; road haulage and logistics companies that carry the food; the Port of Boston, which handles more than one million tons of cargo per year including the import of steel and timber and the export of grain and recyclable materials; shellfishing; other light industry; and tourism. The port is connected by rail, with steel imports going by rail each day to Washwood Heath in Birmingham, and the port and town are also connected by trunk roads including the A16 and the A52.

Boston&#x27;s market is held every Wednesday and Saturday in one of England&#x27;s largest marketplaces, with an additional market and outside auction held on Wednesdays on Bargate Green.

The Town has many local and national stores. Pescod Square shopping centre, located in the centre of town, houses several branded stores including Next, HMV, Waterstones and Wilko. Other big name stores in Boston include New look, Sports direct, Dunelm, TKMAXX and boots. There are several supermarkets, a Tesco and Asda, an Aldi and 2 Lidls. Several Lincolnshire coops are located around the town and both Sainsburys (inside Dobbies Garden Center) and Morrisons (in the town center) have a small presence. In 2021 a new department store opened in the Town centre called Rebos, filling the hole Oldrids and Downtown left when they vacated their Bargate department store in 2020, after 216 years of service, and moved to a new site on the outskirts of town.

In late 2013, a £100 million development was announced for the outskirts of town on the A16 towards Kirton. This development, named the Quadrant, is split in two phases. Phase one consists of a new football ground for Boston United F.C., 500 new homes, retail and business outlets, and a possible supermarket. This development also includes the beginning of a distributor road that will eventually link the A52 Grantham Road and the A16 together. Phase two, still in the development stage, consists of a possible second new marina, more new homes, and retail units.

== Crime ==
In 2016, Boston was named as the most murderous place in England and Wales.

==Health==
In the mid-2000s Boston was shown to have the highest obesity rate of any town in the United Kingdom, with one-third of its adults (31%) considered clinically obese. Obesity has been linked to social deprivation.

==Sport==

===Rugby===
The Princess Royal Arena is located on the Boardsides, just outside Boston, and is the home of Boston Rugby Football Club. The club was established in 1927 by Ernst Clark, who had an interest in providing activity for boys.

===Football===
The town has two nonleague football clubs. The more senior Boston United, nicknamed the Pilgrims, plays in the National League following promotion in 2024. The stadium is currently located on York Street in the centre of the town and has an approximate capacity of 6,200. Boston United moved out of their former ground, York Street, for the 2020–21 season, to the Jakeman&#x27;s stadium on the outskirts of town. The town&#x27;s second club, Boston Town, nicknamed the Poachers, plays in the United Counties Football League. Its home games are played at their stadium on Tattershall Road, on the outskirts of Boston.

===Rowing===
Boston Rowing Club, near Carlton Road, hosts the annual Boston Rowing Marathon each year in mid-September. Crews from throughout the world compete, starting at Brayford Pool in Lincoln, and finishing in times from three to six hours.

===Speedway===
Speedway racing was staged at a stadium in New Hammond Beck Road in the 1970s and 1980s. The Boston Barracudas raced in the British League Division Two, (now the Premier League) and in 1973 won the League and the Knock-out Cup, with one member winning the League Individual Championship. After the New Hammond Beck Road Stadium was sold for redevelopment in 1988, attempts to secure a new venue in the 1990s failed. A team, known as Boston, raced in the Conference League at King&#x27;s Lynn.

An advert for a speedway meeting on Thursday 16 July at the greyhound track in Shodfriers Lane in 1936 appeared in The Guardian on 10 July 1936. Other sources now confirm this was a grass track venue.

===Swimming===
Boston Amateur Swimming Club holds galas and open meets, including the Boston Open, and two yearly club championship events. It trains at the Geoff Moulder Swimming Pool.

===Sailing===
Witham Sailing Club is based on the banks of the Witham, with its own clubhouse.

== Media ==
Boston has two weekly newspapers, the &quot;Boston Standard&quot; and the &quot;Boston Target&quot;. The &quot;Boston Standard&quot; (previously &quot;Lincolnshire Standard&quot;) was founded in the 19th century and has been the main newspaper. The &quot;Boston Target&quot; is owned by Local World, and is &quot;Boston Standard&quot;&#x27;s main rival.

The town is served by a community radio station, Endeavour FM. It had previously been called Endeavour Online and Stump Radio, set up as a collaboration between Blackfriars Arts Centre and Tulip Radio, which first started broadcasting in 2006 on 107 FM.

==Education==

===Secondary schools===
Boston Grammar School an all-male selective school, is on Rowley Road. Its female counterpart, Boston High School is on Spilsby Road. Both schools have sixth forms open to both boys and girls. Haven High Academy is on Marian Road, and another campus on Tollfield Road – it was created in 1992 on the site of Kitwood Girls&#x27; School following its merger with another secondary modern school, Kitwood Boys&#x27; School. The town previously also had a Roman Catholic secondary school, St Bede&#x27;s in Tollfield Road (now the Tollfield Campus operated by Haven High Academy), but this was closed in 2011 following poor exam results.

=== Colleges ===
Boston College is a predominantly further education college that opened in 1964 to provide A-level courses for those not attending the town&#x27;s two grammar schools. It currently has three sites in the town. It also took over the site of Kitwood Boys&#x27; school in Mill Road following the school&#x27;s merger with Kitwood Girls&#x27; School in 1992, but this was closed in 2012, with the buildings subsequently demolished and housing built on the site.

===Independent schools===
St George&#x27;s Preparatory School is the only independent school in the town. Established in 2011, it is housed in a Grade II listed building, the former home of the town architect William Wheeler, and caters for the 3–11 year age group.

<text>Heptathela kimurai, the Kimura spider, or kimura-gumo (in Japanese), is an Old World spider, found primarily in Japan and named after Arika Kimura, who collected it in 1920. It belongs to the sub-order Mesothelae (primitive burrowing spiders) and can reach up to 3 cm in length. Its burrows are covered by a camouflaged &quot;pill box&quot; flap.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Heptathela kimurai&quot; was first described by Kyukichi Kishida in 1920, when it was placed in the genus &quot;Liphistius&quot; as &quot;L. kimurai&quot;. In 1923, Kishida erected the genus &quot;Heptathela&quot; for the species, as on re-examination he decided it was sufficiently distinct from spiders of the genus &quot;Liphistius&quot;. The species name &quot;kimurai&quot; honours the collector, Arika Kimura.

<text>Calvin B. Fowler (February 11, 1940 – March 5, 2013) was the captain of the United States gold medal basketball team at the 1967 Pan American Games. He also was co-captain of the U.S. gold medal team at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Born near Pittsburgh, he graduated from David B. Oliver High School in Pittsburgh in June 1957 and Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, in 1962. Calvin Fowler at David B. Oliver High School scored 61 points in a 101–35 win over Allegheny Vocational. Oliver only led 27–20 at the half on Fowler&#x27;s 22 points, but Fowler poured in 39 in the final two quarters (January 1958).

In the early 1960s, Fowler was a member of the Akron Wingfoots. Fowler was an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) All-America in 1967 and again in 1968 for Akron Goodyear Wingfoots. He would later play in the American Basketball Association for the Carolina Cougars in the 1969–70 season. He played 18 times for the United States.

He is buried in the Eastern Shore Veterans Cemetery in Hurlock, Maryland.

<doc id="65201" wikidata="Q252986" url="?curid=65201" title="Kickflip">
<text>The kickflip is a skateboarding trick, in which the rider flips their skateboard 360° along the axis that extends from the nose to the tail of the deck. When the rider is regular footed the board spins clockwise if viewed from the front.

It was the first of many modern tricks to be invented by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s, and it opened the door to contemporary concepts of board sports wherein the board and rider separate then re-join. In March 2011, Zoltan &quot;The Magician&quot; Torkos was credited to land the first kickflip on a surfboard.

==Origin==
In the 1970s freestyle skateboarders learned to flip the board over beneath them by lifting a rail edge of the board–and flipping it without any leverage of the tail. While the board flipped completely over, the technique employed no upward force, and the setup required the rider to stand with both feet facing the nose. Any connection to the contemporary kickflip is conceptual, since the two tricks employ radically different riding styles on boards that do not have comparable functional features.

In 1982 Rodney Mullen invented the modern form of the trick in Massachusetts, initially naming it the &quot;Ollie Flip&quot;; the term &quot;Magic Flip&quot; was popularized by other skaters who could not figure out how Mullen was flipping his board. The kickflip employs many of the same techniques that Alan Gelfand discovered when he created the technique for the ollie, but Gelfand&#x27;s ollie unifies the board and rider using both feet in a single reaction of force and counterforce wherein board and rider bounce into the air and come back down in unison. Mullen&#x27;s kickflip separates the board and rider using both feet in opposing reactions of force and counterforce wherein the rider flicks, the board flips, and the rider catches it only returning to unison in the downward arc of the trick.

This technique of separating the board and rider became a tremendous amount of the vernacular of street skaters–and later vert skaters–introducing skateboarding to the era of flip tricks, many of which Rodney Mullen also created. Many of the skaters credited with defining skate culture, and discovering how to use flip tricks in a contemporary manner–Daewon Song, Ronnie Creager, Kareem Campbell, Enrique Lorenzo, JB Gillet–were sponsored by Mullen&#x27;s company World Industries.
== Execution ==

To perform a kickflip, the rider ollies into the air and lifts the back foot from the board while simultaneously sliding the front foot across the skateboard diagonally forward and towards the heel side. This front foot motion, sometimes called &quot;the flick&quot;, spins the board, flipping it completely over. Before landing, the rider stops the spin by returning the feet to the board as it nears its original position.

The board revolves around its longitudinal axis, like an aileron roll. To understand this motion and the direction of rotation, imagine stepping backwards off a skateboard, leaving it in front of you, then rolling it over on the ground toward you; during the kickflip, the board spins similarly, but in mid-air beneath the rider. During a heelflip, a similar trick, the rider slides their front heel toward the opposite side that they would with a kick flip, resulting in a rotation of the board opposite to the kick flip. 
== Variations ==
Once a skateboarder masters the kickflip, many variations are possible:

* Using a faster &quot;flick&quot; motion, the rider can spin the board multiple revolutions before landing. These tricks are named with respect to the number of revolutions: Double Kickflip (or &quot;Double Flip&quot;), Triple Flip, etc.

* Many tricks combine the kickflip with a revolution of the board on the z axis in multiples of 180 degrees, as happens during a pop shove-it. Backside rotations form the Varial Flip (180 degrees), 360 Flip, 540 Flip, etc. Frontside rotations form the Hardflip (180 degrees) and 360 Hardflip.
* During a kickflip the board and rider may both rotate together frontside or backside. These tricks are generally named using the number of degrees rotated and the direction of the spin—e.g. Backside 180 Kickflip (or &quot;Backside Flip&quot;)—but may have special names for 360 rotations.

* The rider may rotate Backside or frontside in the air while the board does not. The most common variation is the Kickflip Body Varial, where the rider spin frontside 180 degrees, landing on the board in switch stance.
* The rider and board may rotate in opposite directions. These rarer tricks have less-established names. Some skaters have coined &quot;Mother Flip&quot; to describe a 360 Flip (rotating backside) combined with a 360 frontside body varial.
* During the board&#x27;s spin, the rider may catch it with his/her hand(s) before landing. These tricks are often named according to the type of grab used. E.g. Kickflip Indy, Kickflip Melon.
* The rider may initiate the board&#x27;s flip later in the ollie (after the ascent), or with the foot used to pop the board off the ground (the back foot in an ollie or front foot in a nollie). E.g., the most common is a Nollie Lateflip (or &quot;Frontfoot Lateflip&quot;), where the rider initiates the &quot;flick&quot; of a kickflip in the middle of a nollie. The Backfoot Lateflip (or &quot;Late Backfoot Flip&quot;) has the rider using the back foot to initiate the flip during an ollie. Generally in &quot;late&quot; flips, since the flip occurs when the board is more parallel to the ground, the rider must initiate it with a downward tap of the foot rather than sliding a foot off an edge.
* The Double Kickflip is often combined with other types of kickflips. Examples include the Varial Double Flip (180 degree backside rotation), Double Hardflip (180 degree frontside rotation), and the Double 360 Flip (360 degree backside rotation).
* During the flip of the board, the rider may use the top of the front foot to alter the trick. In a Kickflip Underflip, the rider reverses the direction of the spin after the board has flipped once. In a Hospital Flip, the rider stops the rotation half-way, then flips the board 180 degrees on the axis pointing in the direction of the rider&#x27;s feet so it lands right side up in the opposite direction.

<text>Curaçao, officially the Country of Curaçao (; Papiamentu: &quot;Pais Kòrsou&quot;), is a constituent island country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the southern Caribbean Sea, specifically the Dutch Caribbean region, about north of Venezuela.

Curaçao includes the main island of Curaçao and the much smaller, uninhabited island of Klein Curaçao (&quot;Little Curaçao&quot;). Curaçao has a population of 158,665 (January 2019 estimate), with an area of ; its capital is Willemstad. Together with Aruba and Bonaire, Curaçao forms the ABC islands. Collectively, Curaçao, Aruba, and other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. It is the largest of the ABC islands in terms of area and population, as well as the largest in the Dutch Caribbean.

The island&#x27;s name &quot;Curaçao&quot; may originate from the indigenous autonym of its people; this idea is supported by early Spanish accounts referring to the inhabitants as Indios Curaçaos. Curaçao&#x27;s history begins with the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians; the island becoming a Spanish colony after Alonso de Ojeda&#x27;s 1499 expedition. Though labelled &quot;the useless island&quot; due to its poor agricultural yield and lack of precious metals, it later became a strategic cattle ranching area. When the Dutch colonized the island in 1634, they shifted the island&#x27;s focus to trade and shipping and later made it a hub of the Atlantic slave trade. Members of the Jewish community, fleeing persecution in Europe, settled here and significantly influenced the economy and culture.

British forces occupied Curaçao twice during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but it was returned to Dutch rule. The abolition of slavery in 1863 led to economic shifts and migrations. Dutch remains the official language, though Papiamentu, English, and Spanish are widely spoken, reflecting the island&#x27;s diverse cultural influences. Curaçao was formerly part of the Curaçao and Dependencies colony from 1815 to 1954 and later the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 2010, as Island Territory of Curaçao.

The discovery of oil in the Maracaibo Basin in 1914 transformed Curaçao into a critical refinery location, altering its economic landscape. There were efforts towards becoming a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the island achieved autonomy in 2010.

== Etymology ==

One explanation for the island&#x27;s name is that &quot;Curaçao&quot; was the autonym by which its indigenous peoples identified themselves. Early Spanish accounts support this theory, referring to the indigenous peoples as &quot;Indios Curaçaos&quot;.

From 1525, the island was featured on Spanish maps as &quot;Curaçote, Curasaote, Curasaore&quot;, and even &quot;Curacaute&quot;. By the 17th century, it appeared on most maps as &quot;Curaçao&quot; or &quot;Curazao.&quot; On a map created by Hieronymus Cock in 1562 in Antwerp, the island was called &quot;Qúracao&quot;.

A persistent but undocumented story claims the following: in the 16th and 17th centuries—the early years of European exploration—when sailors on long voyages got scurvy from lack of vitamin C, sick Portuguese or Spanish sailors were left on the island now known as Curaçao. When their ship returned, some had recovered, probably after eating vitamin C-rich fruit there. From then on, the Portuguese allegedly referred to the island as &quot;Ilha da Curação&quot; (Island of Healing) or the Spanish as &quot;Isla de la Curación.&quot;

== History ==
===Pre-colonial===
The original inhabitants of Curaçao were the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians. Their ancestors had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, probably hundreds of years before Europeans&#x27; first arrival.

===Spanish colonization===
The first Europeans recorded as seeing the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Caquetios (Arawak) for forced labour in their Hispaniola colony, but paid little attention to the island itself. In 1515, almost all of the 2,000 Caquetios living there were also transported to Hispaniola as slaves.

Established in 1499 as a Spanish launchpad for exploring northern South America, Curaçao was officially settled by Spain in 1527. It functioned as an island extension of Venezuela throughout the 1500s. As mainland colonization advanced, Spain slowly withdrew from the island. The city registry of Caracas, Venezuela holds one of the earliest written mentions of Curaçao. A document dated 9 December 1595 states that Francisco Montesinos, priest and vicar of &quot;the Yslas de Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire&quot; conferred his power of attorney to Pedro Gutiérrez de Lugo, a Caracas resident, to collect his ecclesiastic salary from the Royal Treasury of King Philip II of Spain.

The Spanish introduced numerous tree, plant and animal species to Curaçao, including horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle from Europe and other Spanish colonies. In general, imported sheep, goats and cattle did relatively well. Cattle were herded by Caquetios and Spaniards and roamed freely in the kunuku plantations and savannas.

Not all imported species fared equally well, and the Spanish also learned to use Caquetio crops and agricultural methods, as well as those from other Caribbean islands. Though historical sources point to thousands of people living on the island, agricultural yields were disappointing; this and the lack of precious metals in the salt mines led the Spanish to call Curaçao &quot;the useless island&quot;.

Over time, the number of Spaniards living on Curaçao decreased while the number of aboriginal inhabitants stabilized. Presumably through natural growth, return and colonization, the Caquetio population then began to increase. In the last decades of Spanish occupation, Curaçao was used as a large cattle ranch. At that point, Spaniards lived around Santa Barbara, Santa Ana and in the villages in the western part of the island, while the Caquetios are thought to have lived scattered all over the island.

===Dutch colonial rule===
In 1634, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War of independence between the Republic of the Netherlands and Spain, the Dutch West India Company under Admiral Johann van Walbeeck invaded the island; the Spanish surrendered in San Juan in August. Approximately 30 Spaniards and many indigenous people were then deported to Santa Ana de Coro in Venezuela. About 30 Taíno families were allowed to live on the island while Dutch colonists started settling there.

The Dutch West India Company founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the Schottegat; the natural harbour proved an ideal place for trade. Commerce and shipping—and piracy—became Curaçao&#x27;s most important economic activities. Later, salt mining became a major industry, the mineral being a lucrative export at the time. From 1662, the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao a centre of the Atlantic slave trade, often bringing slaves from West Africa to the island, before selling them elsewhere in the Caribbean and Spanish Main.

Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution in Spain and Portugal sought safe haven in Dutch Brazil and the Dutch Republic. Many settled in Curaçao, where they made significant contributions to its civil society, cultural development and economic prosperity. In 1674 the island became a free port.

In the Franco-Dutch War of 1672–78, French Count Jean II d&#x27;Estrées planned to attack Curaçao. His fleet—12 men-of-war, three fire ships, two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers—met with disaster, losing seven men-of-war and two other ships when they struck reefs off the Las Aves archipelago. The serious navigational error occurred on 11 May 1678, a week after the fleet set sail from Saint Kitts. To commemorate its narrow escape from invasion, Curaçao marked the events with a day of thanksgiving, which was celebrated for decades into the 18th century.
Many Dutch colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, building impressive colonial buildings in the capital of Willemstad; the city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In 1795, a major slave revolt took place under the leaders Tula Rigaud, Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and Pedro Wakao. Up to 4,000 slaves in northwest Curaçao revolted, with more than 1,000 taking part in extended gunfights. After a month, the slave owners were able to suppress the revolt.
Curaçao&#x27;s proximity to South America resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas more than a century after the independence of the Netherlands from Spain. Architectural similarities can be seen between 19th century Willemstad neighborhoods and the nearby Venezuelan city of Coro in Falcón State, which has also been designated a World Heritage Site. Netherlands established economic ties with the Viceroyalty of New Granada that included the present-day countries of Colombia and Venezuela. In the 19th century, Curaçaoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Brión were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of both Venezuela and Colombia. Political refugees from the mainland, such as Simon Bolivar, regrouped in Curaçao.

During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, British forces twice occupied Curaçao; the first occupation lasted from 1800 to 1803, and the second occupation from 1807 to 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic wars stable Dutch rule returned in 1815. After the signing of the Treaty of London, the island was incorporated into the colony of Curaçao and Dependencies.

The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, causing vast changes in the economy with the shift to wage labour. Some Curaçao inhabitants emigrated to other islands, such as Cuba, to work in sugarcane plantations. Other former slaves had nowhere to go and continued working for plantation owners under the tenant farmer system, in which former slaves leased land from former masters, paying most of their harvest to owners as rent. The system lasted until the early 20th century.

Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of the colonial administration, but its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until the early 19th century, when the British occupied all three islands. Teaching of Spanish was restored when Dutch rule resumed in 1815. Also, efforts were made to introduce widespread bilingual Dutch and Papiamentu education in the late 19th century.

===20th and 21st centuries===
When oil was discovered in the Venezuelan Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande in 1914, Curaçao&#x27;s economy was dramatically altered. In the early years, both Shell and Exxon held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to refineries in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. Both Shell and Exxon were vertically integrated and controlled the entire industry, from pumping, transporting, and refining to sales. The refineries on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues the sale of oil products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries.

In 1929, Curaçao was attacked by Venezuelan rebel commander Rafael Simón Urbina, who, with 250 soldiers, captured the fort. The Venezuelans plundered weapons, ammunition, and the island&#x27;s treasury. They also managed to capture the Governor of the island, Leonardus Albertus Fruytier (1882–1972), and hauled him off to Venezuela on a stolen American ship, &quot;Maracaibo&quot;. Fruytier was criticized and had to resign as governor. After returning to the Netherlands, he settled for a position as chief inspector in Maastricht. The Dutch increased their military presence on the island.

In 1936 a burning bale of cotton thrown overboard by the crew of the M. S. Colombia, which lay anchored in the Schottegat, caused the oil floating on the water to catch fire. It took days to get the fire under control; houses had to be evacuated, but there were no casualties.

During the Second World War, the island played an important role in the supply of fuel for the Allied forces. In 1940, before the invasion of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany, the British occupied Curaçao and the French Aruba. The presence of powers other than the Netherlands alarmed the Venezuelan government given the proximity of these islands at the entrance to the Gulf of Venezuela and the fact they&#x27;d historically been used as bases to launch incursions against Venezuelan territory. In 1941, US troops occupied the island and built military airport &quot;Hato&quot;. The main purpose was this deployment was to fight against expected future attacks by Axis submarines and potentially long-distance Nazi bombers. America was also concerned over the potential threat of a German invasion of the continental US launched with the aid of German settlers in South America.

In 1942 the port of Willemstad, one of the main sources of fuel for the Allied operations, was besieged by German submarines on several occasions under Neuland Operation. In August 1942, the Germans returned to Curaçao and attacked a tanker and received fire from a Dutch shore battery before slipping away. The US Navy established the Fourth Fleet, which was responsible for countering enemy naval operations in the Caribbean and in the South Atlantic. The US Army also sent aircraft and personnel to help protect the oil refineries and bolster the Venezuelan Air Force.

In 1954, Curaçao and other Dutch Caribbean colonies were joined to form the Netherlands Antilles. Discontent with Curaçao&#x27;s seemingly subordinate relationship to the Netherlands, ongoing racial discrimination, and a rise in unemployment owing to layoffs in the Shell refinery led to a series of riots in 1969. 
A state of emergency was declared after rioters set fire the Willemstad downtown and the bankers mansions. Protestors had to face the Dutch Navy marines dispatching from the local military base on the island, in order to quell the rebellion led by charismatic politicians as Papa Godett and Stanley Browne. The riots resulted in two deaths, numerous injuries and severe damage in Willemstad. In response, the Dutch government introduced far-reaching reforms, allowing Afro-Curaçaoans greater influence over the island&#x27;s political and economic life, and increased the prominence of the local Papiamentu language.

Curaçao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell&#x27;s refinery on the island operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global overproduction, stronger competition, and low market expectations threatened the refinery&#x27;s future. In 1985, after 70 years, Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Curaçao. This came at a crucial moment. Curaçao&#x27;s fragile economy had been stagnant for some time. Several revenue-generating sectors suffered even more during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation of the bolivar, and a slowdown in the transportation sector had deleterious effects on the Antillean Airline Company and the Curaçao Dry Dock Company. The offshore financial services industry also experienced a downturn due to new U.S. tax laws.

In the mid-1980s, Shell sold its refinery for the symbolic amount of one Antillean guilder to a local government consortium. In recent years, the aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that its emissions, including sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, far exceed safety standards. The government consortium leases the refinery to the Venezuelan PDVSA state oil company.

Continuing economic hardship in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in much emigration to the Netherlands.

On 1 July 2007, Curaçao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, like Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. On 28 November 2006, the change was delayed when the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007. On 15 December 2008, Curaçao was again scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. A non-binding referendum on the move was held in Curaçao on 15 May 2009; 52% of voters supported it.

====Since the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles====
The dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles came into effect on 10 October 2010. Curaçao became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. The kingdom was also tasked with overseeing the island&#x27;s finances under a debt-relief arrangement agreed upon between the two. Curaçao&#x27;s first prime minister was Gerrit Schotte. He was succeeded in 2012 by Stanley Betrian, &quot;ad interim&quot;. After the 2012 elections, Daniel Hodge became the third prime minister on 31 December 2012. He led a demissionary cabinet until 7 June 2013, when a new cabinet under the leadership of Ivar Asjes was sworn in.

Although Curaçao is autonomous, the Netherlands has intervened in its affairs to ensure that parliamentary elections are held and to assist in finalizing accurate budgets. In July 2017, Curaçaoan Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath said he wanted Curaçao to take full responsibility over its affairs, but asked for more cooperation and assistance from the Netherlands, with suggestions for more innovative approaches to help Curaçao succeed and increase its standard of living. The Dutch government reminded the Curaçaoan government that it had provided assistance with oil refinery negotiations with the Chinese &quot;on numerous occasions&quot;.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted in austerity measures. Curaçao had to impose spending cuts to qualify for additional aid from the Netherlands. As part of the austerity package, the Government of Curaçao announced a 12.5% cut in benefits for civil servants. On 24 June 2020, a group of civil servants, together with waste collectors from Selikor, marched to Fort Amsterdam and demanded to speak with Rhuggenaath. The demonstration turned into a riot, and police cleared the square in front of Fort Amsterdam with tear gas. The city centre of Willemstad was later looted. 48 people were arrested, the city districts of Punda and Otrobanda were placed under lockdown for the night, and a general curfew was declared from 20:30 to 06:00.

== Geography ==

Curaçao, lies on the continental shelf of South America featuring a hilly topography, with its highest point reaching above sea level. named Christoffelberg. Curaçao has diverse range of beaches from coastline&#x27;s bays, inlets, lagoons, seasonal lakes, rough seas at its northshore, and a spring water. In addition, Curaçao has upwelling which is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler and nutrient-rich water from deep ocean moving towards the ocean surface, contributing to the source of natural minerals, thermal conditions, and seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, making the island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region. Furthermore, off the southeast coast of the main island of Curaçao lies the tiny unhabitated Isle of Klein Curaçao. Klein Curaçao boasts long stretched beach.

=== Flora ===
Curaçao&#x27;s flora differ from typical tropical island vegetation. Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub is the most notable, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs, evergreen, and watapana trees (&quot;Libidibia coriaria&quot;; called &quot;divi-divi&quot; on Aruba), which are characteristic of the ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba. &quot;Brassavola nodosa&quot; is a drought-tolerant species of &quot;Brassavola,&quot; one of the few orchids present in the ABC islands. Cacti include &quot;Melocactus&quot; and &quot;Opuntia&quot; species such as &quot;Opuntia stricta&quot;.
=== Fauna ===
Curaçao is semi-arid, and as such has not supported the numerous tropical species of mammals, birds, and lizards most associated with rainforests. Dozens of species of hummingbirds, bananaquits, orioles, and the larger terns, herons, egrets, and even flamingos make their homes near ponds or in coastal areas. The trupial, a black bird with a bright orange underbelly and white swatches on its wings, is common to Curaçao. The mockingbird, called &quot;chuchubi&quot; in Papiamentu, resembles the North American mockingbird, with a long white-grey tail and a grey back. Near shorelines, big billed brown pelicans feed on fish. Other seabirds include several types of gulls and large cormorants.

Other than field mice, small rabbits, and cave bats, Curaçao&#x27;s most notable animal is the white-tailed deer. This deer is related to the American white-tailed deer, or Virginia deer, found in areas from North America through Central America and the Caribbean, and as far south as Bolivia. It can be a large deer, some reaching in length and in height and weighing as much as . It has a long tail with a white underside and is the only type of deer on the island. It has been a protected species since 1926, and an estimated 200 live on Curaçao. They are found in many parts of the island, but most notably at the west end&#x27;s Christoffel Park, where about 70% of the herd resides. Archaeologists believe the deer were brought from South America to Curaçao by its original inhabitants, the Arawaks.

There are several species of iguana, light green in colour with shimmering shades of aqua along the belly and sides, found lounging in the sun across the island. The iguanas found on Curaçao serve not only as a scenic attraction but, unlike many islands that gave up the practice years ago, remain hunted for food. Along the west end of the island&#x27;s north shore are several inlets that have become home to breeding sea turtles. These turtles are protected by the park system in Shete Boka Park and can be visited accompanied by park rangers.

=== Climate ===
Curaçao has a hot, semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;) with a dry season from January to September and a wet season from October to December. Rainfall is scarce, only 450 millimeters (12 inches) per year; in particular, the rainy season is drier than it normally is in tropical climates; during the dry season, it almost never rains. Owing to the scarcity of rainfall, the landscape of Curaçao is arid; especially on the north coast of the island. Temperatures are relatively constant, with small differences measured throughout the year. The trade winds cool the island during the day and warm it at night. The coolest month is January with an average temperature of ; the hottest is September with an average temperature of . The year&#x27;s average maximum temperature is . The year&#x27;s average temperature is . The seawater around Curaçao averages around and is coolest (avg. ) from February to March, and hottest (avg. ) from September to October.

Because Curaçao lies North of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and in an area of low-level divergence where winds flow parallel to the coast, its climate is much drier than expected for the northeastern side of a continent at its latitude. Rainfall is also extremely variable from year to year, being strongly linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation. As little as may fall in a strong El Niño year, but as much as is not unknown in powerful La Niña years.

Curaçao lies outside the Main Development Region for tropical cyclones, but is still occasionally affected by them, as with Hurricanes Hazel in 1954, Anna in 1961, Felix in 2007, and Omar in 2008. No hurricane has made landfall in Curaçao since the US National Hurricane Center started tracking hurricanes. Curaçao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical storms several times; the latest being Hurricane Tomas in 2010, Cesar in 1996, Joan in 1988, Cora and Greta in 1978, Edith and Irene in 1971, and Francelia in 1969. Tomas brushed past Curaçao as a tropical storm, dropping as much as of rain on the island, nearly half its annual precipitation in a single day. This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the island&#x27;s history, as well as one of the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NAƒ50 million (US$28 million) in damage.

According to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, average carbon dioxide emissions per person on the island were 52 tonnes in 2018, the second highest in the world.

Meteo, the Curaçao weather department, provides up-to-date information about weather conditions via its website and mobile apps for iOS and Android.

=== Climate change ===
Average temperatures have risen sharply in the past 40 years in the Caribbean Netherlands and Curaçao has experienced more warm days and fewer cooler nights. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that should air temperatures increase by 1.4 degrees, there will be a 5% to 6% decrease in rainfall, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (including a 66% increase in hurricane intensity), and a 0.5- to 0.6-meter sea-level rise in the Caribbean Netherlands.
=== Geology ===

The northern seabed drops steeply within of the Curaçaoan shore. This drop-off is known as the &quot;blue edge&quot;.

On Curaçao, four major geological formations can be found: the lava formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Curaçao formation and limestone formations.

Curaçao lies within the Caribbean large igneous province (CLIP) with key exposures of those lavas existing on the island consisting of the Curaçao Lava Formation (CLF). The CLF consists of 5 km of pillow lavas with some basalt intrusions. The ages of these rocks include 89 Ma for the lavas and 75 Ma for the poikilitic sills, though some sequences may have erupted as late as 62–66 Ma, placing them in the Cretaceous period. Their composition includes picrite pillows at the base, followed by tholeiitic lavas, then hyaloclastites, then the poikilitic sills. The CLF was gradually uplifted until Eocene-Miocene limestone caps formed, before final exposure above sea level. Christoffelberg and the Zevenbergen (Seven Hills) portion of the island have exposures of the Knip Formation. This formation includes deepwater deposits of calcareous sands and fine clays, capped by siliceous chert containing radiolarians. Middle Curaçao contains alluvial soils from eroded CLF and limestone.

=== Beaches ===

Curaçao has 37 beaches. Most are on the south side of the island. The best known are:
* Baya Beach
* Blue Bay
* Boca Sami
* Daaibooi
* Grote Knip (Kenepa Grandi)
* Kleine Knip (Kenepa Chiki)
* Kokomo Beach
* Mambo Beach
* Piscaderabaai
* Playa Forti
* Playa Jeremi
* Playa Kas Abao
* Playa Kalki
* Playa Kanoa
* Playa Lagun
* Playa Porto Marie
* Playa Santa Cruz
* Playa Santa Barbara
* Seaquarium Beach
* Sint Michielsbaai
* Vaersenbaai 
* Westpunt
== Architecture ==
The island has diverse architectural styles reflecting the influence of the various historical rulers over the region, including Spain, the Netherlands, with more modern elements under Western influence primarily including the United States and other European countries. This ranges from ruins and colonial buildings to modern infrastructure.

=== Forts ===

When the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, and pirates. Six of the best-preserved forts can still be seen today:

* Fort Amsterdam (1635)
* Fort Beekenburg (1703)
* Fort Nassau (1797)
* Waterfort (1826)
* Rif Fort (1828)
* Fort Piscadera (built between 1701 and 1704)

In 1957, the hotel Van der Valk Plaza Curaçao was built on top of the Waterfort.

The Rif Fort is located opposite of the Waterfort, across the Otrobanda harbour entrance. It contains restaurants and shops, and in 2009, the Renaissance Curaçao Resort and Casino opened next to it.

==Politics==
After being part of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao became autonomous, along with Sint Maarten island, while the less populated islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba remained special municipalities governed by the Netherlands.

===Government===

Curaçao is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its governance takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. The King of the Netherlands is the head of state, represented locally by a governor, with the Prime Minister of Curaçao serving as head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.

The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Convicted felons are held at the Curaçao Centre for Detention and Correction.

Curaçao has full autonomy over most matters; the exceptions are outlined in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the title &quot;Kingdom affairs&quot;.

=== Military ===

Defence of the island is the responsibility of the Netherlands. The Netherlands Armed Forces deploy both ground and naval units in the Caribbean with some of these forces based on Curaçao. These forces include:

* a company of the Royal Netherlands Army on Curaçao on a rotational basis;
* a Fast Raiding Interception and Special Forces Craft (FRISC) troop (fast boats);
* a guardship, normally a Holland-class offshore patrol vessel, from the Royal Netherlands Navy on station in the Caribbean on a rotational basis;
* the Royal Netherlands Navy support vessel HNLMS Pelikaan;
* Curmil (Curaçaoan) militia elements;
* Elements of a Royal Marechaussee brigade of the Armed Forces.

Two Dutch naval bases, Parera and Suffisant, are located on the island of Curaçao. Officers of the Arubaanse Militie complete additional training on Curaçao. The Curaçao Volunteer Corps is also stationed at the Suffisant Naval Barracks.

On the west side of Curaçao International Airport are hangars for the two Bombardier Dash 8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft and two AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Until 2007, the site was a Royal Netherlands Navy air base which operated for 55 years with a wide variety of aircraft, including Fireflies, Avengers, Trackers, Neptunes, Fokker F-27s, P-3C Orions, Fokker F-60s and several helicopter types. After the political decision to sell off all Orions, the air base wasn&#x27;t needed anymore.

The west end of the airport is a USAF Forward Operating Location (FOL). The base hosts Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS), cargo aircraft, aerial refueling planes, and reconnaissance aircraft. Until 1999, the USAF operated a small fleet of F-16 fighters from the FOL. The PAE corporation runs base operations at the FOL.

==== Conscription ====
Suffisant Naval Base has facilities used for conscription in the Caribbean. There has been no military conscription since 1997, but a form of civil conscription has replaced it, compelling underprivileged young Antilleans to undertake professional training.

== Economy ==

Curaçao has an open economy; its most important sectors are tourism, international trade, shipping services, oil refining, oil storage and bunkering, and international financial services. Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA&#x27;s lease on the island&#x27;s oil refinery expired in 2019; the facility employs 1,000 people, refining oil from Venezuela for export to the US and Asia. Schlumberger, the world&#x27;s largest oil field services company, is incorporated in Curaçao. The is said to be responsible for Curaçao&#x27;s position as one of the world&#x27;s top five highest per capita CO2 emission-producing countries.

Along with Sint Maarten, Curaçao uses the Netherlands Antillean guilder as its currency. Its economy is well-developed, supporting a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 27th in the world in terms of nominal GDP per capita. Curaçao possesses a high-income economy as defined by the World Bank. 
Activities related to the port of Willemstad, such as the Free Trade Zone, make significant contributions to the economy. To achieve greater economic diversification, the Curaçaoan government is increasing its efforts to attract more foreign investment. This policy, called the &quot;Open Arms&quot; policy, features a heavy focus on attracting information technology companies.

Since 2016, reduced foreign demand for goods due to the ongoing unrest and political uncertainty in Venezuela has led to decreased exports and increased domestic demand for goods and services, resulting in economic stagnation. While many economic sectors contracted, expansion took place in the construction, financial intermediation, and utilities sectors.

=== Tourism ===
While tourism plays a major role in Curaçao&#x27;s economy, the island is less reliant on tourism than many other Caribbean countries. Most tourists come to Curaçao from the Netherlands, the eastern United States, South America and other Caribbean islands. Curaçao was a Caribbean leader in cruise ship tourism growth, with 610,186 cruise passengers in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the previous year. Hato International Airport received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and announced capital investments totaling US$48 million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional hub by 2018.

The Curaçaoan insular shelf&#x27;s sharp drop-off known as the &quot;Blue Edge&quot; is often visited by scuba diving tourists. Coral reefs for snorkeling and scuba diving can be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. At the westernmost point of the island is Watamula and the Cliff Villa Peninsula which are good locations for drift diving. The coastline of Curaçao features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations for boats.

In June 2017, the island was named the Top Cruise Destination in the Southern Caribbean by Cruise Critic, a major online forum. The winners of the Destination Awards were selected based on comments from cruise passengers who rated the downtown area of Willemstad as &quot;amazing&quot; and the food and shopping as &quot;excellent&quot;. The historic centre of Willemstad is a World Heritage Site. Another attraction is the town&#x27;s colourful street art. The Blue Bay Sculpture Garden with works from known Curaçao artists is situated in a nearby resort. Landhuis Bloemhof is an art museum and gallery located in Willemstad.

Some of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. Porto Marie Beach is experimenting with artificial coral reefs in order to improve the reef&#x27;s condition. Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish. It is now under investigation to see if the sewer waste of hotels is a partial cause of the dying of the coral reef.

Ecotourism is a growing segment of Curaçaoan tourism. One site in particular – Mambo Beach, also known as &quot;Seaquarium Beach&quot; – is a popular destination due to the calm tides for children, frequent viewing of marine life, and vibrant coral reefs – some of which have been artificially planted to improve reef health.
=== Labour ===
In 2016, a Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicated that the unemployment rate was 13.3%. For residents ages 15–64, the employment rate was 70.4%.

=== Financial services ===
Curaçao&#x27;s history in financial services dates back to World War I. Prior to this period, the financial arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. However, at the turn of the 20th century, Curaçao underwent industrialization, and a number of merchant houses established private commercial banks. As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually becoming full-fledged financial institutions.

The Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the oldest central bank in the Western Hemisphere. The island&#x27;s legal system supports a variety of corporate structures and is a corporate haven. Though Curaçao is considered a tax haven, it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status from the United States Internal Revenue Service. It is an accepted jurisdiction of the OECD and Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. The country enforces Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism funding compliance.

==== Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ====
On 30 June 2014, Curaçao was deemed to have an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the &quot;Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act&quot; of the United States of America. The Tax Information Exchange Agreement signed in Washington, D.C., on 17 April 2002 between the U.S. and the Kingdom of the Netherlands includes Curaçao, and was updated with respect to Curaçao in 2014, taking effect in 2016.

=== Trade ===
Curaçao trades mainly with the United States, Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Curaçao to export products to European markets, free of import duties and quotas. It is also a participant in the US Caribbean Basin Initiative allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.

=== Prostitution ===

Prostitution in Curaçao is legal only for foreign women who get a temporary permit to work in the large open-air brothel called &quot;Le Mirage&quot; or &quot;Campo Alegre&quot;. Using prostitution services is legal for men (locals included). The brothel has operated near the airport since the 1940s. Curaçao monitors, contains and regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners. However this approach does exclude local women (or men) to legally make a living from prostitution and does lead to loss of local income, as the foreign prostitutes send or take most of their earnings home.

==== Developments of Campo Alegre (2020–2024) ====
Since its closure in 2020 after 71 years of operation, Campo Alegre, Curaçao&#x27;s largest open-air brothel, has been at the center of significant developments. Following the closure, a government-appointed working group proposed three scenarios for the site: transforming it into a regulated prostitution area, repurposing it for commercial use, or converting it into a residential area.

In 2023, the property was put up for auction, attracting various potential buyers. In a significant move, the Curaçao government purchased the Campo Alegre property, aiming to have more control over its future use.

The current ruling political party, Movement for the Future of Curaçao (MFK), had made an election promise to reopen Campo Alegre as a regulated prostitution center. This promise aligns with the recommendations of the working group and reflects the party&#x27;s stance on creating a controlled environment for sex work.

As of 2024, the government is evaluating scenarios to ensure that the chosen path will benefit the local economy and social landscape.

The U.S. State Department has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that, &quot;Curaçao...[is a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked.&quot; The US Department of State has said that the government of Curaçao frequently underestimates the extent of human trafficking problems.

== Demographics ==
Owing to the island&#x27;s history of colonial times, the majority of the Curaçaoans are of African descent, including many of &quot;Mulatto&quot; descent (mixed African and European descent). There are also significant minorities of immigrants and Curaçaoans of Dutch, French, Portuguese, Latin American, South Asian, East Asian, and Levantine descent on the island.

According to 2022 data from the CIA, Curacao has a total of only 92 men for every 100 women. 

=== Religion ===
The religious breakdown of the population of Curaçao, according to a 2011 estimate:
*Roman Catholic; 69.8%
*Adventist; 9%
*Evangelical; 8.9%
*Pentecostal; 7.6%
*Other Protestant; 3.2%
*Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses; 2%
*Other; 3.8%
*None; 10%
*Unspecified; 0.6%

There has been a shift towards the Charismatic movement in recent decades. Other denominations include the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Methodist Church. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practise Montamentu and other diaspora African religions. As elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also practising Muslims and Hindus.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Willemstad encompasses all the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean which includes Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba. The diocese is also a member of the Antilles Episcopal Conference.

While small, Curaçao&#x27;s Jewish community has had a significant impact on the island&#x27;s history. Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Americas, dating to 1651. The Curaçao synagogue is the oldest synagogue of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue. Additionally, there are both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish communities. As of the year 2000 there were approximately 300 Jewish people living on the island.

=== Languages ===
Curaçao is a multilingual society. The official languages are Dutch, Papiamentu and English. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters. Most of Curaçao&#x27;s population is able to converse in at least two, though more commonly in all four of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish.

The most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, a Portuguese creole with African, Dutch and Spanish influences, spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced as a language of primary school education in 1993, making Curaçao one of a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire basic literacy.
Spanish and English also have a long historical presence in Curaçao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish territories in what are now Venezuela and Colombia and several Venezuelan TV networks are received. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British occupied Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted the widespread use of the English language.

According to the 2001 census, Papiamentu was the first language of 81.2% of the population. Dutch of 8%, Spanish of 4%, and English of 2.9%. However, these numbers divide the population in terms of first language and do not account for the high rate of bilingualism in the population of Curaçao.

=== Localities ===
Curaçao was divided into five districts from 1863 to 1925, after which it was reduced to the two outer districts of Bandabou and Bandariba and the city district of Willemstad. Over the years, the capital, Willemstad, encompassed the entire area surrounding the large natural harbour, the Schottegat. As a result, many formerly isolated villages have grown together to form a large urbanised area. The city covers approximately one third of the entire island in the east. Willemstad&#x27;s most famous neighbourhoods are:

===Structure of the population===


===Statistics===
=== Education ===

Public education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues for six years; secondary lasts for another four.

The main institute of higher learning is the University of Curaçao (formerly University of The Netherlands Antilles), enrolling 2,100 students. The comprehensive model of education is influenced by both the Dutch and American education systems. Other higher education offerings on the island include offshore medical schools, universities, language schools and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.

== Culture ==
=== Visual art ===
Visual art in Curaçao encompasses painting, sculptures, and street art.

Curaçao promotes street art with a festival, Kaya Kaya, held in the Otrabanda neighborhood of Willemstad. The streets of Willemstad are filled with murals from multiple versions of the festival.

=== Literature ===
Despite the island&#x27;s relatively small population, the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Curaçao have generated a remarkable literary tradition, primarily in Dutch and Papiamentu. The oral traditions of the Arawak indigenous peoples are lost. West African slaves brought the tales of Anansi, thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by Joseph Sickman Corsen entitled &quot;Atardi&quot;, published in the &quot;La Cruz&quot; newspaper in 1905. Throughout Curaçaoan literature, narrative techniques and metaphors best characterized as magic realism tend to predominate. Novelists and poets from Curaçao have contributed to Caribbean and Dutch literature. Best known are Cola Debrot, Frank Martinus Arion, Pierre Lauffer, , Guillermo Rosario, and Tip Marugg.

=== Cuisine ===
Local food is called &quot;Krioyo&quot; (pronounced the same as &quot;criollo&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;Creole&quot;) and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. Dishes common in Curaçao are found in Aruba and Bonaire as well. Popular dishes include stobá (a stew made with various ingredients such as papaya, beef or goat), Guiambo (soup made from okra and seafood), kadushi (cactus soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to fufu, ugali and polenta) and fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous side dish is fried plantain. Local bread rolls are made according to a Portuguese recipe. All around the island, there are snèks which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English pub.

The ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings of cheese, tuna, ham, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed, such as the hallaca and pekelé, made out of salt cod. At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: kokada (coconut sweets), ko&#x27;i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and tentalaria (peanut sweets). The Curaçao liqueur was developed here, when a local experimented with the rinds of the local citrus fruit known as laraha. Surinamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as satay, nasi goreng and lumpia (which are all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as croquettes and oliebollen are widely served in homes and restaurants.

=== Sports ===

In 2004, the Little League Baseball team from Willemstad, Curaçao, won the world title in a game against the United States champion from Thousand Oaks, California. The Willemstad lineup included Jurickson Profar, the standout shortstop prospect who most recently played for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball, and Jonathan Schoop.

Curaçaoan players Andruw Jones, Ozzie Albies, and Kenley Jansen have made multiple Major League Baseball All-Star Game appearances.

The 2010 documentary film &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; details Curaçao&#x27;s Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country&#x27;s eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport.

The prevailing trade winds and warm water make Curaçao a location for windsurfing.

There is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers and snorkelers may have visibility up to at the Curaçao Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along of Curaçao&#x27;s southern coastline.

Curaçao participated in the 2013 CARIFTA Games. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a distance of . Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 female with a time of 4:47.97.

The Curaçao national football team won the 2017 Caribbean Cup by defeating Jamaica in the final, qualifying for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They then traveled to Thailand and participated in the 2019 King&#x27;s Cup for the first time, eventually winning the tournament by beating Vietnam in the final.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Airport ===
Curaçao International Airport (also called Hato International Airport) is located on the northern coast of the island and offers connections to the Caribbean region, South America, North America and Europe. Curaçao Airport is a fairly large facility, with the third longest commercial runway in the Caribbean region after Rafael Hernández Airport in Puerto Rico and Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport in Guadeloupe. The airport served as a main base for Insel Air, and for Air ALM, the former national airlines of Curaçao.

=== Railways ===
In 1887 a horse drawn street tramway opened in Punda, the part of the capital Willemstad on the eastern side of Sint Annabaai. It had a U-shaped route about 2 km in length. In 1896, a tramway opened in Otrabanda on the opposite side of the bay, but it ceased operations within a few months. The Punda line was rebuilt in 1911, regauged to metre gauge, and the horse-drawn trams replaced by petrol engined ones. The line closed in 1920.

=== Bridges ===

The Queen Emma Bridge, a long pontoon bridge, allows pedestrians to walk between the Punda and Otrobanda districts. This swings open to allow the passage of ships to and from the port. The bridge was originally opened in 1888 and the current bridge was installed in 1939. It is best known and, more often than not, referred to by the locals as &quot;Our Swinging Old Lady&quot;.

The Queen Juliana Bridge carries motor vehicle traffic between the same two districts and its 1974 opening allowed the Queen Emma Bridge to become a pedestrian-only bridge. At above the sea, the Queen Juliana Bridge is one of the highest bridges in the Caribbean.

=== Utilities and sanitation ===
Aqualectra, a government-owned company and a full member of CARILEC, delivers potable water and electricity to the island. Rates are controlled by the government. Water is produced by reverse osmosis or desalinization. It services 69,000 households and companies using 130,000 water and electric meters. The power generation company NuCuraçao opened wind farms in Tera Kora and Playa Kanoa in 2012, and expanded in Tera Kora in 2015. There is no natural gas distribution grid; gas is supplied to homes by pressurized containers.

Curbside trash pickup is provided by the Selikor company. There is no recycling pickup, but there are drop-off centers for certain recycled materials at the Malpais landfill, and various locations operated by Green Force; private haulers recycle construction waste, paper, and cardboard.

<text>Year 344 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rutilus and Torquatus (or, less frequently, year 410 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 344 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* The king of Caria, Idrieus, dies, leaving the Persian satrapy, by his will, to his sister Ada, to whom he was married.

==== Greece ====
* Philip II of Macedon besieges Perinthus, which had defied him and was inclining towards his opponents the Athenians, the Perinthian&#x27;s allies Byzantium and the Achaemenid Empire support Perinthus in their defence of the city.
* Philip divides his army, leaving one part to besiege Perinthus and taking the other to besiege Byzantium.
* The Athenian statesman, Demosthenes, travels to Peloponnesus, in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon&#x27;s influence, but his efforts are generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians see Philip II as the guarantor of their freedom, so they send a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes&#x27; activities. In response to these complaints, Demosthenes delivers the Second Philippic, which is a vehement attack against Philip II.

==== Sicily ====
* The aristocracy of Syracuse appeal to their mother city of Corinth against their tyrant Dionysius II. The Corinthian general Timoleon is chosen to lead a liberation force to Sicily. Landing at Tauromenium (Taormina) on March 21st, Timoleon faces two armies, one under Dionysius and the other under Hicetas (tyrant of nearby Leontini), who has also called in Carthaginian forces. By shrewd tactics Timoleon defeats his enemies and occupies Syracuse.
* Dionysius II goes into exile once more after the successful invasion by Timoleon of Corinth.

=== By topic ===

==== Science ====
* The Greek philosopher and scientist, Aristotle, travels from Assus to Lesbos to study natural history, especially marine biology.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

* Idrieus, king of Caria

<text>Hlothhere (; died 6 February 685) was a King of Kent who ruled from 673 to 685.

Hlothhere succeeded his brother Ecgberht I in 673. His parents were Eorcenberht of Kent and Seaxburh of Ely, the daughter of Anna of East Anglia. In 676 the Mercian king Æthelred invaded Kent and caused great destruction; according to Bede, even churches and monasteries were not spared, and Rochester was laid waste. The damage was so great that Putta, Bishop of Rochester, resigned. So too did his successor, Cwichhelm, due to the poverty of the see.

Hlothhere&#x27;s rule survived this onslaught, however. He appears for a time to have reigned jointly with his nephew Eadric, son of Ecgberht I, since a code of laws still extant was issued under both their names. A law code, the Law of Hlothhere and Eadric, is jointly attributed to him and his successor Eadric. In 685, Eadric went into exile and led the South Saxons against Hlothhere, who was defeated and died of his wounds.

The information is derived from Bede, but Hlothhere is the earliest Kentish king for whom genuine charters survive. One charter known from a 15th-century copy, is precisely dated to 1 April 675 in the first year of Hlothhere&#x27;s reign, which conflicts with the accession date attributed to him by Bede. The Charter of King Hlothhere of Kent, 679 survives in its original form. Two further charters attributed to Hlothere (S1648, S1648a), appear to have been altered copies of charters of Swæfheard and Swæfberht. (Kelly 1995).

<doc id="65212" wikidata="Q200333" url="?curid=65212" title="Hapkido">
<text>Hapkido ( , , also spelled hap ki do or hapki-do; from Korean 합기도 &quot;hapgido&quot; ) is a Korean martial art. It is a hybrid form of self-defense that employs joint locks, grappling, chokeholds, throwing techniques, kicks, punches, and other striking attacks. It also teaches the use of traditional weapons, including knife, sword, rope, nunchaku (ssang juhl bong), cane (ji pang ee), short stick (dan bong), and middle-length staff (joong bong), gun (analogous to the Japanese jō), and bō (Japanese), which vary in emphasis depending on the particular tradition examined.

Hapkido employs both long-range and close-range fighting techniques, utilizing jumping kicks and percussive hand strikes at longer ranges, and pressure point strikes, joint locks, and throws at closer fighting distances. Hapkido emphasizes circular motion, redirection of force, and control of the opponent. Practitioners seek to gain advantage over their opponents through footwork and body positioning to incorporate the use of leverage, avoiding the use of brute strength against brute strength.

The art was adapted from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu as it was taught by Choi Yong-sool (최용술) when he returned to Korea after World War II after having lived in Japan for 30 years. This system was later combined by Choi&#x27;s disciples with kicking and striking techniques of indigenous and contemporary arts such as Taekkyon and Tang Soo Do; as well as various throwing techniques and ground fighting from Japanese Judo.

== Name ==
&quot;Hapkido&quot; or in the native Korean writing system hangul is rendered as in hanja. This is similar to how the Japanese &quot;aikido&quot; was written using kyūjitai in the pre-1946 period. Currently, though, the second character is preferably written in Japanese using shinjitai, which replaces the original 氣 with the modern, simplified , thus reducing the number of strokes by four.

In hanja, the character &quot;hap&quot; means &quot;coordinated&quot;, &quot;joining&quot;, or &quot;harmony&quot;; &quot;ki&quot; literally means air, gas or breath but is used to mean spirit or so-called &#x27;internal energy&#x27;; and &quot;do&quot; means &quot;way&quot; or &quot;art&quot;, yielding a literal translation of &quot;joining-energy-way&quot;. It is most often translated as &quot;the way of coordinating energy&quot;, &quot;the way of coordinated power&quot;, or &quot;the way of harmony&quot;.

Although Japanese aikido and Korean hapkido share common technical origins, in time they have become separate and distinct from one another. They differ significantly in philosophy, range of responses, and manner of executing techniques. The fact that they share the same Japanese technical ancestry represented by their respective founders&#x27; practice of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, and that they share the same Chinese characters, despite being pronounced &quot;ai&quot; in Japanese and &quot;hap&quot; in Korean, has proved problematic in promoting hapkido internationally as a discipline with its own set of unique characteristics differing from those common to Japanese martial arts.

== History and major figures from Korea ==
The birth of modern hapkido can be traced to the efforts of a group of Korean nationals in the post-Japanese colonial period of Korea: Choi Yong-sool (최용술) (1904–1986) and his most prominent students; Chinil Chang, his personally chosen successor, Seo Bok-Seob, the first student of the art; Ji Han-jae (born 1936), one of the earliest promoters of the art; Jung Hwan Park, a long time student of Choi; Kim Moo-hong, a major innovator; Myung Jae-nam, a connector between the art of hapkido and aikido; and Myung Kwang-sik the historian and ambassador, all of whom were direct students of Choi or of his immediate students.

=== Choi Yong-sool ===

Choi Yong-sool (최용술)&#x27;s training in martial arts is a subject of contention. It is known that Choi was sent to Japan as a young boy and returned to Korea with techniques characteristic of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, a forerunner of aikido.

The subsequent history is quite controversial in Daitō-ryū circles but is claimed by many contemporary hapkido-ists and is attributed to Choi in an interview that took place during a trip Choi made to the United States in 1980 to visit his direct lineage successor Chin-il Chang in New York City. In the interview with Chin-il Chang, Choi claimed to have been adopted by Takeda Sōkaku when he was 11 years old and to have been given the Japanese name Yoshida Asao. He claims to have been taken to Takeda&#x27;s home and dojo in Akita on Shin Shu mountain where he lived and trained with the master for 30 years. The interview also asserts that he travelled with him as a teaching assistant, that he was employed to catch war deserters and that he was the only student to have a complete understanding of the system taught by Takeda.

This is contradicted by other claims asserting that Choi was simply a worker in the home of Takeda. The meticulous enrollment and fee records of Tokimune Takeda, Takeda&#x27;s eldest son and Daitō-ryū&#x27;s successor, do not seem to include Choi&#x27;s name among them. Therefore, except for claims made by Choi himself, there is little evidence that Choi was the adopted son of Takeda. Kondo Katsuyuki (current head of the mainline Daito Ryu) has however released a page from Takeda Sokaku&#x27;s eimeiroku that contains Choi Yong-sul&#x27;s name.

Stanley Pranin, then of Aiki News and now editor of the Aikidojournal.com, asked Kisshomaru Ueshiba about Choi Yong-sool and hapkido:

While Kondo Katsuyuki has released documentation from Takeda Sokaku&#x27;s eimeiroku that confirms that Choi Yong-sul did in fact study with him for a short time, some scholars believe it is likely that Choi received most of his training in Daito Ryu from Yoshida Kotaro.

Choi Yong-sool&#x27;s first student, and the man whom some claim helped him develop the art of hapkido was Seo Bok-seob, a Korean judo black belt when they met. Some of Choi&#x27;s other respected senior students are: Chinil Chang, Lim Hyun-soo, Ji Han-Jae, Chung Kee-tae, Kim Moo-hong, and arguably Suh In-hyuk () and Lee Joo-bang () who went on to form the arts of Kuk Sool Won and modern Hwa Rang Do respectively (though some argue that their training stems from time spent training under Kim Moo-hong).

=== Chang (Jang) In-mok ===

Grand Patriarch Jang In-mok (born 15 August 1912) of Daegu, who also trained under Takeda Sokaku&#x27;s lineage, returned to Daegu in 1945 like Grand Patriarch Choi Yong-sul. He was a doctor of Oriental medicine and taught aikijitsu as hapkido. Jang learned Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul Hapkido from his teachers Masuta Yutaka and Takeda Sokaku in Japan. Choi Yong-sool trained many students but Jang only trained a few. Jang&#x27;s notable students included Han-young Choi (Chun Ki Do), Jang Seeung-ho, Song Joon-hwi, Hu Il-wong (teacher of Peter and Joseph Kim) and Song Il-hun. He introduced the Dae Don Ryu Sul system to Korea in 1960. He first learned martial arts in Japan in September 1928 with Daito-ryu Jujitsu and received his certificate in 1935 from Yutaka, a student of Sodaku.

=== Han-young Choi ===

Kwang Jang Nim Han-young Choi was born in Kyongkido, Korea December 11, 1935. He began his formal martial arts training at the age of four, instructed by his father (Chun-san Choi) and his uncle (Man-san Choi), in 1939 to learn his family&#x27;s martial arts system, a system based on stepping, spinning, and jumping. The founder of Chun Ki Do Hapkido Grand Master Han-young Choi learned also Taekwondo Mudokwan under Grandmaster Hwang Kee Hwang Ki and was also a top student and pioneer of Taekwondo in Korea. Choi, Han-young Choi, was the first student of Dr. Chang In-mok&#x27;s Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul system in Seoul. His martial arts are based on stepping techniques (triangle step, cross step, skip step), turning and jumping. His early years of formal training at a Buddhist monastery in Kyongi do, where he learned meditation, breathing, and application into the physical world. Hounslow (developed into modern hapkido) – joint manipulation from Grandmaster Chang In Mok. Grandmaster Chang has the same training and lineage as Grandmaster Choi Yong-sul...both brought what is now known as hapkido to Korea from Japan, except Grandmaster Choi commercialized it and Grandmaster Chang did not. Grandmaster Chang focused on oriental medicine and acupuncture. He Choi learned acupuncture and pressure points from him. Before he founded the World Chun Ki Association, he belonged to the Daehan Hapkido association and Kuk Sool Won Association. One of his best friends was Suh In-hyuk&#x27;s older brother, and he asked Grandmaster Choi to help spread Kuk Sool Won in Seoul. In the old days, they spread martial arts by fighting the owner of the neighbourhood schools. Then taking them over and changing the names and techniques. One school at a time, he went neighbourhood by neighbourhood, fighting school owners and taking over schools in the name of Kuk Sool Won. Then he moved to the U.S. and after getting fed up with the politics of Daehan and Kuk Sool Won, he quit and founded the World Chun Ki Do Association.

Choi, Han-young, was also a pioneer of the Taekwondo Han Moo Kwan system. He held the number one Black Belt certificate from the Han Moo Kwan. Choi, after he had studied for three years under Dr. Chang In-mok, moved to Seoul and began to teach Dae Dong Ryu Yu Sul. But he joined the Kuk Sool organization and taught Dae Dong Ryu Sul under the Kuk Sool name. One of his best friends was Suh In-hyuk&#x27;s older brother, and he asked Choi to help spread Kuk Sool Won in Seoul. He also has been belonged to the Daehan Hapkido association. In 1972, Choi Han-young immigrated to the United States and moved to El Paso, Texas. He created his own system called Choi&#x27;s Martial Arts, and later in the 90s, he renamed it to Chun Ki (Heavenly Power). It was his ambition to acquire do so that Chun Ki Do become accepted as a new style, and he achieves tenth-degree black belt status. Grandmaster&#x27;s goal was to develop his own martial art to reach the 10th-degree black belt. So Chun Ki was born. It took a long time and a lot of work to add the long-dreamed-of Do, and Chun Ki Do gain worldwide recognition in the line of hapkido. As a new style in the colour hapkido world as its own style, Grand Master Han-young Choi was awarded the title of Grand Patriarch, the founder of Chun Ki Do Hapkido. He has trained over 50,000 students in Asia, Europe, and America and is respected by many as one of the few remaining original Hapkido Grandmasters. His belt examination program is methodical and didactically structured, all techniques are explained in simple steps and easy for everyone to understand. With his 15 hand levers, his bring techniques to the man are unique in martial arts. A few of the notable students were: His son Sam Choi, Daniel Ray Walker, and Roman Nikolaus Urban who founded the Chun Ki Do Association in Africa and Europe, Jaeshin Cho his Nephew and Gregory Jump His first Top-student.

=== Seo Bok-seob ===
Choi&#x27;s first student and the first person known to have opened up a dojang under Choi was Seo Bok-seob (서복섭, also spelled Suh Bok-sup).

In 1948, when Seo Bok-sub was still in his early 20s, he had already earned his black belt in judo and was a graduate of Korea University. After watching Choi Yong-sool successfully defend himself against a group of men when an argument erupted in the yard of the Seo Brewery Company, Seo who was son of the chairman of the company, invited Choi to begin teaching martial arts to him and some workers at the distillery where he had prepared a dojang.

In 1951, Seo opened up the first proper dojang called the &quot;Daehan Hapki Yukwonsool Dojang (대한합기유권술도장)&quot;. Seo also incorporated many of judo&#x27;s throws and ground work techniques to the teachings of master Choi. The first symbol for hapkido was designed by Seo, which was used to denote the art was the inverted arrowhead design featured in both the modern incarnation of the KiDo Association and by Myung Kwang-Sik&#x27;s World Hapkido Federation. Choi Yong-sool was also employed during this time as a bodyguard to Seo&#x27;s father who was a congressman. Seo and Choi agreed to shorten the name of the art from &#x27;hapki yu kwon sool&#x27; to &#x27;hapkido&#x27; in 1959.

===Ji Han-jae===

Ji Han-jae (지한재) was undoubtedly the prime mover in the art of Korean hapkido. It is due to his physical skills, technical contributions, promotional efforts and political connections as head hapkido instructor to the presidential body guard under Korean President Park Chung-hee that hapkido became popularized, first within Korea and then internationally.

If the martial art education of Choi Yong-sool is unconfirmed, the same must be said for martial art history of Ji Han-jae&#x27;s training, apart from his time as a student of Choi. Ji was an early student (Dan #14) of Choi. He details that prior to opening his martial art school in Seoul, the Sung Moo Kwan (성무관), he also supposedly studied from a man known as &#x27;Taoist Lee&#x27; and an old woman he knew as &#x27;Grandma&#x27;.

As a teacher of hapkido, Ji incorporated traditional Korean kicking techniques (from Taoist Lee and the art Sam Rang Do Tek Gi) and punching techniques into the system and gave the resulting synthesis the name hapkido in 1957.

Although a founding member of the Korea Kido Association (대한기도회) in 1963 with Choi Yong-sool as titular chairman and Kim Jeong-yoon as Secretary General and Head Instructor for the association, Ji found himself not able to exert as much control over the organization as he might have wished. To this end and with the support of the Head of the Security Forces, Park Jong-kyu, Ji founded the very successful Korea Hapkido Association (대한 합기도 협회) in 1965.

Later, when this organization combined with the organizations founded by Myung Jae-nam (Korea Hapki Association/한국 합기회) and Kim Moo-Hong (Korean Hapkido Association/한국 합기도 협회) in 1973, they became the very extensive and influential organization known as the Republic of Korea Hapkido Association (대한민국 합기도 협회).

In 1984, after being released from prison for fraud, Ji moved first to Germany and then to the United States, and founded Sin Moo Hapkido (신무 합기도), which incorporates philosophical tenets, a specific series of techniques (including kicks) and healing techniques into the art. Three of Ji Han-jae&#x27;s notable students in Korea were Kwon Tae-man (권태만), Myung Jae-nam (명재남) and Chang Young-shil (장영실) who is the current president of the International Hapkido Federation. Ji can be seen in the films &quot;Lady Kung-fu&quot; and &quot;Game of Death&quot; in which he takes part in a long fight scene against Bruce Lee.

After the death of Choi Yong-sool in 1986, Ji came forward with the assertion that it was he who founded the Korean art of hapkido, asserting that Choi Yong-sool taught only yawara based skills and that it was he who added much of the kicking and weapon techniques we now associate with modern hapkido. The reality being that Grandmaster Choi Yong-sool taught him little of the original art and higher level techniques so he fabricated a new system on his own terms. He also asserted that it was he who first used the term &#x27;hapkido&#x27; to refer to the art. While both claims are contested by some of the other senior teachers of the art, what is not contested is the undeniably huge contributions made by Ji to the art, its systematization and its promotion worldwide.

===Chang Chin-il===
A direct student of Choi, Chin-il Chang (장진일) inherited the title of Doju in Choi&#x27;s personal and complete system of hapkido on January 15, 1985, becoming the second direct lineage Grandmaster.

On April 5, 1985, Choi personally awarded Chang with the title of Doju (Keeper of the way). Chang also had the privilege and honor of being the first hapkido master awarded the 9th Dan certificate by Choi in 1980.

A large inauguration ceremony followed on April 11, 1985. The historic event was covered and documented by Korea Sports News and MBC Korean Television. Choi Young-sool, Chang, and Choi&#x27;s son, the late Choi Bok-yeol, were in attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Interview 02/02/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Choi left the full documentation and recordings of the system to Chang, who continued to research and document the full history and development of hapkido.

Furthermore, the future Grandmaster, who was a personally trained, closed-door disciple of Choi, was given Letter of Appointment certificates, the second dated December 1, 1977, and the third dated March 5, 1980. This gave Chang more progressive power and authority in Choi&#x27;s Hapkido Association. These specific certificates, along with his 9th Dan ranking in 1980, and Doju title in 1985, amply demonstrate that Choi was grooming Chang to be the future Grandmaster of Hapkido.

Chang&#x27;s intimate video interview(one of several over decades) with his teacher Doju Choi during his visit to New York City has been abused through numerous interpretations and translations. Some have even claimed erroneously to have conducted the interview themselves, further clouding and distorting the truth and gravity inherent in the interview. These endless distortions were generally rebutted in various media each time they appeared.

Doju Chang continues to teach in New York City after decades of maintaining a commercial school, as well as a stint teaching hapkido at the United Nations. He currently teaches a small group in NYC dedicated to the preservation of hapkido. Many detractors have spread endless conjecture about him. One lineage created further controversy by stating Choi passed the system to his only son, Choi Bok-yeol, which is incorrect, misleading, and insulting to the legacy and wishes of Choi. Black Belt Magazine, respecting Chin-il Chang as the second lineage successor, asked him to write a brief obituary on Choi that appeared in the April 1987 issue.

Doju Chang died peacefully in his sleep on February 23, 2018, at the age of 77 as a result of hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

=== Kim Moo-hong ===
Kim Moo-hong (김무홍; alternately rendered as Kim Moo-woong or Kim Mu-hyun) was a student from the Choi and Seo&#x27;s Daehan Hapki Yukwonsool Dojang, who later taught at Seo&#x27;s main dojang in Taegu. Seo, who promoted Kim to 4th degree, credits Kim with the development of many kicks which are still used in hapkido today. Kim apparentally took the concepts from very basic kicks he had learned from Choi and went to a temple to work on developing them to a much greater degree. Later, in 1961, Kim travelled to Seoul and while staying at Ji Han-jae&#x27;s Sung Moo Kwan dojang they finalized the kicking curriculum.

Kim went on to found his Shin Moo Kwan dojang (신무관) in the Jongmyo section of Seoul, also in 1961. Won Kwang-hwa (원광화) and Kim Jung-soo(김정수) also served as instructors at this dojang. Kim&#x27;s notable students were Lee Han-cheol (이한철), Kim Woo-tak (김우탁; who founded the Kuk Sool Kwan Hapkido dojang), Huh Il-woong (허일웅), Lee Joo-bang (이주방; who founded modern Hwa Rang Do), Na In-dong (나인동), Shin Dong-ki (신동기) and Seo In-hyuk (서인혁; who founded Kuk Sool Won).

Originally a member of the Korea Kido Association, the organization sent Kim to teach hapkido in the United States in 1969. Upon returning to Korea in 1970, Kim looked to Ji Han-Jae&#x27;s move to set up his own organization and with the encouragement of his students followed suit and founded the Korean Hapkido Association in 1971. Later he combined this organization with the groups led by Ji Han-Jae and Myung Jae-nam to form the Republic of Korea Hapkido Association.

=== Lim Hyun-soo ===
Lim Hyun-soo was born in Geochang County, South Gyeongsang Province, of Korea on Sept. 7, 1944. In 1965 he visited hapkido founder Choi Yong-sool and experienced the martial art for the first time. In 1965, Lim began his training in hapkido under Kim Yeung-jae, the chief instructor at Choi&#x27;s studio. From 1978, Lim attained all of his ranks and training directly from Choi. During his training, Lim endured strict and intense training. With Choi&#x27;s blessing, he launched &quot;jungkigwan&quot; on October 24, 1974. In 1976, Choi retired and closed his studio and joined &quot;jungkigwan&quot;, though he retired from public teaching. Choi privately taught Lim during his visits and also spent his days at the studio playing baduk (Go) with Lim. During these times, Lim asked Choi about Hapkido techniques. 

Lim based &quot;jungkigwan&quot; in Daegu and was promoted to 9th dan by Choi. Lim is an accomplished swordsman and created Chung Suk Kuhapdo after studying sword styles in Japan and Korea. Choi told Lim that learning swordsmanship would be an essential component to his hapkido training. Lim attends his studio daily to teach students from home and abroad. Since 1996, he has visited the U.S. many times for seminars. In addition, he has hosted Hapkido and Chung Suk Kuhapdo seminars in European countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands.


=== Han Bong-soo ===

Han Bong-soo (한봉수; alternately rendered as Bong-soo Han) began his training in hapkido after seeing a demonstration put on by the founder, Yong-sul Choi. From then on, he committed himself to hapkido training under Choi and other teachers, but never received any direct high ranking from Choi himself. Han was one of the world&#x27;s foremost practitioners of hapkido, and is referred to as the Father of his own offshoot of modern hapkido in the Western World. He led a dedicated effort in the development of his own version of hapkido. He taught thousands of loyal students throughout his life with many becoming masters themselves. Other masters across all styles have sought out his wisdom and teachings.

In 1967, Han emigrated to the United States of America, first staying with and teaching at his friend S. O. Choi&#x27;s hapkido school in California. Han later opened his own school in Los Angeles in 1968. His early years were difficult and he worked in a factory during the day while he taught at a struggling hapkido school in the evening located in an economically depressed area. Later, he relocated his school to the Pacific Palisades area in an effort to be closer to Hollywood and the movie industry.

On July 4, 1969, Han Bong-soo was giving a demonstration of hapkido at a park in Pacific Palisades, California. In the audience was Tom Laughlin. After a spectacular demonstration, Laughlin approached Han about being involved in a movie project called &quot;Billy Jack&quot;. Han gained critical acclaim for staging and performing some of the most realistic martial arts fight sequences in a film. Before &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, movies contained at most brief references to martial arts, with fights portrayed by actors who had little training. With &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, Han introduced authentic hapkido techniques to Western audiences. In its sequel, &quot;The Trial of Billy Jack&quot;, he received a co-starring part where he spoke about and demonstrated the art, mentioning the art by name for the first time.

Han studied and refined this Korean martial art for more than 60 years. He was not a direct high level student of Grandmaster Yong-sul Choi but created and crafted his own limited version from various other teachers that he expanded and taught throughout the world.

===Kim Jung-soo===
Kim Jung-soo (김정수) was born and raised in the Taegu area, Korea, and started training Hapkido directly under Choi Yong-sool (최용술) in 1957. He was one of the earlier students of Hapkido, and one source puts him as the eight original student of Choi Yong-sool. Kim Jung-soo trained sporadically under Choi Yong-sool (최용술) along with his primary teachers and influencers Kim Moo-hong (김무홍) and Won Kwang-wha (원광화) from 1957 until 1986.

In 1961, Kim Moo-hong (김무홍) moved to Seoul to open a dojang, and Kim Jung-soo (김정수) and Won Kwang-wha (원광화) went with him and became his dojang&#x27;s primary instructors. Together, they developed the Shin Moo Kwan (신무관) branch of Hapkido. In 1963 Kim Jung-soo (김정수) decided to go his own way and opened his own dojang in Taegu under the banner of Yun Bee Kwan (윤비관). Later, his students began opening branch schools throughout the greater Taegu aerea, under various names, but still considered to be part of the Yun Bee Kwan (윤비관) family. These schools are known to hold tightly to the original teachings of Choi, Yong-sool (김정수), while also including most of the refinements done by Kim Moo-hong (김무홍) in terms of kicking methods.

Kim Jung-soo (김정수) is mostly known for being the founder and president of the Korea-based World Hapkido General Federation, also known as World Hapkido Federation, collecting most of the schools under the Yun Bee Kwan (윤비관) linage in one federation. This organization has since expanded worldwide. While having a similar name, this organization is not to be confused with the U.S. based World Hapkido Federation founded by Kwang Sik Myung (광시숭).

Kim Jung-soo is currently teaching from his dojang in Taegu City, South Korea.

=== Myung Jae-nam ===
In 1972, Myung Jae-nam (명재남) was one of the original members of the Korea Hapkido Association (대한 합기도 협회), which was formed in 1965 at the request of the South Korean President Park Jeong-hee. The Korea Hapkido Association was formed with the assistance of Park Jong-kyu, who was the head of the Presidential Protective Forces and one of the most powerful men in Korea at the time.

Myung Jae-nam exchanged martial art techniques and information with an Aikido practitioner named Hirata in 1965, for a period of about four years and included many aikido-like techniques into his version of hapkido. He has produced Several books and videos on the subject of hapkido self-defense. Later Myung Jae-nam broke away from all the other organizations and started to focus on promoting a new style, hankido. Until his death in 1999 he was the leader of the International Hapkido Federation.

=== Lee Chong-min ===
Chong-min Lee was born and raised in Seoul, Korea. He began his study of hapkido as a teenager and continued studying hapkido throughout his life though not a direct student of the late Grandmaster Yong-sool Choi. He is a self-promoted 9th Degree Black Belt, the Master Instructor of Hapkido Center, President of The World Hapkido Association.

Lee served as an Instructor with the 1st Special Forces Group in the Korean Army, and has taught martial arts to the Police Departments in Seoul as well as Plainfield, New Jersey. He has also served as the director of Hapkido demonstrations for such dignitaries as Hubert H. Humphrey and the Chancellor of the Republic of China, Mr. Chang, during their visits to Seoul, Korea. Lee came to the United States in June 1980. He currently operates a Hapkido Center in Warren, New Jersey, and is also a member of the Law Enforcement Officers Association New Jersey State. He has been instructing students for over 42 years in hapkido.

=== Kim Myung-Yong ===
Kim Myung-yong was born in Korea in 1942. He started at the age of 17 training at Seung Moo Kwan School under Grandmaster Ji Han-jae. He was a hapkido instructor in the military camp of Wang Shim Ri. His style of Hapkido Jin Jung Kwan has locations all over the world and is one of the largest hapkido styles practiced.

===Kim Yun-sik===
Kim Yun-sik (김윤식) was born in Seoul in 1943. He is the founder of Bum Moo Kwan Hapkido. He began his martial arts training in 1954 under the direction of Choi Yong-sool, and received the black belt from Choi in 1957. That same year, he received the black belt in Tang Soo Do from Grandmaster Hwang Kee.

Kim is the founder of the Bum Moo Kwan style, in which the practitioner is instructed to finish the encounter quickly, using any available material as weapon or any part of his body, aiming the opponent&#x27;s pressure or vital points. Bum Moo is one of the three original and government regulated Hapkido Kwans.

Residing, teaching and training in Brazil since 1977, Kim was the master of several Hapkido World Champions, such as Norberto Serrano Jr., Rafael Tercarolli and Leandro Heck Gemeo.

=== Lim Chae-kwan===
Grandmaster Lim Chae-kwan is the founder of Jin Mu Kwan. The Jin Mu Kwan (&quot;Jin&quot;: &quot;authentic, true&quot;; &quot;Mu&quot;: &quot;martial&quot;; &quot;Kwan&quot;: &quot;school or training hall&quot;) is a traditional art of hapkido. 

This school was founded by Grandmaster Lim Chae-kwan in 2007 after many years of research and study into the Hapkido of Founder Choi Young-sul. As a high school student, Lim, Chea-kwan began his Hapkido training under Grand Master Lim, Hyun-soo. Through the courtesy of his teacher at that time Grand Master Lim, Hyun-soo, president of the Jung Ki-kwan, he obtained a 4th dan certificate signed by Founder Choi Yong-sul. Since Choi&#x27;s death in 1986 GM Lim studied with the top students of Founder Choi. Some of these Grandmasters were GM Jun Jeong-pil (kicking), GM Lee Jae-young (advanced wrist technology), GM Lee Young-hee (clothing grab defense), GM Chae Hung-jun (special offensive techniques for joint locking and throwing), GM Kim Yeong-jae (special self-protection techniques).

GM Lim Chae-kwan after studying Founder Choi&#x27;s Hapkido style and feeling his very high level martial arts has studied diligently his whole life to become a skilled craftsman in Hapkido.

== Principles ==
On the &quot;hard-soft&quot; scale of martial arts, hapkido stands somewhere in the middle, employing &quot;soft&quot; techniques similar to jujutsu and aikido as well as &quot;hard&quot; techniques reminiscent of taekwondo and tang soo do. Even the &quot;hard&quot; techniques, though, emphasize circular rather than linear movements. Hapkido is an eclectic, hybrid martial art, and different hapkido schools emphasize different techniques. However, some core techniques are found in each school (&quot;kwan&quot;), and all techniques should follow the three principles of hapkido:

* Harmony or blending principle ()
* Circle principle ()
* Flowing or water principle ()

Hwa, or harmony, is simply the act of remaining relaxed and not directly opposing an opponent&#x27;s force. For example, if an opponent were to push against a hapkido practitioner&#x27;s chest, rather than resist and push back, the hapkido practitioner would blend with the opponent, avoiding any direct confrontation by moving in the same direction as the push and utilizing the opponent&#x27;s forward momentum to execute a throw. Thus, this principle is largely based on energy conservation, allowing the hapkido practitioner to remain strong and fresh while his opponent becomes tired throughout the conflict. 

Won, the circle principle, is a way to gain momentum for executing the techniques in a natural and free-flowing manner (much like being swept up in a vortex). If an opponent attacks in a linear motion, as in a punch or knife thrust, the hapkido practitioner would redirect the opponent&#x27;s force by leading the attack in a circular pattern, thereby adding the attacker&#x27;s power to his own. Once he has redirected that power, the hapkido practitioner can then execute any of a variety of techniques to incapacitate his attacker. The hapkido practitioner must learn to view an attacker as an &quot;energy entity&quot; rather than as a physical entity. The bigger the person is, the more energy a person has, and the better it is for the hapkido practitioner. Additionally, these circular motions are not limited to mere circles but can also take on spiral or even helical formations, which further serve to confound your adversaries.

Yu, the water principle, is analogous to the concept of a &quot;moving target&quot; wherein the saying, &quot;In regards to a stream, you can&#x27;t step on the same water twice,&quot; the current forever moves the water downstream and that persistent flow can erode away just about anything, even a boulder, which is often perceived as a substance that&#x27;s &quot;stronger&quot; than water. Hapkido is fluid and does not rely on brute force against force. Rather it is much like water as an adaptable entity, in that a hapkido master will attempt to deflect an opponent&#x27;s strike in a way that is similar to free-flowing water being divided around a stone, only to return and envelop it.

== Techniques ==
Hapkido seeks to be a fully comprehensive fighting style and as such tries to avoid narrow specialization in any particular type of technique or range of fighting. It maintains a wide range of tactics for striking, standing joint locks, throwing techniques (both pure and joint manipulating throws) and pinning techniques. Some styles also incorporate tactics for ground fighting. (Although, these tactics generally tend to be focused upon escaping and regaining footing or controlling, striking, and finishing a downed opponent, rather than lengthy wrestling or submission grappling engagements.)

The Korean term for technique is &quot;sool&quot; (). As terminology varies between schools, some refer to defensive maneuvers as &quot;soolgi&quot; (술기; loosely translated as &quot;technique-ing&quot;), while &quot;hoshinsool&quot; (; meaning &quot;self-defense&quot;) is preferred by others.

Proper hapkido tactics include using footwork and a series of kicks and hand strikes to bridge the distance with an opponent. Then to immediately control the balance of the opponent (typically by manipulating the head and neck), for a take down or to isolate a wrist or arm and apply a joint twisting throw, depending upon the situation; Hapkido is a comprehensive system and once the opponent&#x27;s balance has been taken, there are myriad techniques to disable and subdue the opponent.

Hapkido makes use of pressure points known in Korean as &quot;hyeol&quot; () which are also used in traditional Asian medical practices such as acupuncture point. These pressure points are either struck to produce unconsciousness or manipulated to create pain allowing one to more easily upset the balance of one&#x27;s opponent prior to a throw or joint manipulation.

Hapkido emphasizes self-defense over sport fighting and as such employs the use of weapons, including environmental weapons of opportunity, in addition to empty hand techniques. Some schools also teach &quot;hyeong&quot; (), the Korean equivalent of what is commonly known as &quot;kata&quot; (or &quot;forms&quot;) in Japanese martial arts.

=== Kicking ===

The wide variety of kicks in hapkido make it distinctly Korean. Taekwondo kicks appear to be similar to many of the kicks found in hapkido, though again circular motion is emphasized. Also, in contrast to most modern taekwondo styles, hapkido utilises a wide variety of low (below the waist), hooking or sweeping kicks, with one of the most distinctive being the low spinning (sweeping) heel kick.

Hapkido&#x27;s method of delivery tends toward greater weight commitment to the strikes and less concern for quick retraction of the kicking leg. Traditionally, Choi Yong-sool&#x27;s &quot;yu kwon sool&quot; () kicking techniques were only to the lower body, but most derived varieties of hapkido, probably as a direct influence from other Korean arts, also include high kicks and jumping kicks. At the more advanced levels of Hapkido the practitioner learns &quot;blade kicks&quot; which utilize sweeping blade strikes of the inner and outer foot against pressure points of the body.

Two of the earliest innovators in this regard were Ji Han-jae and Kim Moo-hong, both of whom were exposed to what were thought to be indigenous Korean kicking arts. They combined these forms together with the yu sool concepts for striking taught to them by Choi and during a period of 8 months training together in 1961 finalized the kicking curriculum which would be used by the Korea Hapkido Association for many years to come.

Other influences also were exerted on the kicking techniques of important hapkido teachers. Kwon Tae-man (권태만) initially studied under Ji Han-jae before immigrating to southern California in the United States. Han Bong-soo studied under &quot;Gwonbeop&quot; () and Shūdōkan karate from Yoon Byung-in (윤병인), whose students were influential in the later forming of Kong Soo Do and Taekwondo styles, specifically the Chang Moo Kwan and Jidokwan. He, like Kim Moo-hong, also trained briefly in the Korean art of Taekkyon under Lee Bok-yong (이복용).

Many other teachers like Myung Kwang-sik (명광식), Jeong Kee-tae (정기태), Lim Hyun-soo (임현수), and many others trained in tang soo do and kong soo do, Shotokan and Shūdōkan karate based systems which predated and influenced the forming of first tae soo do and later modern taekwondo styles.

Kim Sang-cook states that while many of the original yu kwon sool students were exposed to many different contemporary Korean arts the Chung Do Kwan was of particular importance in the transition from the original jujutsu based form to what we know today as modern hapkido.

Most forms of hapkido include a series of double kicks used to promote balance, coordination and muscular control.

; An example of a double kick set
* Front Kick 
* Side Kick;
* Front Kick 
* Back Kick (&quot;Turning back-side Kick&quot;);
* Front Kick 
* Roundhouse Kick;
* Front Heel/Hook Kick
* Roundhouse Kick;
* Inverted Low Side Kick
* High Side Kick;
* Inside Crescent Kick/Outside Crescent Kick (or Heeldown/Axe-Kick for both)
* Side Kick (or Inside Heeldown Kick and Side Kick);
* Outside Heel-down Kick
* Roundhouse Kick;
* Ankle Scoop Kick 
* Side Kick;
* Cover Kick 
* Front Kick;
* Inside Heel Hooking-the-Thigh kick
* Front Kick;
* High Spinning Heel Kick
* Low Spinning Heel Kick;
* Inside Footblade Kick 
* Outside Footblade Kick;
* Outside Heeldown Kick 
* Roundhouse Kick

After these kicks are mastered using one foot, the student moves on to jumping versions, alternating the kicking legs.

Kim Chong-sung (김종성, Jang Mu Won Hapkido Founder) was one of the oldest living active hapkido instructors, who maintains that the source of these kicking methods is from the indigenous Korean kicking art of Taekkyon. Others feel that these kicks are more representative of kong soo do and tang soo do styles which emerged from an adaptation of Japanese karate forms.

=== Hand strikes ===
Like most martial arts, hapkido employs a great number of punches and hand strikes, as well as elbow strikes. A distinctive example of hapkido hand techniques is &quot;live hand&quot; strike that focuses energy to the &quot;baek hwa hyul&quot; in the hand, producing energy strikes and internal strikes. The hand strikes are often used to weaken the opponent before joint locking and throwing, and also as finishing techniques.

Hand striking in hapkido (unless in competition) is not restricted to punches and open hand striking; some significance is given to striking with fingernails at the throat and eyes; pulling at the opponent&#x27;s genitals is also covered in conventional training.

In order to recall hand strikes more easily in an emotionally charged situation, beginning students are taught conventional, effective patterns of blocks and counter-attacks called &quot;makko chigi&quot; (막고 치기), which progress to more complex techniques as the student becomes familiar with them.

=== Joint manipulation techniques ===

Many of hapkido&#x27;s joint control techniques are said to be derived largely from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu. They are taught similarly to Aikido and Ju Jutsu techniques, but in general the circles are smaller and the techniques are applied in a more linear fashion. Hapkido&#x27;s joint manipulation techniques attack both large joints (such as the elbow, shoulder, neck, back, knee, and hip) and small joints (such as wrists, fingers, ankles, toes, and jaw).

Most techniques involve applying force in the direction that a joint moves naturally and then forcing it to overextend or by forcing a joint to move in a direction that goes against its natural range of motion. These techniques can be used to cause pain and force a submission, to gain control of an opponent for &#x27;come along&#x27; techniques (as is often employed in law enforcement), to assist in a hard or gentle throw or to cause the dislocation or breaking of the joint. Hapkido differs from some post-war styles of Aikido in its preservation of a great many techniques which are applied against the joint that were deemed by some to be inconsistent with Aikido&#x27;s more pacifistic philosophy.

; Wristlocks
Hapkido is well known for its use of a wide variety of wristlocks. These techniques are derived from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu although their manner of performance is not always identical to that of the parent art. Still many of the techniques found in hapkido are quite similar to those of Daito-ryu and of Aikido, which was derived from that art. Examples of such techniques are: the supinating wristlock, pronating wristlock, internal rotational wristlock, and the utilization of pressure points on the wrist. These techniques are common to many forms of Japanese Jujutsu, Chinese chin na, and even &quot;catch as catch can&quot; wrestling.

; Elbowlocks
Although well known for its wristlocking techniques, Hapkido has an equally wide array of tactics which center upon the manipulation of the elbow joint (see armlock). The first self-defense technique typically taught in many hapkido schools is the &quot;knife-hand elbow press&quot;. This technique is thought to be derived from Daitō-ryū&#x27;s &quot;ippondori&quot;, a method of disarming and destroying the elbow joint of a sword-wielding opponent. Hapkido typically introduces this technique off a wrist-grabbing attack where the defender makes a circular movement with his hands to free himself from the opponent&#x27;s grasp and applies a pronating wristlock while cutting down upon the elbow joint with their forearm, taking their opponent down to the ground, where an elbow lock is applied with one&#x27;s hand or knee to immobilize the attacker in a pin. Both Daito-ryu and Aikido prefer to use hand pressure on the elbow throughout the technique rather than using the forearm as a &quot;hand blade ()&quot;, cutting into the elbow joint, in the Hapkido manner.

=== Throwing techniques ===
In addition to throws which are achieved by unbalancing one&#x27;s opponent through the twisting of their joints, hapkido also contains techniques of pure throwing which do not require the assistance of jointlocks. Some of these techniques are found within Daito-ryu but a great many of them are held in common with judo (pronounced &quot;yudo 유도&quot; in Korean). Many of early practitioners of hapkido had extensive judo backgrounds including Choi Yong-sool&#x27;s first student Seo Bok-seob.

Judo techniques were introduced in the early years of the 20th century in Korea during the Japanese colonial period. Judo/Yudo tactics employ extensive use of throws, various chokes, hold downs, joint locks, and other grappling techniques used to control the opponent on the ground. It is believed that these techniques were absorbed into the hapkido curriculum from judo as there were a great many judo practitioners in Korea at that time and its tactics were commonly employed in the fighting of the period. Indeed, there also exists a portion of the hapkido curriculum which consists of techniques specifically designed to thwart judo style attacks.

The judo/yudo techniques were however adopted with adjustments made to make them blend more completely with the self-defence orientation which hapkido stresses. For example, many of the judo style throwing techniques employed in hapkido do not rely upon the use of traditional judo grips on the uniform, which can play a large role in the Japanese sport. Instead in many cases they rely upon gripping the limbs, head or neck in order to be successful.

Even today Korea remains one of the strongest countries in the world for the sport of judo and this cross influence on the art of Korean hapkido to be felt in Hapkido influenced styles such as GongKwon Yusul (공권유술).

=== Weapons ===
As a hapkido student advances through the various belt levels (essentially the same as other Korean arts, e.g. taekwondo), he or she learns how to employ and defend against various weapons. The first weapon encountered is most often a knife (). Another initial weapon used to teach both control and the basic precepts of utilizing a weapon with Hapkido techniques is the Jung Bong (police baton sized stick), techniques and defenses against the 35 cm short stick (), a walking stick or cane (ji-pang-ee; 지팡이), and a rope are introduced in hapkido training. Many hapkido organisations may also include other weapons training such as a sword (gum; 검), long staff (), middle length staff, nunchaku (), war-fan or other types of bladed weapons such as twin short swords. Some schools even teach students to defend against firearms. Hapkido weapons techniques are often incorporated into many military and law enforcement training curricula.

== Training ==
Hapkido training takes place in a dojang. While training methods vary, a typical training session will contain technique practice (striking techniques as well as defensive throws and grappling), break falling (), sparring, meditation and exercises to develop internal energy (&quot;ki&quot;, ).

Hapkido is predominantly a &quot;soft&quot; art, but this does not mean that it is easier on the opponent, or that training is easier (see Hard and soft (martial arts)). Hapkido training is vigorous and demanding. The practitioner could benefit in training by being lean and muscular. However, strength is not a prerequisite of hapkido; what strength and fitness is necessary to perform the techniques develops naturally as a result of training.

The following is an example of the Korea Hapkido Association technical requirements from 1st degree to 5th degree Black Belt as recorded by Hae-young Kim in 1991, created in association with Ji Han-jae. These techniques are now considered pre-dan level.

<doc id="65213" wikidata="Q168787" url="?curid=65213" title="Cabinda Province">
<text>Cabinda (formerly called Portuguese Congo, ) is an exclave and province of Angola, a status that has been disputed by several political organizations in the territory. The capital city is also called Cabinda, known locally as &quot;Tchiowa&quot;, &quot;Tsiowa&quot; or &quot;Kiowa&quot;. The province is divided into four municipalities—Belize, Buco-Zau, Cabinda and Cacongo.

Modern Cabinda is the result of a fusion of three kingdoms: N&#x27;Goyo, Loango and Kakongo. It has an area of and a population of 716,076 at the 2014 census; the latest official estimate (as at mid-2019) is 824,143. According to 1988 United States government statistics, the total population of the province was 147,200, with a near even split between rural and urban populations. At one point an estimated one third of Cabindans were refugees living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; however, after the 2007 peace agreement, refugees started returning to their homes.

Cabinda is separated from the rest of Angola by a narrow strip of territory belonging to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly known, up until 1960, as the Belgian Congo), which bounds the province on the south and the east. Cabinda is bounded on the north by the Republic of the Congo (formerly known as French Congo), and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent to the coast are some of the largest offshore oil fields in the world. Petroleum exploration began in 1954 with the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, when the territory was under Portuguese rule.

Cabinda also produces hardwoods, coffee, cacao, rubber, and palm oil products; however, petroleum production accounts for most of Cabinda&#x27;s domestic product. Cabinda produces of crude oil per day. Cabinda Oil is associated with Sonangol, Agip Angola Lda (41%), Chevron (39.2%), TotalEnergies (10%) and Eni (9.8%).

In 1885, the Treaty of Simulambuco established Cabinda as a protectorate of the Portuguese Empire, and Cabindan independence movements consider the occupation of the territory by Angola illegal. While the Angolan Civil War largely ended in 2002, an armed struggle persists in the exclave of Cabinda. Some of the factions have proclaimed an independent Republic of Cabinda, with offices in Paris.

== History ==

=== Portuguese Congo ===
Portuguese explorers, missionaries, and traders arrived at the mouth of the Congo River in the mid-15th century, making contact with the Manikongo, the powerful King of the Bakongo tribe. The Manikongo controlled much of the region through affiliation with smaller kingdoms, such as the Kingdoms of Ngoyo, Loango, and Kakongo in present-day Cabinda.

Over the years, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English established trading posts, logging camps, and small palm oil processing factories in Cabinda. Trade continued and the European presence grew, resulting in conflicts between the rival colonial powers. Between 1827 and 1830, the Imperial Brazilian Navy maintained a naval base in the western part of Cabinda, making it the only Brazilian colony outside of South America.

Portugal first claimed sovereignty over Cabinda in the February 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco, which gave Cabinda the status of a protectorate of the Portuguese Crown under the request of &quot;the princes and governors of Cabinda&quot;. This is often the basis upon which the legal and historical arguments in defense of the self-determination of modern-day Cabinda are constructed. Article 1, for example, states, &quot;the princes and chiefs and their successors declare, voluntarily, their recognition of Portuguese sovereignty, placing under the protectorate of this nation all the territories by them governed&quot; . Article 2, which is often used in separatist arguments, goes even further: &quot;Portugal is obliged to maintain the integrity of the territories placed under its protection&quot;. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-R) argues that the above-mentioned treaty was signed between the emissaries of the Portuguese Crown and the princes and notables of Cabinda, then called Portuguese Congo, giving rise to not one, but three protectorates: Cacongo, Loango, and Ngoio.

Through the Treaty of Simulambuco in 1885 between the kings of Portugal and the princes of Cabinda, a Portuguese protectorate was decreed, reserving rights to the local princes and independent of Angola. Cabinda once had the Congo River as the only natural boundary with Angola, but in 1885, the Berlin Conference extended the territory of the Congo Free State along the Congo River to the river&#x27;s mouth at the sea.

During this time rubber was harvested and traded in Cabinda. Atrocities such as the cutting of hands were also committed there, although comprehensive reports on these atrocities were more scant and less publicly known compared to the neighbouring Congo Free State.

=== Administrative merger with Angola ===
By the mid-1920s, the borders of Angola had been finally established in negotiations with the neighboring colonial powers. From there on Angola and Cabinda were treated distinctively under the Portuguese constitution of 1933 until 15 January 1975 under the Alvor Agreement.
The Portuguese constitution of 1933 distinguished between the colony of Angola and the protectorate of Cabinda, but in 1956, the administration of Cabinda was transferred to the governor-general of Angola. The legal distinction of Cabinda&#x27;s status from that of Angola was also expressed in the Portuguese constitution of 1971. Yet, when Angola was declared an &quot;overseas province&quot; (Província Ultramarina) within the empire of Portugal in 1951, Cabinda was treated as an ordinary district of Angola. In 1972, the name of Angola was changed to &quot;State of Angola&quot;.

Under Portuguese rule, Cabinda was an important agricultural and forestry center, and in 1967, it discovered huge offshore oil fields. Oil, timber, and cocoa had been its main exports until then. The town of Cabinda, the capital of the territory, was a Portuguese administrative and services center with a port and airfield. The beaches of Cabinda were popular with Portuguese Angolans.

=== After independence of Angola from Portugal ===
A 1974 military coup in Lisbon abolished the authoritarian regime established by António de Oliveira Salazar that had prevailed in Portugal for decades. The new government decided immediately to grant all Portuguese colonies the independence for which nationalist guerilla movements had been striving. In Angola, the decolonization process took the form of a violent conflict between the different guerilla movements and their allies. In 1975, the Treaty of Alvor between Portugal and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) reconfirmed Cabinda&#x27;s status as part of Angola. The treaty was rejected by the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda and other local political organizations which advocated for separate independence. Since then, Cabinda has been, on the one hand, a normal Angolan province, but on the other hand, there has been persistent political protest against this status; the &quot;Kabinda Free State&quot; says the exclave was a Portuguese protectorate until Angola invaded in 1974. They also say they control 85% of Kabinda territory and invite proposals for joint ventures. A number of guerrilla actions have also occurred in Cabinda.

=== Secessionism ===
==== Ethnic grounds for self-determination ====
The arguments for self-determination are based on Cabindans&#x27; cultural and ethnic background. Prior to the Treaty of Simulambuco, three kingdoms existed in what is now referred to as Cabinda: Cacongo, Ngoyo, and Loango. The Cabindans belong to the Bakongo ethnic group whose language is Kikongo. The Bakongo also comprise the majority of the population in Uíge and Zaire provinces of Angola. However, despite this shared ancestry, the Cabindans developed a very different culture and distinct variants of the Kikongo language.

==== Secessionist history ====
In the early 1960s, several movements advocating a separate status for Cabinda came into being. The Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (MLEC) was formed in 1960 under the leadership of Luis Ranque Franque. Resulting from the merger of various émigré associations in Brazzaville, the MLEC rapidly became the most prominent of the separatist movements. A further group was the Alliama (Alliance of the Mayombe), representing the Mayombe, a small minority of the population. In an important development, these movements united in August 1963 to form a united front. They called themselves the FLEC, and the leadership role was taken by the MLEC&#x27;s Ranque Franque.

In marked contrast with the FNLA, the FLEC&#x27;s efforts to mobilize international support for its government in exile met with little success. In fact, the majority of Organization of African Unity (OAU) members, concerned that this could encourage separatism elsewhere on the continent, committed to the sanctity of state borders and firmly rejected recognition of the FLEC&#x27;s government in exile.

In January 1975, Angola&#x27;s MPLA, FNLA and UNITA liberation movements signed the Alvor Agreement with Portugal, to establish the modalities of the transition to independence. FLEC was not invited.

On 1 August 1975, at an OAU summit in Kampala which was discussing Angola in the midst of its turbulent decolonization process, Ranque Franque proclaimed the independence of the &quot;Republic of Cabinda&quot;. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko called for a referendum on the future of Cabinda.

FLEC formed a provisional government, led by Henriques Tiago. Luiz Branque Franque was elected president. Following the declaration of Angolan independence in November 1975, Cabinda was invaded by forces of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), with the support of Cuban troops. The MPLA overthrew the provisional FLEC government and incorporated Cabinda into Angola.

For much of the 1970s and 1980s, FLEC operated a low intensity guerrilla war, attacking Angolan government troops and economic targets, or creating havoc by kidnapping foreign employees working in the province&#x27;s oil and construction businesses.

The National Union for the Liberation of Cabinda (; UNLC), a militant separatist group, emerged in the 1990s under the leadership of Lumingu Luis Gimby.

In April 1997, Cabinda joined the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, a democratic and international organization whose members are indigenous peoples, occupied nations, minorities and independent states or territories. In 2010, Cabinda became a charter member of the Organization of Emerging African States (OEAS).

==== Recent history ====
An ad-hoc United Nations commission for human rights in Cabinda reported in 2003 that many atrocities had been perpetrated by the MPLA. In 2004, according to Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Human Rights Watch mission for Africa, the Angolan army continued to commit crimes against civilians in Cabinda.

Although the Angolan government says FLEC is no longer operative, this is disputed by the Republic of Cabinda and its Premier, Joel Batila.

Earlier increases in the price of oil have made Cabinda&#x27;s untapped onshore oil reserves a valuable commodity.

===== Peace deal =====
In July 2006, after ceasefire negotiations in the Republic of Congo, António Bento Bembe – as a president of Cabindan Forum for Dialogue and Peace, and vice-president and executive secretary of FLEC – announced that the Cabindan separatist forces were ready to declare a ceasefire. Bembe is the leader of the &quot;Cabindan Forum for Dialogue&quot;, an organization which represents most Cabindan groups. The peace was recognized by the United States, France, Portugal, Russia, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the African Union.

:&quot;We&#x27;re going to sign a cease-fire with the Angolans who in return have accepted the principle of granting special status to Cabinda&quot;, he announced, implying that while his group is resigned to be a part of Angola, they have gotten a promise of some form of autonomy.

From Paris, FLEC-FAC contended Bembe has no authority or mandate to negotiate with the Angolans, and that the only acceptable solution is total independence.

===== Togo football team bus attack =====
On 8 January 2010, the bus carrying the Togo national football team traveling through Cabinda en route to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournament was attacked by gunmen, even though it had an escort of Angolan forces. The ensuing gunfight resulted in the deaths of the assistant coach, team spokesman and bus driver, and caused injuries to several others as well.

An offshoot of the FLEC claimed responsibility. Rodrigues Mingas, secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (Flec-PM), said his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. &quot;This attack was not aimed at the Togolese players but at the Angolan forces at the head of the convoy&quot;, Mingas told France 24 television. &quot;So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don&#x27;t have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for the total liberation of Cabinda.&quot;

== Economy ==
 Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber, and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil. Conservative estimates say that Cabinda accounts for close to 60% of Angola&#x27;s oil production, estimated at approximately , and it is estimated that oil exports from the province are worth the equivalent of US$100,000 per annum for every Cabindan. Yet Cabinda remains one of the poorest provinces in Angola. An agreement in 1996 between the national and provincial governments stipulated that 10% of Cabinda&#x27;s taxes on oil revenues would be given back to the province, but Cabindans often feel that these revenues do not benefit the population as a whole, largely because of corruption. The private sector, particularly the oil industry, has both affected and been affected by the secessionist conflict. During the early days of Cabinda&#x27;s struggle, the oil companies were perceived as sympathetic to, if not supportive of, Cabinda&#x27;s self-determination cause. The strategy used by the separatists to gain international attention, was most evident in 1999 and 2000. During 1999, FLEC-R kidnapped four foreign workers (two Portuguese and two French citizens), but released them after several months, having failed to attract the attention of the international community. FLEC-FAC also increased its activities during 2000 with the more widely publicized kidnapping of three Portuguese workers employed by a construction company, while FLEC-R kidnapped another five Portuguese civilians. These hostages were not freed until June 2001, following diplomatic intervention by the governments of Gabon and the Republic of the Congo.

Two giant oil fields, the &quot;Malonga North&quot; and &quot;Malonga West&quot; were discovered in 1967 and 1970, respectively, both pre-salt or pre-Aptian producers.

Located in water depths of 50 to 75 m, oil was discovered in Barremian deposits in 1971, then the Cenomanian section in 1979.

Four offshore oil fields, the &quot;Wamba&quot;, &quot;Takula&quot;, &quot;Numbi&quot; and &quot;Vuko&quot;, are located in the greater Takula area, producing from the Upper Cretaceous, Cenomanian Vermelha sandstone deposited in the coastal environment.

<doc id="65218" wikidata="Q152854" url="?curid=65218" title="Pillars of Hercules">
<text>The Pillars of Hercules are the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the Rock of Gibraltar. A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history, with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco. The term was applied in antiquity: Pliny the Elder included the Pillars of Hercules in his &quot;Naturalis historia&quot; (Book III:3).

==History==
According to Greek mythology adopted by the Etruscans and Romans, when Hercules had to perform twelve labours, one of them (the tenth) was to fetch the Cattle of Geryon of the far West and bring them to Eurystheus; this marked the westward extent of his travels. A lost passage of Pindar quoted by Strabo was the earliest traceable reference in this context: &quot;the pillars which Pindar calls the &#x27;gates of Gades&#x27; when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles&quot;. Since there has been a one-to-one association between Heracles and Melqart since Herodotus, the &quot;Pillars of Melqart&quot; in the temple near Gades/Gádeira (modern Cádiz) have sometimes been considered to be the true &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot;.

Plato placed the legendary island of Atlantis beyond the &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot;. Renaissance tradition says the pillars bore the warning &quot;Ne plus ultra&quot; (also , &quot;nothing further beyond&quot;), serving as a warning to sailors and navigators to go no further.

According to some Roman sources, while on his way to the garden of the Hesperides on the island of Erytheia, Hercules had to cross the mountain that was once Atlas. Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the Strait of Gibraltar. One part of the split mountain is Gibraltar and the other is either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name.

Diodorus Siculus, however, held that, instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules &quot;narrowed&quot; an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea.

In some versions, Heracles instead built the two to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas from his damnation.

===Phoenician connection===
Beyond Gades, several important Mauretanian colonies (in modern-day Morocco) were founded by the Phoenicians as the Phoenician merchant fleet pushed through the Pillars of Hercules and began constructing a series of bases along the Atlantic coast starting with Lixus in the north, then Chellah and finally Mogador.

Near the eastern shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern Cádiz, just beyond the strait) Strabo describes the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic Melqart, by . Strabo notes that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making. The columns of the Melqart temple at Tyre were also of religious significance.

===The Pillars in Syriac geography===
Syriac scholars were aware of the Pillars through their efforts to translate Greek scientific works into their language as well as into Arabic. The Syriac compendium of knowledge known as &quot;Ktaba d&#x27;ellat koll &#x27;ellan&quot; (&quot;Cause of All Causes&quot;) is unusual in asserting that there were three, not two, columns.

==In art==
===Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;===
In &quot;Inferno&quot; XXVI Dante Alighieri mentions Ulysses in the pit of the Fraudulent Counsellors and his voyage past the Pillars of Hercules. Ulysses justifies endangering his sailors by the fact that his goal is to gain knowledge of the unknown. After five months of navigation in the ocean, Ulysses sights the mountain of Purgatory but encounters a whirlwind from it that sinks his ship and all on it for their daring to approach Purgatory while alive, by their strength and wits alone.

===Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Novum Organum&quot;===

The Pillars appear prominently on the engraved title page of Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Instauratio Magna&quot; (&quot;Great Renewal&quot;), 1620, an unfinished work of which the second part was his influential &quot;Novum Organum&quot;. The motto along the base says &quot;Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia&quot; (&quot;Many will pass through and knowledge will be the greater&quot;). The image was based on the use of the pillars in Spanish and Habsburg propaganda.

===Statue of the pillars of Hercules in Ceuta===
The Spanish enclave in the extreme north of the African continent, the town of Ceuta is home to a modern-day statue called “The Pillars of Hercules” (Spanish: Columnas de Hércules).
The statue consists of two huge bronze pillars, which are held apart by Hercules. The statue was made by Ceuta artist Ginés Serrán-Pagán.

===In architecture===
On the Spanish coast at Los Barrios are Torres de Hercules which are twin towers that were inspired by the &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot;. These towers were the tallest in Andalusia until Cajasol Tower was completed in Seville in 2015.

In the southern wall of the National Autonomous University of Mexico&#x27;s Central Library, the mural &quot;Historical Representation of Culture&quot;, created by the artist Juan O&#x27;Gorman, portrays a depiction of the Pillars of Hercules as an allusion to the colonial past of Mexico and the house of Charles V.

==Coat of arms==

The Pillars appear as supporters of the coat of arms of Spain, originating in the impresa of Spain&#x27;s sixteenth century king Charles I, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. It was an idea of the Italian humanist Luigi Marliano. It bears the motto &quot;Plus Ultra&quot;, Latin for &quot;further beyond&quot;, implying that the pillars were a gateway. This was modified from the phrase &quot;Nec plus ultra&quot;, &quot;Nothing more beyond&quot; after the discovery of the Americas, which laid to rest the idea of the Pillars of Hercules as the westernmost extremity of the inhabitable world which had prevailed since Antiquity.

<text>Year 345 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Dorsuo and Camerinus (or, less frequently, year 409 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 345 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Nagorno-Karabakh (, ; ) is a region in Azerbaijan, covering the southeastern stretch of the Lesser Caucasus mountain range. Part of the greater region of Karabakh, it spans the area between Lower Karabakh and Syunik. Its terrain mostly consists of mountains and forestland.

Most of Nagorno-Karabakh was governed by ethnic Armenians under the breakaway Republic of Artsakh — also known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) — from the end of the first Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1994 to the announcement of the dissolution of the republic in September 2023. Representatives from the two sides held numerous inconclusive peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group regarding the region&#x27;s disputed status, with its majority-Armenian population over time variously advocating either for Artsakh&#x27;s independence from both states or for its integration into Armenia.

The region is usually equated with the administrative borders of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, comprising ; however, the region&#x27;s historical extent encompasses approximately .

On 27 September 2020, the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War broke out with an Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. Azerbaijan made significant gains during the war, regaining all of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and capturing one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh, including Shusha and Hadrut. The war ended on 10 November 2020 when a trilateral ceasefire agreement was signed between Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia, under which all the remaining occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh were formally returned to Azerbaijani control. The Republic of Artsakh became an isolated rump state connected with Armenia only by a narrow Russian-controlled corridor.

On 19 September 2023, after a blockade lasting several months, Azerbaijan launched a fresh large-scale military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Artsakh forces collapsed rapidly, resulting in an Azerbaijani victory, the dissolution of the Republic of Artsakh, the exodus of almost the entire Armenian population from the region and the entry of Azerbaijani security forces into the former Artsakh capital of Stepanakert, known as Khankendi by Azerbaijan. On 1 January 2024, the Republic of Artsakh was formally dissolved, marking the end of a millennia-old Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh.

== Etymology ==

The prefix &quot;Nagorno-&quot; derives from the Russian attributive adjective (), which means &quot;highland&quot;. The Azerbaijani names of the region include the similar adjectives (mountainous) or (upper). Such words are not used in the Armenian name, but appeared in the region&#x27;s official name during the Soviet era as Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Other languages apply their own wording for &quot;mountainous&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;, or &quot;highland&quot;; for example, the official name used for the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in French is , meaning &quot;Upper Karabakh&quot;.

The names for the region in the various local languages all translate to &quot;mountainous Karabakh&quot;, or &quot;mountainous black garden&quot;:

Armenians living in the area often call Nagorno-Karabakh &quot;Artsakh&quot; (), the name of the 10th province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. Urartian inscriptions (9th–7th centuries BC) use the name for the region. Ancient Greek sources called the area .

== History ==
===Antiquity and Early Middle Ages===

Nagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the Kura-Araxes culture who lived between the two rivers Kura and Araxes.

The ancient population of the region consisted of various autochthonous local and migrant tribes who were mostly non-Indo-Europeans. According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians who came to the region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd (or possibly earlier, the 4th) century BC. Other scholars suggest that the Armenians settled in the region as early as the 7th century BC.

Around 180 BC, Artsakh became one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom and remained so until the 4th century. While formally having the status of a province (&quot;nahang&quot;), Artsakh possibly formed a principality on its own — like Armenia&#x27;s province of Syunik. Other theories suggest that Artsakh was a royal land, belonging directly to the king of Armenia. King Tigran the Great of Armenia (who ruled from 95 to 55 BC) founded in Artsakh one of four cities named &quot;Tigranakert&quot; after himself. The ruins of the ancient Tigranakert, located north-east of Stepanakert, are being studied by a group of international scholars.

In 387 AD, after the partition of Armenia between the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia, two Armenian provinces — Artsakh and Utik — became part of the Sassanid satrapy of Caucasian Albania, which in turn came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence. At the time the population of Artsakh and Utik consisted of Armenians and several Armenized tribes.

Armenian culture and civilization flourished in the early medieval Nagorno-Karabakh. In the 5th century, the first-ever Armenian school was opened on the territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh at Amaras Monastery through the efforts of St. Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. St. Mesrop was very active in preaching the Gospel in Artsakh and Utik. Overall, Mesrop Mashtots made three trips to Artsakh and Utik, ultimately reaching pagan territories at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus. The 7th-century Armenian linguist and grammarian Stephanos Syunetsi stated in his work that Armenians of Artsakh had their own dialect, and encouraged his readers to learn it.

=== High Middle Ages ===

Around the mid 7th century, the region was conquered by the invading Muslim Arabs through the Muslim conquest of Persia. Subsequently, it was ruled by local governors endorsed by the Caliphate. According to some sources, in 821 the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian revolted in Artsakh and established the House of Khachen, which ruled Artsakh as a principality until the early 19th century. According to other sources, Sahl Smbatian &quot;was of the Zamirhakan family of kings,&quot; and in the year 837–838 he acquired sovereignty over Armenia, Georgia, and Albania. The name &quot;Khachen&quot; originated from Armenian word &quot;khach,&quot; which means &quot;cross&quot;. By 1000 the House of Khachen proclaimed the Kingdom of Artsakh with John Senecherib as its first ruler. Initially Dizak in southern Artsakh also formed a kingdom ruled by the ancient House of Aranshahik, descended from the earliest Kings of Caucasian Albania. In 1261, after the daughter of the last king of Dizak married the king of Artsakh, Armenian prince Hasan Jalal Dola, the two states merged into one Armenian Principality of Khachen. Subsequently, Artsakh continued to exist as a de facto independent principality.

=== Late Middle Ages ===


In the 15th century, the territory of Karabakh was part of the states ruled subsequently by the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkic tribal confederations. According to Abu Bakr Tihrani, during the period of Jahan Shah (1438–1468), the ruler of Kara Koyunlu, Piri bey Karamanli held the governorship of Karabakh. However, according to Robert H. Hewsen, the Turkoman lord Jahan Shah (1437–67) assigned the governorship of upper Karabakh to local Armenian princes, allowing a native Armenian leadership to emerge consisting of five noble families led by princes who held the titles of &quot;meliks&quot;. These dynasties represented the branches of the earlier House of Khachen and were the descendants of the medieval kings of Artsakh. Their lands were often referred to as the Country of Khamsa (&quot;five&quot; in Arabic). In a Charter (2 June 1799) of the Emperor Paul I titled &quot;About their admission to Russian suzerainty, land allocation, rights and privileges&quot;, it was noted that the Christian heritage of the Karabakh region and all their people were admitted to the Russian suzerainty. However, according to Robert Hewsen, the Russian Empire recognized the sovereign status of the five princes in their domains by the charter of Emperor Paul I dated 2 June 1799.

The Armenian meliks were granted supreme command over neighbouring Armenian principalities and Muslim khans in the Caucasus by the Iranian king Nader Shah, in return for the meliks&#x27; victories over the invading Ottoman Turks in the 1720s. These five principalities in Karabakh were ruled by Armenian families who had received the title Melik (prince) and were the following:
* Principality of &quot;Gulistan&quot; – under the leadership of the Melik-Beglarian family
* Principality of &quot;Jraberd&quot; – under the leadership of the Melik-Israelian family
* Principality of &quot;Khachen&quot; – under the leadership of the Hasan-Jalalian family
* Principality of &quot;Varanda&quot; – under the leadership of the Melik-Shahnazarian family
* Principality of &quot;Dizak&quot; – under the leadership of the Melik-Avanian family

From 1501 to 1736, during the existence of the Safavid Empire, the province of Karabakh was governed by the Ziyadoghlu Qajar dynasty, until Nader Shah took over Karabakh from their rule. The Armenian meliks maintained full control over the region until the mid-18th century. In the early 18th century, Iran&#x27;s Nader Shah took Karabakh out of control of the Ganja khans in punishment for their support of the Safavids, and placed it under his own control In the mid-18th century, as internal conflicts between the meliks led to their weakening, the Karabakh Khanate was formed. The Karabakh khanate, one of the largest khanates under Iranian suzerainty, was headed by Panah-Ali khan Javanshir. For the reinforcement of the power of Karabakh khanate, Khan of Karabakh, Panah-Ali khan Javanshir, built up “the fortress of Panahabad (today Shusha)” in 1751. During that time, Otuziki, Javanshir, Kebirli, and other Turkic tribes constituted the majority of the overall population.

=== Modern era ===
Karabakh (including modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh), became a protectorate of the Russian Empire by the Kurekchay Treaty, signed between Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh and general Pavel Tsitsianov on behalf of Tsar Alexander I in 1805, according to which the Russian monarch recognized Ibrahim Khalil Khan and his descendants as the sole hereditary rulers of the region. However, its new status was only confirmed following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), when through the loss in the war, Persia formally ceded Karabakh to the Russian Empire per the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), before the rest of Transcaucasia was incorporated into the Empire in 1828 by the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which came as an outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828).

In 1822, 9 years after it passed from Iranian to Russian control, the Karabakh Khanate was dissolved and the area became part of the Elizavetpol Governorate within the Russian Empire. In 1823 the five districts corresponding roughly to modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh were 90.8% Armenian-populated.

=== Soviet era ===

After the October Revolution, Karabakh became part of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian states. Over the next two years (1918–1920), there were a series of short wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions, including Nagorno-Karabakh. Between 1918 and 1920, Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s de jure affiliation with Armenia or Azerbaijan was disputed and not adjudicated by the League of Nations.

In July 1918, the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a National Council and government. Later, Ottoman troops entered Karabakh, meeting armed resistance by Armenians.

After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, British troops occupied Karabakh. The British command provisionally affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov (appointed by the Azerbaijani government) as the governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the Paris Peace Conference. The decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians. In February 1920, the Karabakh National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction, while Armenians elsewhere in Karabakh continued guerrilla fighting, never accepting the agreement. The agreement itself was soon annulled by the Ninth Karabagh Assembly, which declared union with Armenia in April.

In April 1920, while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan was taken over by Bolsheviks. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached. In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks. After the Sovietization of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Kavbiuro (Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)) decided that Karabakh would remain within Azerbaijan SSR with broad regional autonomy, with the administrative centre in the city of Shusha (the administrative center was later moved to Stepanakert). The oblast&#x27;s borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages. The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority.

With the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region, the conflict over the region died down for several decades until the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the question of Nagorno-Karabakh re-emerged. Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced Azerification of the region, the majority Armenian population, with ideological and material support from the Armenian SSR, started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the Armenian SSR. In August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union with Armenia with tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow.

=== War and secession ===
On 13 February 1988, Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in Stepanakert, in favour of unification with the Armenian republic. Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan. On 20 February, the Soviet of People&#x27;s Deputies in Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia. This unprecedented action by a regional Soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan, but Moscow rejected the Armenians&#x27; demands. On 20 February 1988, 2 Azeri girls were raped in Stepanakert. This caused widespread outrage in the Azeri town of Aghdam. The first direct confrontation of the conflict occurred as a large group of Azeris marched from Agdam to the Armenian populated town of Askeran. The confrontation between the Azeris and the police near Askeran degenerated into the Askeran clash, which left two Azeris dead, one of them allegedly killed by an Azeri police officer. Fifty Armenian villagers and an unknown number of Azeris and police officers were injured. Large numbers of refugees left Armenia and Azerbaijan as violence began against the minority populations of the respective republics. On 7 July 1988, the European Parliament passed a resolution that condemned the violence employed against Armenian demonstrators in Azerbaijan, and supported the demand of the Armenians for reunification with the Soviet Republic of Armenia.

On 29 November 1989, direct rule in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended and the region was returned to Azerbaijani administration. The Soviet policy backfired, however, when a joint session of the Armenian Supreme Soviet and the National Council, the legislative body of Nagorno-Karabakh, proclaimed the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. On 26 November 1991 Azerbaijan abolished the status of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, rearranging the administrative division and bringing the territory under direct control of Azerbaijan.

On 10 December 1991, in a referendum boycotted by local Azerbaijanis, Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh approved the creation of an independent state. A Soviet proposal for enhanced autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan satisfied neither side and a full-scale war subsequently erupted between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, with the latter receiving support from Armenia. According to Armenia&#x27;s former president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and &quot;they thought they could get more.&quot;

The struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh escalated after both Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In the post-Soviet power vacuum, military action between Azerbaijan and Armenia was heavily influenced by the Russian military. Furthermore, both the Armenian and Azerbaijani military employed a large number of mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia. Between fifteen and twenty-five hundred Afghan mujahideen, along with fighters from Chechnya, participated in the fighting on Azerbaijan&#x27;s side. Russia provided Armenia with heavy artillery and tanks. Many survivors from the Azerbaijani side found shelter in 12 emergency camps set up in other parts of Azerbaijan to cope with the growing number of internally displaced people due to the first Nagorno-Karabakh war.

By the end of 1993, the conflict had caused about 30,000 casualties and created hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides. By May 1994, the Armenians were in control of 14% of the territory of Azerbaijan. At that stage, for the first time during the conflict, the Azerbaijani government recognized Nagorno-Karabakh as a third party in the war and started direct negotiations with the Karabakh authorities. As a result, a ceasefire was reached on 12 May 1994 through Russian mediation.

=== Post-1994 ceasefire ===

Despite the ceasefire, fatalities due to armed conflicts between Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers continued. On 25 January 2005, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted PACE Resolution 1416, which condemned ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis. On 15–17 May 2007 the 34th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Conference adopted resolution No. 7/34-P, considering the occupation of Azerbaijani territory as the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan and recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity, and condemning the destruction of archaeological, cultural and religious monuments in the occupied territories. The 11th session of the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference held on 13–14 March 2008 in Dakar adopted resolution No. 10/11-P (IS). In the resolution, OIC member states condemned the occupation of Azerbaijani lands by Armenian forces and Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan, ethnic cleansing against the Azeri population, and charged Armenia with the &quot;destruction of cultural monuments in the occupied Azerbaijani territories&quot;. On 14 March of the same year the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution No. 62/243 which &quot;demands the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot;. On 18–20 May 2010, the 37th session of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Conference in Dushanbe adopted another resolution condemning the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan, recognizing the actions against Azerbaijani civilians as a crime against humanity and condemning the destruction of archaeological, cultural, and religious monuments in occupied territories. On 20 May of the same year, the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted the resolution on &quot;The need for an EU Strategy for the South Caucasus&quot; on the basis of the report by Evgeni Kirilov, the Bulgarian member of the Parliament. The resolution states in particular that &quot;the occupied Azerbaijani regions around Nagorno-Karabakh must be cleared as soon as possible&quot;. On 26 January 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted Resolution 2085, which deplored the fact that the occupation by Armenia of Nagorno-Karabakh and other adjacent areas of Azerbaijan creates humanitarian and environmental problems for the citizens of Azerbaijan, condemned ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis and Assembly requested immediate withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from the region concerned.

Several world leaders have met with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the years, but efforts to maintain the ceasefire have failed.

On 2 April 2016 Azerbaijani and Armenian forces again clashed in the region. The Armenian Defense Ministry alleged that Azerbaijan launched an offensive to seize territory in the region. At least 30 soldiers were killed during the fighting and a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and tank were also destroyed, with 12 of the fallen soldiers belonging to the Azerbaijani forces and the other 18 belonging to the Armenian forces, as well as an additional 35 Armenian soldiers reportedly wounded.

=== 2020 war and ceasefire agreement ===
On 27 September 2020, a new war erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The United Nations strongly condemned the conflict and called on both sides to deescalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay.

The war ended on 10 November 2020, when a trilateral ceasefire agreement was signed among Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia. According to the ceasefire agreement, Azerbaijan regained all of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and capturing one-third of Nagorno-Karabakh proper, including Shusha and Hadrut.

=== Blockade (2022–2023) ===
In December 2022, Azerbaijanis claiming to be environmental activists blocked the Lachin corridor, the sole road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and the outside world. On 23 April 2023, Azerbaijani forces installed a checkpoint on the Lachin corridor. The blockade led to a humanitarian crisis for the population in Artsakh and imports of essential goods were blocked, as well as humanitarian convoys of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers, trapping the 120,000 residents of the region. Limited traffic had been conducted by Russian peacekeepers and the International Committee of the Red Cross to transport patients in need of medical care and provide humanitarian supplies. However, starting on 15 June 2023, Azerbaijan intensified the blockade, blocking all passage of food, fuel, and medicine from the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers through the Lachin corridor. On 19 September, Azerbaijan launched a military operation.

=== Azerbaijani offensive (2023) ===

On 19 September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh. One day after the offensive started, on 20 September, an agreement on establishing a complete cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh was reached at the mediation of the Russian peacekeeping command in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan held a meeting with representatives of the Artsakh Armenian community on 21 September in Yevlakh to start the process of re-integrating the region into Azerbaijan. Ceasefire violations by Azerbaijan were nonetheless reported by both Artsakh and local residents in Stepanakert on 21 September. In the aftermath of the offensive, an exodus of Armenians from the region started. On 28 September 2023, the Republic of Artsakh agreed to dissolve itself by 1 January 2024.

== Geography ==


Nagorno-Karabakh has a total area of . Approximately half of Nagorno-Karabakh terrain is over above sea level. The borders of Nagorno-Karabakh resemble a kidney bean with the indentation on the east side. It has tall mountain ridges along the northern edge and along the west and mountainous south. The part near the indentation of the kidney bean itself is a relatively flat valley, with the two edges of the bean, the districts of Martakert and Martuni, having flatlands as well. Other flatter valleys exist around the Sarsang reservoir, Hadrut, and the south. The entire region lies, on average, above sea level. Notable peaks include the border mountain Murovdag and the Great Kirs mountain chain in the junction of Shusha and Hadrut districts. The territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh forms a portion of the historic region of Karabakh, which lies between the rivers Kura and Araxes, and the modern Armenia-Azerbaijan border. Nagorno-Karabakh in its modern borders is part of the larger region of Upper Karabakh.

Nagorno-Karabakh does not directly border Armenia but is connected to the latter through the Lachin corridor, a mountain pass under the control of the Russian peacekeeping forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.

The major cities of the region are Stepanakert, which once served as the capital of the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Shusha, which lies partially in ruins. Vineyards, orchards, and mulberry groves for silkworms are developed in the valleys.

== Environment ==

Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s environment vary from steppe on the Kura lowland through dense forests of oak, hornbeam, and beech on the lower mountain slopes to birchwood and alpine meadows higher up. The region possesses numerous mineral springs and deposits of zinc, coal, lead, gold, marble, and limestone.

== Demographics ==
=== Antiquity – 1918 ===
Historically, the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh — then part of the province of Artsakh — were confirmed by Ancient Greek and Roman sources &quot;long before our era&quot; to be Armenian. In the early 15th century, German traveller Johann Schiltberger after visiting the region stated that &quot;although the Muslims had taken possession of Karabagh, there were still Armenian villages in the region&quot;. Historian Victor Schnirelmann writes that &quot;In the mid-18th century, … Turkic tribes … gained access to the highland territories [of Karabakh] and began to settle in Shusha … by the end of the 18th century, a substantial number of its former Armenian inhabitants had left Nagorny Karabagh. Just at the turn of the 19th century, the Turkic population significantly outnumbered the local Armenians, but this only lasted … [until the] end of the 1820s, [when] the Armenians began to come back to Karabagh, and they accounted for the majority of its population by the mid-19th century&quot;. Edmund Herzig and Marina Kurkchiyan present an alternative view that &quot;Armenians had already been a majority in some areas such as mountainous Karabagh&quot;, compared to the Yerevan province which had &quot;regained an Armenian majority for the first time in several hundred years.&quot;

According to an 1823 Russian survey published in Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi) in 1866, Armenians made up 97 percent of the population in the five districts () of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus proving, contrary to claims in Azerbaijani historiography, that Armenians formed an overwhelming majority of Nagorno-Karabakh prior to 1828. Historian George Bournoutian writes that Russian statistics from 1810 show that Armenians made up 21 percent of the Karabakh region&#x27;s population; In 1823, the Armenian population of Karabakh had increased by 30 percent &quot;after the return of those who had fled the region&quot;, and by 1832, the Armenian population had increased to one-third of Karabakh. Moreover, the &quot;one-third&quot; of the population of Karabakh composed of Armenians resided in one-third of the territory of Karabakh, the mountainous territory (i.e. Nagorno-Karabakh), where they &quot;constituted an overwhelming majority of the population.&quot;

=== 1918–1920 ===
According to Armenian sources, the &quot;historical Nagorno-Karabakh&quot; region had a population of 300,000–330,000 in 1918–1920, rising to 700,000–800,000 by 1988. As a result of &quot;Turkish-Azerbaijani aggression&quot;, the region&#x27;s population declined by 20 percent in 1918–1920. In this period, Azerbaijani forces carried out massacres against Armenians in Ghaibalishen, Jamilli, Karkijahan, and Pahlul (600–700 dead), Stepanakert (several hundred dead), and Shusha (several hundred to 12,000 dead). As a result of the Shusha massacre, 5,000–6,000 Armenians were displaced to the regions of Varanda and Dizak. By 11 April 1920, some thirty villages in Nagorno-Karabakh had been &quot;devastated&quot; by Azerbaijani forces as a result of the uprising, leaving 25,000 homeless (including nearly 6,000 refugees from Shusha).

=== 1921–1987 ===
1923 statistics indicate that the NKAO was 94.8 percent Armenian, numbering 149,600, whilst the Azerbaijani population numbered 7,700. Historian Cory Welt writes of a &quot;discrepancy&quot; of the Armenian population jumping by over 25,000 individuals between the 1921 and 1923 censuses, also pointing out that the Armenian population declined to 111,700 in 1926, thus indicating an &quot;unexplained drop&quot; of 38,000 individuals. In the 1920s, the NKAO had a population of 131,500 people, 94.4 percent (124,136) of whom were ethnic Armenians and only 5.6 percent (7,364) of whom were ethnic Azerbaijanis. In 1933, Nagorno-Karabakh had a population of 147,308, 10,751 (7.3 percent) of whom were urban dwellers, and 136,557 (92.7 percent) of whom were rural residents. On 1 January 1973, the oblast had a population of 153,000.

==== Discrimination and stagnation ====

Whilst the region was a part of the Azerbaijan SSR, the Armenian share of the population dropped from 94.7 to 76.9 percent, whilst the Azerbaijani share of the population quadrupled from 5.1 to 21.5 percent as a result of &quot;migratory influx&quot; — indicative of the socio-economic difficulties local Armenians experienced under Soviet Azerbaijani leadership which led them to emigrate from Karabakh. Emeritus professor of law M. Cherif Bassiouni writes of the stagnation of the Armenian population &quot;due to the discriminatory policies of Azerbaijani authorities that compelled Armenians to emigrate&quot;; also adding that 600,000 Armenians from Karabakh reside in Armenia and the countries of the CIS. According to historian Deon Geldenhuys, &quot;[t]his was due to Baku&#x27;s deliberate promotion of Azerbaijani settlement in Karabagh as part of a policy of &#x27;cultural de-Armenization&#x27; of the region&quot;; further adding that Azerbaijan &quot;neglected the economic needs of the territory&quot;. Stuart J. Kaufman, a professor of political science and international relations, writes of the difficulties of Karabakh Armenians:… Armenian-language education was not easily available, Armenian history was not taught at all, and those who went to Armenia for training were discriminated against in competing for jobs in the province, … Underinvestment in the region—also blamed on Baku—meant less economic development and poor infrastructure even by Soviet standards, and therefore fewer jobs overall, especially for Armenians. Cultural ties with Armenia were strangled in red tape in Baku, and a decision to make Armenian-language television available in the region was left unimplemented. One result of these policies was a continuing exodus of Armenians from Karabagh in search of greener pastures.

=== 1988–present ===
Following the Sumgait pogrom and the exodus of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, Azerbaijanis in Stepanakert and Armenians in Shusha were expelled in September 1988. As local Armenian forces gained possession of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts (amounting to 14 percent of the internationally recognised territory of Azerbaijan) during the First Nagorno-Karabakh war, hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis were expelled from their lands. During the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan regained control over the surrounding districts and southern parts of the former NKAO, thus displacing approximately 70,000 Armenians.

== Transport ==
During the rule of the Soviet Union, the Yevlakh–Aghdam–Stepanakert line connected the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with the main part of Azerbaijan. After the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the abandonment of Ağdam, the line&#x27;s service was cut back to service only between Yevlax and Kətəlparaq, without any present section at the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The former railway line between Kətəlparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.

The (Tbilisi–Gyumri–)Yerevan–Nakhchivan–Horadiz–Shirvan(–Baku) main railway was also dismantled from the NKR between Ordubad and Horadiz, as well as a by-line from Mincivan to the Armenian city of Kapan. Currently, the Azerbaijani trains only travel to Horadiz. The Ordubad–Horadiz section has been demolished, leaving the NKR with no intact, active railway line in their territory. The railway at the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic still operates, but it is separated from the main Azerbaijani lines, and only has a connection to Iran.

<text>Franco Modigliani ((; ; 18 June 1918 – 25 September 2003) was an Italian-American economist and the recipient of the 1985 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He was a professor at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, and MIT Sloan School of Management.

==Early life and education==
Modigliani was born on 18 June 1918 in Rome to the Jewish family of a pediatrician father and a voluntary social worker mother.

He entered university at the age of seventeen, enrolling in the faculty of Law at the Sapienza University of Rome. In his second year at Sapienza, his submission to a nationwide contest in economics sponsored by the official student organization of the state, won first prize and Modigliani received an award from the hand of Benito Mussolini. 
He wrote several essays for the fascist magazine &quot;Lo Stato&quot; where he showed an inclination for the fascist ideological currents critical of liberalism.

Among his early works in Fascist Italy was an article about the organization and management of production in a socialist economy, written in Italian and arguing the case for socialism along lines laid out by earlier market socialists like Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange.

But, that early enthusiasm evaporated soon after the passage of racial laws in Italy. In 1938, Modigliani left Italy for Paris together with his then-girlfriend, Serena Calabi, to join her parents there. After briefly returning to Rome to discuss his &quot;laurea&quot; thesis at the city&#x27;s university, he obtained his diploma on 22 July 1939, and returned to Paris.

The same year, they all immigrated to the United States and he enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research. His Ph.D. dissertation, an elaboration and extension of John Hicks&#x27; IS–LM model, was written under the supervision of Jacob Marschak and Abba Lerner, in 1944, and is considered &quot;ground breaking.&quot;

==Career==
From 1942 to 1944, Modigliani taught at Columbia University and Bard College as an instructor in economics and statistics. In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1948, he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty. From 1952 to 1962, he was a member of the Carnegie Mellon University faculty.

In 1962, he joined the faculty of MIT, as an Institute Professor.

==Contributions to economic theory==
Modigliani, beginning in the 1950s, was an originator of the life-cycle hypothesis, which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy. The hypothesis that consumers aim for a stable level of consumption throughout their lifetime (for example by saving during their working years and then spending during their retirement).

The rational expectations hypothesis is considered by economists to originate in the paper written by Modigliani and Emile Grunberg in 1954.

When he was a member of the Carnegie Mellon University faculty, he formulated in 1958, along with Merton Miller, the Modigliani–Miller theorem for corporate finance. The theorem posits that, under certain assumptions, the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by equity (selling shares) or by debt (borrowing money), meaning that the debt-to-equity ratio is unimportant for private firms.

In the early 1960s, his response, co-authored with Albert Ando, to the 1963 paper of Milton Friedman and David I. Meiselman, initiated the so-called &quot;monetary/fiscal policy debate&quot; among economists, which went on for more than sixty years.

In 1975, Modigliani, in a paper whose co-author was his former student Lucas Papademos, introduced the concept of the &quot;NIRU&quot;, the non-inflationary rate of unemployment, ostensibly an improvement over the &quot;natural rate of unemployment&quot; concept. The terms refer to a level of unemployment below which inflation rises.

In 1997, Modigliani and his granddaughter, Leah Modigliani, developed what is now called the &quot;Modigliani Risk-Adjusted Performance,&quot; a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of an investment portfolio that was derived from the Sharpe ratio, adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of a benchmark, e.g. the &quot;market.&quot;

==Appointments and awards==
In October 1985, Modigliani was awarded the Nobel prize in Economics &quot;for his pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets.&quot;

In 1985, Modigliani received MIT&#x27;s James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award. In 1997, he received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; degree in Management Engineering from the University of Naples Federico II in 1997.

Late in his life, Modigliani became a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security organization, formerly &quot;Economists Allied for Arms Reduction&quot; and was considered an &quot;influential adviser&quot;: in the late 1960s, on a contract with the Federal Reserve, he designed the &quot;MIT-Pennsylvania-Social Science Research Council&quot; model, a tool that &quot;guided monetary policy in Washington for many decades.&quot;

A collection of Modigliani&#x27;s papers is housed at Duke University&#x27;s Rubenstein Library.

==Criticism==
Modigliani&#x27;s work on fiscal policy came under criticism from followers of Post-Keynesian economics, who disputed the &quot;Keynesianism&quot; of his viewpoints, pointing out his contribution to the NAIRU concept, as well as his general stance on fiscal deficits. The Modigliani-Miller theorem implies that, for a closed economy, state borrowing is merely deferred taxation, since state spending can be financed only by &quot;printing money&quot;, taxation, or borrowing, and therefore monetary financing of state spending implies the subsequent imposition of a so-called &quot;inflation tax,&quot; which ostensibly has the same effect on permanent income as explicit taxation.

Nonetheless, they acknowledged his dissenting voice on the issue of unemployment, in which Modigliani concurred early on with heterodox economists that Europe-wide unemployment in the late 20th century was caused by the lack of demand induced by austerity policies.

==Personal life==
In 1939, while they were in Paris, Modigliani married Serena Calabi. They had two children, Andre and Sergio Modigliani.

Modigliani died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2003, while still working at MIT, and teaching until the last months of his life. He was 85. Serena Modigliani-Calabi, active to the end in progressive politics, most notably with the League of Women Voters, and an outspoken believer in participatory democracy, died in 2008.

<doc id="65228" wikidata="Q319622" url="?curid=65228" title="Saving">
<text>Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. In economics, a broader definition is any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs.

Methods of saving include putting money in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or kept as cash. In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher. Saving does not automatically include interest.

&quot;Saving&quot; differs from &quot;savings&quot;. The former refers to the act of not consuming one&#x27;s assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one&#x27;s assets in the form of cash. Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to &quot;saving&quot; as &quot;savings&quot;.

In different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. For example, the part of a person&#x27;s income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as &quot;saving&quot; unless the institutions and people who receive them save them.

Saving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter. By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth.

However, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. However, savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to a loan (interest-free) to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan.

In a primitive agricultural economy, savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. If the whole crop were consumed the economy would convert to hunting and gathering the next season.

== Interest rates ==
Classical economics posited that interest rates would adjust to equate saving and investment, avoiding a pile-up of inventories (general overproduction). A rise in saving would cause a fall in interest rates, stimulating investment, hence always investment would equal saving.

But John Maynard Keynes argued that neither saving nor investment was very responsive to interest rates (i.e. that both were interest-inelastic) so that large interest rate changes were needed to re-equate them after one changed. Furthermore, it was the demand for and supplies of stocks of money that determined interest rates in the short run. Thus, saving could exceed investment for significant amounts of time, causing a general glut and a recession.

== Saving in personal finance ==
Within personal finance, the act of &quot;saving&quot; corresponds to nominal &quot;preservation&quot; of money for future use. A deposit account paying interest is typically used to hold money for future needs, &quot;i.e.&quot; an emergency fund, to make a capital purchase (car, house, vacation, etc.) or to give to someone else (children, tax bill etc.).

Within personal finance, money used to purchase stocks, put in an investment fund or used to buy any asset where there is an element of capital risk is deemed an investment. This distinction is important as the investment risk can cause a capital loss when an investment is realized, unlike cash saving(s). Cash savings accounts are considered to have minimal risk. In the United States, all banks are required to have deposit insurance, typically issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC. In extreme cases, a bank failure can cause deposits to be lost as it happened at the start of the Great Depression. The FDIC has prevented that from happening ever since.

In many instances the terms saving and investment are used interchangeably. For example, many deposit accounts are labeled as &quot;investment accounts&quot; by banks for marketing purposes. As a rule of thumb, if money is &quot;invested&quot; in cash, then it is savings. If money is used to purchase some asset that is hoped to increase in value over time, but that may fluctuate in market value, then it is an investment.

== Saving in economics ==

In economics, saving is defined as after-tax income minus consumption. The fraction of income saved is called the average propensity to save, while the fraction of an increment to income that is saved is called the marginal propensity to save. The rate of saving is directly affected by the general level of interest rates. The capital markets equilibrate the sum of (personal) saving, government surpluses, and net exports to physical investment.

<doc id="65282" wikidata="Q368572" url="?curid=65282" title="Valinor">
<text>Valinor (Quenya&quot;: Land of the Valar&quot;) or the Blessed Realm is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the home of the immortal Valar on the continent of Aman, far to the west of Middle-earth; he used the name Aman mainly to mean Valinor. It includes Eldamar, the land of the Elves, who as immortals are permitted to live in Valinor.

Aman is known as &quot;the Undying Lands&quot;, but the land itself does not cause mortals to live forever. However, only immortal beings are generally allowed to reside there. Exceptions are made for the surviving bearers of the One Ring: Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, who dwell there for a time, and the dwarf Gimli.

Tolkien&#x27;s myth of the attempt of Númenor to capture Aman has been likened to the biblical Tower of Babel and the ancient Greek Atlantis, and the resulting destruction in both cases. They note, too, that a mortal&#x27;s stay in Valinor is only temporary, not conferring immortality, just as, in medieval Christian theology, the Earthly Paradise is only a preparation for the Celestial Paradise that is above.

Others have compared the account of the beautiful Elvish part of the Undying Lands to the Middle English poem &quot;Pearl&quot;, and stated that the closest literary equivalents of Tolkien&#x27;s descriptions of these lands are the &quot;imrama&quot; Celtic tales such as those about Saint Brendan from the early Middle Ages. The Christian theme of good and light (from Valinor) opposing evil and dark (from Mordor) has also been discussed.

== Geography ==

=== Physical ===

Valinor lies in Aman (&quot;Unmarred&quot;), a continent on the west of Belegaer, the ocean to the west of Middle-earth. Ekkaia, the encircling sea, surrounds both Aman and Middle-earth. Tolkien wrote that the name &quot;Aman&quot; was &quot;chiefly used as the name of the land in which the Valar dwelt&quot;. The Pelóri mountains run along the east coast; their highest peak is Taniquetil. Tolkien created no detailed maps of Aman; those drawn by Karen Wynn Fonstad, based on Tolkien&#x27;s rough sketch of Arda&#x27;s landmasses and seas, show Valinor about wide, west to east (from the Great Sea to the Outer Sea), and about long north to south. The continent of Aman extends from the Arctic latitudes of the Helcaraxë to the subpolar southern region of Arda – about .
&quot;Eldamar&quot; is &quot;Elvenhome&quot;, the &quot;coastal region of Aman, settled by the Elves&quot;, wrote Tolkien. Eldamar was the true Eldarin name of Aman. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; it is named &quot;Faerie&quot;. The land is well-wooded, as Finrod &quot;walk[ed] with his father under the trees in Eldamar&quot; and the Teleri Elves have timber to build their ships. The city of the Teleri, on the north shore of the Bay is Alqualondë, the Haven of the Swans, whose halls and mansions are made of pearl. The harbour is entered through a natural arch of rock, and the beaches are strewn with gems given by the Noldor Elves. In the bay is the island of Tol Eressëa.
&quot;Calacirya&quot; (Quenya: &quot;Light Cleft&quot;, for the light of the Two Trees that streams through the pass into the world beyond) is the pass in the Pelóri mountains where the Elven city Tirion is set. It is close to the Girdle of Arda (the Equator). After the hiding of Valinor, this is the only gap through the mountains of Aman.
In the extreme north-east, beyond the Pelóri, is the Helcaraxë, a vast ice sheet that joins the two continents of Aman and Middle-earth before the War of Wrath. 
To prevent anyone from reaching the main part of Valinor&#x27;s east coast by sea, the Valar create the Shadowy Seas, and within these seas they set a long chain of islands called the Enchanted Isles.

=== Political ===

Valinor is the home of the Valar (singular Vala), spirits that often take humanoid form, sometimes called &quot;gods&quot; by the Men of Middle-earth. Other residents of Valinor include the related but less powerful spirits, the Maiar, and most of the Elves.

Each Vala has his or her own region of the land. The Mansions of Manwë and Varda, two of the most powerful spirits, stands upon the top of Taniquetil. Yavanna, the Vala of Earth, Growth, and Harvest, resides in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the land, west of the Pelóri. Nearby are the mansions of Yavanna&#x27;s spouse, Aulë the Smith. Oromë, the Vala of the Hunt, lives in the Woods of Oromë to the north-east of the pastures. Nienna lives in the far west of the island. Just south of Nienna&#x27;s home, and to the north of the pastures, are the Halls of Mandos; he lives with his spouse Vairë the weaver. To the east of the Halls of Mandos is the Isle of Estë, in the lake of Lórellin within the Gardens of Lórien.

In east-central Valinor at the Girdle of Arda is Valmar, the capital of Valinor (also called Valimar, the City of Bells), the residence of the Valar and the Maiar in Valinor. The first house of the Elves, the Vanyar, settles there as well. The mound of Ezellohar, on which stand the Two Trees, and Máhanaxar, the Ring of Doom, are outside Valmar. Farther east is the Calacirya, the only easy pass through the Pelóri, a huge mountain range fencing Valinor on three sides, created to keep Morgoth&#x27;s forces out. The city of the Noldor (and for a time the Vanyar Elves also) is Tirion, built on the hill of Túna, inside the Calacirya mountain pass; it is just north of Taniquetil, facing both the Two Trees and the starlit seas.

In the northern inner foothills of the Pelóri, far to the north of Valmar, is Fëanor&#x27;s city of Formenos, built after his banishment from Tirion.

==History==
===Years of the Trees===

Valinor is established on the western continent Aman when Melkor (a Vala later named Morgoth, &quot;the black foe&quot;, by the Elves) destroys the Valar&#x27;s original home on the island Almaren in primeval Middle-earth, ending the Years of the Lamps. To defend their new home from attack, they raise the Pelóri Mountains. They also establish Valimar, the radiant Two Trees, and their dwelling-places. Valinor is said to surpass Almaren in beauty. Later, the Valar hear of the awakening of the Elves in Middle-earth, where Melkor is unopposed. They propose to bring the Elves to the safety of Valinor, but to do that, they need to get Melkor out of the way. A war is fought, and Melkor&#x27;s stronghold Utumno is destroyed. Then, many Elves come to Valinor, and establish their cities Tirion and Alqualondë, beginning Valinor&#x27;s age of glory. Melkor comes back to Valinor as a prisoner, and after three Ages is brought before the Valar; he sues for pardon, vowing to assist the Valar and make amends for the hurts he has done. Manwë grants him pardon, but confines him within Valmar to remain under watch. After his release, Melkor starts planting seeds of dissent in the minds of the Elves, including between Fëanor and his brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor uses some of the light of the Two Trees to forge the three Silmarils, beautiful and irreplaceable jewels.

=== The Darkening of Valinor===

Belatedly, the Valar learn what Melkor has done. Knowing that he is discovered, Melkor goes to the home of the Noldor&#x27;s High King Finwë, kills him and steals the Silmarils. He then destroys the Two Trees with the help of Ungoliant, plunging Valinor into darkness, the Long Night, relieved only by stars. Melkor and Ungoliant flee to Middle-earth.

===The Hiding of Valinor===
The Valar manage to save one last luminous flower from one of the Two Trees, Telperion, and one last luminous fruit from the other, Laurelin. These become the Moon and the Sun. The Valar carry out further titanic labours to improve the defences of Valinor. They raise the Pelóri mountains to even greater and sheerer heights. Off the coast, eastwards of Tol Eressëa, they create the Shadowy Seas and their Enchanted Isles; both the Seas and the Isles present numerous perils to anyone attempting to get to Valinor by sea.

=== Later history ===

For centuries, Valinor take no part in the struggles between the Noldor and Morgoth in Middle-earth. But near the end of the First Age, when the Noldor are in total defeat, the mariner Eärendil convinces the Valar to make a last attack on Morgoth. A mighty host of Maiar, Vanyar and the remaining Noldor in Valinor destroy Morgoth&#x27;s gigantic army and his stronghold Angband, and cast Morgoth into the void.

During the Second Age, the Valar create the island of Númenor as a reward to the Edain, Men who had fought alongside the Noldor. Centuries later the kingdom of Númenor grows so powerful and so arrogant that Ar-Pharazôn, the twenty-fifth and last king, dares to attempt an invasion of Valinor. When the creator Eru Ilúvatar responds to the call of the Valar, Númenor sinks into the sea, and Aman is removed beyond the reach of the Men of Arda. Arda itself becomes spherical, and is left for Men to govern. The Elves can go to Valinor only by the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the spheres of the earth.

== Analysis ==

=== Paradise ===

Keith Kelly and Michael Livingston, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, note that Frodo&#x27;s final destination, mentioned at the end of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, is Aman, the Undying Lands. In Tolkien&#x27;s mythology, they write, the islands of Aman are initially just the dwelling-places of the Valar (in the Ages of the Trees, while the rest of the world lies in darkness). The Valar help The One, Eru Ilúvatar, to create the world. Gradually some of the immortal and ageless Elves are allowed to live there as well, sailing across the ocean to the West. After the fall of Númenor and the reshaping of the world, Aman becomes the place &quot;&quot;between&quot; (sic) Over-heaven and Middle-earth&quot;. It is accessible only in special circumstances like Frodo&#x27;s, allowed to come to Aman through the offices of the Valar and of Gandalf, one of the Valar&#x27;s emissaries, the Istari or Wizards. However, Aman is not, they write, exactly paradise. Firstly, being there does not confer immortality, contrary to what the Númenóreans supposed. Secondly, those mortals like Frodo who are allowed to go there will eventually choose to die. They note that in another of Tolkien&#x27;s writings, &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;, understood to be a journey through Purgatory (the Catholic precursor stage to paradise), Tolkien avoids describing paradise at all. They suggest that to the Catholic Tolkien, it is impossible to describe Heaven, and it might be sacrilege to make the attempt. The Tolkien scholar Michael D. C. Drout comments that Tolkien&#x27;s accounts of Eldamar &quot;give us a good idea of his conceptions of absolute beauty&quot;. He notes that these resemble the paradise described in the Middle English poem &quot;Pearl&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey adds that in 1927 Tolkien wrote a poem, &quot;The Nameless Land&quot;, in the complex stanza-form of &quot;Pearl&quot;. It spoke of a land further away than paradise, and more beautiful than the Irish Tír na nÓg, the deathless otherworld. Kelly and Livingston similarly draw on &quot;Pearl&quot;, noting that it states that &quot;fair as was the hither shore, far lovelier was the further land&quot; where the Dreamer could not pass. So, they write, each stage looks like paradise, until the traveller realises that beyond it lies something even more paradisiacal, glimpsed and beyond description. The Earthly Paradise can be described; Aman, the Undying Lands, can thus be compared to the Garden of Eden, the paradise that the Bible says once existed upon Earth before the Fall of Man. The Celestial Paradise of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; lies &quot;beyond (or above)&quot;, as it does, they note, in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;. Matthew Dickerson notes that Valinor resembles the Garden of Eden in having two trees.

=== Good against evil ===

The scholar of English literature Marjorie Burns writes that one of the female Vala, Varda (Elbereth to the Elves) is sung to by the Elf-queen of Middle-earth Galadriel. Burns notes that Varda &quot;sits far off in Valinor on Oiolossë&quot;, looking from her mountain-peak tower in Aman towards Middle-earth and the Dark Tower of Sauron in Mordor: she notes Timothy O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s view that the white benevolent feminine symbol opposes the evil masculine symbol. Further, Burns suggests, Galadriel is an Elf from Valinor &quot;in the Blessed Realm&quot;, bringing Varda&#x27;s influence with her to Middle-earth. This is seen in the phial of light that she gives to Frodo, and that Sam uses to defeat the evil giant spider Shelob: Sam invokes Elbereth when he uses the phial. Burns comments that Sam&#x27;s request to the &quot;Lady&quot; sounds distinctly Catholic, and that the &quot;female principle, embodied in Varda of Valinor and Galadriel of Middle-earth, most clearly represents the charitable Christian heart.&quot;

=== Original sin ===

The scholar of literature Richard Z. Gallant comments that while Tolkien made use of pagan Germanic heroism in his legendarium, and admired its Northern courage, he disliked its emphasis on &quot;overmastering pride&quot;. This created a conflict in his writing. The pride of the Elves in Valinor resulted in a fall, analogous to the biblical fall of man. Tolkien described this by saying &quot;The first fruit of their fall was in Paradise [Valinor], the slaying of Elves by Elves&quot;; Gallant interprets this as an allusion to the fruit of the biblical tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the resulting exit from the Garden of Eden. The leading prideful elf is Fëanor, whose actions, Gallant writes, set off the whole dark narrative of strife among the Elves described in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;; the Elves fight and leave Valinor for Middle-earth.

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===

The passage at the start of the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; about Scyld Scefing contains a cryptic mention of &quot;þā&quot; (&quot;those&quot;) who have sent Scyld as a baby in a boat, presumably from across the sea, and to whom Scyld&#x27;s body is returned in a ship funeral, the vessel sailing by itself. Shippey suggests that Tolkien may have seen in this both an implication of a Valar-like group who behave much like gods, and a glimmer of his Old Straight Road, the way across the sea to Valinor forever closed to mortal Men by the remaking of the world after Númenor&#x27;s attack on Valinor.

=== Lost home ===

Phillip Joe Fitzsimmons compares &quot;The Silmarillion&#x27;s&quot; faraway Valinor, forbidden to Men and lost to the Elves, though it constantly calls to them to return, to Tolkien&#x27;s fellow-Inkling, Owen Barfield&#x27;s &quot;lost home&quot;. Barfield writes of the loss of &quot;an Edenic relationship with nature&quot;, part of his theory that man&#x27;s purpose is to serve as &quot;the Earth&#x27;s self-consciousness&quot;. Barfield argued that rationalism creates individualism, &quot;unhappy isolation ... [and] the loss of a mutual relationship with nature.&quot; Further, Barfield believed that ancient civilisations, as recorded in their languages, had a connection to and inner experience of nature, so that the modern situation represents a loss of that state of grace. Fitzsimmons states that the lost home motif recurs throughout Tolkien&#x27;s writings. He does not suggest that Barfield influenced Tolkien, but that the ideas of the two men grew from &quot;the same time, place, and even social circle&quot;.

=== Atlantis, Babel ===

Kelly and Livingston state that while Aman could be home to Elves as well as Valar, the same was not true of mortal Men. The &quot;prideful&quot; Men of Númenor, imagining they could acquire immortality by capturing the physical lands of Aman, were punished by the destruction of their own island, which is engulfed by the sea, and the permanent removal of Aman &quot;from the circles of the world&quot;. Kelly and Livingston note the similarity to the ancient Greek myth of Atlantis, the greatest human civilisation lost beneath the sea; and the resemblance to the biblical tale of the Tower of Babel, the hubristic and &quot;sacrilegious&quot; attempt by mortal men to climb up into God&#x27;s realm.

=== Celtic influence ===

The scholar of English literature Paul H. Kocher writes that the Undying Lands of the Uttermost West including Eldamar and Valinor, is &quot;so far outside our experience that Tolkien can only ask us to take it completely on faith.&quot; Kocher comments that these lands have an integral place both geographically and spiritually in Middle-earth, and that their closest literary equivalents are the &quot;imrama&quot; Celtic tales from the early Middle Ages. The &quot;imrama&quot; tales describe how Irish adventurers such as Saint Brendan sailed the seas looking for the &quot;Land of Promise&quot;. He notes that it is certain that Tolkien knew these stories, since in 1955 he wrote a poem, entitled &quot;Imram&quot;, about Brendan&#x27;s voyage.

<text>In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning &quot;those with knowledge&quot; in his constructed language Quenya) are a kindred of Elves who migrate west to the blessed realm of Valinor from the continent of Middle-earth, splitting from other groups of Elves as they went. They then settle in the coastal region of Eldamar. The Dark Lord Morgoth murders their first leader, Finwë. The majority of the Noldor, led by Finwë&#x27;s eldest son Fëanor, then return to Beleriand in the northwest of Middle-earth. This makes them the only group to return and then play a major role in Middle-earth&#x27;s history; much of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is about their actions. They are the second clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. 

Among Elves, the Noldor show the greatest talents for intellectual pursuits, technical skills and physical strength, yet are prone to unchecked ambition and pride in their ability to create. Scholars such as Tom Shippey  have commented that these attributes lead to their decline and fall, especially through Fëanor who creates and covets the magical jewels, the Silmarils. Others including Dimitra Fimi have linked the Noldor to the mythical Irish warriors and sorcerers, the Tuatha Dé Danann.

== Etymology and origins ==

&quot;Noldor&quot; or &quot;Ñoldor&quot; means those who have great knowledge and understanding. The Noldor are called &quot;Golodhrim&quot; or &quot;Gódhellim&quot; in Sindarin, and &quot;Goldui&quot; by another kindred of Elves, the Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is &quot;Noldo&quot; and the adjective is &quot;Noldorin&quot;, which is also the name of their dialect of Quenya.

In early drafts of his legendarium, Tolkien used the name &quot;Gnomes&quot; for the group later called the Noldor, and their language, the Noldorin dialect of Sindarin, was called &quot;Gnomish&quot; or &quot;Noldorin&quot;. Tolkien had chosen &quot;gnome&quot; thinking that it derived from the Greek , &quot;gnōsis&quot; (knowledge), and hence was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common association with garden gnomes, Tolkien abandoned the term.

==Attributes==
The Noldor are counted among the Calaquendi (&quot;Elves of the Light&quot;) or High Elves, as they had seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. The most distinctive aspect of Noldorin culture is their fondness for craftwork and skill of their workmanship, which ranges from lapidary to embroidery to the craft of language. Among the Elven kindreds, the Noldor are the most beloved by the Vala Aulë, who originally taught them craftsmanship. As a result of their renown as the most skilled of all peoples in lore, warfare and crafts, the Noldor are sometimes called the &quot;Deep Elves&quot;. Following their return to Middle-earth at the end of the First Age, the Noldor build great cities within their realms in the land of Beleriand, such as Nargothrond and Gondolin.

When the Noldor are in Valinor they speak Quenya; in Middle-earth they also speak Sindarin. Among the wisest of the Noldor is Rúmil, creator of the first writing system, Sarati, and author of many books of lore. Fëanor, son of Finwë and Míriel, is the greatest of their craftsmen, &quot;mightiest in skill of word and of hand&quot;, and creator of the Silmarils. Fëanor also devised the Tengwar script.

Tolkien gave some Noldorin leaders like Finwë and Fingolfin their own heraldic devices, carefully distinguishing their ranks by the number of points touching the rim.

The Noldor are the proudest of the Elves, as they vaunt in particular their ability to create: in the words of the Sindar, &quot;they needed room to quarrel in&quot;. Equally, this causes in them an arrogance that plagues their history and causes them great suffering.

The Noldor are tall and physically strong. Their hair colour is usually a very dark shade of brown; Tolkien hesitated over whether their hair might be black. Red and even white (&quot;silver&quot;) hair occasionally exists among some individuals. Their eyes are usually grey or dark, with the inner light of Valinor reflected in their eyes; the Sindarin term &quot;Lachend&quot; means &quot;flame-eyed&quot;.

== Fictional history ==

=== Early history ===

&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; tells the history of the Noldor. The Elves are placed, asleep, in Cuiviénen on Middle-earth by the creator, Ilúvatar. According to Elven-lore, the Noldor as a clan is founded by Tata, the second Elf to awaken, his spouse Tatië and their 54 companions. The fate of Tata and Tatië is not recorded; it is Finwë who leads the Noldor to Valinor, where he becomes their King, and their chief dwelling-place is the city of Tirion upon Túna. In Valinor &quot;great became their knowledge and their skill; yet even greater was their thirst for more knowledge, and in many things they soon surpassed their teachers. They were changeful in speech, for they had great love of words, and sought ever to find names more fit for all things they knew or imagined.&quot;

The Noldor draw the ire of the rogue Vala Melkor, who envies their prosperity and, most of all, the Silmarils crafted by Fëanor. So he often goes among them, offering advice, and the Noldor listen, being eager for knowledge. But Melkor sows lies, and in the end the peace in Tirion is poisoned. Fëanor, having assaulted his half-brother Fingolfin and thus broken the laws of the Valar, is banished to his fortress Formenos, and with him goes Finwë his father. Fingolfin remains as the ruler of the Noldor of Tirion.

With the aid of the spider spirit Ungoliant, Melkor destroys the Two Trees of Valinor, slays Finwë, steals the Silmarils and departs from Aman. Driven by vengeance, Fëanor rebels against the Valar and rouses the Noldor to leave Valinor, follows Melkor to Middle-earth and wages war against him for the recovery of the Silmarils. Though the greater part of the Noldor still hold Fingolfin as the rightful leader, they follow Fëanor out of kinship and to avenge Finwë. Fëanor and his sons swear an oath of vengeance against Melkor (whom Fëanor renames Morgoth) or anyone who comes into possession of a Silmaril.

=== Flight of the Noldor: exile to Middle-earth ===

In the port city of Alqualondë, the Noldor hosts led by Fëanor demand that the Falmari, those of the Teleri who had come to Valinor, let them use their ships. When the Teleri refuse, Fëanor&#x27;s forces take the ships by force, committing the first Kinslaying. A messenger from the Valar comes later and delivers the Prophecy of the North, pronouncing the Doom of Mandos on the Noldor for the Kinslaying, and warning that a grim fate awaits them should they proceed with their rebellion. Some of the Noldor who had had no hand in the Kinslaying, including Finarfin, son of Finwë and Indis, return to Valinor, and the Valar forgive them. The majority of the Noldor, some blameless for the Kinslaying, remain determined to leave Valinor for Middle-earth. Among them are Finarfin&#x27;s children, Finrod and Galadriel, who choose to follow Fingolfin instead of Fëanor and his sons.

The Noldor cross the sea to Middle-earth in the stolen ships, leaving Fingolfin and his people behind. Upon his arrival in Middle-earth, Fëanor has the ships burned. When the Noldor led by Fingolfin discover their betrayal, they go far to the north and cross the sea at the Grinding Ice or Helcaraxë. Suffering substantial losses along the way, this greatly adds to their animosity for Fëanor and his sons. The deaths of the Two Trees and the departure of the Noldor out of the Undying Lands mark the end of the Years of the Trees, and the beginning of the Years of the Sun, when the Valar create the Moon and the Sun out of Telperion&#x27;s last flower and Laurelin&#x27;s last fruit. Fëanor&#x27;s company is soon attacked by Morgoth in the Battle under Stars or &quot;Dagor-nuin-Giliath&quot;. Fëanor himself is mortally wounded by Balrogs, who had issued forth from Morgoth&#x27;s fortress of Angband and captured his eldest son Maedhros.

Fingon, the eldest son of Fingolfin, saves Maedhros (his half-cousin) from captivity, which settles the rift between their houses for a time. Maedhros is due to succeed Fëanor, but he regrets his part in the Kinslaying as well as the abandonment of Fingolfin, and leaves the leadership of the Noldor in Middle-earth to his uncle Fingolfin, who becomes High King of the Noldor. Maedhros&#x27;s brothers dissent and begin to call themselves &quot;the Dispossessed&quot;, paying little deference to Fingolfin or his successors, and are still determined to fulfil the oath they swore to recover the Silmarils on behalf of their father. 


In Beleriand, in the north-west of Middle-earth, the Noldor make alliances with the Sindar and later with Men of the Three Houses of the Edain. Fingolfin reigns long in the land of Hithlum, and his younger son Turgon builds the hidden city of Gondolin. The Sons of Fëanor rule the lands in Eastern Beleriand, while Finrod Finarfin&#x27;s son is the King of Nargothrond and his brothers Angrod and Aegnor hold Dorthonion. Fingolfin&#x27;s reign is marked by warfare against Morgoth; in the year 60 of the First Age, after their victory in the battle of Dagor Aglareb, the Noldor start the Siege of Angband, the great fortress of Morgoth. In 455 the siege is broken by Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach, or Battle of Sudden Flame, in which the north-eastern Elvish realms are conquered, with the exception of Maedhros&#x27; fortress at Himring. A man, Barahir, saves Finrod&#x27;s life; Finrod gives him a ring which had been made in Valinor. Fingolfin in despair rides to Angband and challenges Morgoth to single combat, dealing the Dark Lord seven wounds before perishing. Fingolfin is succeeded by his eldest son Fingon the Valiant, who becomes the second High King of the Noldor in Beleriand.

In 472, Maedhros organises an attack on Morgoth, which leads to the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. The Noldor and their allies are utterly defeated when they are betrayed by the Easterlings and surrounded by Morgoth&#x27;s forces. Fingon is killed by Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs, and is succeeded by his brother Turgon. Morgoth scatters the remaining forces led by the sons of Fëanor, and in 495 Nargothrond too is conquered. Turgon had already withdrawn to Gondolin, which had been kept hidden from both Morgoth and other Elves; his realm is betrayed to Morgoth by his nephew Maeglin in 510. Turgon dies during the Fall of Gondolin, though his daughter Idril leads many of his people to escape and find their way south. Gil-galad, son of Fingon, succeeds Turgon and becomes the fourth and last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth.

Between 545 and 583, the War of Wrath is fought between Morgoth and the host of the Valar. As the result of the cataclysmic destruction from the war, Beleriand sinks into the sea, except for a part of Ossiriand later known as Lindon, and a few islands. The defeat of Morgoth marks the end of the First Age and the start of the Second, when most of the Noldor return to Aman, though some like Galadriel or Celebrimbor, grandson of Fëanor, refuse the pardon of the Valar and remain in Middle-earth.

=== Second and Third Ages ===

Gil-galad founds a new kingdom at Lindon and rules throughout the Second Age, longer than any of the High Kings before him. After Sauron re-emerges and manipulates Celebrimbor and the smiths of Eregion into forging the Rings of Power, he fortifies Mordor and begins the long war with the remaining Elves in Middle-earth. His forces attack Eregion, destroying it, but are repelled at Rivendell and Lindon. With the aid of the Númenóreans, the Noldor manage to defeat him for a time.

In the year 3319 of the Second Age, Sauron manipulates the Númenóreans and their King, Ar-Pharazôn, to rebel against the Valar. Númenor is destroyed. Elendil escapes to the mainland with his sons Anárion and Isildur, who establish the realms of Arnor and Gondor. Gil-galad sets out for Mordor in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with Elendil&#x27;s forces and defeats Sauron in the Siege of Barad-dûr, though Gil-galad himself perishes with no successors as High King of the Noldor. Among the lineal descendants of Finwë in Middle-earth, only Galadriel and some Half-elven remain.
In the Third Age, the Noldor in Middle-earth dwindle, and at the end of the Third Age the remaining Noldor depart to Valinor. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; Frodo meets a band of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion from the House of Finrod who are returning from a pilgrimage at the White Towers.

== House of Finwë ==

The Sons of Fëanor are (in the order of their birth) Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Caranthir, Amras, and Amrod.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that the family tree of the House of Finwë is &quot;essential&quot;, as Tolkien allocates character by ancestry; thus, Fëanor is pure Noldor, and so excellent as a craftsman, but his half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin have Vanyar blood from their mother, Indis. They are accordingly less skilful as craftsmen, but superior &quot;in restraint and generosity&quot;.

== Analysis ==

=== Tuatha Dé Danaan ===

Scholars including Dimitra Fimi, Anne Kinniburgh, and John Garth have connected the Noldor with the Irish Tuatha Dé Danaan as a possible influence. The parallels are both thematic and direct. In Irish mythology, the Tuatha Dé Danaan invade Ireland as a tall pale fair-haired race of immortal warriors and sorcerers. They have godlike attributes but human social organisation. They enter Ireland with what Kinniburgh calls a &quot;historical trajectory&quot;, entering in triumph, living with a high status, and leaving diminished, just as the Noldor do in Middle-earth. They are semi-divine as Sons of Danu, just as the Noldor are counted among the first of the sentient races, the Children of Ilúvatar. Their immortality keeps them from disease and the frailty of age, but not from death in battle, an exact parallel with the Noldor. Nuada Airgetlám, the Tuatha Dé Danaan&#x27;s first high king, is killed by Balor of the Evil Eye; Fëanor is killed by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Celebrimbor&#x27;s name means &quot;Silver Hand&quot; in Sindarin, the same meaning as Nuada&#x27;s epithet Airgetlám in Irish Gaelic. Celebrimbor&#x27;s making of powerful but dangerous rings, too, has been linked with the finding of a curse on a ring at the temple of Nodens, a Roman god whom Tolkien in his work as a philologist identified with Nuada. Like Nuada, Maedhros loses a hand.

=== Germanic influence ===
The Tolkien scholar Leslie A. Donovan notes that Tolkien&#x27;s concept of exile, as principally exemplified by the Noldor, derives in part from Anglo-Saxon culture, in which he was an expert.

The medievalist Elizabeth Solopova makes a connection between Middle English and Tolkien&#x27;s description of Finwë&#x27;s first wife Míriel as the most skilful of the Noldor at weaving and needlework; Solopova notes that Tolkien had proposed an etymology for the Middle English term &quot;burde&quot;, meaning lady or damsel, linking it to Old English &quot;borde&quot;, embroidery, and that he had given examples from both Old English and Old Norse where women were called weavers or embroiderers.

=== Sub-creation ===
Shippey writes that Tolkien was himself fascinated with artefacts and their &quot;sub-creation&quot;. He comments that in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Tolkien consistently chooses to write about the &quot;restless desire to make things&quot;. This is not quite, he notes, the same as the Christian sin of avarice or possessiveness. This made sense in the case of the Noldor, as for consistency their besetting sin ought not to be the same as Adam and Eve&#x27;s, which was pride. In Valinor, Shippey writes, the equivalent of the Fall &quot;came when conscious creatures became &#x27;more interested in their own creations than in God&#x27;s&#x27;&quot;, with Fëanor&#x27;s forging of the Silmarils. He adds that the smith-Vala Aulë is not only the patron of all craftsmen but the Vala most like Melkor, the first Dark Lord. The kinds of craftsmanship he encouraged among the Noldor was not only of physical things, but &quot;&#x27;those that make not, but seek only for the understanding of what is&#x27; — the philologists, one might say&quot;, writes Shippey, including Tolkien&#x27;s profession along with the Noldor&#x27;s skill with letters and poetry. 

=== Decline and fall ===
The Tolkien scholar Bradford Lee Eden states that in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, Tolkien focused on the Noldor as their history is &quot;filled with the doom and fate so typical of medieval literature that determines the entire history of Middle-earth from the First Age to the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; He notes that in many &quot;parallel stories and tales&quot; the fates of Elves and Men are tightly interwoven, leading inexorably to the decline and fading of the Elves and the rise of Men as the dominant race in the modern Earth. The Tolkien scholar Matthew Dickerson writes that the theft of the Silmarils by Morgoth leads Fëanor and his sons into swearing their dreadful oath and leading the Noldor out of Valinor back to Middle-earth. This is, he comments, at once a free choice and a self-imposed exile.

=== Colonialism ===
The Swedish archaeologist Martin Rundkvist writes that Tolkien&#x27;s account of Finrod Felagund includes &quot;a transparently colonial passage&quot; where the Elf, having arrived in a new country, &quot;immediately takes up the White Man&#x27;s Burden and spends a year educating the humans about his religious beliefs (&#x27;true knowledge&#x27;). They think this is great and become his feudal subjects. Then to avoid conflict with the Green-elves he re-settles the new arrivals in a thinly populated area ruled by some of his relatives.&quot;

==In culture==
&quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;, a 1998 studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, contained multiple references to the Noldor and the events they experience within the narrative of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. For example, &quot;Face the Truth&quot; has Fingolfin tell how he crossed the icy Helcaraxë, while in &quot;Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)&quot; he regrets having left Valinor; &quot;Battle of Sudden Flame&quot; recalls the battle of Dagor Bragollach, which marked the turning point of the Noldor&#x27;s war against Morgoth in the Dark Lord&#x27;s favour; &quot;The Dark Elf&quot; recounts the birth of Maeglin, the son of Fingolfin&#x27;s daughter Aredhel and Eöl the titular Dark Elf; &quot;Nom the Wise&quot; is an elegy by Beren to his friend Finrod Felagund. The Tolkien scholar Bradford Lee Eden writes that &quot;although one can assume that Tolkien was not a headbanger&quot;, he finds that in the opinion of his students, the &quot;driving energy&quot; of the power metal sound is appropriate for the stories: &quot;The music conveys rage and despair, which fits lyrics such as &#x27;The doom of the Noldor drew near/ The words of a banished king, “I swear revenge!”&#x27;&quot; Eden adds that this facilitates discussion of Tolkien&#x27;s Christian view of the fall of man.

<text>Finwë () and Míriel () are fictional characters from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. Finwë is the first King of the Noldor Elves; he leads his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. His first wife is Míriel, who, uniquely among immortal Elves, dies while giving birth to their only child Fëanor, creator of the Silmarils; her spirit later serves the godlike Vala queen Vairë. Finwë is the first person to be murdered in Valinor: he is killed by the Dark Lord Morgoth, who is intent on stealing the Silmarils. The event sets off the Flight of the Noldor from Valinor back to Beleriand in Middle-earth, and its disastrous consequences.

Tolkien commented on the importance of the story of Finwë and Míriel on his legendarium, stating that had Finwë chosen differently, the whole course of Middle-earth&#x27;s history would have been better. Tolkien called Míriel&#x27;s decision to let go of life disastrous; he associated it with the Biblical Fall of man. Scholars have debated whether Finwë and Míriel were to blame for the subsequent disastrous history of the Elves in Middle-earth. They have remarked that Míriel was extremely skilful in craftsmanship, and passed on her skill to her son Fëanor, whose other name, Curufinwë, means &quot;Skill-Finwë&quot; in one of Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages, Quenya. They have commented, too, on the lasting consequences of Míriel&#x27;s death, through Fëanor&#x27;s uncontrolled and divisive actions.

== Fictional history ==

=== In Middle-earth ===

Among the Elves who first awoke at Cuiviénen, a bay on the Sea of Helcar in the East of Middle-earth, the Noldor are the &quot;Deep-Elves&quot;, always interested in knowledge, skill, and understanding; their leader is Finwë. The godlike Valar ask the Elves to come and live with them in their blessed realm of Valinor. The Elves are doubtful about this, so the Vala Oromë picks three leaders of the Elves, Elwë, Finwë, and Ingwë, to come and see Valinor for themselves. Delighted by what they see, the three ambassadors return to their people and invite them to make the journey to Valinor. The Fair-Elves of Ingwë go and stay; the Deep-Elves of Finwë go, but many later return to Middle-earth; while the Elves of Elwë are divided, and though they set out together, many do not complete the journey. The ambassadors become the Kings of their respective peoples.

=== In Valinor ===

Finwë marries Míriel, the most skilful of the Noldor in needlework and weaving. Míriel gives birth to their only child, Curufinwë, commonly called Fëanor; he inherits her skill, becoming the most gifted and brilliant of all the Noldor, the mightiest in crafts, especially the making of jewels.

Míriel, an immortal elf, is so exhausted by the birth, &quot;consumed in spirit and body&quot; by the fiery creative energy of her son Fëanor, that she wilfully gives up her spirit. She thus becomes the first sentient being in the blessed realm of Aman to experience death. This leaves Finwë on his own, not through his own choice; such a thing had never occurred before, and he chooses to remarry. His second wife is Indis of the Vanyar, the Fair-Elves of Ingwë. She bears him two sons: Fingolfin and Finarfin, and two daughters: Findis and Írimë, their names echoing his.

Fëanor comes to resent Finwë&#x27;s other sons, his half-brothers; there is constant strife between them. Fëanor makes the Silmarils, three star-like jewels that embody some of the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.

During the Dark Lord Melkor&#x27;s attempt to corrupt the Noldor, Finwë tries to exert a moderating influence over his people and lead them back to the Valar. When Fëanor is exiled from the Elvish city of Tirion after he openly threatens Fingolfin, Finwë goes with him to their northern fortress, Formenos. There he is the first to be murdered in Valinor when Melkor, seeking the Silmarils, kills him at the doors of Formenos. This directly leads to the Flight of the Noldor, the disastrous rebellion of the Noldor against the Valar, which in turn leads the First Kinslaying, when Elves killed other Elves.

=== In the Halls of Mandos ===

After their deaths, Finwë and Míriel meet again in the Halls of Mandos, the place where the shades of dead Elves go in Aman. The Valar had allowed Finwë to remarry, given that Míriel had made clear she would never again live in a body; they did not want an Elf to have two living wives. As with Elves killed in battle, the Valar offer Finwë the choice to live again; he decides instead to let Míriel have this chance. Míriel feels that there is no longer a place for her among the Noldor, since Finwë had remarried, and declines the offer. She chooses to become an eternal assistant to Vairë, the weaver of the godlike Valar: she helps to weave the tapestries of time for the duration of the world&#x27;s existence.

== Analysis ==

=== Creative power ===

Megan Fontenot, writing on &quot;Tor.com&quot;, notes that when Míriel says she will have no more children after the effort of having Fëanor, Finwë &quot;becomes depressed&quot;, but ultimately gets the Vala Manwë to do as Míriel wishes, and let her go to the garden of Lórien, in the South of Aman, which is the realm of the Vala Irmo, the master of dreams. There she falls asleep and her spirit departs for the Halls of Mandos. Finwë visits her and calls her names, but she does not return. Fontenot comments that Tolkien&#x27;s drafts of the tale of Míriel are complex. One strand of Tolkien&#x27;s accounts of her tells that her needlework is so fine that just one piece would be worth more than a kingdom; Tolkien likens her creative power to that of the Vala Yavanna, she who loves all trees and plants that grow in the earth. In Fontenot&#x27;s view, Míriel&#x27;s creativity &quot;celebrates and amplifies the beauty already present in the world around her. Her art doesn&#x27;t hoard light and beauty&quot;. Further, Fontenot writes, it is significant that Yavanna made the Two Trees of Valinor, while Míriel made Fëanor, who made the Silmarils, which captured some of the light of the Two Trees.

=== Important choices ===

Some of Tolkien&#x27;s drafts of the story describe similarities of character between Fëanor and Míriel. Tolkien calls both of them determined, hardly ever changing their mind once they had said they would do something. In another draft, Tolkien adds that Míriel was both &quot;proud and obdurate&quot;; the mention of pride directly echoes Fëanor&#x27;s ill-fated oath.

Tolkien rewrote the tale of Finwë and Míriel several times, as it assumed &quot;an extraordinary importance in [his] later work on &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father&#x27;s unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale of Finwë and Míriel; Tolkien may have intended to incorporate a fuller version. In Tolkien&#x27;s works, Elves are immortal, their shades going to the Halls of Mandos after death, and marriage is forever. Tolkien noted that had Finwë chosen differently, the whole history of Middle-earth would have changed for the better, thus making his choice a pivotal event in the mythology; it showed the importance Tolkien attached to unbreakable relationships.

=== Skill of mother and son ===

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger comments that Míriel&#x27;s death has deep-running consequences through her son Fëanor&#x27;s &quot;unchecked nature&quot;. She notes that his usual name means &quot;Spirit of Fire&quot;, and that it is not his true name, which is Curufinwë (Quenya: &quot;Curu&quot;, &quot;Skill&quot;, and his father&#x27;s name); in her view, the use of an epithet implies a strong emphasis on his fire element. The first thing his fire consumes is Míriel&#x27;s body; &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; says she is &quot;consumed in spirit and body&quot;. The poet and essayist Melanie Rawls writes that Fëanor&#x27;s consuming nature, always taking things in, is &quot;a negative-feminine trait&quot;, implying a disharmony of the genders. Flieger writes that his fire then drives his creativity, making the beautiful letters of the Fëanorian script, and jewels, including, fatefully, the Silmarils. She states that Tolkien, choosing his words very carefully, calls Fëanor two things. Firstly, he uses the word &quot;subtle&quot;, by etymology from Latin &quot;sub-tela&quot;, &quot;under the warp (of a weaving)&quot;, hence the crosswise weft threads that go against the grain, a dangerous part of the fabric of life. Secondly, he applies the word &quot;skilled&quot;, by etymology from Indo-European &quot;skel-&quot;, &quot;to cut&quot;, like the Noldor as a whole tending to cause division among the Elves. His choices, and the Silmarils, do in fact lead to division and war, to the Kinslaying of Elf by Elf, the theft of the Telerin Elves&#x27; ships in Aman, and in turn to further disasters across the sea in Beleriand.

Both Matthew Dickerson in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; and Elizabeth Solopova in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot; note that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; emphasises Míriel&#x27;s skill, naming her in early versions &quot;Byrde&quot;, later &quot;Serindë&quot;, &quot;the broideress&quot;; she passes on her &quot;surpassing skill&quot; in craftsmanship to her only son. Solopova suggests a possible link to Tolkien&#x27;s study of the Middle English word &quot;burde&quot;, conventionally meaning &quot;lady, damsel&quot;; he proposed that it derived from Old English , &quot;embroidery&quot; and pointed out that in Old Norse and Old English poetry, stock terms for &quot;woman&quot; included &quot;weaver&quot; and &quot;embroideress&quot;.

=== &quot;A strange case&quot; ===

Tolkien mentions in a letter &quot;a strange case of an Elf (Míriel mother of Fëanor) that tried to &quot;die&quot;, which had disastrous results, leading to the &#x27;Fall&#x27; of the High-elves&quot;; he discusses it in the context of the Fall of Man. Dickerson writes that while Fëanor is held responsible by the Valar, &quot;neither Finwë nor Míriel is blameless&quot;. He states that no reason is given in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; for Míriel&#x27;s decision, beyond the enormous amount of energy, &quot;enough for many children&quot;, that she put into Fëanor. However, he notes that Morgoth had already worked his evil on the Elves when they were still at Cuiviénen, where they first awakened, in the east of Middle-earth, sowing &quot;the seeds of despair&quot;; this might, he suggests, have contributed to Míriel&#x27;s loss of hope. Tolkien wrote in &quot;Laws and Customs Among the Eldar&quot; that &quot;Niënna came to Manwë, and she said: &#x27;Lord of Aman, it is now made clear that the death of Míriel was an evil of Arda Marred, for with the coming hither of the Eldar the Shadow hath found an entrance even into Aman.&#x27;&quot;

Fontenot notes that Tolkien&#x27;s drafts differ widely in how long Míriel lives after Fëanor&#x27;s birth, and hence in whether she can influence his ill humour directly. This in turn affects the issue of how far Finwë and Míriel can be blamed for the consequences of Fëanor&#x27;s actions. It is a question that the Valar debate amongst themselves.

=== Philosophical themes ===

The scholar of religion Amelia Rutledge identifies what she calls Pauline constructs (like the language used by Paul the Apostle in the Bible) in the legalistic wording relating to the tale of Finwë and Míriel. She notes that Elizabeth Whittingham and Douglas Kane discuss instead the eschatology relating to the tale. Whittingham considers what she calls &quot;some of the most interesting glimpses of Tolkien as sub-creator&quot; in his stories and essays on the nature of mortal Men and immortal Elves, exploring the question of death and immortality raised by the voluntary death of Míriel. Kane discusses Mandos&#x27;s Second Prophecy, with an illustration of &quot;The spirit of Míriel appearing before Mandos and Manwë, and taking a last look at Finwë&quot;.

<text>Fëanor () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. He creates the Tengwar script, the palantír seeing-stones, and the three Silmarils, the skilfully forged jewels that give the book their name and theme, triggering division and destruction. He is the eldest son of Finwë, the King of the Noldor Elves, and his first wife Míriel.

Fëanor&#x27;s Silmarils form a central theme of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as Men and Elves battle with the forces of evil for their possession. After the Dark Lord Morgoth steals the Silmarils, Fëanor and his seven sons swear the Oath of Fëanor, vowing to fight anyone and everyone—whether Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala—who withholds the Silmarils.

The oath commands Fëanor and his sons to press to Middle-earth, in the process committing atrocities against their fellow Elves, the first Kinslaying, at the havens of the Teleri. Fëanor dies soon after his arrival in Middle-earth; his sons unite in the cause of defeating Morgoth and retrieving the Silmarils, but end up causing further harm among the Elves.

The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance has seen Fëanor&#x27;s pride as leading to his downfall, alongside Morgoth&#x27;s corruption of Elves and Men as reflecting Satan&#x27;s temptation of Adam and Eve, and the desire for godlike knowledge as in the Garden of Eden. Others have likened Fëanor to the Anglo-Saxon leader Byrhtnoth whose foolish pride led to defeat and death at the Battle of Maldon. Tom Shippey writes that the pride is specifically a desire to make things that reflect their own personality, and likens this to Tolkien&#x27;s own desire to sub-create. John Ellison further likens this creative pride to that of the protagonist in Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1947 novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, noting that both that novel and Tolkien&#x27;s own legendarium were responses to World War.

== Fictional history ==

=== Early life ===

Fëanor&#x27;s father is Finwë, the first King of the Noldor; his mother, Míriel, dies, &quot;consumed in spirit and body&quot;, shortly after giving birth to him. Fëanor &quot;was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and a bright flame was in him.&quot; Finwë remarries and has several children, including Fëanor&#x27;s half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor studies under his father-in-law Mahtan, who was a student of the godlike Vala Aulë. He becomes a craftsman and gem-smith, inventor of the Tengwar script, and the creator of the magical seeing-stones, the palantírs.

=== Silmarils ===

Fëanor, &quot;in the greatest of his achievements, captured the light of the Two Trees to make the three Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels, though they were not mere glittering stones, they were alive, imperishable, and sacred.&quot; Even the Valar with their godlike powers could not copy them. In fact, Fëanor himself could not copy them, as part of his essence goes into their making. Their worth is close to infinite, as they are unique and irreplaceable. The Vala &quot;Varda hallowed the Silmarils so that thereafter no mortal flesh, nor hands unclean, nor anything of evil will might touch them, for it would be scorched and withered.&quot;

Fëanor prizes the Silmarils, and grows suspicious of the Valar and Elves who he believes covet them. The Vala Melkor, recently released from imprisonment and now residing in Valinor, sees an opportunity to sow dissent among the Noldor. Fëanor refuses to communicate with Melkor, but is still caught in his plot. Fëanor angrily warns Fingolfin not to spread lies, and threatens to kill him. As punishment, the Valar exile Fëanor to his remote home Formenos for twelve years. Finwë too withdraws to Formenos.

The Valar learn that Melkor is manipulating Fëanor, and send one of their number, Tulkas, to capture Melkor, but he has already escaped. Fëanor wisely realises that Melkor&#x27;s goal is to obtain the Silmarils, &quot;and he shut the doors of his house in the face of the mightiest of all the dwellers in Eä.&quot; The Valar invite Fëanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offers a hand to his half-brother, recognising Fëanor&#x27;s place as the eldest. Fëanor accepts, but soon Melkor and Ungoliant destroy The Two Trees, leaving the Silmarils as the only surviving light of the Trees. The Valar ask Fëanor to give them up so that they can restore the Trees. Fëanor replies: &quot;It may be that I can unlock my jewels, but never again shall I make their like; and if I must break them, I shall break my heart.&quot; He refuses to give up the Silmarils of his own free will. Messengers from Formenos tell him that Melkor has killed Finwë and stolen the Silmarils. Yavanna is thus unable to heal the Two Trees.

For this deed, Fëanor names Melkor &quot;Morgoth&quot;, &quot;Black Enemy&quot;. Fëanor rails against the Great Enemy, blaming the Valar for Morgoth&#x27;s deeds. He gives a speech in the Elvish city of Tirion, persuading most of his people to return to Middle-earth to avenge Finwë and free themselves from the Valar. Together with his seven sons, they swear the Oath of Fëanor:

=== Return to Beleriand ===

To get to Middle-earth, Fëanor goes to the shores of Aman, and asks the seafaring Teleri for their aid. When they refuse, Fëanor orders the Noldor to steal the ships. The Teleri resist, and many of them are killed. The battle became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, or the first kinslaying. His sons later commit two other acts of warfare against Elves in Middle-earth in his name. In repentance, Finarfin, Finwë&#x27;s third son, takes his host and turns back. They are accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin rules as High-King of the Noldor in Valinor. The remaining Elves, those who follow Fëanor and Fingolfin, become subject to the Doom of Mandos, that they will come to harm if they continue their rebellion against the Valar. There are not enough ships to carry all the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons lead the first group. Upon arriving in the far west of Beleriand, they decide to burn the ships and leave Fingolfin and his people behind. Fingolfin, furious, returns to Beleriand by the long and hard land route, via the northern ice.

Morgoth summons his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacks Fëanor&#x27;s encampment in Mithrim. This battle was called the Battle under the Stars, or &quot;Dagor-nuin-Giliath&quot;, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Noldor win the battle. Fëanor presses on toward Angband with his sons. He comes within sight of Angband, but is ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few Elves about him. He fights mightily with Gothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons come upon the Balrogs with a great force of Elves, and drive them off; but Fëanor knows his wounds are fatal. He curses Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he sees that his Elves, unaided, will never throw down the dark towers of Thangorodrim.

=== Aftermath ===

The Oath of Fëanor affects the lovers Beren and Lúthien. They steal a Silmaril from Morgoth, leading to Kinslaying and years of strife among the Elves, until Eärendil carries the Silmaril off into the West. That Silmaril is lost to the Sons of Fëanor, but the other two remain in the crown of Morgoth. They too are stolen, one ending in the earth, one in the sea.

According to Mandos&#x27; prophecy, following Melkor&#x27;s final return and defeat in the Dagor Dagorath, the world will be changed and the Valar will recover the Silmarils. Fëanor will be released from the Halls of Mandos and will give Yavanna the Silmarils. Fëanor will break them, and Yavanna will revive the Two Trees. The Pelóri Mountains will be flattened and the light of the Two Trees will fill the world in eternal bliss.

=== House of Fëanor ===





 Kings of the Noldor in Valinor

 High Kings of the Noldor in Exile (in Middle-earth)

All the characters shown are Elves. The above tree follows the late note &quot;The Shibboleth of Fëanor&quot;. In the published Silmarillion, the birth order of Fëanor&#x27;s sons is Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin (father of Celebrimbor), Amrod, and Amras; Fëanor&#x27;s half-sisters Findis and Írimë do not appear.

== Development ==

Fëanor was originally named Curufinwë (&quot;skilful [son of] Finwë&quot;) in Tolkien&#x27;s fictional language of Quenya. He is known as Fëanáro, &quot;spirit of fire&quot; in Quenya, from &quot;fëa&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot;) and &quot;nár&quot; (&quot;flame&quot;). Fëanáro is his &quot;mother-name&quot; or &quot;Amilessë&quot;, the name given by an Elf&#x27;s mother at, or some years after, birth and it was one of their true names.

Tolkien wrote at least four versions of the Oath of Fëanor itself, as found in &quot;The History of Middle-earth.&quot; The three earliest versions are found in &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;: in alliterative verse (circa 1918–1920s), in chapter 2, &quot;Poems Early Abandoned&quot; &quot;The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor&quot;. Lines 132–141; in rhyming couplets (circa 1928), in chapter 3, &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot;. Canto VI, lines 1628–1643; and in a different form as restated by Celegorm, third son of Fëanor, in chapter 3, &quot;The Lay of Leithian.&quot; Canto VI, lines 1848–1857. A later version is found in &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot;. Fëanor is among those major characters whom Tolkien, who also used to illustrate his writings, supplied with a distinct heraldic device.

== Analysis ==

=== Pride and downfall ===

The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance sees Morgoth&#x27;s corruption of Elves and Men as clearly Biblical, as it &quot;mirrors that of Adam and Eve by Satan; the desire for power and godlike being is the same desire for knowledge of good and evil witnessed in the Garden of Eden.&quot; She treats the Silmarils as symbols of that same desire. She identifies Fëanor&#x27;s wish to be like the Valar in creating &quot;things of his own&quot; as rebellious pride, and that, like Melkor, he &quot;succumbs to a &#x27;greedy love&#x27;&quot; of his creations that causes his downfall. She points out that Fëanor&#x27;s rebellion is echoed by that of the Númenórean man Ar-Pharazon, and then at the end of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; by the (angelic) Maia, Sauron, who becomes the Dark Lord of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The philologist Elizabeth Solopova suggests that the character of Fëanor was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon leader Byrhtnoth, and in particular his appearance in the poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. The poem tells how he is slain in that battle, which took place in the year 991. Tolkien wrote a short play in verse, &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot; on the character&#x27;s misplaced pride, and described Byrhtnoth as misled by &quot;pride and misplaced chivalry proven fatal&quot; and as &quot;too foolish to be heroic&quot;. Fëanor is similarly driven by &quot;overmastering pride&quot; that causes his death and that of countless followers.

=== Pride in sub-creation ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that Fëanor and his Silmarils relate to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;″s theme in a particular way: the sin of the Elves is not human pride, as in the Biblical fall, but their &quot;desire to make things which will forever reflect or incarnate their own personality&quot;. This Elvish form of pride leads Fëanor to forge the Silmarils, and, Shippey suggests, led Tolkien to write his fictions: &quot;Tolkien could not help seeing a part of himself in Fëanor and Saruman, sharing their perhaps licit, perhaps illicit desire to &#x27;sub-create&#x27;.&quot;

John Ellison, writing in the Tolkien Society&#x27;s journal &quot;Mallorn&quot;, draws a comparison between Fëanor and the Faust legend, in particular Thomas Mann&#x27;s version in his 1947 novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. In Ellison&#x27;s view, the life history of both characters is of &quot;genius corrupted finally into insanity; the creative drive turns on its possessor and destroys him, and with him a good part of the fabric of society.&quot; He describes as parallel Mann&#x27;s depiction of his Faust character Leverkühn in a collapsing Nazi Germany and Tolkien&#x27;s starting his mythology amidst the collapse of pre-1914 Europe in the First World War. Fëanor is, he writes, not an exact equivalent of Doctor Faustus: he does not make a pact with the devil; but both Fëanor and Leverkühn outgrow their teachers in creative skill. Ellison calls Leverkühn &quot;a Fëanor of our times&quot;, and comments that far from being a simple battle of good versus evil, Tolkien&#x27;s world as seen in Fëanor has &quot;the creative and destructive forces in man&#x27;s nature ... indivisibly linked; this is the essence of the &#x27;fallen world&#x27; in which we live.&quot; He adds that Fëanor is central to the whole of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, &quot;the hinge on which the whole great Tale ... turns.&quot;

Like Shippey, Ellison relates Fëanor&#x27;s making of the Silmarils to what he supposes was Tolkien&#x27;s own belief: that it was &quot;a dangerous and impermissible act&quot; that went beyond what the Creator had intended for the Elves. Further, Ellison suggests that while Fëanor does not directly represent Tolkien, there is something about his action that can be applied to Tolkien&#x27;s life. Tolkien calls Fëanor &quot;&quot;; Ellison notes that Tolkien analysed his own name as &quot;tollkühn&quot;, with the same meaning. Further, Tolkien seems, Ellison writes, to have felt a conflict between his own &quot;sub-creation&quot; and his Catholic faith.

=== Ancestry as guide to character ===

Shippey and the Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger both note that Tolkien intended ancestry to be a guide to character. Shippey writes that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; echoes Norse mythology in this belief, and that one perhaps needs to study the family trees to see clearly how it all works:

=== &quot;Subtle&quot; and &quot;skilled&quot; ===

Flieger writes that Fëanor&#x27;s fire drives his creativity, making the beautiful letters of the Fëanorian script, and jewels, including, fatefully, the Silmarils. She comments that Tolkien, choosing his words very carefully, calls Fëanor both &quot;subtle&quot;, by etymology from Latin &quot;sub-tela&quot;, &quot;under the warp (of a weaving)&quot;, hence the crosswise weft threads that go against the grain, a dangerous part of the fabric of life; and &quot;skilled&quot;, by etymology from Indo-European &quot;skel-&quot;, &quot;to cut&quot;, like the Noldor as a whole tending to cause division among the Elves; and indeed his choices, and the Silmarils, lead to division and war, to the Kinslaying of Elf by Elf, the theft of the Telerin Elves&#x27; ships in Aman, and in turn to further disasters across the sea in Beleriand.

<text>Neverwhere is an urban fantasy television miniseries by Neil Gaiman that first aired in 1996 on BBC 2. The series is set in &quot;London Below&quot;, a magical realm coexisting with the more familiar London, referred to as &quot;London Above&quot;. It was devised by Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry and directed by Dewi Humphreys. Gaiman adapted the series into a novel, which was released in September 1996. The series and book were partially inspired by Gene Wolfe&#x27;s novel &quot;Free Live Free&quot;.

== Plot ==
Richard Mayhew, a Scottish man living in London, encounters an injured girl named Door on the street one night. Despite his fiancée&#x27;s protests he decides to help her; upon doing so he ceases to exist on Earth and becomes real only to the denizens of &quot;London Below&quot;, whose inhabitants are generally invisible and non-existent to the people of &quot;London Above&quot;. He loses his flat, his job, and nearly his mind as he travels London Below in an attempt to make sense out of it all, find a way back, and help Door survive as she is hunted down by hired assassins.

In London Below the various familiar names of London all take on a new significance: for example Knightsbridge becomes &quot;Night&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, a stone bridge whose darkness takes its toll in human life; The Angel, Islington is an actual angel. London Below is a parallel world in and beneath the sewers. Its inhabitants are the homeless, but also people from other times, such as Roman legionaries and medieval monks, as well as fictional and fantastical characters.

== Characters and cast ==
* Richard Mayhew (Gary Bakewell) – a young businessman, who discovers the world of London Below one day after helping the injured Door recover in his flat.
* Door (Laura Fraser) – a young woman from London Below, the daughter of a noble family who were all murdered shortly before the beginning of the story. She possesses her family&#x27;s innate ability to &quot;open&quot; things (and not just doors).
* Mr. Croup (Hywel Bennett) – the talkative half of the pair of assassins, the Messrs. He is short, fat, and speaks in a pompous and verbose manner. Like his partner, Mr. Vandemar, he seems to be able to simply move from one place to another very quickly despite his ungainly appearance. He is the brains of the pair and seems to be the one calling the shots, and he apparently has a taste (literally) for fine china. Much of the imagery used to describe him is that of a fox.
* Mr. Vandemar (Clive Russell) – dull-witted, tall, and gangly, Vandemar is Croup&#x27;s polar opposite. He does not speak much, and when he does, his statements are often laconic and blunt. He is quite brutish and seems to enjoy nothing more than killing and destroying things (even practising his golf swing with live toads). He also has a tendency to eat live animals. The descriptive imagery likens him to a hound or a wolf, and he even howls at one point when catching up with his mark.
* The Marquis de Carabas (Paterson Joseph) – The Marquis is arrogant, cunning and very self-confident. Though very much the trickster, he is a loyal friend of Door and her family. This character was inspired by Puss in Boots, in which the cat invokes a fictional character of this name. Gaiman stated this as the starting point for the character, and imagining &quot;Who would own a cat like this?&quot;
* The Angel Islington (Peter Capaldi) – an angel dwelling in the sewers of London Below. Its duty is to watch over London Below, though (or maybe because) it failed at its previous task: guarding the city of Atlantis.
* Hunter (Tanya Moodie) – a warrior of London Below; her feats are legendary. Her lifelong obsession is to slay the great Beast of London. The imagery used to describe her likens her to a lioness.
* Old Bailey (Trevor Peacock) – an old friend of the Marquis, he keeps the company of pigeons on the rooftops and wears clothing made of feathers. He became indebted to the Marquis long ago, and so is charged with keeping a portion of his life safe for him.
* Lamia (Tamsin Greig) – the leader of a group of vampire-like seductresses, dressed in dark velvet, who &quot;suck the warmth&quot; from their victims.
* The Earl (Freddie Jones)
* The Abbott (Earl Cameron) – the leader of a group of armed black friars guarding a special key at Blackfriars.
* Anasthesia (Amy Marston)

== Episodes ==
&quot;Neverwhere&quot; was first broadcast on BBC Two from 12 September 1996. There are six half-hour episodes:

# &quot;Door&quot;
# &quot;Knightsbridge&quot;
# &quot;Earl&#x27;s Court to Islington&quot;
# &quot;Blackfriars&quot;
# &quot;Down Street&quot;
# &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;

== Background ==
The idea for the story came from a conversation between Gaiman and Henry about a possible television series. Henry suggested a story with tribes of homeless people in London. Gaiman was initially reluctant to commit, as he feared that making the homeless appear &quot;cool&quot; might cause more young people to attempt to emulate the characters, but decided that the effect could be avoided by making the story more removed from reality.

&quot;Neverwhere&quot; received some criticism for its appearance. One major problem lay in the original plan to shoot on video (for budgetary reasons), and then later &quot;filmise&quot; the footage to make it look as if it had been shot on film. For this reason, the programme had been lit and shot in a manner appropriate to a film-based production, but the decision to apply the filmisation process was later reversed. In addition to what some considered the old-fashioned appearance of un-filmised video, the lighting set up with film in mind appeared garish and unsubtle on the more clinical medium. Gaiman himself commented that the loss of quality resulting from multi-generational VHS copies actually improved the appearance in this respect.

== Production ==
=== Locations ===
* Abbey Mills Pumping Station was used as the Angel Islington&#x27;s lair.
* The scene where Richard meets Old Bailey was filmed on the roof of the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras railway station. The hotel interior was also used as &quot;Down Street&quot;.
* The exteriors for the first Market were filmed at Battersea Power Station, though a different location was used for the interiors. HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; was the scene of the second Market.
* The scene where Richard saves a man from suicide was filmed on the Albert Bridge.
* The scenes where Croup and Vandemar capture the Marquis and where Richard bids farewell to Door and London Below were filmed at the abandoned Crystal Palace station.

== DVD releases ==

After a two-cassette VHS video release, the six episodes were released in the US and Canada to DVD as a two-disc set on 9 September 2005 in conjunction with A&amp;E Network. Despite the DVDs often being advertised as region 1, some of the actual discs are region zero. The BBC have released the series on DVD on 23 April 2007. The opening theme tune on the original BBC2 transmission was the same as the music over the closing credits. The opening theme on the Region 2 DVD version is a series of abstract sounds, while the closing music remains intact. The music for the series was made by Brian Eno.

== Adaptations ==
=== Novelisation ===

Neil Gaiman wrote a novelisation of the television series that was first released in 1996, during the television show&#x27;s transmission. This was accompanied by a spoken word release on CD and cassette. The text was later re-written for the US market (Gaiman&#x27;s publisher insisting that many of the references of London were too obscure for US tastes) and a third version is now available which combines elements of both earlier versions of the novel.

=== Graphic novel ===
A nine-issue graphic novel limited series began in June 2005, written by Mike Carey (who had worked on &quot;Lucifer&quot;, a spin-off from Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;), with art by Glenn Fabry. Vertigo changed a character, the Marquis De Carabas, that had been portrayed in the TV series and on the radio as a man from the African Diaspora into a creature with a black skin tone not seen in the real world. The comic is an adaptation inspired by the novelisation, rather than the original TV series. Thus the characters and settings do not generally resemble those seen in the series. The series was published by DC Comics&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. The collected volume was also published by Vertigo, in February 2007 ().

=== Stage ===
In 2006, a world-premiere stage adaptation of the novel, developed by writer and actress Eve Butler and director Sasha Travis, was produced by the Savannah Actor&#x27;s Theatre in Savannah, Georgia.

In 2008, a stage adaptation of the novel was created and performed by the Actors Gymnasium in Evanston, Illinois.

In 2010, Lifeline Theatre in Chicago performed an adaptation written by Robert Kauzlaric. The eight-week run proved so successful that it was extended another four weeks. The play was viewed by Neil Gaiman and the co-creator of the original BBC series, Lenny Henry, during the extension.

In February 2012, Calgary-based theatre company Mob Hit Productions performed a two-week run of Kauzlaric&#x27;s adaptation.

In May 2011, the first school production of Kauzlaric&#x27;s adaptation was performed at Northwest Academy in Portland, Oregon. In February 2013, Kauzlaric&#x27;s adaption was performed at Friends Academy in Locust Valley, New York.

On 5 April 2013, the Sacred Fools Theater Company in Los Angeles performed the American West Coast premiere of Kauzlaric&#x27;s adaptation. Originally scheduled to run through 11 May, it was extended an additional two weeks due to its popularity. The play was viewed by Neil Gaiman.

In August 2013, Washington, D.C.–based company Rorschach Theatre performed Kauzlaric&#x27;s adaptation after a successful Kickstarter campaign.

=== Film ===
A script was written for a film version in 2009 and was optioned by The Weinstein Company. The project has been abandoned since.

=== Radio ===

A radio dramatisation in six parts was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra in March 2013, written by Dirk Maggs and co-directed with producer Heather Larmour. During one of his book signings Gaiman indicated that it would be released for sale in late 2013. The radio play starred James McAvoy as Richard Mayhew and Natalie Dormer as Lady Door.

== Sequels ==
Since at least 2014, Gaiman said a sequel to the book titled &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot; was a possibility, later confirming in 2017 that he was in fact writing it.

&quot;How the Marquis Got His Coat Back&quot; is a short story written by Neil Gaiman and set in the Neverwhere universe. It was published in &quot;Rogues&quot;, a short story anthology edited by Gardner Dozois and George RR Martin. Audible adapted it as an audio story as well.

* &quot;Undone&quot;, a radio series featuring a number of parallel universe versions of London between which the protagonists may pass by means of hidden &quot;gaps&quot;. It was described by one of its authors as &quot;a kind of comic &quot;Neverwhere&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="65307" wikidata="Q363" url="?curid=65307" title="World War III">
<text>World War III (WWIII or WW3), also known as the Third World War or World War 3, is a hypothetical future global conflict subsequent to World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945). It is widely assumed that such a war would involve all the great powers, like its predecessors, in addition to the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, thus surpassing all prior wars in geographic scope, devastation, and loss of life.

Since the Manhattan Project&#x27;s development of nuclear weapons in 1945 and their use by the United States in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, the risk of a nuclear apocalypse causing widespread destruction and the potential collapse of modern civilization or human extinction has been a common theme in speculation and fiction about World War III. With the start of the Cold War in 1947 and spread of nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union in 1949, which was followed by their acquisition by several other countries, the risk of a third world war rose. During the Cold War, the possibility was anticipated and planned for by military and civil personnel around the world, with scenarios ranging from conventional warfare to limited or total nuclear warfare. The strategic doctrine of mutually assured destruction, which held that a full-scale nuclear war would annihilate all parties to the conflict, became widely accepted. Nuclear close calls included the Korean War, Berlin Crisis of 1961, 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, 1973 Yom Kippur War, and Able Archer 83.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, various military conflicts, most notably the Russian invasion of Ukraine ongoing since 2022, as well as rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, have been perceived as potential flashpoints or triggers for a third world war.

==Etymology==

===&quot;Time&quot; magazine===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine was an early adopter, if not originator, of the term &quot;World WarIII&quot;. The first usage appears in its 3 November 1941 issue (preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941) under its &quot;National Affairs&quot; section and entitled &quot;World WarIII?&quot; about Nazi refugee Hermann Rauschning, who had just arrived in the United States. In its 22 March 1943, issue under its &quot;Foreign News&quot; section, &quot;Time&quot; reused the same title &quot;World WarIII?&quot; about statements by then-US Vice President Henry A. Wallace: &quot;We shall decide sometime in 1943 or 1944... whether to plant the seeds of World War III.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; continued to entitle with or mention in stories the term &quot;World WarIII&quot; for the rest of the decade and onwards: 1944, 1945, 1946 (&quot;bacterial warfare&quot;), 1947, and 1948. &quot;Time&quot; persists in using this term, for example, in a 2015 book review entitled &quot;This Is What World War III Will Look Like&quot;.

==Military plans==
Military strategists have used war games to prepare for various war scenarios and to determine the most appropriate strategies. War games were utilized for World War I and World War II.

===Operation Unthinkable===
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet Red Army forces deployed in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II and the unreliability of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, there was a serious threat to Western Europe. In April–May 1945, the British Armed Forces developed Operation Unthinkable, thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War. Its primary goal was &quot;to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire&quot;. The plan was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible.

===Operation Dropshot===
Operation Dropshot was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union in the Western European and Asian theaters. Although the scenario made use of nuclear weapons, they were not expected to play a decisive role.

At the time, the US nuclear arsenal was limited in size, based mostly in the United States, and depended on bombers for delivery. Dropshot included mission profiles that would have used 300 nuclear bombs and 29,000 high-explosive bombs on 200 targets in 100 cities and towns to wipe out 85% of the Soviet Union&#x27;s industrial potential in a single stroke. Between 75 and 100 of the 300 nuclear weapons were targeted to destroy Soviet combat aircraft on the ground.

The scenario was devised before the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. It was also devised before US President John F. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara changed the US Nuclear War plan from the &#x27;city killing&#x27; countervalue strike plan to a &quot;counterforce&quot; plan (targeted more at military forces). Nuclear weapons at this time were not accurate enough to hit a naval base without destroying the city adjacent to it, so the aim of using them was to destroy the enemy&#x27;s industrial capacity to cripple their war economy.

=== British-Irish cooperation ===
The Republic of Ireland started planning for a possible nuclear war in the late 1940s. Co-operation between the United Kingdom and Ireland would be formed in the event of WWIII, where they would share weather data, control aids to navigation, and coordinate the Wartime Broadcasting Service that would occur after a nuclear attack. Operation Sandstone in Ireland was a top-secret British-Irish military operation. The armed forces from both states began a coastal survey of Britain and Ireland cooperating from 1948 to 1955. This was a request from the United States to identify suitable landing grounds for the US in the event of a successful Soviet invasion. By 1953, the co-operation agreed upon sharing information on wartime weather and the evacuation of civilian refugees from Britain to Ireland. Ireland&#x27;s Operation Sandstone ended in 1966.

===Exercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace===
In January 1950, the North Atlantic Council approved NATO&#x27;s military strategy of containment. NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the Korean War in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a &quot;force under a centralized command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defense of Western Europe&quot;. Allied Command Europe was established under General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. Army, on 2 April 1951. The Western Union Defence Organization had previously carried out Exercise Verity, a 1949 multilateral exercise involving naval air strikes and submarine attacks.

Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defense of Denmark and Norway from the Soviet attack in 1952. It was the first major NATO exercise. The exercise was jointly commanded by Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, United States Navy, and Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Matthew B. Ridgeway, U.S. Army, during the autumn of 1952.

The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Netherlands, and Belgium participated.

Exercises Grand Slam and Longstep were naval exercises held in the Mediterranean Sea during 1952 to practice dislodging an enemy occupying force and amphibious assault. It involved over 170 warships and 700 aircraft under the overall command of Admiral Robert B. Carney. The overall exercise commander, Carney summarized the accomplishments of Exercise Grand Slam by stating: &quot;We have demonstrated that the senior commanders of all four powers can successfully take charge of a mixed task force and handle it effectively as a working unit.&quot;

The Soviet Union called the exercises &quot;war-like acts&quot; by NATO, with particular reference to the participation of Norway and Denmark and prepared for its military maneuvers in the Soviet Zone.

===Exercise Strikeback===
Exercise Strikeback was a major NATO naval exercise held in 1957, simulating a response to an all-out Soviet attack on NATO. The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the United States Navy, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, Exercise Strikeback was characterized by military analyst Hanson W. Baldwin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World WarII&quot;.

===Exercise Reforger===

Exercise Reforger (from the REturn of FORces to GERmany) was an annual exercise conducted during the Cold War by NATO. While US troops could be easily flown across the Atlantic, the heavy equipment and armor reinforcements would have to come by sea and be delivered to POMCUS (Pre-positioned Overseas Material Configured to Unit Sets) sites. These exercises tested the United States and allied abilities to carry out transcontinental reinforcement. Timely reinforcement was a critical part of the NATO reinforcement exercises. The United States needed to be able to send active-duty army divisions to Europe within ten days as part of a wartime NATO general deployment. In addition to assessing the capabilities of the United States, Reforger also monitored the personnel, facilities, and equipment of the European countries playing a significant role in the reinforcement effort. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO could quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, and especially in tanks and armoured vehicles. Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces defending against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced.

Reforger was not merely a show of force. In the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as Operation Reforger. The political goals of Reforger were to promote extended deterrence and foster NATO cohesion. Important components in Reforger included the Military Airlift Command, the Military Sealift Command, and the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.

===Seven Days to the River Rhine===

Seven Days to the River Rhine was a top-secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact. It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the Vistula river valley in a first-strike scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties. In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day. Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges and that large numbers of troops would die of radiation sickness. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit to get them to withhold the use of their nuclear weapons.

===Exercise Able Archer===

Exercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the U.S. European Command that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on the transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.

&quot;Able Archer 83&quot; was a five-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) command post exercise starting on 7 November 1983, that spanned Western Europe, centered on the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) Headquarters in Casteau, north of the city of Mons. Able Archer&#x27;s exercises simulated a period of conflict escalation, culminating in a coordinated nuclear attack.

The realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with deteriorating relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of strategic Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a ruse of war, obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear first strike. In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in East Germany and Poland on alert.

This &quot;1983 war scare&quot; is considered by many historians to be the closest the world has come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The threat of nuclear war ended with the conclusion of the exercise on 11 November.

===Strategic Defense Initiative===
The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by US President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983. In the latter part of his presidency, numerous factors (which included watching the 1983 movie &quot;The Day After&quot; and hearing through a Soviet defector that Able Archer 83 almost triggered a Russian first strike) had turned Reagan against the concept of winnable nuclear war, and he began to see nuclear weapons as more of a &quot;wild card&quot; than a strategic deterrent. Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike. However, the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since a unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.

The SDI concept was to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.

===NATO nuclear sharing===

NATO operational plans for a Third World War have involved NATO allies who do not have their nuclear weapons, using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan, under the direction of NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander.

Of the three nuclear powers in NATO (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States), only the United States has provided weapons for nuclear sharing. , Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are still hosting US nuclear weapons as part of NATO&#x27;s nuclear sharing policy. Canada hosted weapons until 1984, and Greece until 2001. The United Kingdom also received US tactical nuclear weapons such as nuclear artillery and Lance missiles until 1992, despite the UK being a nuclear weapons state in its own right; these were mainly deployed in Germany.

In peacetime, the nuclear weapons stored in non-nuclear countries are guarded by US airmen though previously some artillery and missile systems were guarded by US Army soldiers; the codes required for detonating them are under American control. In case of war, the weapons are to be mounted on the participating countries&#x27; warplanes. The weapons are under custody and control of USAF Munitions Support Squadrons co-located on NATO main operating bases that work together with the host nation forces.

 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs of the 480 US nuclear weapons believed to be deployed in Europe fall under the nuclear sharing arrangement. The weapons are stored within a vault in hardened aircraft shelters, using the USAF WS3 Weapon Storage and Security System. The delivery warplanes used are F-16 Fighting Falcons and Panavia Tornados.

==Historical close calls==

With the initiation of the Cold War arms race in the 1950s, an apocalyptic war between the United States and the Soviet Union became a real possibility. During the Cold War era (1947–1991), several military events have been described as having come close to potentially triggering World WarIII. Even after the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some incidents afterward have been described as close calls as well.

=== Korean War: 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953 ===
The Korean War was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the Korean Peninsula: a communist coalition including North Korea, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States and the United Nations Command. Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the U.S., the U.S.S.R., and China. CBS News war correspondent Bill Downs wrote in 1951, &quot;To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World WarIII. The brilliant landings at Inchon and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea. But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world.&quot; Downs afterwards repeated this belief on &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; while reporting on the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident in 1968. Secretary of State Dean Acheson later acknowledged that the Truman administration was concerned about the escalation of the conflict and that General Douglas MacArthur warned him that a U.S.-led intervention risked a Soviet response.

=== Berlin Crisis: 4 June – 9 November 1961 ===

The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was a political-military confrontation between the armed forces of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. at Checkpoint Charlie with both several American and Soviet/East German tanks and troops at the stand-off at each other only 100 yards on either side of the checkpoint. The reason behind the confrontation was the occupational status of the German capital city, Berlin, and of post–World War II Germany. The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin. The crisis culminated in the city&#x27;s de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall. This stand-off ended peacefully on 28 October following a U.S.–Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks and reduce tensions.

=== Cuban Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962 ===

The Cuban Missile Crisis, a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a third World War. The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day:

* The most critical incident occurred when a Soviet submarine nearly launched a nuclear-tipped torpedo in response to having been targeted by American naval depth charges in international waters, with the Soviet nuclear launch response only having been prevented by Soviet Navy executive officer Vasily Arkhipov.
* The shooting down of a Lockheed U-2 spy plane piloted by Rudolf Anderson while violating Cuban airspace.
* The near interception of another U-2 that had strayed into Soviet airspace over Siberia, which airspace violation nearly caused the Soviets to believe that this might be the vanguard of a US aerial bombardment.

Despite what many believe to be the closest the world has come to a nuclear conflict, throughout the entire standoff, the Doomsday Clock, which is run by the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; to estimate how close the end of the world, or doomsday, is, with midnight being the apocalypse, stayed at a relatively stable seven minutes to midnight. This has been explained as being due to the brevity of the crisis since the clock monitored more long-term factors such as the leadership of countries, conflicts, wars, and political upheavals, as well as societies&#x27; reactions to said factors.

The &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; now credits the political developments resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis with having enhanced global stability. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; posits that future crises and occasions that might otherwise escalate, were rendered more stable due to two major factors: 
# A Washington to Moscow hotline resulted from the communication trouble between the White House and the Kremlin during the crisis. This gave the leaders of the two largest nuclear powers the ability to contact each other in real-time, vital when seconds could potentially prevent a nuclear exchange.
# The second factor was caused in part due to the worldwide reaction to how close the US and USSR had come to the brink of World WarIII during the standoff. As the public began to more closely monitor topics involving nuclear weapons, and therefore to rally support for the cause of non-proliferation, the 1963 test ban treaty was signed. To date this treaty has been signed by 126 total nations, with the most notable exceptions being France and China. Both of these countries were still in the relative beginning stages of their nuclear programs at the time of the original treaty signing, and both sought nuclear capabilities independent of their allies. This Test Ban Treaty prevented the testing of nuclear ordnance that detonated in the atmosphere, limiting nuclear weapons testing to below ground and underwater, decreasing fallout and effects on the environment, and subsequently caused the Doomsday Clock to decrease by five minutes, to arrive at a total of twelve minutes to midnight. Up until this point, over 1000 nuclear bombs had been detonated, and concerns over both long and short term effects to the planet became increasingly more worrisome to scientists.

=== Sino-Soviet border conflicts: 2 March – 11 September 1969 ===

The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military border war between the Soviet Union and China at the height of the Sino-Soviet split in 1969. The most serious of these border clashes, which brought the world&#x27;s two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 in the vicinity of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria.

The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, with a return to the status quo. Critics point out that the Chinese attack on Zhenbao was to deter any potential future Soviet invasions; that by killing some Soviets, China demonstrated that it could not be &#x27;bullied&#x27;; and that Mao wanted to teach them &#x27;a bitter lesson&#x27;.

China&#x27;s relations with the USSR remained sour after the conflict, despite the border talks, which began in 1969 and continued inconclusively for a decade. Domestically, the threat of war caused by the border clashes inaugurated a new stage in the Cultural Revolution; that of China&#x27;s thorough militarization. The 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held in the aftermath of the Zhenbao Island incident, confirmed Defense Minister Lin Biao as Mao Zedong&#x27;s heir apparent.

Following the events of 1969, the Soviet Union further increased its forces along the Sino-Soviet border, and in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

=== Yom Kippur War superpower tensions: 6–25 October 1973 ===
The Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with a surprise invasion of Israeli-occupied territories by a coalition of Arab states, aided by the Soviet Union. Israel successfully counterattacked with the aid of the US. Tensions grew between the two superpowers: American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other in the Mediterranean Sea. Admiral Daniel J. Murphy of the US Sixth Fleet reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent. The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4to3. The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under UNSC 339.

=== NORAD computer error of 1979: 9 November 1979 ===
The United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD systems indicated that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched. No attempt was made to use the Moscow–Washington hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors. A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic. A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes.

=== Soviet radar malfunction: 26 September 1983 ===
A false alarm occurred on the Soviet nuclear early warning system, showing the launch of American LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles from bases in the United States. A retaliatory attack was prevented by Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet Air Defence Forces officer, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations).

=== Able Archer 83 escalations: 2–11 November 1983 ===
During Able Archer 83, a ten-day NATO exercise simulating a period of conflict escalation that culminated in a DEFCON 1 nuclear strike, some members of the Soviet Politburo and armed forces treated the events as a ruse of war concealing a genuine first strike. In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the Warsaw Pact states of East Germany and Poland under high alert. However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises.

=== Norwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995 ===
The Norwegian rocket incident was the first World WarIII close call to occur after the Cold War had ended. This incident occurred when Russia&#x27;s Olenegorsk early warning station accidentally mistook the radar signature from a Black Brant XII research rocket (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from Andøya Rocket Range), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a Trident SLBM missile. In response, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was summoned and the &quot;Cheget&quot; nuclear briefcase was activated for the first and only time. However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation. It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians.

===Incident at Pristina airport: 12 June 1999===
On 12 June 1999, the day following the end of the Kosovo War, some 250 Russian peacekeepers occupied the Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO troops and were to secure the arrival of reinforcements by air. American NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Wesley Clark ordered the use of force against the Russians. Mike Jackson, a British Army general who contacted the Russians during the incident, refused to enforce Clark&#x27;s orders, famously telling him &quot;I&#x27;m not going to start the Third World War for you&quot;. Captain James Blunt, the lead officer at the front of the NATO column in the direct armed stand-off against the Russians, received the &quot;Destroy!&quot; orders from Clark over the radio, but he followed Jackson&#x27;s orders to encircle the airfield instead and later said in an interview that even without Jackson&#x27;s intervention he would have refused to follow Clark&#x27;s order.

===Shootdown of Sukhoi bomber: 24 November 2015===
On 24 November 2015, at the border between Turkey and Syria, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Sukhoi attack aircraft. The Turks claimed that the aircraft violated Turkish airspace, a claim denied by the Russians; the plane was in the region as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, in which Turkey supported opposing forces. The incident was the first destruction of a Russian or Soviet Air Forces warplane by a NATO member state since the attack on the Sui-ho Dam during the Korean War in 1953. The incident led to numerous media and individuals commenting that it could have sparked and escalated into a world war.

== Current potential flashpoints ==
===Russian invasion of Ukraine: 24 February 2022 – present===

On 24 February 2022, Russia&#x27;s president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014. The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War II. Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, while others have suggested the contrary.

Because of the invasion, at least fifty countries have provided some kind of military aid to Ukraine, including all member states of NATO. The Russian government has threatened retaliation against countries supplying military aid to Ukraine, and said it meant NATO was waging a &quot;proxy war&quot; against Russia. Senior Russian politicians—including president Putin, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and United Russia party leader Dmitry Medvedev—have made statements widely seen as nuclear blackmail. They have implied that Russia may use nuclear weapons if certain &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed, such as helping Ukraine to strike back at mainland Russia. Officials from the United States and NATO, including US president Joe Biden and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, have stressed the need to prevent the conflict escalating into a third world war, while also affirming that NATO members will defend each other. The US warned Russia&#x27;s government that the country would suffer &quot;catastrophic&quot; consequences if it used nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Former CIA Director, David Petraeus, said NATO would likely respond by destroying all Russian forces in Ukraine. Several incidents have risked a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, such as Russian breaches of NATO airspace and a missile explosion in Poland. In early 2023, Putin suspended Russia&#x27;s participation in New START, the last remaining nuclear treaty between Russia and the US, and announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.

Russian threats have been described as a way to intimidate Western countries, to deter them from helping Ukraine. Fearing escalation, NATO countries held back from sending advanced weapons to Ukraine, and forbade Ukraine to fire NATO weapons into Russia. Since July 2024, they have allowed Ukraine to use NATO weapons to strike military targets in Russia, but only near the border in self-defense. Russia&#x27;s government has not followed through on its threats against NATO and has not used nuclear weapons, despite most of its &quot;red lines&quot; being crossed.

Iran and North Korea have provided weapons and ammunition to Russia during the invasion, including ballistic missiles. In 2024, Russia and North Korea signed a defense pact, and that November, Russia further escalated the conflict by deploying 10,000 North Korean troops on its border to fight Ukraine. In November 2024, Putin said that the war &quot;has acquired elements of a global character&quot;, adding that Russia was entitled to strike military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against mainland Russia.

==Extended usage of the term ==
===Cold War===

As Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post-World WarII period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World WarIII was ever-present. A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World WarIII to have already started.

In 2004, commentator Norman Podhoretz proposed that the Cold War, lasting from the surrender of the Axis powers until the fall of the Berlin Wall, might rightly be called World WarIII. By Podhoretz&#x27;s reckoning, &quot;World WarIV&quot; would be the global campaign against Islamofascism.

Still, the majority of historians would seem to hold that World WarIII would necessarily have to be a worldwide &quot;war in which large forces from many countries fought&quot; and a war that &quot;involves most of the principal nations of the world&quot;. The Cold War received its name from the lack of action taken from both sides. The lack of action was out of fear that a nuclear war would possibly destroy humanity. In his book &quot;Secret Weapons of the Cold War&quot;, Bill Yenne concludes that the military Superpower standoff from the 1940s through to 1991, was not World WarIII.

===War on terror===

The &quot;war on terror&quot; that began with the September 11 attacks has been claimed by some to be World War III or sometimes World War IV (assuming the Cold War was World War III). Others have disparaged such claims as &quot;distorting American history&quot;. While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a &quot;World War&quot; might now no longer require such worldwide and large-scale aggression and carnage. Still, such claims of a new &quot;lower threshold of aggression&quot;, that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a &quot;World War&quot; have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians.

====War on the Islamic State====
On 1 February 2015, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari declared that the war against the Islamic State was effectively &quot;World WarIII&quot;, due to the Islamic State&#x27;s aims for a worldwide caliphate, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the Levant region. In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, King of Jordan Abdullah II stated &quot;We are facing a Third World War [within Islam]&quot;.

In his State of the Union Address on 12 January 2016, US President Barack Obama warned that news reports granting ISIL the supposed ability to foment a third World War might be excessive and irresponsible, stating that &quot;as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World WarIII just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.&quot;

===Multiple small wars as a &quot;third war&quot;===
In multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World WarI andII to the ongoing lower-intensity wars of the 21st century, Pope Francis has said, &quot;The world is at war because it has lost the peace&quot;, and &quot;perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal&quot;.

==Hypothetical scenarios==
In 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of World War II, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible World War III would be so catastrophic upon human civilization so as to revert mankind to the Stone Age. When asked by journalist Alfred Werner what types of weapons Einstein believed World WarIII might be fought with, Einstein warned, &quot;I know not with what weapons World WarIII will be fought, but World WarIV will be fought with sticks and stones&quot;.

As for the extermination of the human race as a consequence of atomic war, Leslie A. White challenged Einstein, &quot;this too may be admitted as possibility, and all we can say is that if it is to come, it will come. Extravagant expressions of horror will not alter the course of events.&quot; Crane Brinton also doubted the psychological pacification of Einstein: &quot;Teachers, preachers, educators, even politicians are telling the growing generation that there must be no war and, therefore, there will be no war. I have doubts as to whether this is wise teaching…&quot; In spite of the atomic bomb, there will be another general war and humanity will survive it, according to Brinton. James Burnham of the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the CIA), also believed in survival: The uniqueness of the atomic weapons is commonly found in that they can totally annihilate human life, including through climatic and geological chain reaction, but such is not the case. The great principles of military strategy stand unaltered. An atomic war will look different from older wars but it will be decided by the same combination of resources, morale and strategy.

A 1998 &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; overview found that &quot;Although many people believe that the threat of a nuclear attack largely disappeared with the end of the Cold War, there is considerable evidence to the contrary&quot;. In particular, the United States–Russia mutual detargeting agreement in 1994 was largely symbolic and did not change the amount of time required to launch an attack. The most likely &quot;accidental-attack&quot; scenario was believed to be a retaliatory launch due to a false warning, similar to the 1983 incident. Historically, World War I happened through an escalating crisis; World War II happened through deliberate action. Hypothesized flashpoints in the 2010s and the 2020s include the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chinese expansion into adjacent islands and seas, Sino-Indian border dispute, Chinese threats of military operation against Taiwan, Indo-Pakistani wars border conflicts, and foreign involvement in the Syrian civil war. Other hypothesized risks are that a war involving or between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Israel and Iran, United States and Iran, India and Pakistan, Ukraine and Russia, Poland and Belarus, South Korea and North Korea, or Taiwan and China could escalate via alliances or intervention into a war between &quot;great powers&quot; such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, India, Japan or an all out war between military alliances NATO and CSTO, or even the possibility of a &quot;rogue commander&quot; under any nuclear power might launch an unauthorized strike that escalates into a full-blown war.

According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, releasing over 150 Tg of stratospheric soot, could indirectly kill more than five billion people by starvation during a nuclear winter. More than two billion people could die of starvation from a smaller-scale (5–47 Tg) nuclear war between India and Pakistan. In the event of a nuclear war between Russia and the United States, 99% of the population in the belligerent countries, as well as Europe and China, would die.

Some scenarios involve risks due to upcoming changes from the known status quo. In the 1980s the Strategic Defense Initiative made an effort at nullifying the USSR&#x27;s nuclear arsenal; some analysts believe the initiative was &quot;destabilizing&quot;. In his book &quot;Destined for War&quot;, Graham Allison views the global rivalry between the established power, the US, and the rising power, China, as an example of the Thucydides Trap. Allison states that historically, &quot;12 of 16 past cases where a rising power has confronted a ruling power&quot; have led to fighting. In 2020 and 2023, the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; advanced its Doomsday Clock, citing among other factors a predicted destabilizing effect from upcoming hypersonic weapons.

Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, could hypothetically generate risk in the decades ahead. A 2018 RAND Corporation report has argued that AI and associated information technology &quot;will have a large effect on nuclear-security issues in the next quarter century&quot;. A hypothetical future AI could provide a destabilizing ability to track &quot;second-launch&quot; launchers. Incorporating AI into decision support systems used to decide whether to launch, could also generate new risks, including the risk of an adversarial exploitation of such an AI&#x27;s algorithms by a third party to trigger a launch recommendation. A perception that some sort of emerging technology would lead to &quot;world domination&quot; might also be destabilizing, for example by leading to fear of a pre-emptive strike.

Cyberwarfare is the exploitation of technology by a nation-state or international organization to attack and destroy the opposing nation&#x27;s information networks and computers. The damage can be caused by computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks (DoS). Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly common, threatening cybersecurity and making it a global priority. There has been a proliferation of state-sponsored attacks. The trends of these attacks suggest the potential of a cyber World War III. The world&#x27;s leading militaries are developing cyber strategies, including ways to alter the enemy&#x27;s command and control systems, early warning systems, logistics, and transportation. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns about a large-scale cyberattack, with Russia having previously launched cyberattacks to compromise organizations across Ukraine. Nearly 40 discrete attacks were launched by Russia which permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations, with 40% aimed at critical infrastructure sectors in Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s use of cyberwarfare has turned the war into a large-scale &quot;hybrid&quot; war in Ukraine.

<doc id="65308" wikidata="Q197949" url="?curid=65308" title="Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction">
<text>Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction are genres of speculative fiction in which the Earth&#x27;s (or another planet&#x27;s) civilization is collapsing or has collapsed. The apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; astronomical, an impact event; destructive, nuclear holocaust or resource depletion; medical, a pandemic, whether natural or human-caused; end time, such as the Last Judgment, Second Coming or Ragnarök; or any other scenario in which the outcome is apocalyptic, such as a zombie apocalypse, AI takeover, technological singularity, dysgenics or alien invasion.

The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or it may be post-apocalyptic, set after the event. The time may be directly after the catastrophe, focusing on the psychology of survivors, the way to keep the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been mythologized. Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain.

Numerous ancient societies, including the Babylonian and Judaic, produced apocalyptic literature and mythology which dealt with the end of the world and human society, such as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, written c. 2000–1500 BCE. Recognizable modern apocalyptic novels had existed since at least the first third of the 19th century, when Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1826) was published; however, this form of literature gained widespread popularity after World War II, when the possibility of global annihilation by nuclear weapons entered the public consciousness.

==Themes==

The apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; natural, such as an impact event; man made, such as nuclear holocaust; medical, such as a plague or virus, whether natural or man-made; religious, such as the Rapture or Great Tribulation; or imaginative, such as zombie apocalypse or alien invasion. The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or may be post-apocalyptic and set after the event. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain.

Other themes may be cybernetic revolt, divine judgment, dysgenics, ecological collapse, pandemic, resource depletion, supernatural phenomena, technological singularity, or some other general disaster.

The relics of a technological past &quot;protruding into a more primitive... landscape&quot;, a theme known as the &quot;ruined Earth&quot;, have been described as &quot;among the most potent of [science fiction]&#x27;s icons&quot;.

==Ancient predecessors==
Ancient Mesopotamian texts containing the oldest surviving apocalyptic literature, including the Eridu Genesis and the Epic of Gilgamesh, both of which date to around 2000-1500 BCE. Both describe angry gods sending floods to punish humanity, and the Gilgamesh version includes the ancient hero Utnapishtim and his family being saved through the intervention of the god Ea.

The Biblical myth of Noah and his ark describes the destruction of the corrupt original civilization and its replacement with a remade world. Noah is assigned the task to build the ark and save two of each animal species in order to reestablish a new post-flood world.

The Biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah also has post-apocalyptic elements. The daughters of Lot, who mistakenly believe that the destruction had engulfed the whole world and that they and their father were the only surviving human beings, conclude that in such a situation it would be justified - and indeed vitally needed - to have sex with their father in order to ensure the survival of humanity. Such situations and dilemmas occur in modern post-apocalyptic fiction.

A similar story to the Genesis flood narrative is found in the 71st Chapter of the Quran; however, unlike the Biblical story, the Quranic account explicitly claims that the deluge was only sent to the tribe of the Prophet Nūḥ () ( in Arabic), and therefore, the deluge did not engulf the entire world.

In the Hindu Dharmasastra, an apocalyptic deluge plays a prominent part. According to the Matsya Purana, the Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu, informed the King Manu of an all-destructive deluge which would be coming very soon. The King was advised to build a huge boat (ark) which housed his family, nine types of seeds, pairs of all animals and the Saptarishis to repopulate Earth, after the deluge would end and the oceans and seas would recede. At the time of the deluge, Vishnu appeared as a horned fish and Shesha appeared as a rope, with which Vaivasvata Manu fastened the boat to the horn of the fish. Variants of this story also appear in Buddhist and Jain scriptures.

The 1st centuries CE saw the recording of the Book of Revelation (from which the word &quot;apocalypse&quot; originated, meaning &quot;revelation&quot; in ancient Greek), which is filled with prophecies of destruction, as well as luminous visions. In the first chapter of Revelation, the writer St. John the Divine explains his divine errand: &quot;Write the things which thou hast seen, the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter&quot; (Rev. 1:19). He takes it as his mission to convey—to reveal—to God&#x27;s kingdom His promise that justice will prevail and that the suffering will be vindicated (Leigh). The apocalyptist provides a beatific vision of Judgement Day, revealing God&#x27;s promise for redemption from suffering and strife. Revelation describes a new Heaven and a new Earth, and its intended Christian audience is often enchanted and inspired, rather than terrified by visions of Judgment Day. These Christians believed themselves chosen for God&#x27;s salvation, and so such apocalyptic sensibilities inspired optimism and nostalgia for the end times.

The Norse poem &quot;Völuspá&quot; from the Poetic Edda details the creation, coming doom, and rebirth of the world. The world&#x27;s destruction includes fire and flood consuming the earth while mythic beasts do battle with the Aesir gods, during which they all perish in an event called Ragnarök. After the destruction, a pair of humans, a man and woman, find the world renewed and the god Baldr resurrected.

==In society==

Such works often feature the loss of a global perspective as protagonists are on their own, often with little or no knowledge of the outside world. Furthermore, they often explore a world without modern technology whose rapid progress may overwhelm people as human brains are not adapted to contemporary society, but evolved to deal with issues that have become largely irrelevant, such as immediate physical threats. Such works depict worlds of less complexity, direct contact, and primitive needs. It is often the concept of change as much as the concept of destruction that causes public interest in apocalyptic themes.

Such fiction is studied by social sciences, and may provide insights into a culture&#x27;s fears, as well as things like the role imagined for public administration.

Since the late 20th century, a surge of popular post-apocalyptic films can be observed.
Christopher Schmidt notes that, while the world &quot;goes to waste&quot; for future generations, we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment. Some have commented on this trend, saying that &quot;it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism&quot;.

==Pre-1900 works==
Lord Byron&#x27;s 1816 poem &quot;Darkness&quot;, included in &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot; collection, on the apocalyptic end of the world and one man&#x27;s survival, was one of the earliest English-language works in this genre. The sun was blotted out, leading to darkness and cold which kills off mankind through famine and ice-age conditions. The poem was influential in the emergence of &quot;the last man&quot; theme which appeared in the works of several poets, such as &quot;The Last Man&quot; by Thomas Campbell (1824) and &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1826) by Thomas Hood, as well as &quot;The Last Man&quot; by Thomas Lovell Beddoes. The year 1816 was known as the Year Without a Summer because Mount Tambora had erupted in the Dutch East Indies in 1815 that emitted sulphur into the atmosphere which lowered the temperature and altered weather patterns throughout the world. This was the source for Byron&#x27;s poem.

Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1826) is a continuation of the apocalyptic theme in fiction and is generally recognized as the first major fictional post-apocalyptic story. The plot follows a group of people as they struggle to survive in a plague-infected world. The story&#x27;s male protagonist struggles to keep his family safe but is inevitably left as the last man alive.

Shelley&#x27;s novel is predated by Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville&#x27;s French epic prose poem &quot;Le Dernier Homme&quot; (English: &quot;The Last Man&quot; [1805]), and this work is sometimes considered the first modern work to depict the end of the world. Published after his death in 1805, de Grainville&#x27;s work follows the character of Omegarus, the titular &quot;last man,&quot; in what is essentially a retelling of the Book of Revelation, combined with themes of the story of Adam and Eve. Unlike most apocalyptic tales, de Grainville&#x27;s novel approaches the end of the world not as a cautionary tale, or a tale of survival, but as both an inevitable, as well as necessary, step for the spiritual resurrection of mankind.

Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion&quot; (1839) follows the conversation between two souls in the afterlife as they discuss the destruction of the world. The destruction was brought about by a comet that removed nitrogen from Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; this left only oxygen and resulted in a worldwide inferno. Similarly, Giacomo Leopardi&#x27;s short dialogue &quot;Dialogue between a Goblin and a Gnome&quot; (1824) features a world without the presence of the human beings, most likely because they &quot;violate[d] the laws of nature, and [went] contrary to their welfare&quot;.

Richard Jefferies&#x27; novel &quot;After London&quot; (1885) can best be described as genuine post-apocalyptic fiction. After a sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature and the few survivors return to a quasi-medieval way of life. The first chapters consist solely of a description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The rest of the story is a straightforward adventure/quest set many years later in the wild landscape and society, but the opening chapters set an example for many later science fiction stories.

H.G. Wells wrote several novels that have a post-apocalyptic theme. &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895) has the unnamed protagonist traveling to the year 802,701 A.D. after civilization has collapsed and humanity has split into two distinct species, the elfin Eloi and the brutal Morlocks. Later in the story, the time traveler moves forward to a dying Earth beneath a swollen red sun. &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898) depicts an invasion of Earth by inhabitants of the planet Mars. The aliens systematically destroy Victorian England with advanced weaponry mounted on nearly indestructible vehicles. Due to the infamous radio adaptation of the novel by Orson Welles on his show, &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, the novel has become one of the best known early apocalyptic works. It has subsequently been reproduced or adapted several times in comic books, film, music, radio programming, television programming, and video games.

==Post-1900 works==
===Aliens===
&quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; is a 1953 science fiction novel by the British author Arthur C. Clarke, in which aliens come to Earth, human children develop fantastic powers and the planet is destroyed.

Argentine comic writer Héctor Germán Oesterheld&#x27;s comic series &quot;El Eternauta&quot; (1957 to 1959), an alien race only mentioned by the protagonists as &quot;Ellos&quot; (&quot;Them&quot;) invades the Earth starting with a deadly snowfall and then using other alien races to defeat the remaining humans.

In Alice Sheldon&#x27;s Nebula-winning novelette &quot;The Screwfly Solution&quot; (1977), aliens are wiping out humanity with an airborne agent that changes men&#x27;s sexual impulses to violent ones.

Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; series (1979–2009) is a humorous take on alien invasion stories. Multiple Earths are repeatedly &quot;demolished&quot; by the bureaucratic Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass, to the chagrin of the protagonist Arthur Dent.

In Gene Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Urth of the New Sun&quot; (1987), aliens (or highly evolved humans) introduce a white hole into the sun to counteract the dimming effect of a black hole, and the resulting global warming causes a sea-level rise that kills most of the population (though this may be redemptive, like Noah&#x27;s Flood, rather than a disaster).

In Greg Bear&#x27;s &quot;The Forge of God&quot; (1987), Earth is destroyed in an alien attack. Just prior to this, a different group of aliens is able to save samples of the biosphere and a small number of people, resettling them on Mars. Some of these form the crew of a ship to hunt down the homeworld of the killers, as described in the sequel, &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot; (1992).

Al Sarrantonio&#x27;s &quot;Moonbane&quot; (1989) concerns the origin of werewolves (he attributes it to the Moon, which is why they are so attracted to it), and an invasion after an explosion on Luna sends meteoric fragments containing latent lycanthropes to Earth, who thrive in our planet&#x27;s oxygen-rich atmosphere. &quot;Moonbane&quot;″s tone is reminiscent of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1897).

Charles R. Pellegrino and George Zebrowski&#x27;s novel &quot;The Killing Star&quot; (1995) describes a devastating attack on a late-21st-century Earth by an alien civilization. Using missiles traveling at relativistic speed, they are determined to destroy the human race in a preemptive strike, as they are considered, after watching several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; which shows human domination in space, a future threat.

In the video game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; (1995), the giant alien creature Lavos collides with the earth in prehistoric times, subsequently hibernating beneath the earth. As millions of years pass, the monster feeds on the energy of the earth, eventually surfacing in 1999 to wreak complete destruction of the human race, atmosphere, and general life on the planet in the form of a rain of destruction fired from its outer shell, known as the &quot;Day of Lavos&quot;.

In the video game &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), hostile alien creatures arrive on Earth through a portal after a scientific experiment goes wrong. In its sequel, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), it is revealed to the player the creatures encountered in the first game are merely the slaves of a much more powerful alien race, the Combine, who have taken over the Earth to drain its resources after subduing the entirety of Earth&#x27;s governments and military forces in only seven hours.

In the 2000 Don Bluth animated film &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, Earth has been destroyed by the Drej, due to a human experimental discovery called Project Titan, which made them fear “what humanity will become”.

The 2011 TV series &quot;Falling Skies&quot;, by Robert Rodat and Steven Spielberg, follows a human resistance force fighting to survive after extraterrestrial aliens attempt to take over Earth by disabling most of the world&#x27;s technology and destroying its armed forces in a surprise attack. It is implied that the attacking aliens are in reality former victims of an attack on their own planet and are now the slaves of an unseen controller race.

The television series &quot;Defiance&quot; (2013–2015) is set in an Earth devastated by the &quot;Pale Wars&quot;, a war with seven alien races referred to as the &quot;Votan&quot;, followed by the &quot;Arkfalls&quot;, which terraforms Earth to an almost unrecognizable state. Unlike most apocalyptic works, in this one Earth is not inhospitable, and humanity is not on the verge of extinction.

&quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; is a 2013 British-American comic science fiction film directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike. The film follows a group of friends who discover an alien invasion during a pub crawl in their hometown.

In the 2018 horror film &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, the 2021 sequel &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot;, and a 2024 movie &quot;A Quiet Place: Day One&quot; society has collapsed in the wake of lethal attacks by extraterrestrial creatures who, having no eyesight, hunt humans and other creatures with their highly sensitive hearing; the scattered survivors live most of their lives in near-silence as a result.

===Astronomical===

In Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer&#x27;s novel &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1933), Earth is destroyed by the rogue planet Bronson Alpha. A selected few escape on a spaceship. In the sequel, &quot;After Worlds Collide&quot; (1934), the survivors start a new life on the planet&#x27;s companion Bronson Beta, which has taken over the orbit formerly occupied by Earth.

In J. T. McIntosh&#x27;s novel &quot;One in Three Hundred&quot; (1954), scientists have discovered how to pinpoint the exact minute, hour, and day the Sun will go &quot;nova&quot; – and when it does, it will boil away Earth&#x27;s seas, beginning with the hemisphere that faces the sun, and as Earth continues to rotate, it will take only 24 hours before all life is eradicated. Super-hurricanes and tornadoes are predicted. Buildings will be blown away. A race is on to build thousands of spaceships for the sole purpose of transferring evacuees on a one-way trip to Mars. When the Sun begins to go nova, everything is on schedule, but most of the spaceships turn out to be defective, and fail en route to Mars.

In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Seveneves&quot;, The Moon is destroyed by an unknown agent, forming a massive debris cloud. This cloud threatens to produce a White Sky, which then causes a massive bombardment of Moon fragments. Due to this, a multinational effort is put in place to construct an ark for the preservation of Humanity, built around the International Space Station.

Brian Aldiss&#x27; novel &quot;Hothouse&quot; (1961) occurs in a distant future where the Sun is much hotter and stronger, and the human population has been reduced to a fifth of what it had been.

J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Drowned World&quot; (1962) occurs after a rise in solar radiation that causes worldwide flooding and accelerated mutation of plants and animals.

Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven&#x27;s novel, &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; (1977), is about a cataclysmic comet hitting Earth and various groups of people struggling to survive the aftermath in southern California.

Hollywood—which previously had explored the idea of the Earth and its population being potentially endangered by a collision with another heavenly body with the &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1951), a film treatment of the aforementioned 1933 novel – revisited the theme in the late 1990s with a trio of similarly themed projects. &quot;Asteroid&quot; (1997) is an NBC-TV miniseries about the U.S. government trying to prevent an asteroid from colliding with the Earth. The following year saw dueling big-budget summer blockbuster movies &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998) and &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), both of which involved efforts to save the Earth from, respectively, a rogue comet and an asteroid, by landing crews upon them to detonate nuclear weapons there in hopes of destroying them.

Characters in the six-part ITV television drama serial &quot;The Last Train&quot; (1999) awaken from a cryogenic sleep after an asteroid the size of Birmingham strikes Africa, causing a worldwide apocalypse.

K. A. Applegate&#x27;s 2001–2003 book series, &quot;Remnants&quot;, details the end of the world by asteroid collision. The first book, &quot;The Mayflower Project&quot; (2001), describes Earth in a sort of hysteria as 80 people are chosen by NASA to board a spacecraft that will go to an unknown destination away from the destroyed Earth. The later books deal with the few survivors waking up from a 500-year hibernation and succumbing to both strange mutations and the will of a strange alien computer/spaceship that they land on. Eventually they return to Earth to find a couple colonies of survivors struggling on a harsh planet completely different from the Earth the Remnants knew.

&quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), the middle entry of filmmaker Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;depression trilogy&quot;, ends with humanity completely wiped out by a collision with a rogue planet. The depressed protagonist reverses roles with her relatives as the crisis unfolds, as she turns out to be the only family member capable of calmly accepting the imminent impact event.

In id Software&#x27;s video game &quot;Rage&quot; (2011), Earth is heavily damaged, and humanity nearly wiped out, by the direct collision of the real asteroid 99942 Apophis with the Earth in the year 2029.

Marly Youmans&#x27; epic poem &quot;Thaliad&quot; (2012) tells the story of a group of children after an unspecified apocalypse from the sky, perhaps connected with solar flares or meteor impact, resulting in people and animals having been burned and the skies having filled with ash. The children survive only because they were together on a school visit to a cave.

In the obscure 2013 Australian film &quot;These Final Hours&quot;, a massive asteroid hits the Atlantic Ocean dooming all life. The film follows James, who decides to head to the &#x27;party-to-end-all-parties&#x27; and there spend the last 12 hours before the global firestorm reaches Western Australia.

In the 2020 film &quot;Greenland&quot;, a massive comet, Clarke, is set on a collision course with Earth, with only a few people permitted into a massive complex of bunkers in Greenland. The film follows the Garrity family&#x27;s attempts to reach these safe havens after they were unable to board the transport aircraft to the bunkers. Clarke collides with Earth, leaving the planet devastated; however, there are survivors throughout the world, implying that Humanity can still survive. A sequel is now in development called &quot;.&quot;

===Cozy catastrophe===
The &quot;cozy catastrophe&quot; is not an intentional style of post-apocalyptic science fiction, but rather a criticism of certain apocalyptic works considered as not believably harsh enough for the critic&#x27;s stated preferences.

Stories subject to this criticism generally involve some sort of catastrophe wherein civilization comes to an end with mass deaths, but the main characters survive relatively unscathed and are freed from the constraints of vulgar civilization in their hideaway, perhaps finding a kind of quiet happiness in the changed world.

The term was coined by Brian Aldiss in &quot;Billion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction&quot; (1973). Aldiss was directing his remarks mainly at novels of English author John Wyndham such as &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; (1953), but especially his novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1951), whose protagonists did not suffer enough associated hardship from the collapse of society for Aldiss&#x27;s taste, as well as other British books in the era following the Second World War.

The genre has been defended though as being a valid take on more low-key catastrophes of an ecological sort, and other books have been questioned if they qualify at all - Margaret Atwood defended &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; as not as &quot;cozy&quot; as alleged, for example.

===Environmental disaster===

&quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; (1901) by M. P. Shiel is a novel in which most of humanity has been killed by a poisonous cloud issuing from volcanic eruptions.

In Alfred Walter Stewart&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Nordenholt&#x27;s Million&quot;, an engineered strain of bacteria denitrifies almost all plants, causing a collapse of food supply. The plutocrat of the title establishes a haven in central Scotland for a chosen group of survivors, while deliberately wrecking all alternative refuges.

In Alfred Bester&#x27;s story &quot;Adam and No Eve&quot; (1941), an inventor takes off in a rocket whose propulsion uses a dangerous catalyst. From outer space he sees that the entire world has been destroyed by fire in a runaway reaction caused by the catalyst. Fatally injured in a crash landing, he crawls to the sea so that the bacteria in his body can initiate new life on Earth.

In John Christopher&#x27;s novel &quot;The Death of Grass&quot; (1956), a mutated virus kills cereal crops and other grasses throughout Eurasia, causing famine.

Kurt Vonnegut &#x27;s novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963) ends with all the bodies of water turning into &quot;ice-nine&quot;, a fictional phase of ice that forms at room temperature.

In J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Burning World&quot; (1964, expanded into &quot;The Drought&quot; in 1965), pollution in the oceans creates a surface layer that resists evaporation, bringing about a worldwide drought.

John Brunner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sheep Look Up&quot; (1972) describes an environmentally-degraded world rapidly collapsing into social chaos, revolution, and anarchy.

Richard Cowper&#x27;s three-volume novel &quot;The White Bird of Kinship&quot; (1978–82) envisions a future in which anthropogenic global warming has led to a catastrophic rise in sea level. Most of it takes place two millennia later.

Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s novel &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; (1985) takes place long after worldwide disasters—apparently largely environmental though nuclear war may also be involved—have drastically reduced the population. It paints an admiring picture of a primitive society that will not repeat the mistakes of civilization. It won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize and was a runner-up for a National Book Award.

Chuck Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Chuck Dixon&quot; comic has the anti-hero Scully and Rah-Rah the badger team up with teenage Wynn to take on a world fallen to winter. Continued in La Nina, Frozen Fleet, and the book Chuck Dixon

Palladium Books&#x27; &quot;Rifts&quot; roleplaying game (1990) features an apocalypse caused by various natural disasters including the eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano which releases a large amount of magical energy that is amplified by deaths of millions occurring during a solstice, at midnight, during a planetary alignment, creating the titular rifts that bring forth various beings and monstrosities from throughout the Megaverse.

In Octavia Butler&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot;, climate change and corporatism are the human-caused reasons for societal collapse.

In the film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004), based on Whitley Strieber&#x27;s speculative non-fiction novel &quot;The Coming Global Superstorm&quot; (1999), extreme weather events caused by climate change invoke mass destruction across the planet, and eventually result in a new ice age.

The video game &quot;The Long Dark&quot; (2017) depicts survival in the wilderness of northern Canada during winter after a geomagnetic disaster has disabled all modern technology.

The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (2002) features a world where a magic flood destroyed all settlements that were not located on mountain peaks.

===Failure of modern technology===

In E. M. Forster&#x27;s novelette &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; (1909), humanity has been forced underground due to inhospitable conditions on Earth&#x27;s surface, and is entirely dependent on &quot;the machine,&quot; a god-like mechanical entity which has supplanted almost all free will by providing for humankind&#x27;s every whim. The machine deteriorates and eventually stops, ending the lives of all those dependent upon it, though one of the dying alludes to a group of humans dwelling on the surface who will carry the torch of humanity into the future.

In René Barjavel&#x27;s novel &quot;Ravage&quot; (1943), written and published during the German occupation of France, a future France is devastated by the sudden failure of electricity, causing chaos, disease, and famine, with a small band of survivors desperately struggling for survival.

Fred Saberhagen goes one better than Barjavel with the &quot;Empire of the East&quot; series which starts, in the 1968 book &quot;The Broken Lands&quot;, sometime after the &quot;Change&quot; (with sincere nods from Boyett and Stirling), in which a defense designed to temporarily make nukes inoperative, permanently changes some of the laws of science for magic.

Steve Boyett&#x27;s novel &quot;Ariel&quot; (1983, sub-titled &quot;A Book of the Change&quot;) also has all technology—including electricity, gunpowder, and some physics principles—ceasing to function, while magic becomes real. He also contributed to the 1986 Borderland series, which investigates a return of the Realm of Faery to the world.

&quot;The Quiet Earth&quot;, a 1985 New Zealand movie notable for its visually stunning ending, follows a scientist&#x27;s descent into madness after he wakes up to a world where every single member of the kingdom Animalia has seemingly disappeared. After recovering and finding other people, he realizes his experiments with energy transfers through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field are to blame, and that unless he shuts down the experiment, it will destroy the planet.

S. M. Stirling also takes a swipe at the inconstant-physical-constants field with the &quot;Emberverse&quot; series. &quot;Dies the Fire&quot; (2004), &quot;The Protector&#x27;s War&quot; (2005), and &quot;A Meeting at Corvallis&quot; (2006), depict the world&#x27;s descent into feudalism after a sudden mysterious &quot;change&quot; alters physical laws so that electricity, gunpowder, and most forms of high-energy-density technology no longer work. Civilization collapses, and two competing groups struggle to re-create medieval technologies and skills, as well as master magic. Like Boyett&#x27;s novel, Stirling&#x27;s features Society for Creative Anachronism members as favorably disposed survivors, and a hang glider attack against a building.

&quot;Afterworld&quot; (first aired in 2007) is an animated American science fiction television series where a network of satellites firing persistent electronic pulses, combined with a strange nanotechnology, has not only destroyed most electronic technology on the planet, but also caused the deaths of 99% of humanity, and is now causing strange mutations to occur in lower forms of life.

The video game series &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; is set after a second Chernobyl Disaster which pollutes the Ukrainian Countryside, resulting in otherworldly changes to the environment, causing the flora, fauna and laws of physics to irreversibly morph and mutate.

John Barnes&#x27; &quot;Daybreak&quot; series (starting 2010) deals with an America devastated by a nanotech swarm.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot; (2012–2014) also revolved around a &quot;change&quot; after which the principles of electricity and physics are inoperable; however, the focus of the story was how a group of protagonists tried to get the power back on while opposing the efforts of a tyrannical militia leader to understand it first (so that he can take absolute power).

The web series &quot;H+: The Digital Series&quot; (2012-2013) depicts in part, the aftermath of a world in which a computer virus that infected a popular brain-computer interface killed one-third of the population, leading to a breakdown in order and the lack or shortage of electricity and other modern conveniences.

&quot;All Systems Down&quot; (2018) is an American novel which describes a cyber war that cripples Western infrastructure, resulting in the collapse of society.

Robert Harris&#x27;s novel &quot;The Second Sleep&quot; (2019) is set in a fundamentalist agrarian society several centuries after the collapse of global civilisation, which is implied to be the result of a sudden breakdown of the internet, possibly as the result of cyberwarfare.

==== AI takeover and technological singularity ====

The topic of technological singularity, also known as “singularity,” was first coined in 1993. Since then, the idea of the term has been used to produce countless major motion pictures and earn Hollywood producers millions of dollars at the box office. The &quot;singularity&quot; refers to a future moment in human history when science and science fiction, religion and philosophy, and hope and fear converge. The mathematician and science fiction writer Vernor Vinge coined the term to denote a juncture when artificial intelligence (AI) equals, and then in an intelligence explosion, far exceeds man intelligence.” In laymen&#x27;s terms, technological singularity is the theoretical future moment when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and becomes aware, autonomous, and potentially threatening to humans. 
*&quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), James Cameron directs this science-fiction thriller about a futuristic killing machine called the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), which is sent back to the year 1984 to assassinate a young woman named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). The cyborg comes from the year 2029, following a nuclear war that has devastated the better part of civilization. Computer defense mechanisms have turned on their creators, starting another war, in an effort to eliminate the human race altogether. Man&#x27;s valiant rebel leader is John Connor, Sarah&#x27;s son. John is destined to help the human race win this war, and the Terminator is the only thing standing in the way. Sent back to the present, the cyborg must kill Sarah before John is born. It systematically eliminates every Sarah Connor in the city of Los Angeles. But Sarah escapes with the man sent to protect her, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) before the Terminator can get to her. What follows is a massive chase that will eventually end in victory for mankind. Co-writer William Wisher Jr. has a cameo as a police officer.

===Fossil fuel supply scarcities===

The film &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), directed by George Miller, presents a world in which oil resources have been nearly exhausted. This has resulted in constant energy shortages and a breakdown of law and order. The police do battle with criminal motorcycle gangs, with the result being the complete breakdown of modern society and nuclear war as depicted in &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981). The opening narration of &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; implies that the fuel shortage was caused not just by peak oil, but also by oil reserves being destroyed during a large scale conflict in the Middle East. The remnants of society survive either through scavenging, or in one notable case, as depicted in the third sequel &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985), by using methane derived from pig feces.

James Howard Kunstler&#x27;s novel &quot;World Made By Hand&quot; (2008) imagines life in upstate New York after a declining world oil supply has wreaked havoc on the US economy, and people and society are forced to adjust to daily life without cheap oil.

This also makes the infected more dangerous, as they can run very quickly and as their bodies are not decaying. The plot centers on groups of both uninfected survivors and a handful of virus carriers who are immune to the effects of the disease.

In the Reboot series of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, Will Rodman was a scientist of Gen-Sys who was working on an experimental drug he called ALZ-112 in an effort to save his father, who had been diagnosed with &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot;. The virus proved a success with ape test subjects by greatly enhancing their intelligence, and managed to cure Rodman&#x27;s father, but only temporarily, as his body gradually developed antibodies against the virus. In order to make an stronger version, the ALZ-113 (later dubbed Simian Flu) was created, in which proved to be fatal to humans. During the first trial, the virus was accidentally released onto Robert Franklin when Koba kicked off Franklin&#x27;s breathing mask. Franklin was later found dead, but not before he infected Rodman&#x27;s neighbor Douglas Hunsiker. After the apes break free and escaped to the Muir Woods, an infected Hunsiker went to his job as an airline pilot, triggering the spread of the ALZ-113 across the planet via international flight routes and leading to a worldwide pandemic that destroyed mostly of humanity. Later, the virus mutated, in which caused humans to lose their speech capabilities and their advanced intelligence. Eventually, the Apes became the new predominant species of Earth, while humanity have been regressed into a primitive state.

Since this measure of destruction was no longer imaginary, some of these new works, such as Nevil Shute&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1957), which was subsequently twice adapted for film (in 1959 and 2000), Mordecai Roshwald&#x27;s &quot;Level 7&quot; (1959), Pat Frank&#x27;s &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; (1959), and Robert McCammon&#x27;s &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1987), shun the imaginary science and technology that are the identifying traits of general science fiction. Others include more fantastic elements, such as mutants, alien invaders, or exotic future weapons such as James Axler&#x27;s &quot;Deathlands&quot; (1986).

In Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s story &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot; (1937, originally titled &quot;The Place of the Gods&quot;), a young man explores the ruins of a city in the northeastern United States, possibly New York City, generations after a war in which future weapons caused &quot;The Great Burning&quot;.

According to some theorists, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 has influenced Japanese popular culture to include many apocalyptic themes. Much of Japan&#x27;s manga and anime are filled with apocalyptic imagery. The 1954 film &quot;Gojira&quot; (1954, romanized as &quot;Godzilla&quot;) depicted the title monster as an analogy for nuclear weapons, something Japan had experienced first-hand.

Judith Merril&#x27;s first novel &quot;Shadow on the Hearth&quot; (1950) is one of the earliest post-World War II novels to deal with a post-nuclear-holocaust world. The novel recounts the ordeals of a young suburban housewife and mother of two children as she struggles to survive in a world forever changed by the horrors of a nuclear attack. Several of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short stories of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; take place before, during, and after a nuclear war on Earth. The people flee Earth and settle on Mars but have constant conflicts with the native Martians. Several of these stories have been adapted to other media.

Andre Norton&#x27;s &quot;Star Man&#x27;s Son&quot; (1952, also known as &quot;Daybreak 2250&quot;), is an early post-nuclear-war novel that follows a young man, Fors, in search of lost knowledge. Fors begins his Arthurian quest through a radiation-ravaged landscape with the aid of a telepathic mutant cat. He encounters mutated creatures called &quot;the beast things&quot;, which are possibly mutated rats or a degenerate form of humans.

Wilson Tucker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Long Loud Silence&quot; (1952) posits a post-nuclear holocaust America in which the eastern half of the country has been largely destroyed and its surviving inhabitants infected with a plague and barred from crossing the Mississippi River to try to find refuge in the unscathed western part of the country.

A nuclear war occurs at the end of Bradbury&#x27;s dystopian futuristic novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953), with the outcasts, who had fled an unidentified American city to escape a despotic government which burned books in order to control the public by limiting knowledge, left alive to re-establish society.

John Wyndham&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; (United States title: &quot;Re-Birth&quot;), set in a small community untold centuries after a nuclear holocaust (not expressly told, but strongly hinted at with genetic mutations, glowing ruins, landscape baked to glass), tells the story of David, part of a small group of teens who share a limited form of telepathy that allows them to communicate with others who have the same talent; however, the fundamentalist society they live in, regards the slightest difference from the norm as a blasphemy and affront to God. The group attempt to remain hidden, then failing that, survive during a war between mutants and the fundamentalists while waiting for members of a distant advanced telepathic human civilization to rescue them.

In Walter M. Miller Jr.&#x27;s &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; (1959) a Catholic Church, pseudo-medieval society, and rediscovery of the knowledge of the pre-holocaust world are central themes.

Edgar Pangborn&#x27;s &quot;Tales of a Darkening World: The Davy Series&quot;, written mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, takes place after a nuclear war. The best-known story is the novel &quot;Davy&quot;.

Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Maurai&quot; series (1959–1983) also takes place after a nuclear war, and his Hugo and Prometheus award-winning story &quot;No Truce With Kings&quot; takes place after a cataclysmic war. Both show the interactions among various kinds of societies that have developed in the centuries of recovery.

Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; follows the story of a group of people that have survived a nuclear explosion. The group survives the attack in a fallout shelter but are taken to a future in which Africans rule.

&quot;Damnation Alley&quot; is a 1967 science fiction novella by Roger Zelazny, which he expanded into a novel in 1969. A film adaptation of the novel was released in 1977.

Harlan Ellison&#x27;s novella &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; (1969) takes place in a world desolated by the nuclear warfare in World War IV. It was adapted into a 1975 film of the same name as well as a companion graphic novel titled &quot;Vic and Blood&quot;. In turn, the 1975 film adaptation influenced the &quot;Mad Max&quot; films, particularly &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (1981).

Alexander Key&#x27;s novel &quot;The Incredible Tide&quot; (1970) is set years after the Third World War. The weapons used were not nuclear, but ultra-magnetic that tore and submerged the continents. The story was adapted in the anime &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978).

Russell Hoban&#x27;s &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; (1980), set in the English county of Kent around two thousand years after a nuclear war, also has religious or mystical themes and is written in a fictional future version of English.

In Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s manga (1982–1994) and anime film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984), human civilization is destroyed after a war known as the &quot;Seven Days of Fire&quot;, which results in the Earth&#x27;s surface becoming polluted and the seas turning poisonous.

William W. Johnstone wrote a series of books between 1983 and 2003 (35 books all containing the word &quot;Ashes&quot; in the title) about the aftermath of worldwide nuclear and biological war.

David Brin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Postman&quot; (1985) takes place in an America where some are trying to rebuild civilization after the &quot;Doomwar&quot;. It was adapted into the film &quot;The Postman&quot; (1997).

Orson Scott Card&#x27;s post-apocalyptic anthology &quot;The Folk of the Fringe&quot; (1989) deals with American Mormons after a nuclear war.

Jeanne DuPrau&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The City of Ember&quot; (2003) was the first of four books in a post-apocalyptic series for young adults. A film adaptation, &quot;City of Ember&quot; (2008), stars Bill Murray and Saoirse Ronan.

====Video games====
In the computer game &quot;Wasteland&quot; (1988) and its sequels, nuclear war occurred in 1998 leaving a wasteland in its wake. The game centers around a player-controlled party of Desert Rangers. &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; was produced in 2015 and &quot;Wasteland 3&quot; in 2020, both continuing the story of the Desert Rangers.

&quot;Fallout&quot;, an ongoing series of post-apocalyptic role-playing games first published in 1997, depicts a world after a series of resource wars that culminates in a massive nuclear exchange between the U.S and China in 2077. The games revolve around &quot;vaults,&quot; underground bunkers for long-term survival (in reality social experiments created by the ruling elite of the pre-war United States), and exploring the outside wasteland, in locations such as California, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., New England, and West Virginia. &quot;Fallout&quot; draws heavily from retro 1950s sci-fi, and the setting combines elements of mid-20th century technology, such as vacuum tubes and monochrome screens, with highly advanced artificial intelligences and energy weapons.
In &quot;Metro 2033&quot; (2010), a nuclear war occurs in late 2013. Russia was targeted with atomic bombs, causing severe radiation across Moscow, forcing the rest of the people to live underground in the metro stations away from the deadly effects of radiation. Many animals and humans left behind mutated into creatures known as the Dark Ones, who were left outside for the next 20 years. The game is played from the perspective of Artyom, a 20-year-old male survivor and one of the many children brought into the metro right before the bombs dropped. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but some missions have the player go to the surface which is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air. A sequel, &quot;&quot; was released in 2013. A sequel to &quot;Metro: Last Light&quot;; &quot;&quot; was produced in 2019.

Nuclear apocalypse followed by a demon invasion is a recurring staple of the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series. In those games it is generally scene as a major religious event created by or following the orders of God, an example of this is in the 1992 Super Famicom game Shin Megami Tensei, in which the Germanic Deity Thor, following the orders of God, rains ICBMs on the city of Tokyo initiating the second act of the game and setting up for its sequel, Shin Megami Tensei II. In this franchise, these events are referred to as The Great Cataclysm.

The &quot;Danganronpa&quot; series is revealed to be set in a world where society has collapsed as a result of &quot;The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History&quot; which involves constant chaos, violence, and death for the sake of spreading of despair.

In &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, sometime after the events on Mars in &quot;Doom&quot;, Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out most of the planet&#x27;s population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have joined the Armored Response Coalition, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion, which has gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and teleported away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the AI VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests.

&quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot; (2013) is set in a near future that follows the nuclear destruction of the Middle East. The oil-producing nations of South America form the &quot;Federation of the Americas&quot; in response to the ensuing global economic crisis and quickly grow into a global superpower, swiftly invading and conquering Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico.

&quot;&quot; (2016) is set during an ongoing Apocalypse, after a Hellgate opens on Earth and a host of demons enter the world. The player controls a group of survivors that found a base to fight back and find a way to repel the invasion.

The &quot;Splatoon&quot; franchise takes place in a future where humans and all mammals died out due to accelerating climate change, multiple wars and the detonation of a nuclear device in the ice caps causing the ocean levels to rapidly rise. Although many groups of humans tried to survive for some time, both in an underground habitat called Alterna and on a spacecraft called Ark Polaris, all of the attempts resulted in accidents that led to the groups dying out, in the DLC &quot;Splatoon 2 : Octo Expansion&quot; the character of Commander Tartar is introduced, its purpose being to pass down humanity&#x27;s knowledge to the next dominant species that may rise after the devastation of Earth&#x27;s biosphere.

&quot;Old World Blues&quot; is a &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot; mod set in the &quot;Fallout&quot; universe. This mod has been praised for its effective portrayal of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series within a grand strategy setting.

&quot;My Time at Portia&quot; and &quot;My Time at Sandrock&quot; (released 2019 and 2023 respectively) are both farm sim video games that were developed by Pathea. Both games took place 300 years after most modern technologies were destroyed.

===Other===
====Anime and manga====
&quot;Violence Jack&quot; (1973 debut), a manga and anime series by Go Nagai, is set in a post-apocalyptic world with corruption and psychotic gangs. It is credited with creating the post-apocalyptic manga and anime genre, depicting its post-apocalyptic world as a desert wasteland with biker gangs, anarchic violence, ruined buildings, innocent civilians, tribal chiefs and small abandoned villages. This was similar to, and may have influenced, the desert wasteland settings of later post-apocalyptic franchises such as the film series &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979 debut) and the manga/anime series &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (, 1983 debut). Goichi Suda (Suda 51), who cited &quot;Violence Jack&quot; as an influence on his video game series &quot;No More Heroes&quot; (2007 debut), stated: “All of the desert-setting titles are actually inspired by &quot;Violence Jack&quot;. That came way before &quot;&quot;, so that&#x27;s the real origin of everything.”

The Second Impact had led to mass extinctions and wars, as well as significant changes to the planet&#x27;s climate and population.

&quot;Uchuu no Stellvia&quot; (2003 debut) describes an earth after being hit by a big electromagnetic wave from a supernova of a nearby star, where mankind needs to rescue the earth 189 years after this impact from a second wave of matter coming towards the solar system. The anime shows a globalized society who have put together to fight this &quot;enemy&quot;.

In &quot;Black Bullet&quot; (2011 debut), the earth was devastated by an alien race, spreading a virus that transforms humans into some kind of insect. Only the major cities holding back behind big walls of some fictitious material and are under constant threat to be invaded when these walls fail.

&quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot; (1961) is a film by Val Guest about an Earth thrown out of its orbit around the Sun by excessive nuclear testing. It paints a picture of a society ready to believe that humans could destroy the planet, hoping that science could fix what it has broken but resigned to the possibility of irreversible doom.

The film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), loosely based upon Harry Harrison&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (1966), is set in the dystopian future of 2022, in an overpopulated, heavily polluted world, where the masses of mostly homeless and destitute people have been herded into the overcrowded cities and barely survive on government-issued food rations made from the processed corpses of the dead.

Ernst Jünger&#x27;s novel &quot;Eumeswil&quot;&#x27;s (1977) key theme is the figure of the Anarch, the inwardly-free individual who lives quietly and dispassionately within but not of society and the post apocalyptic world.

John Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;Engine Summer&quot; (1979) takes place perhaps a thousand years after &quot;the Storm&quot; (not described) destroyed industrial civilization. Surviving cultures seem to be influenced by the 1960s and 1970s counterculture.

Robert Reed&#x27;s short story &quot;Pallbearer&quot; (2010) deals with most of the developed world&#x27;s population dying after a mass vaccination program in which the vaccines were purposefully tainted. The survivors are those who were not vaccinated, often for religious reasons, and their descendants. Most of the developing world does not receive the vaccine, and decades later, large numbers of its refugees are arriving to America&#x27;s shores. The protagonist survives the disaster as a young boy and has a chance encounter with an elderly scientist and her fanatical younger family members.

James Wesley Rawles&#x27; novel &quot;Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse&quot; (2011) addresses a contemporaneous global economic crash, and focuses on the struggles of a large cast of characters who struggle to survive after what is termed &quot;The Crunch.&quot; It covers both the lead up to the economic crash, as well as several years after the crash.

&quot;This Is The End&quot; (2013) centers on fictionalized versions of its cast in the wake of a global biblical apocalypse.

When humanity tried to find a magic that both men and women could use, they encountered the Dark One, a Satan-like being able to corrupt human nature and the natural world. A war between the &quot;Light&quot; and the &quot;Shadow&quot; (the Dark One and his followers) ends with the Dark One being imprisoned with saidin. He corrupts it from within his prison; however, driving male users of the Power insane. They use their power to destroy civilization and geography in what is known as the &quot;Breaking of the World&quot;. The era before the Breaking is later remembered as the &quot;Age of Legends&quot;, since much knowledge was lost, and many common feats of that time seemed miraculous to the characters of the series.

====Music====
Many musicians have post-apocalyptic themes and imagery in their lyrics. For example, Muse&#x27;s album &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012) was inspired by post-apocalyptic life in &quot;World War Z&quot;, and the event is referred to specifically in the song &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot; (2003).

Post-apocalyptic scenarios were a common theme in the music of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, most notably the song &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; and the album &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;.

The music video for the song &quot;Mankind Man&quot;(1995) by the Barstool Prophets featured a dystopian view of the future reminisent of Lord of the Flies and Mad Max. Likewise, the music video for The Sisters of Mercy song &quot;This Corrosion&quot; takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting.

<text>In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, SVMs are one of the most studied models, being based on statistical learning frameworks of VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974).

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classification using the &quot;kernel trick&quot;, representing the data only through a set of pairwise similarity comparisons between the original data points using a kernel function, which transforms them into coordinates in a higher-dimensional feature space. Thus, SVMs use the kernel trick to implicitly map their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces, where linear classification can be performed. Being max-margin models, SVMs are resilient to noisy data (e.g., misclassified examples). SVMs can also be used for regression tasks, where the objective becomes formula_1-sensitive.

The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data into groups, and then to map new data according to these clusters.

The popularity of SVMs is likely due to their amenability to theoretical analysis, and their flexibility in being applied to a wide variety of tasks, including structured prediction problems. It is not clear that SVMs have better predictive performance than other linear models, such as logistic regression and linear regression.

== Motivation ==

Classifying data is a common task in machine learning.
Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a &quot;new&quot; data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a formula_2-dimensional vector (a list of formula_2 numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a formula_4-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the &quot;maximum-margin hyperplane&quot; and the linear classifier it defines is known as a &quot;maximum-margin classifier&quot;; or equivalently, the &quot;perceptron of optimal stability&quot;.

More formally, a support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outliers detection. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin, the lower the generalization error of the classifier. A lower generalization error means that the implementer is less likely to experience overfitting.
Whereas the original problem may be stated in a finite-dimensional space, it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much higher-dimensional space, presumably making the separation easier in that space. To keep the computational load reasonable, the mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products of pairs of input data vectors may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space, by defining them in terms of a kernel function formula_5 selected to suit the problem. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant, where such a set of vectors is an orthogonal (and thus minimal) set of vectors that defines a hyperplane. The vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters formula_6 of images of feature vectors formula_7 that occur in the data base. With this choice of a hyperplane, the points formula_8 in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation formula_9 Note that if formula_5 becomes small as formula_11 grows further away from formula_8, each term in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point formula_8 to the corresponding data base point formula_7. In this way, the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated. Note the fact that the set of points formula_8 mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result, allowing much more complex discrimination between sets that are not convex at all in the original space.

== Applications ==
SVMs can be used to solve various real-world problems:
* SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization, as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings. Some methods for shallow semantic parsing are based on support vector machines.
* Classification of images can also be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true for image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik.
* Classification of satellite data like SAR data using supervised SVM.
* Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM.
* The SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. Permutation tests based on SVM weights have been suggested as a mechanism for interpretation of SVM models. Support vector machine weights have also been used to interpret SVM models in the past. Posthoc interpretation of support vector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences.

== History ==
The original SVM algorithm was invented by Vladimir N. Vapnik and Alexey Ya. Chervonenkis in 1964. In 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The &quot;soft margin&quot; incarnation, as is commonly used in software packages, was proposed by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1993 and published in 1995.

== Linear SVM ==

We are given a training dataset of formula_16 points of the form
formula_17
where the formula_18 are either 1 or −1, each indicating the class to which the point formula_19 belongs. Each formula_19 is a formula_2-dimensional real vector. We want to find the &quot;maximum-margin hyperplane&quot; that divides the group of points formula_22 for which formula_23 from the group of points for which formula_24, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point formula_19 from either group is maximized.

Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points formula_26 satisfying
formula_27
where formula_28 is the (not necessarily normalized) normal vector to the hyperplane. This is much like Hesse normal form, except that formula_28 is not necessarily a unit vector. The parameter formula_30 determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector formula_28.

Warning: most of the literature on the subject defines the bias so that
formula_32

=== Hard-margin ===
If the training data is linearly separable, we can select two parallel hyperplanes that separate the two classes of data, so that the distance between them is as large as possible. The region bounded by these two hyperplanes is called the &quot;margin&quot;, and the maximum-margin hyperplane is the hyperplane that lies halfway between them. With a normalized or standardized dataset, these hyperplanes can be described by the equations
: formula_33 (anything on or above this boundary is of one class, with label 1)
and
: formula_34 (anything on or below this boundary is of the other class, with label −1).
Geometrically, the distance between these two hyperplanes is formula_35, so to maximize the distance between the planes we want to minimize formula_36. The distance is computed using the distance from a point to a plane equation. We also have to prevent data points from falling into the margin, we add the following constraint: for each formula_37 either
formula_38
or
formula_39
These constraints state that each data point must lie on the correct side of the margin.

This can be rewritten as

We can put this together to get the optimization problem:

formula_40

The formula_28 and formula_42 that solve this problem determine the final classifier, formula_43, where formula_44 is the sign function.

An important consequence of this geometric description is that the max-margin hyperplane is completely determined by those formula_22 that lie nearest to it (explained below). These formula_22 are called &quot;support vectors&quot;.

=== Soft-margin ===
To extend SVM to cases in which the data are not linearly separable, the &quot;hinge loss&quot; function is helpful
formula_47

Note that formula_18 is the &quot;i&quot;-th target (i.e., in this case, 1 or −1), and formula_49 is the &quot;i&quot;-th output.

This function is zero if the constraint in is satisfied, in other words, if formula_22 lies on the correct side of the margin. For data on the wrong side of the margin, the function&#x27;s value is proportional to the distance from the margin.

The goal of the optimization then is to minimize:

formula_51

where the parameter formula_52 determines the trade-off between increasing the margin size and ensuring that the formula_22 lie on the correct side of the margin (Note we can add a weight to either term in the equation above). By deconstructing the hinge loss, this optimization problem can be formulated into the following:

formula_54

Thus, for large values of formula_55, it will behave similar to the hard-margin SVM, if the input data are linearly classifiable, but will still learn if a classification rule is viable or not.

== Nonlinear kernels ==

The original maximum-margin hyperplane algorithm proposed by Vapnik in 1963 constructed a linear classifier. However, in 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick (originally proposed by Aizerman et al.) to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The kernel trick, where dot products are replaced by kernels, is easily derived in the dual representation of the SVM problem. This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space high-dimensional; although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space.

It is noteworthy that working in a higher-dimensional feature space increases the generalization error of support vector machines, although given enough samples the algorithm still performs well.

Some common kernels include:
* Polynomial (homogeneous): formula_56. Particularly, when formula_57, this becomes the linear kernel.
* Polynomial (inhomogeneous): formula_58.
* Gaussian radial basis function: formula_59 for formula_60. Sometimes parametrized using formula_61.
* Sigmoid function (Hyperbolic tangent): formula_62 for some (not every) formula_63 and formula_64.

The kernel is related to the transform formula_65 by the equation formula_66. The value is also in the transformed space, with formula_67. Dot products with for classification can again be computed by the kernel trick, i.e. formula_68.

== Computing the SVM classifier ==
Computing the (soft-margin) SVM classifier amounts to minimizing an expression of the form
We focus on the soft-margin classifier since, as noted above, choosing a sufficiently small value for formula_69 yields the hard-margin classifier for linearly classifiable input data. The classical approach, which involves reducing to a quadratic programming problem, is detailed below. Then, more recent approaches such as sub-gradient descent and coordinate descent will be discussed.

=== Primal ===
Minimizing can be rewritten as a constrained optimization problem with a differentiable objective function in the following way.

For each formula_70 we introduce a variable formula_71. Note that formula_72 is the smallest nonnegative number satisfying formula_73

Thus we can rewrite the optimization problem as follows

formula_74

This is called the &quot;primal&quot; problem.

=== Dual ===
By solving for the Lagrangian dual of the above problem, one obtains the simplified problem

formula_75

This is called the &quot;dual&quot; problem. Since the dual maximization problem is a quadratic function of the formula_76 subject to linear constraints, it is efficiently solvable by quadratic programming algorithms.

Here, the variables formula_76 are defined such that

formula_78

Moreover, formula_79 exactly when formula_80 lies on the correct side of the margin, and formula_81 when formula_80 lies on the margin&#x27;s boundary. It follows that formula_28 can be written as a linear combination of the support vectors.

The offset, formula_84, can be recovered by finding an formula_80 on the margin&#x27;s boundary and solving
formula_86

(Note that formula_87 since formula_88.)

=== Kernel trick ===

Suppose now that we would like to learn a nonlinear classification rule which corresponds to a linear classification rule for the transformed data points formula_89 Moreover, we are given a kernel function formula_90 which satisfies formula_91.

We know the classification vector formula_28 in the transformed space satisfies

formula_93

where, the formula_94 are obtained by solving the optimization problem

formula_95

The coefficients formula_76 can be solved for using quadratic programming, as before. Again, we can find some index formula_97 such that formula_81, so that formula_99 lies on the boundary of the margin in the transformed space, and then solve

formula_100

Finally,

formula_101

=== Modern methods ===
Recent algorithms for finding the SVM classifier include sub-gradient descent and coordinate descent. Both techniques have proven to offer significant advantages over the traditional approach when dealing with large, sparse datasets—sub-gradient methods are especially efficient when there are many training examples, and coordinate descent when the dimension of the feature space is high.

==== Sub-gradient descent ====
Sub-gradient descent algorithms for the SVM work directly with the expression

formula_102

Note that formula_103 is a convex function of formula_28 and formula_42. As such, traditional gradient descent (or SGD) methods can be adapted, where instead of taking a step in the direction of the function&#x27;s gradient, a step is taken in the direction of a vector selected from the function&#x27;s sub-gradient. This approach has the advantage that, for certain implementations, the number of iterations does not scale with formula_16, the number of data points.

==== Coordinate descent ====
Coordinate descent algorithms for the SVM work from the dual problem

formula_107

For each formula_108, iteratively, the coefficient formula_76 is adjusted in the direction of formula_110. Then, the resulting vector of coefficients formula_111 is projected onto the nearest vector of coefficients that satisfies the given constraints. (Typically Euclidean distances are used.) The process is then repeated until a near-optimal vector of coefficients is obtained. The resulting algorithm is extremely fast in practice, although few performance guarantees have been proven.

== Empirical risk minimization ==
The soft-margin support vector machine described above is an example of an empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm for the &quot;hinge loss&quot;. Seen this way, support vector machines belong to a natural class of algorithms for statistical inference, and many of its unique features are due to the behavior of the hinge loss. This perspective can provide further insight into how and why SVMs work, and allow us to better analyze their statistical properties.

=== Risk minimization ===
In supervised learning, one is given a set of training examples formula_112 with labels formula_113, and wishes to predict formula_114 given formula_115. To do so one forms a hypothesis, formula_103, such that formula_117 is a &quot;good&quot; approximation of formula_114. A &quot;good&quot; approximation is usually defined with the help of a &quot;loss function,&quot; formula_119, which characterizes how bad formula_120 is as a prediction of formula_11. We would then like to choose a hypothesis that minimizes the &quot;expected risk:&quot;

formula_122

In most cases, we don&#x27;t know the joint distribution of formula_123 outright. In these cases, a common strategy is to choose the hypothesis that minimizes the &quot;empirical risk:&quot;

formula_124

Under certain assumptions about the sequence of random variables formula_125 (for example, that they are generated by a finite Markov process), if the set of hypotheses being considered is small enough, the minimizer of the empirical risk will closely approximate the minimizer of the expected risk as formula_16 grows large. This approach is called &quot;empirical risk minimization,&quot; or ERM.

=== Regularization and stability ===
In order for the minimization problem to have a well-defined solution, we have to place constraints on the set formula_127 of hypotheses being considered. If formula_127 is a normed space (as is the case for SVM), a particularly effective technique is to consider only those hypotheses formula_129 for which formula_130 . This is equivalent to imposing a &quot;regularization penalty&quot; formula_131, and solving the new optimization problem

formula_132

This approach is called &quot;Tikhonov regularization.&quot;

More generally, formula_133 can be some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis formula_103, so that simpler hypotheses are preferred.

=== SVM and the hinge loss ===
Recall that the (soft-margin) SVM classifier formula_135 is chosen to minimize the following expression:

formula_136

In light of the above discussion, we see that the SVM technique is equivalent to empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization, where in this case the loss function is the hinge loss

formula_137

From this perspective, SVM is closely related to other fundamental classification algorithms such as regularized least-squares and logistic regression. The difference between the three lies in the choice of loss function: regularized least-squares amounts to empirical risk minimization with the square-loss, formula_138; logistic regression employs the log-loss,

formula_139

==== Target functions ====
The difference between the hinge loss and these other loss functions is best stated in terms of &quot;target functions -&quot; the function that minimizes expected risk for a given pair of random variables formula_140.

In particular, let formula_141 denote formula_11 conditional on the event that formula_143. In the classification setting, we have:

formula_144

The optimal classifier is therefore:

formula_145

For the square-loss, the target function is the conditional expectation function, formula_146; For the logistic loss, it&#x27;s the logit function, formula_147. While both of these target functions yield the correct classifier, as formula_148, they give us more information than we need. In fact, they give us enough information to completely describe the distribution of formula_149.

On the other hand, one can check that the target function for the hinge loss is &quot;exactly&quot; formula_150. Thus, in a sufficiently rich hypothesis space—or equivalently, for an appropriately chosen kernel—the SVM classifier will converge to the simplest function (in terms of formula_151) that correctly classifies the data. This extends the geometric interpretation of SVM—for linear classification, the empirical risk is minimized by any function whose margins lie between the support vectors, and the simplest of these is the max-margin classifier.

== Properties ==

SVMs belong to a family of generalized linear classifiers and can be interpreted as an extension of the perceptron. They can also be considered a special case of Tikhonov regularization. A special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical &quot;classification error&quot; and maximize the &quot;geometric margin&quot;; hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers.

A comparison of the SVM to other classifiers has been made by Meyer, Leisch and Hornik.

=== Parameter selection ===

The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel&#x27;s parameters, and soft margin parameter formula_69.
A common choice is a Gaussian kernel, which has a single parameter &quot;formula_153&quot;. The best combination of formula_69 and formula_153 is often selected by a grid search with exponentially growing sequences of formula_69 and &quot;formula_153&quot;, for example, formula_158; formula_159. Typically, each combination of parameter choices is checked using cross validation, and the parameters with best cross-validation accuracy are picked. Alternatively, recent work in Bayesian optimization can be used to select formula_69 and &quot;formula_153&quot; , often requiring the evaluation of far fewer parameter combinations than grid search. The final model, which is used for testing and for classifying new data, is then trained on the whole training set using the selected parameters.

=== Issues ===
Potential drawbacks of the SVM include the following aspects:

* Requires full labeling of input data
* Uncalibrated class membership probabilities—SVM stems from Vapnik&#x27;s theory which avoids estimating probabilities on finite data
* The SVM is only directly applicable for two-class tasks. Therefore, algorithms that reduce the multi-class task to several binary problems have to be applied; see the multi-class SVM section.
* Parameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret.

== Extensions ==

=== Multiclass SVM ===
Multiclass SVM aims to assign labels to instances by using support vector machines, where the labels are drawn from a finite set of several elements.

The dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems. Common methods for such reduction include:
* Building binary classifiers that distinguish between one of the labels and the rest (&quot;one-versus-all&quot;) or between every pair of classes (&quot;one-versus-one&quot;). Classification of new instances for the one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all strategy, in which the classifier with the highest-output function assigns the class (it is important that the output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores). For the one-versus-one approach, classification is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification.
* Directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM)
* Error-correcting output codes

Crammer and Singer proposed a multiclass SVM method which casts the multiclass classification problem into a single optimization problem, rather than decomposing it into multiple binary classification problems. See also Lee, Lin and Wahba and Van den Burg and Groenen.

=== Transductive support vector machines ===
Transductive support vector machines extend SVMs in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semi-supervised learning by following the principles of transduction. Here, in addition to the training set formula_162, the learner is also given a set

formula_163

of test examples to be classified. Formally, a transductive support vector machine is defined by the following primal optimization problem:

Minimize (in formula_164)

formula_165

subject to (for any formula_166 and any formula_167)

formula_168

and

formula_169

Transductive support vector machines were introduced by Vladimir N. Vapnik in 1998.

=== Structured SVM ===

Structured support-vector machine is an extension of the traditional SVM model. While the SVM model is primarily designed for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression tasks, structured SVM broadens its application to handle general structured output labels, for example parse trees, classification with taxonomies, sequence alignment and many more.

=== Regression ===

A version of SVM for regression was proposed in 1996 by Vladimir N. Vapnik, Harris Drucker, Christopher J. C. Burges, Linda Kaufman and Alexander J. Smola. This method is called support vector regression (SVR). The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin. Analogously, the model produced by SVR depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction. Another SVM version known as least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle.

Training the original SVR means solving

: minimize formula_170
: subject to formula_171

where formula_7 is a training sample with target value formula_18. The inner product plus intercept formula_174 is the prediction for that sample, and formula_175 is a free parameter that serves as a threshold: all predictions have to be within an formula_175 range of the true predictions. Slack variables are usually added into the above to allow for errors and to allow approximation in the case the above problem is infeasible.

=== Bayesian SVM ===
In 2011 it was shown by Polson and Scott that the SVM admits a Bayesian interpretation through the technique of data augmentation. In this approach the SVM is viewed as a graphical model (where the parameters are connected via probability distributions). This extended view allows the application of Bayesian techniques to SVMs, such as flexible feature modeling, automatic hyperparameter tuning, and predictive uncertainty quantification. Recently, a scalable version of the Bayesian SVM was developed by Florian Wenzel, enabling the application of Bayesian SVMs to big data. Florian Wenzel developed two different versions, a variational inference (VI) scheme for the Bayesian kernel support vector machine (SVM) and a stochastic version (SVI) for the linear Bayesian SVM.

== Implementation ==

The parameters of the maximum-margin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization. There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises from SVMs, mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Another approach is to use an interior-point method that uses Newton-like iterations to find a solution of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems.
Instead of solving a sequence of broken-down problems, this approach directly solves the problem altogether. To avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix, a low-rank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick.

Another common method is Platt&#x27;s sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, which breaks the problem down into 2-dimensional sub-problems that are solved analytically, eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm and matrix storage. This algorithm is conceptually simple, easy to implement, generally faster, and has better scaling properties for difficult SVM problems.

The special case of linear support vector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin, logistic regression; this class of algorithms includes sub-gradient descent (e.g., PEGASOS) and coordinate descent (e.g., LIBLINEAR). LIBLINEAR has some attractive training-time properties. Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data, and the iterations also have a Q-linear convergence property, making the algorithm extremely fast.

The general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using sub-gradient descent (e.g. P-packSVM), especially when parallelization is allowed.

Kernel SVMs are available in many machine-learning toolkits, including LIBSVM, MATLAB, SAS, SVMlight, kernlab, scikit-learn, Shogun, Weka, Shark, JKernelMachines, OpenCV and others.

Preprocessing of data (standardization) is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of classification. There are a few methods of standardization, such as min-max, normalization by decimal scaling, Z-score. Subtraction of mean and division by variance of each feature is usually used for SVM.

<text>The Arawak are a group of Indigenous peoples of northern South America and of the Caribbean. The term &quot;Arawak&quot; has been applied at various times to different Indigenous groups, from the Lokono of South America to the Taíno (Island Arawaks), who lived in the Greater Antilles and northern Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. All these groups spoke related Arawakan languages.

==Name==

Early Spanish explorers and administrators used the terms &quot;Arawak&quot; and &quot;Caribs&quot; to distinguish the peoples of the Caribbean, with &quot;Carib&quot; reserved for Indigenous groups that they considered hostile and &quot;Arawak&quot; for groups that they considered friendly.

In 1871, ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton proposed calling the Caribbean populace &quot;Island Arawak&quot; because of their cultural and linguistic similarities with the mainland Arawak. Subsequent scholars shortened this convention to &quot;Arawak&quot;, creating confusion between the island and mainland groups. In the 20th century, scholars such as Irving Rouse resumed using &quot;Taíno&quot; for the Caribbean group to emphasize their distinct culture and language.

==History==

The Arawakan languages may have emerged in the Orinoco River valley in present-day Venezuela. They subsequently spread widely, becoming by far the most extensive language family in South America at the time of European contact, with speakers located in various areas along the Orinoco and Amazonian rivers and their tributaries. The group that self-identified as the Arawak, also known as the Lokono, settled the coastal areas of what is now Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Bahamas, Jamaica and parts of the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.

Michael Heckenberger, an anthropologist at the University of Florida who helped found the Central Amazon Project, and his team found elaborate pottery, ringed villages, raised fields, large mounds, and evidence for regional trade networks that are all indicators of a complex culture. There is also evidence that they modified the soil using various techniques such as adding charcoal to transform it into black earth, which even today is famed for its agricultural productivity. Maize and sweet potatoes were their main crops, though they also grew cassava and yautia. The Arawaks fished using nets made of fibers, bones, hooks, and harpoons. According to Heckenberger, pottery and other cultural traits show these people belonged to the Arawakan language family, a group that included the Tainos, the first Native Americans Columbus encountered. It was the largest language group that ever existed in the pre-Columbian Americas.

At some point, the Arawakan-speaking Taíno culture emerged in the Caribbean. Two major models have been presented to account for the arrival of Taíno ancestors in the islands; the &quot;Circum-Caribbean&quot; model suggests an origin in the Colombian Andes connected to the Arhuaco people, while the Amazonian model supports an origin in the Amazon basin, where the Arawakan languages developed. The Taíno were among the first American people to encounter Europeans. Christopher Columbus visited multiple islands and chiefdoms on his first voyage in 1492, which was followed by the establishment of La Navidad that same year on the northeast coast of Hispaniola, the first Spanish settlement in the Americas. Relationships between the Spaniards and the Taíno would ultimately sour. Some of the lower-level chiefs of the Taíno appeared to have assigned a supernatural origin to the explorers. When Columbus returned to La Navidad on his second voyage, he found the settlement burned down and the 39 men he had left there killed.

With the establishment of a second settlement, La Isabella, and the discovery of gold deposits on the island, the Spanish settler population on Hispaniola started to grow substantially, while disease and conflict with the Spanish began to kill tens of thousands of Taíno every year. By 1504, the Spanish had overthrown the last of the Taíno cacique chiefdoms on Hispaniola, and firmly established the supreme authority of the Spanish colonists over the now-subjugated Taíno. Over the next decade, the Spanish colonists presided over a genocide of the remaining Taíno on Hispaniola, who suffered enslavement, massacres, or exposure to diseases. The population of Hispaniola at the point of first European contact is estimated at between several hundred thousand to over a million people, but by 1514, it had dropped to a mere 35,000. By 1509, the Spanish had successfully conquered Puerto Rico and subjugated the approximately 30,000 Taíno inhabitants. By 1530, there were 1,148 Taíno left alive in Puerto Rico.

Taíno influence has survived even until today, though, as can be seen in the religions, languages, and music of Caribbean cultures. The Lokono and other South American groups resisted colonization for a longer period, and the Spanish remained unable to subdue them throughout the 16th century. In the early 17th century, they allied with the Spanish against the neighbouring Kalina (Caribs), who allied with the English and Dutch. The Lokono benefited from trade with European powers into the early 19th century, but suffered thereafter from economic and social changes in their region, including the end of the plantation economy. Their population declined until the 20th century, when it began to increase again.

Most of the Arawak of the Antilles died out or intermarried after the Spanish conquest. In South America, Arawakan-speaking groups are widespread, from southwest Brazil to the Guianas in the north, representing a wide range of cultures. They are found mostly in the tropical forest areas north of the Amazon. As with all Amazonian native peoples, contact with European settlement has led to culture change and depopulation among these groups.

==Modern population and descendants==
===Kalinago===
During the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Island Carib population in St. Vincent was greater than that in Dominica. Both the Island Caribs (Yellow Caribs) and the Black Caribs (Garifuna) fought against the British during the Second Carib War. After the end of the war, the British deported the Garifuna (a population of 4,338) to Roatan Island, while the Island Caribs (whose population consisted of 80 people) were allowed to stay on St. Vincent. The 1812 eruption of La Soufrière destroyed the Carib territory, killing a majority of the Yellow Caribs. After the eruption, 130 Yellow Caribs and 59 Black Caribs survived on St. Vincent. Unable to recover from the damage caused by the eruption, 120 of the Yellow Caribs, under Captain Baptiste, emigrated to Trinidad. In 1830, the Carib population numbered less than 100. The population made a remarkable recovery after that, although almost the entire tribe died out during the 1902 eruption of La Soufrière.

As of 2008, a small population of around 3,400 Kalinago survived in the Kalinago Territory in northeast Dominica. The Kalinago of Dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island&#x27;s rugged terrain. The island&#x27;s east coast includes a 3,700-acre (15 km2) territory formerly known as the Carib Territory that was granted to the people by the British government in 1903. The Dominican Kalinago elect their own chief. In July 2003, the Kalinago observed 100 Years of Territory, and in July 2014, Charles Williams was elected Kalinago Chief, succeeding Chief Garnette Joseph.

===Lokono===
In the 21st century, about 10,000 Lokono live primarily in Guyana, with smaller numbers present in Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guiana. Despite colonization, the Lokono population is growing.

In addition, attempts to save the Lokono language, classified as critically-endangered, have been undertaken. An assessment published by Language Documentation and Conservation in 2015 determined the number of ethnic speakers who are fluent in the language had declined to approximately five percent of the known population.

===Taíno===
The Spaniards who arrived in the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and the Virgin Islands in 1492, and later in Puerto Rico in 1493, first met the Indigenous peoples now known as the Taíno, and then the Kalinago and other groups. Some of these groups—most notably the Kalinago—were able to survive despite warfare, disease and slavery brought by the Europeans. Others survived in isolated communities with escaped and free Black people, called Maroons. Many of the explorers and early colonists also raped Indigenous women they came across, resulting in children who were considered mestizo. Some of these mestizo groups retained Indigenous culture and customs over many generations, especially among rural communities such as the jíbaro.

In time, the number of recorded Taíno was greatly diminished through forced labor, disease and warfare, but also through changes to how &quot;Indio&quot; groups were recorded in the Spanish Caribbean. For example, the 1787 census in Puerto Rico lists 2,300 &quot;pure&quot; Indios in the population, but on the next census, in 1802, not a single Indio is listed. This created the enduring belief that the Taíno people went extinct, also known as the paper genocide. The paper genocide and the myth of extinction spread throughout colonial empires, Taíno people still continued to practice their culture and teachings passing it down from generation to generation. Much of this was done in secret or disguised through Catholicism in fear for their survival and of discrimination.

With the modern invention of DNA testing, many Caribbean people have discovered they have Indigenous heritage. This has supported the claims of individuals and communities with Taíno heritage living today, particularly in rural areas such as &quot;campos&quot; (meaning small villages/towns in the country side). Though many communities and individuals across the Caribbean have some amount of Indigenous DNA, not all of them identify as Indigenous or Taíno. Those who do identify as Indigenous Caribbean may also use other terms to describe themselves as well as or in addition to &quot;Taíno&quot;.
There has been increasing scholarly attention paid to Taíno practices and culture, including communities with full or partial Taíno identities. Because of this, Taíno people started to become more open about sharing their identities, passed down Indigenous culture, and beliefs, such as the syncretic religion of Agua Dulce (also known as Tamani) that is practiced in the Dominican Republic. Even before the DNA confirmation in the scientific community, Taíno peoples within the Caribbean and its diasporas had started a movement around the late 1980s and early 1990s calling for the protection, revival or restoration of Taíno culture.

By coming together and sharing individual knowledge passed down by either oral history or maintained practice, these groups were able to use that knowledge and cross-reference the journals of Spaniards to fill in parts of Taíno culture and religion long thought to be lost due to colonization. This movement led to some Yukayekes (Taíno Tribes) being reformed.

Today there are Yukayekes in Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, such as &quot;Higuayagua&quot; and &quot;Yukayeke Taíno Borikén&quot;. There have also been attempts to revive the Taíno language—such as the Hiwatahia Hekexi dialect—using words that have survived into local Spanish dialects and extrapolation from other Arawakan languages in South America to fill in lost words.
