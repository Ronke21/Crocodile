<text>Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s and one of the best selling artists in that decade. AllMusic has called Denver &quot;among the most beloved entertainers of his era&quot;.

Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he wrote himself. He had 33 albums and singles that were certified Gold and Platinum in the U.S by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with estimated sales of more than 33 million units. He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, disdain for city life, enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials. Denver&#x27;s music appeared on a variety of charts, including country music, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and adult contemporary, earning 12 gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;; &quot;Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises&quot;; &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;; &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;; &quot;Calypso&quot;; &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot;; and &quot;Sunshine on My Shoulders&quot;.

Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s, including the 1977 hit &quot;Oh, God!&quot;, in which he starred alongside George Burns. He continued to record into the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues as well as lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of Congress to protest censorship in music. Known for his love of Colorado, Denver lived in Aspen for much of his life. In 1974, Denver was named poet laureate of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; as one of its two state songs in 2007, and West Virginia did the same for &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; in 2014. An avid pilot, Denver died at the age of 53 in 1997, in a single-fatality crash while piloting a recently purchased light plane.

==Early life==
Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. was born on December 31, 1943, in Roswell, New Mexico, to Erma Louise (née Swope; 1922–2010) and Captain Henry John &quot;Dutch&quot; Deutschendorf Sr. (1920–1982), a United States Army Air Forces pilot stationed at Roswell Army Air Field. Captain Deutschendorf Sr. was a decorated pilot who set a number of air speed records in a Convair B-58 Hustler in 1961.

In his 1994 autobiography &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, Denver described his father as a stern man who could not show his love for his children. With a military father, Denver&#x27;s family moved often, and he found difficulty gaining friends and assimilating with children of his own age. The introverted Denver often felt misplaced and did not know where he truly belonged. While stationed at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, the Deutschendorfs purchased a house and lived there from 1951 to 1959. Denver lived in Tucson from ages six to 14.

During these years, Denver attended Mansfeld Junior High School and was a member of the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus for two years. He was content in Tucson, but his father was transferred to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. The family later moved to Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas, where Denver graduated from Arlington Heights High School. Denver was distressed with life in Fort Worth, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father&#x27;s car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California in a friend&#x27;s jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.

==Career==
===Early career===
At age 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother. He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. Denver decided to change his name when Randy Sparks, founder of the New Christy Minstrels, suggested that &quot;Deutschendorf&quot; would not fit comfortably on a marquee. Denver attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock and sang in a folk-music group, &quot;The Alpine Trio&quot;, while studying architecture. He was also a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Denver dropped out of Texas Tech in 1963 and moved to Los Angeles, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965, Denver joined The Chad Mitchell Trio, replacing founder Chad Mitchell. After more personnel changes, the trio later became known as &quot;Denver, Boise, and Johnson&quot; (John Denver, David Boise, and Michael Johnson).

In 1969, Denver abandoned band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for RCA Records, &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot;. Two years earlier, he had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. It included a song Denver had written called &quot;Babe, I Hate to Go&quot;, later renamed &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;. He made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas. Milt Okun, who produced records for The Chad Mitchell Trio and folk group Peter, Paul and Mary, had become Denver&#x27;s producer as well. Okun brought the unreleased &quot;Jet Plane&quot; song to Peter, Paul and Mary. Their rendition hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Denver&#x27;s song also made it to No. 2 in the UK in February 1970, having also made No. 1 on the US Cash Box chart in December 1969.

RCA did not actively promote &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot; with a tour, but Denver embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or coffeehouse to let him play, Denver distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview. As the writer of &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;, Denver was often successful in gaining some promotional airtime, usually performing one or two songs live. Some venues let him play for the &#x27;door&#x27;; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this, Denver had built a solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.

Denver recorded two more albums in 1970, &quot;Take Me to Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Whose Garden Was This&quot;, including a mix of songs he had written and covers.

===Career peak===
Denver&#x27;s next album, &quot;Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises&quot; (1971), was a breakthrough for him in the United States, thanks in part to the single &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, which went to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver&#x27;s career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver had his first Top Ten album with &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;, with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973. In 1974 and 1975, Denver had a string of four No. 1 songs (&quot;Sunshine on My Shoulders&quot;, &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;) and three No. 1 albums (&quot;John Denver&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Back Home Again&quot;, and &quot;Windsong&quot;).

In the 1970s, Denver&#x27;s onstage appearance included long blond hair and wire-rimmed &quot;granny&quot; glasses. His embroidered shirts with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer and appliqué artist Anna Zapp. Weintraub insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver&#x27;s protests at the time, &quot;I&#x27;ve had no success in Britain ... I mean &quot;none&quot;&quot;. In December 1976, Weintraub told Maureen Orth of &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people.&quot;

After appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver hosted his own variety and music specials, including several concerts from Red Rocks Amphitheatre. His seasonal special, &quot;Rocky Mountain Christmas&quot;, was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time.

In 1973, Denver starred in his own BBC television series, &quot;The John Denver Show&quot;, a weekly music and variety show directed and produced by Stanley Dorfman.
Denver&#x27;s live concert special, &quot;An Evening with John Denver&quot;, won the 1974–1975 Emmy Award for Outstanding Special, Comedy-Variety or Music. When Denver ended his business relationship in 1982 because of Weintraub&#x27;s focus on other projects, Weintraub threw Denver out of his office and accused him of Nazism. Denver later told Arthur Tobier, when the latter transcribed his autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;d bend my principles to support something he wanted of me. And of course, every time you bend your principles — whether because you don&#x27;t want to worry about it, or because you&#x27;re afraid to stand up for fear of what you might lose — you sell your soul to the devil&quot;.

Denver was also a guest star on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Denver and Jim Henson that spawned two television specials with the Muppets, &quot;A Christmas Together&quot; and &quot;Rocky Mountain Holiday&quot;. He also tried acting, appearing in &quot;The Camerons are a Special Clan&quot; episode of the &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot; television series in October 1973 and &quot;The Colorado Cattle Caper&quot; episode of the &quot;McCloud&quot; television series in February 1974. In 1977, Denver starred in the hit comedy film &quot;Oh, God!&quot; opposite George Burns. He also hosted the Grammy Awards five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on several occasions. In 1975, Denver was awarded the Country Music Association&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year award. At the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year, Charlie Rich, presented the award to his successor after he set fire to the slip of paper containing the official notification of the award. Some speculated Rich was protesting the selection of a non-traditional country artist for the award, but Rich&#x27;s son disputes that, saying his father was drunk, taking pain medication for a broken foot, and just trying to be funny. Denver&#x27;s music was defended by country singer Kathy Mattea, who told Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;: &quot;A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way ... People forget how huge he was worldwide.&quot;

In 1977, Denver co-founded The Hunger Project with Werner Erhard and Robert W. Fuller. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. President Jimmy Carter appointed Denver to serve on the President&#x27;s Commission on World Hunger. Denver wrote the song &quot;I Want to Live&quot; as the commission&#x27;s theme song. In 1979, Denver performed &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot; at the Music for UNICEF Concert. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to UNICEF. 

Denver&#x27;s father taught him to fly in the mid-1970s, which led to their reconciliation. In 1980, Denver and his father, by then a lieutenant colonel, co-hosted an award-winning television special, &quot;The Higher We Fly: The History of Flight&quot;. It won the Osborn Award from the Aviation/Space Writers&#x27; Association, and was honored by the Houston Film Festival.

== Political views and activism ==
In the mid-1970s, Denver became outspoken in politics. He expressed his ecological interests in the epic 1975 song &quot;Calypso&quot;, an ode to the eponymous exploration ship used by Jacques Cousteau. In 1976, Denver campaigned for Jimmy Carter, who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the Democratic Party and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the African AIDS crisis. He founded the charitable Windstar Foundation in 1976 to promote sustainable living. Denver&#x27;s dismay at the Chernobyl disaster led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.

During the 1980s, Denver was critical of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration and remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987. Denver&#x27;s criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad &quot;Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)&quot;. In an open letter to the media, Denver wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President Bill Clinton for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which Denver wrote in the midst of the 1996 United States presidential election, was one of the last he ever wrote. In 1992, Denver, along with fellow singers Liza Minnelli and John Oates, performed a benefit to fight the passage of Amendment 2, an anti-LGBT ballot measure that prevented Colorado municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination protections. Denver was also on the National Space Society&#x27;s board of governors for many years.

== Later years and humanitarian efforts ==
Denver had a few more US Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. Denver began to focus more on humanitarian and sustainability causes, focusing extensively on nature conservation projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as Richard Buckminster Fuller (about whom he wrote and composed &quot;What One Man Can Do&quot;) and Amory Lovins, from whom he said he learned much. Denver also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). He also had a keen interest in solutions to world hunger and visited Africa during the 1980s to witness firsthand the suffering caused by starvation and work with African leaders toward solutions.

From 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp&#x27;s annual operating budget. During the Aspen Valley Hospital&#x27;s $1.7 million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.

In 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards, which he had previously done in 1977, 1978, and 1979. In the 1983 finale, he was joined on stage by folk music legend Joan Baez, with whom Denver led an all-star version of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;, joined by such diverse musical icons as Jennifer Warnes, Donna Summer, and Rick James.

In 1984, ABC Sports president Roone Arledge asked Denver to compose and sing the theme song for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator, as skiing was another of his enthusiasms. Denver composed &quot;The Gold and Beyond&quot;, and sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.

In 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of &quot;We Are the World&quot; but was rejected, despite his obvious genuine commitment to charity work and his musical talent. According to Ken Kragen (who helped produce the song), Denver was snubbed because many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. &quot;I didn&#x27;t agree with this assessment,&quot; Kragen said, but he reluctantly turned Denver down anyway. Denver later wrote in his 1994 autobiography &quot;Take Me Home&quot; about the rejection, &quot;It broke my heart not to be included.&quot;

For Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental television program, &quot;In Partnership With Earth,&quot; with then-EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.

Due to his love of flying, Denver was attracted to NASA and became dedicated to America&#x27;s work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the &quot;Citizens in Space&quot; program. In 1985, Denver received the NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal for &quot;helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world&quot;, an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. That same year, he passed NASA&#x27;s rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen&#x27;s trip on the Space Shuttle in 1986. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster with teacher Christa McAuliffe aboard, Denver dedicated his song &quot;Flying for Me&quot; to all astronauts, and continued to support NASA. He entered discussions with the Soviet space program about purchasing a flight aboard one of their rockets. The talks fell through after the price tag was rumored to be as high as $20 million.

Denver testified before the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee on the topic of censorship during a Parents Music Resource Center hearing in 1985. Contrary to his innocuous public image as a musician, Denver openly stood with more controversial witnesses like Dee Snider (of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister) and Frank Zappa in opposing the PMRC&#x27;s objectives. For instance, Denver described how he was censored for &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;, which was misconstrued as a drug song.

Denver also toured Russia in 1985. His eleven concerts in the USSR were the first by any American artist in more than 10 years. Denver returned two years later to perform at a benefit concert for the victims of the Chernobyl disaster.

In October 1992, Denver undertook a multiple-city tour of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He also released a greatest-hits CD, &quot;Homegrown&quot;, to raise money for homeless charities. In 1994, he published his autobiography, &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, in which he candidly spoke of his cannabis, LSD, and cocaine use, marital infidelities, and history of domestic violence. In 1996, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 1997, Denver filmed an episode for the television series &quot;Nature&quot;, centering on the natural wonders that inspired many of his best-loved songs. His last song, &quot;Yellowstone, Coming Home&quot;, composed while rafting along the Colorado River with his son and young daughter, is included. In the summer of 1997, shortly before his death, Denver recorded a children&#x27;s train album for Sony Pictures Kids Zone, &quot;All Aboard!&quot;, produced by longtime friend Roger Nichols. The album consisted of old-fashioned swing, big band, folk, bluegrass, and gospel music woven into a theme of railroad songs. It won a posthumous Best Musical Album for Children Grammy, Denver&#x27;s only Grammy. His final concert was held in Corpus Christi, Texas, at the Selena Auditorium on October 5.

==Personal life==
Denver&#x27;s first marriage, in 1967, was to Annie Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She was the subject of his song &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;, which he composed in 10 minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. After the success of &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;, inspired by a camping trip with Annie and some friends, Denver bought a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and a girl, Anna Kate, who, Denver said, were &quot;meant to be&quot; theirs. Denver once said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you the best thing about me. I&#x27;m some guy&#x27;s dad; I&#x27;m some little gal&#x27;s dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate&#x27;s father, boy, that&#x27;s enough for me to be remembered by. That&#x27;s more than enough.&quot; Zachary was the subject of &quot;A Baby Just Like You&quot;, a song that included the line &quot;Merry Christmas, little Zachary&quot; which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary &quot;John Denver: Country Boy&quot; (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Martell said they were too young and immature to deal with Denver&#x27;s sudden success. To drive home the point that their assets were being split in the divorce, he cut their marital bed in half with a chainsaw.

Denver married Australian actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988 after a two-year courtship. Settling at Denver&#x27;s home in Aspen, the couple had a daughter, Jesse Belle. Denver and Delaney separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993. Of his second marriage, Denver said that &quot;before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the valley to the other&quot;.

In 1993, Denver pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge and was placed on probation. In August 1994, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen. Though a July 1997 trial resulted in a hung jury on the second DUI charge, prosecutors later decided to reopen the case, which was closed only after Denver&#x27;s accidental death in October 1997. In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determined that Denver was medically disqualified from operating an aircraft due to his failure to abstain from alcohol; in October 1995, following Denver&#x27;s drunk-driving conviction, the FAA had directed Denver to abstain from alcohol if he wished to continue flying airplanes.

Beyond music, Denver&#x27;s artistic interests included painting, but because of his limiting schedule, Denver pursued photography, saying once, &quot;photography is a way to communicate a feeling.&quot; An exhibition of over 40 never-before-seen photographs taken by Denver debuted at the Leon Gallery in Denver, Colorado, in 2014.

Denver was also an avid skier and golfer, but his principal interest was in flying. Denver&#x27;s love of flying was second only to his love of music. In 1974, Denver bought a Learjet to fly himself to concerts. He was a collector of vintage biplanes and owned a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 Centurion airplanes, and a 1997 amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ.

On April 21, 1989, Denver was in a plane accident while taxiing down the runway at Holbrook Municipal Airport in his vintage 1931 biplane. Denver had stopped to refuel on a flight from Carefree, Arizona, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Reports stated wind gusts caught the plane, causing it to spin around and sustain extensive damage. Denver was not harmed in the incident.

==Death==

Denver died on the afternoon of October 12, 1997, when his light homebuilt aircraft, a Rutan Long-EZ with registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. He was the plane&#x27;s only occupant. The official cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma resulting from the crash.

Denver was a pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience. He had pilot ratings for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider and instrument. Denver also held a type rating in his Learjet. He had recently purchased the Long-EZ aircraft, made by someone else from a kit, and had taken a half-hour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before the crash.

Denver was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash. In previous years, he had been arrested several times for drunk driving. In 1996, nearly a year before the crash, the FAA learned that Denver had failed to maintain sobriety by not refraining entirely from alcohol and revoked his medical certification. However, it was determined that the crash was not caused or influenced by alcohol use; an autopsy found no signs of alcohol or other drugs in Denver&#x27;s body.

The post-crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) showed that the leading cause of the crash was Denver&#x27;s inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane&#x27;s flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane&#x27;s designer to be between the pilot&#x27;s legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot&#x27;s left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot&#x27;s seat and was not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver&#x27;s plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.

Before the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of Vise-Grip pliers, but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials&#x27; post-crash investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve&#x27;s positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one&#x27;s right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (nose right) and pitch up.

The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was &quot;less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank&quot;. He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft, saying that he would only be flying for about an hour.

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver&#x27;s last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos. Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane&#x27;s altitude between when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;backfire&quot; accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.

In addition to Denver&#x27;s failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the crash. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder&#x27;s decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place. The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.

==Legacy==

Upon the announcement of Denver&#x27;s death, Colorado Governor Roy Romer ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff in his honor. Funeral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in Aurora, Colorado, on October 17, 1997, officiated by Pastor Les Felker, a retired Air Force chaplain, after which Denver&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes scattered in the Rocky Mountains. Further tributes were made at the following Grammy and Country Music Association Awards.

In 1998, Denver posthumously received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Folk Music Association, which also established a new award in his honor.

In 2000, CBS presented the television film &quot;Take Me Home: The John Denver Story&quot; loosely based on his memoirs, starring Chad Lowe as Denver. The &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote, &quot;An overachiever like John Denver couldn&#x27;t have been this boring&quot;. 

 That same year on April 22, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Kempton, Pennsylvania dedicated a bench that was funded by donations as a tribute to his memory for that year&#x27;s Earth Day. The bench sits on the South Lookout of the sanctuary.

On September 23, 2007, nearly 10 years after Denver&#x27;s death, his brother Ron witnessed the dedication of a plaque placed near the crash site in Pacific Grove, California.

Copies of DVDs of Denver&#x27;s many television appearances are now sought-after collectibles, especially his one-hour specials from the 1970s and his six-part series for Britain&#x27;s BBC, &quot;The John Denver Show&quot;. An anthology musical featuring Denver&#x27;s music, &quot;Back Home Again: A John Denver Holiday&quot;, premiered at the Rubicon Theatre Company in 2006.

On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver&#x27;s trademark 1972 hit &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; one of the state&#x27;s two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, &quot;Where the Columbines Grow&quot;. The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Representative Debbie Stafford that the song reflected drug use, most specifically in the line &quot;friends around the campfire and everybody&#x27;s high&quot;. Senator Bob Hagedorn, who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as having nothing to do with drugs, but rather everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado&#x27;s mountain vistas. Senator Nancy Todd said, &quot;John Denver to me is an icon of what Colorado is&quot;.
On September 24, 2007, the California Friends of John Denver and The Windstar Foundation unveiled a bronze plaque near the spot where his plane went down. The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved by Jeffrey Pine with Denver&#x27;s name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially, the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of Denver&#x27;s family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a bas-relief of the singer&#x27;s face and lines from his song &quot;Windsong&quot;: &quot;So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers. Follow her summons when she calls again.&quot;

To mark the 10th anniversary of Denver&#x27;s death, his family released a set of previously unreleased recordings of his 1985 concert performances in the Soviet Union. This two-CD set, &quot;John Denver – Live in the USSR&quot;, was produced by Roger Nichols and released by AAO Music. These digital recordings were made during 11 concerts and then rediscovered in 2002. Included in this set is a previously unpublished rendition of &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; in Russian. The collection was released November 6, 2007.

On October 13, 2009, a DVD box set of previously unreleased concerts recorded throughout Denver&#x27;s career was released by Eagle Rock Entertainment. &quot;Around the World Live&quot; is a 5-disc DVD set featuring three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977, Japan in 1981, and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984 and performances at Farm Aid from 1985, 1987, and 1990. The final disc has two-hour-long documentaries made by Denver.

On April 21, 2011, Denver became the first inductee into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame. A benefit concert was held at Broomfield&#x27;s 1stBank Center and hosted by Olivia Newton-John. Other performers participating in the event included the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lee Ann Womack, and John Oates. Both his ex-wives attended, and the award was presented to his three children.

The John Denver &quot;Spirit&quot; sculpture is a 2002 bronze sculpture statue by artist Sue DiCicco that was financed by Denver&#x27;s fans. It is at the Colorado Music Hall of Fame at Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; the official state song of West Virginia. Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8. Denver is only the second person, along with Stephen Foster, to have written two state songs.

On October 24, 2014, Denver was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California.

Denver began his recording career with The Mitchell Trio (the name &quot;Chad&quot; being legally dropped from the group&#x27;s name upon the departure of its namesake founder); his distinctive voice can be heard where he sings solo on &quot;Violets of Dawn&quot;, among other songs. He recorded three albums with the Trio, replacing Chad Mitchell as high tenor. Denver also wrote a number of songs that were covered by the group, such as his hits &quot;For Bobbi&quot;, &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;, as well as &quot;Deal with The Ladies&quot; (later recorded on his 1988 album, &quot;Higher Ground&quot;) and &quot;Stay With Me&quot;. The group Denver, Boise, and Johnson, which had evolved from The Chad Mitchell Trio, released a single before he moved on to a solo career. The Trio also performed at college campuses across the United States.

Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, billed as Fat City and credited as co-writers of Denver&#x27;s song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, were close friends of Denver and his family, appearing as singers and songwriters on many of Denver&#x27;s albums until they formed the Starland Vocal Band in 1976. The band&#x27;s albums were released on Denver&#x27;s Windsong Records label, later known as Windstar Records.

Denver&#x27;s solo recording contract resulted in part from the recording by Peter, Paul, and Mary of his song &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;, which became the sole number-one hit single for the group. Denver recorded songs by Tom Paxton, Eric Andersen, John Prine, David Mallett, and many others in the folk scene. His record company, Windstar, is still an active record label today. Country singer John Berry considers Denver the greatest influence on his own music and has recorded Denver&#x27;s hit &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; with the original arrangement.

Olivia Newton-John, an Australian singer whose across-the-board appeal to pop, middle-of-the-road, and country audiences in the mid-1970s was similar to Denver&#x27;s, lent her distinctive backup vocals to Denver&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;Fly Away&quot;; she performed the song with Denver on his 1975 &quot;Rocky Mountain Christmas&quot; special. She also covered his &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, and had a hit in the United Kingdom (#15 in 1973) and Japan (#6 in a belated 1976 release) with it. In 1976, Denver and Newton-John appeared as guest stars on &quot;The Carpenters&#x27; First Television Special&quot;, a one-hour special broadcast on the ABC television network.

=== Alaska, the American Child ===
Alaska, the American Child is a documentary by John Denver. The filmed was funded heavily by John Denver but received some assistance from ABC. The film was designed to gather support in Congress for H-39, which would have classified 95 million acres of federal-owned land in Alaska as parks and wildlife refuges.

In the documentary, he travels through the State, showcasing its natural beauty, and the people who call Alaska home including Alaska Natives and bush pilots. He starts the documentary off, and ends it, with the song American Child. Two other songs of his are included in the documentary.

<doc id="58588" wikidata="Q791938" url="?curid=58588" title="Axe historique">
<text>The Axe historique (; &quot;historical axis&quot;) refers to a straightly aligned series of thoroughfare streets, squares, monuments and buildings that extend from the centre of Paris, France, to the west-northwest of the city. It is also known as the Voie Triomphale (; &quot;triumphal way&quot;).

==History==
The &quot;Axe historique&quot; began with the creation of the Champs-Élysées, designed in the 17th century to create a vista to the west, extending the central axis of the gardens to the royal Tuileries Palace. Today the Tuileries Garden (&quot;Jardin des Tuileries&quot;) remain, preserving their wide central pathway, though the palace was burned down during the Paris Commune, 1871.

Between the Tuileries Garden and the Champs-Élysées extension a jumble of buildings remained on the site of the Place de la Concorde until early in the reign of Louis XV, for whom the square was at first named. Then the garden axis could open through a grand gateway into the new royal square.

To the east, the Tuileries Palace faced an open square, the Place du Carrousel. There, by order of Napoleon, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel was centered on the palace (and so on the same axial line that was developing beyond the palace). Long-standing plans to link the Louvre Palace, as the disused palace was called, with the Tuileries, by sweeping away the intervening buildings, finally came to fruition in the early 19th century. Consequently, the older axis extending from the courtyard of the Louvre is slightly skewed to the rest of what has become the &quot;Axe historique,&quot; but the &quot;Arc du Carrousel&quot;, at the fulcrum between the two, serves to disguise the discontinuity.

To the west, the completion of the Arc de Triomphe in 1836 on the Place de l&#x27;Étoile at the western end of the Champs-Élysées formed the far point of this line of perspective, which now starts at the equestrian statue of Louis XIV placed by I.M. Pei adjacent to his Louvre Pyramid in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre.

The axis was extended again westwards along the Avenue de la Grande Armée, past the city boundary of Paris to La Défense. This was originally a large junction, named for a statue commemorating the defence of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War.

In the 1950s, the area around La Défense was marked out to become a new business district, and high-rise office buildings were built along the avenue. The axis found itself extended yet again, with ambitious projects for the western extremity of the modern plaza.

It was not until the 1980s, under president François Mitterrand, that a project was initiated, with a modern 20th century version of the Arc de Triomphe. This is the work of Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen, La Grande Arche de la Fraternité (also known as simply La Grande Arche or L&#x27;Arche de la Défense), a monument to humanity and humanitarian ideals rather than militaristic victories. It was inaugurated in 1989.

The network of railway lines and road tunnels beneath the elevated plaza of La Défense prevented the pillars supporting the arch from being exactly in line with the axis: it is slightly out of line, bending the axis should it be extended further to the west. From the roof of the Grande Arche, a second axis can be seen: the Tour Montparnasse stands exactly behind the Eiffel Tower.
The &quot;Seine-Arche&quot; project is extending the historical axis to the west through the city of Nanterre, but with a slight curve.

==Solar alignment==
As a natural consequence of the nature of the line, the sun sets behind the Grande Arche twice per year, in a phenomenon dubbed &quot;Paris henge&quot;.

<doc id="58589" wikidata="Q2343619" url="?curid=58589" title="Name change">
<text>Name change is the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their current name.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, common law jurisdictions have looser procedures for a name change while civil law jurisdictions are more restrictive. While some civil law jurisdictions have loosened procedures, a few remain complicated.

A pseudonym is a name used in addition to the original or true name. This does not require legal sanction. Pseudonyms are generally adopted to conceal a person&#x27;s identity, but may also be used for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one&#x27;s name==

* Marriage or civil partnership (e.g. Andrew Jones marries Tiffany Rodriguez and assumes her surname, becoming Andrew Rodriguez)
* Adoption, or marriage of a custodial parent
* Divorce or estrangement of parents
* Immigration / adaptation of the name to a different language or script (e.g. Samantha Ogden became Shilpa Ojha on becoming an Indian national)
* General dislike of one&#x27;s name
* To evade the law or a debt or commit fraud
* To avoid a stalker or harassment
* Religious conversion or deconversion, ordination or return to lay status (e.g., Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali upon conversion to Islam, Ibrahim Yassin to Avraham Sinai upon converting to Judaism)
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name Henry Lizardlover)
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (for example Augustus Pitt Rivers was required to adopt that surname when he inherited from his cousin, Horace Pitt-Rivers; this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g., old surname Lipschitz, new surname London) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Michael Jackson, new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon Pendragon)
* To dissociate themselves from a family black sheep (e.g., relatives of Adolf Hitler).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g., changing Battenberg to Mountbatten or Jan Ludvik Hoch to Robert Maxwell).
* Commercial sponsorship, e.g., Jimmy White temporarily became Jimmy Brown for HP brown sauce. Ashley Revell became Ashley Blue Square Revell for Rank Group&#x27;s Blue Square service. Peter Janson briefly changed his name by deed poll to NGK Janson to circumvent a Motorsport Australia rule that only allowed a driver&#x27;s, and not a sponsor&#x27;s, name to be carried on a windscreen at the 1977 Bathurst 1000.
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer Save the Forests)
* To change to a fictional character&#x27;s name, (e.g., old name Tracy Darling, new name Tracy Beaker)
* To make their name more attractive or &quot;catchy&quot; so as to increase their chance of success (see Stage name)
* To circumvent election law governing what information can be provided on a ballot paper, by changing (for example) one&#x27;s middle name to a short political message (see Byron (Low Tax) Looper).
* To change the legal name to the one used in everyday life (e.g., where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To remove superstitious consequences of the old name (e.g. old name Mulyono, new name Joko Widodo)
* To better fit one&#x27;s gender identity, or as part of one&#x27;s gender transition (e.g. Samantha was his name, now he is Samuel) 
* Losing a bet - for instance, a New Zealand man changed his name to Full Metal Havok More Sexy N Intelligent Than Spock And All The Superheroes Combined With Frostnova, and apparently discovered it had been accepted when his passport expired.
* In accordance with witness protection.
* To remove associations with a slave name imposed on their ancestors. 
* To reclaim a traditional name.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognised by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable someone to change the name recorded on their passport, driving licence, tax and National Insurance records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that &quot;documentary evidence&quot; of a change of name is provided. Documents such as birth, marriage and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are considered &quot;matters of fact&quot;, which means that they were correct at the time they were issued. However, exceptions exist, such as holders of a Gender Recognition Certificate.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, decree absolute (proof of divorce), civil partnership certificate, statutory declaration or deed of change of name. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred and they do not themselves operate to change a person&#x27;s name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman&#x27;s surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one&#x27;s name for all purposes). The term &#x27;deed&#x27; is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. &#x27;Poll&#x27; is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.

===England and Wales===

People whose births are registered in England and Wales may, but are under no obligation to, have their deed poll enrolled at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

===Scotland===
Residents of Scotland can change their name by deed poll or statutory declaration. Scottish-born/adopted people may optionally apply to the Registrar General for Scotland to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated. There is also an alternative route to changing one&#x27;s name in Scotland, equivalent to enrolling a deed poll with the College of Arms; one may petition the Court of the Lord Lyon for a name change and subsequently receive a Certificate of Recognition of Change of Name.

===Historical usage===

From the medieval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates, on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus, the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making.

Such changes were also more rarely demanded by marriage settlements, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter&#x27;s dowry her husband should adopt his father-in-law&#x27;s surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family&#x27;s name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private act of Parliament or by obtaining a royal licence.

Well known examples are:
* Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d. 1341) of Kingston Russell, Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, &quot;Warbelton v Gorges&quot; in 1347.
* Smithson to Percy (18th century). Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet (1715–1786) in 1740 married Lady Elizabeth Seymour, daughter and sole heiress of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d. 1722), daughter and sole heiress of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private act of Parliament, the Hugh Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s Name and Arms Act 1749 (23 Geo. 2. c. &quot;14&quot; ), Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title Earl of Northumberland and was later created Duke of Northumberland.

A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname &quot;in addition to&quot; his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the &quot;double-barrelled&quot;, even the &quot;triple-barrelled&quot; name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy &quot;squirearchy&quot; with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

== Canada ==
In Canada, name changes are handled through the vital statistics bureaux of the various provinces and territories, except in Nunavut, where they are handled by the Courts.

All Canadian provinces and territories allow their residents, whether Citizens, Permanent Residents or Temporary Residents, to obtain a name change, provided they fulfil the pertinent regulations (e.g. time lived in province). Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction, has historically had substantial differences from the common law jurisdictions comprising the rest of Canada in how it permits its residents to obtain a change of name—for example, requiring them to be citizens, which was abolished on January 28, 2021, due to a Superior Court of Quebec decision.

All Canadian provinces except Quebec also recognize common law name changes—i.e. by &quot;general usage&quot;—even if not registered with the government or ordered by a court. Although a common law name change is still a legal name, formal processes may be required to obtain government-issued ID or change the name on accounts (like banks) that depend on government ID; this is one situation where a person may have more than one name.

Quebec also historically had other strict regulations regarding name changes. For example, the transgender Quebecker Micheline Montreuil had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the Directeur de l&#x27;état civil refused to permit the change on the grounds that someone who was legally assigned male at birth could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her registered gender because that required proof of a completed gender confirmation surgery, which was not the case for her. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeals ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was registered as male from legally adopting a woman&#x27;s name.

Another issue specific to Quebec is married names. Because of the Quebec Charter of Rights, married women in Quebec have been unable to adopt their spouse&#x27;s surname since 1976. Other provinces allow their residents to change their last name on the strength of their marriage certificate. The Directeur de l&#x27;état civil will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole to legally change their names by temporarily moving to another Canadian province or territory, which follow more permissive common law rules.

Additionally, Saskatchewan registers changes of name made outside its jurisdiction and issues a &quot;Registration of Change of Name Effected Outside the Province of Saskatchewan&quot;.

==United States==
In the United States, state laws regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including &quot;Lindon v. First National Bank&quot;. In &quot;Christianson v. King County&quot;, 239 U.S. 356 (1915), the Supreme Court accepted a name changed using the common law method as a legal name (more detail of the decision accepted by the Supreme Court is found at 196 F. 791 (1912)).
Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. , 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change. Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a court order is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a state court), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change.

Where a court process is used, it is necessary to plead that the name change is not for a fraudulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a lien or debt or for defaming someone else. Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited judicial discretion to deny a change of name: usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or immoral purposes. In 2004, a Missouri man succeeded in changing his name to &quot;They&quot;. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a name change to &quot;1069&quot; could be denied, but that &quot;Ten Sixty-Nine&quot; was acceptable (&quot;Application of Dengler&quot;, 1979); the North Dakota Supreme Court had denied the same request several years before (&quot;Petition of Dengler&quot;, 1976).

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity&#x27;s name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a racial slur, a threat, or an obscenity.

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a hyphenated surname, or some combination of parts of both surnames). This is usually done without court proceedings.
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a maiden name) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under U.S. nationality law, when immigrants apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grant of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more Americanized names. During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a federal court. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of law enforcement. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a federal court naturalizes an applicant.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The &quot;open and notorious&quot; use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an assumed name. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one&#x27;s legal name can be registered with a county clerk, secretary of state, or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under pseudonyms; such a right is protected under case law pursuant to the United States Constitution.

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed without formality and for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name. In most states, a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method, unless the statute makes itself exclusive. A person may sue under a common law name.

In California the &quot;usage method&quot; (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name. Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively. Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person&#x27;s name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, &quot;Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.&quot; Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a &quot;preferred name&quot; instead of one&#x27;s legal name. This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student ID cards.

===Official registration===
The legal name change process is usually different from simple usage and includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the Social Security Administration (generally following statutory law, not common law), Bureau of Consular Affairs (for passports), the Federal Communications Commission, the Selective Service System and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver&#x27;s license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time, and some state motor vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes, by first registering a new name with the Social Security office.

The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner&#x27;s civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (&quot;e.g.&quot;, intellectual property rights) of others.

=== Forcible name changes ===
In 1887, the Dawes Act directed that Indigenous Americans adopt a surname. This forcible solidification of individual identities, in pursuance of Western legal and political orders, assisted in the federal government&#x27;s efforts to remove their ownership of communally-held land.

More recently, recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals have been forced to revert to the names on their birth registration documents by USCIS, even where this does not match the name they have been using all their life in the United States. This is especially true with DACA recipients from Spanish-speaking countries, whereby two last names appear on birth registration documents per Spanish naming customs. Even where the person has only ever used one surname (typically that of the father), USCIS forces them to revert to both surnames, creating a discrepancy in matters such as academic records and credit ratings.

==Other common law jurisdictions==

=== Australia ===

Individuals may legally change their name through the state and territory governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled &quot;Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages&quot;. Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate) and in some states, changes may only be made once a year. A state/territory&#x27;s RBDM typically has jurisdiction over changes of name for people born in that state or territory, and for people born overseas now residing in that state or territory. Residents born interstate must typically apply to the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages (RBDM) of their birth jurisdiction for a change of name, though there are exceptions.

If a person&#x27;s birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person&#x27;s birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued birth certificate if born in Australia and/or &quot;Change of Name Certificate&quot;. Transgender residents born overseas may receive a recognised details certificate or identity acknowledgment certificate. These certificates are recognised secure identity documents and can be verified electronically through the Attorney-general of Australia&#x27;s Document Verification Service.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.
In India, name change legal process may be completed either publishing in State Government Gazette or Central Government Gazette. It is always preferred that one should opt for Central Govt. Gazette since it is valid all over world. Central Government Gazette process is explained here. There are four easy steps to complete the task. First, one has to make an affidavit on a Non-judicial stamp-paper. Get notarised. Second, publish in a newspaper about the change of name. Third, fill-in the required forms and attach affidavit and newspaper. Pay the government fee online. Attach the receipt also. Fourth and last step is submit the application. In certain States gazette application may be submitted online but most of the States and Central Government there is no online name change facility. One can either personally visit the concerned office and submit or may send by post. The Central Government Gazette office is located at Civil Lines, Near Delhi Metro Station, New Delhi. The office works from Monday to Friday only. For more details one can visit their website. After submission of application one can download the same from their website.

===Hong Kong===

It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their legal English name is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the Immigration Department which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, a person earns their name by &quot;use and repute&quot;. For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. This was the traditional practice for a bride adopting her husband&#x27;s surname. A change of name deed poll is not required, but provides documentary evidence of a name change. Resident non-EU nationals must apply to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for a deed poll. The deed poll requires a witness affidavit, and may optionally be enrolled in the High Court upon payment of stamp duty. An enrolled deed poll is required for some administrative name changes, such as on a driving licence or when changing legal gender.

There is a second option using an &#x27;unenrolled&#x27; deed poll, this is a regular deed poll that is signed by yourself in the presence of a witness over 18. This can be used to update your name in banks, schools and other non-governmental institutions. This is the long process as the Irish Passport Office and NDLS require two years of &#x27;proof of usage&#x27; e.g bank statements in your new name dating back two years in order to change your name in comparison to a registered deed poll which allows you to change your name in the NDLS instantly along with DESAP.

=== Malaysia ===
Name changes in Malaysia are done at the local office of National Registration Department (JPN). Name changes for children require Malaysian identity cards (MyKad) of both parents, wedding certificates, birth certificate, and MyKid if exists. For name changes at will, a statutory declaration must be signed first, and the JPN.KP16 form is to be filled up at the JPN office.

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, New Zealanders can change their name by making a statutory declaration and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by deed poll.

==Civil law jurisdictions==
In general, unlike in common law countries, names cannot be changed at will in civil law jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of personal identification numbers, that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.

===Belgium===
Changes in law Aug 2018 changes first name and fee will fall under the authority of local town hall In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: &quot;Arrêté royal&quot;, Dutch: &quot;Koninklijk besluit&quot;) for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further their integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing them great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren (&quot;born naked&quot;), and Clooten (&quot;sods of earth&quot; in Middle Dutch, but &quot;testicles&quot; in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity

===Brazil===
In Brazil, legal name changes are regulated by the Public Records Act (Law No. 6,015/1973) and can be requested by any person registered on a Brazilian civil registry office, through a court order or directly on a civil registry office, depending on the case.

People over the age of majority (18 years) may change their given names without specifying a reason. The change of given name directly on a civil registry office can be done only once, and to revert the change, a court order is required.

A person&#x27;s surnames can be changed directly on a civil registry office, in the following circumstances:
* inclusion of family surnames;
* inclusion of the spouse&#x27;s or partner&#x27;s surname following marriage or stable union;
* exclusion of the spouse&#x27;s or partner&#x27;s surname following divorce or extinction of a stable union;
* inclusion or exclusion of surnames following change of filiation;
* for stepchildren, the inclusion of the surname of the stepmother or stepfather, as long as there are justifiable reasons and consent from the stepparent whose surname is being included.

===Indonesia===
Unlike other countries, the legal procedures for name change in Indonesia are very complicated. The photocopies of many personal documents are required, including a family register, an identity card, a marriage book, a diploma, a birth certificate, a land ownership certificate, a saving book, and a motor vehicle ownership book. Then, an order by local court is required to change the name. A minimum of two witnesses in the court are required. Changing a name in a birth certificate, especially of a minor, requires the photocopies of identity cards of both parents, and a letter of known birth.

However, correcting one&#x27;s name spelling (i.e. inconsistent) is much easier, it is only required to bring personal documents with the correct one to the civil registry.

===Netherlands===
While name changes due to marriages performed in the Netherlands cannot be processed, it is certainly possible in the Netherlands to process name changes due to marriages performed outside the Netherlands, provided certain conditions are met: the marriage must be registered abroad, the application for name change abroad must be requested on the same date as the marriage date, the changed name must be recorded abroad on a certificate in accordance with the local rules of the foreign country, and the marriage and name change as well as proof of application as of the date of the marriage must be legalized/apostilled and provided to the Dutch consulate or Dutch municipality upon return to the Netherlands.

The reason is that international marriages are not necessarily governed by Dutch Law but by Private International Law which is codified in the Netherlands in the &quot;Commoner&#x27;s Law Book&quot; (Burgerlijk Wetboek) Book No. 10, Private International Law, Title 2 – The Name, Article 24.

===Norway===

Although it has always been relatively easy to change one&#x27;s legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents&#x27; names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law. It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.

The first name or nickname on the civil register may be changed under any of the following circumstances:
* when the first name or nickname on the civil register is ridiculous, tainted with dishonor or extremely difficult to pronounce;
* when the new first name or nickname has been used habitually and continuously by the applicant and they have been publicly known by the new first name or nickname in the community; or
* when the change will avoid confusion.

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, Philippines jurisprudence requires full-blown court lawsuit, that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The Supreme Court of the Philippines Justice Leonardo Quisumbing on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, to change the name on his birth certificate to read Jeff, and his legal gender to male.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil Roman Dutch law, mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in South Africa are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the Department of Home Affairs. An individual&#x27;s surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a &quot;good and sufficient reason&quot; for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband&#x27;s surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective Cantonal government, if there are important reasons (&quot;wichtige Gründe&quot; / &quot;justes motifs&quot;) for the change, according to article 30 of the Swiss Civil Code. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. According to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the &quot;Name Act&quot; bans changing one&#x27;s legal name for some criminal reasons per Article 15 since 2015 (Article 12 since 2001). Otherwise, one may change the surname, given name, or both per Article 8, 9, or 10 since 2015 (Article 5, 6, or 7 since 1953, or Article 6, 7, or 8 since 2001).

Changing the given name is allowed if:
*Having the same name when serving or studying in the same institution or school.
*Since 1983, having the same given name as one&#x27;s parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.
*Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
*Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example 陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng), a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 (:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)) but also a Taiwanese statesman (Chen Chin-hsing).
*Since 2015, acknowledgement by father or adoption starts or ends.
*Having special reasons, which is limited to thrice since 2015 (twice since 2001) in one&#x27;s lifetime, while the second given name change of this type requires the age of majority.

====Replacing documents====
Diplomas, work experience documents, licenses, permits, and other such documents shall use a person&#x27;s legal name to avoid being deemed invalid, so those intending to change names have to note that:

Licensed Taiwanese driver who legally changes the name without reporting to the competent traffic authority is fined 300 to 600 new Taiwan dollars and asked to re-register the legal name.

Taiwan passports are to be replaced after having changed the names.

Registration of change in name of the right holder having been changed after a land right has been registered, shall be applied; the same shall apply to the change of the name of administrator.

====Overseas application====

A national without household registration may apply for name change outside Taiwan at a Taiwanese diplomatic mission, but having had household registration in Taiwan may apply there only to forward a name change application to the Household Registration Office covering the last Taiwanese address of residency, which is a better method only if no risk of discrepancies among Taiwanese documents, so anyone having considerable Taiwanese documents should still change the name in person at Taiwanese Household Registration Office, to also replace the National Identification Card, healthcard card, driver license, etc.

=== Israel ===
Israeli law determine that every adult over the age of 18 that does not have a guardianship can submit a request for a name change. A person who changed their name cannot change it again until 7 years passed unless they have a special approval from Minister of Interior. In case of adoption, the adopting family cannot change the child&#x27;s name unless the court ruled otherwise. In case of marriage, a person can change their last name, change back to the maiden name or add their spouse&#x27;s last name to theirs at any time. A minor whom parents changed their last name gets the new last name of their parents, and a minor that one of their parents changed their last name to match the other parent get the mutual last name, the minister is allowed to disapprove the new name if they believe the name may be misleading or offensive. The minister is not allowed to disapprove a name change if the name was chosen to accommodate Common-law marriage.

In case of a minor who want to change their first name, may do this with a detailed reason for the change of name, and a consent from both their parents and a verbal and written consent of the child, if the minor is under 10 years old the child doesn&#x27;t need to come with the parents to change their name.

An adult convicted of a sex offense isn&#x27;t allowed to change their name as part of &quot;the public protection law against committing sex offenses&quot;.

==Name change on religious conversion==

Adherents of various religions change their name upon conversion or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new &quot;Dharma name&quot;, which marks their &quot;taking refuge&quot;.

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on baptism or (in some countries) confirmation.
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a religious institute take on a name in religion is still observed by Eastern Orthodox and some traditional Roman Catholics. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* Popes take a papal name upon their accession to office; for example, Jorge M. Bergoglio adopted the name Francis.

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called Shudhikaran (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become Hindu may be optionally given a new Dharma (religious) name, which is usually based on Sanskrit or Indian name such as names based on Hindu deities.

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a theophoric name in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay&#x27;s adoption of the name Muhammad Ali is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens&#x27; change to Yusuf Islam and Malcolm Little&#x27;s adoption of the name Malcolm X and later &quot;El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz&quot;. On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did Dave Chappelle.
*Women do not normally take their husbands&#x27; surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone&#x27;s chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of surname:
** The first kind comes from the father&#x27;s first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as &quot;ibn Abdullah&quot; means &quot;son of Abdullah&quot;, or &quot;bint Abdullah&quot; means &quot;daughter of Abdullah&quot;. Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
** The second kind is associated with clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation and is also solely dependent on the person&#x27;s patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
* The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one&#x27;s biological father.

===Judaism===

* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes. Converts to Judaism choose a Hebrew name. Full Jewish names include a patronym: converts take the patronym &quot;ben/bat Avraham Avinu&quot; (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of Abraham, the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the Sikh faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the Khalsa. Men adopt the last name Singh, while women adopt the last name Kaur.
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some Wiccans have a craft name that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

<text>Zutphen () is a city and municipality located in the province of Gelderland, Netherlands. It lies some northeast of Arnhem, on the eastern bank of the river IJssel at the point where it is joined by the Berkel. First mentioned in the 11th century, the place-name appears to mean &quot;south fen&quot; ( in modern Dutch). In 2005, the municipality of Zutphen was merged with the municipality of Warnsveld, retaining its name. In 2021, the municipality had a population of .

==History==


In about 300 AD, a Germanic settlement was the first permanent town on a complex of the low river dunes. While many such settlements were abandoned in the early Middle Ages, Zutphen, on the strategic confluence of IJssel and Berkel, stayed. After the incorporation of the IJssel lands in Charlemagne&#x27;s Francia, Zutphen became a local centre of governance under the Count of Zutphen. The Normans raided and ravaged it in 882. Afterwards, a circular fortress was built to protect the budding town against Viking attacks.

In the eleventh century, Zutphen was a royal residence for a number of years; a pfalz was built, together with a large chapter church, the predecessor of the present St. Walburgis. The counts of Zutphen acquired a lot of power until the line of counts became extinct in the twelfth century. After the death of her father and her brother, Ermengarde, the heiress of Zutphen married the count of Guelders; her son Henry I, Count of Guelders was the first to have both titles.

The settlement received town rights between 1191 and 1196, allowing it to self govern and have a judicial court. One of the oldest towns in the country, only Utrecht and Deventer preceded it in receiving town rights. Zutphen, in turn, became the mother town of several other towns in Guelders, such as Arnhem, Doetinchem, Doesburg, Lochem, Harderwijk, Venlo and Emmerich. It also became part of the Hanseatic League, a group of towns with great wealth; this league was the economic centre in that part of Europe.

During the 12th century, coins were minted in Zutphen by the Counts of Guelders and Zutphen: Henry I (–1181) and Otto I (1182–1207). Although the city had minting rights for a few centuries, this was only actively used during four periods: 1478–1480, 1582–1583, 1604–1605 and 1687–1692.

The largest and oldest church of the city is the St. Walburgis (Saint Walpurga) church, which originally dates from the eleventh century. The present Gothic building contains monuments of the former counts of Zutphen, a fourteenth-century candelabrum, an elaborate copper font (1527), and a monument to the Van Heeckeren family (1700). The chapter-house&#x27;s library () contains a pre-Reformation collection, including some valuable manuscripts and incunabula. It is considered one of only five remaining medieval libraries in Europe (in England and Italy). This chained library&#x27;s books are still chained to their ancient wooden desk – a custom from centuries ago, when the &quot;public library&quot; used chains to prevent theft.

Having been fortified, the town withstood several sieges, especially during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the most celebrated fight under its walls being the Battle of Zutphen in September 1586 when Sir Philip Sidney was mortally wounded. Taken by the Spanish in 1587 by the treachery of the English commander Rowland York, Zutphen was recovered by Maurice, Prince of Orange, in the 1591 siege, and except for two short periods, one in 1672 and the other during the French Revolutionary Wars, it has since remained a part of the Netherlands. Its fortifications were dismantled in 1874. In World War II, the town was bombed several times by the allied forces because the bridge over the IJssel was vital to support the German troops at Arnhem after the Operation Market Garden. After two weeks of battle, the town was liberated on 14 April 1945. After the war, a renovation program started. Nowadays, Zutphen has one of the best-preserved medieval town centres of northwestern Europe, including the remains of the medieval town wall and a few hundred buildings dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.

==Modern city==

The old center survived the Second World War almost in its entirety despite the bombing of Zutphen. However, some parts of the city were lost, especially the area around the railway station, in the northern part of the city centre, known as the (English: New City). The city center includes many monumental buildings dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, and some even date back to the 13th century, such as a retirement home area. There are also remains of the old town walls in several places.

Today, Zutphen is a modern small city. The urban area, which includes the village of Warnsveld, has about 51,000 inhabitants. Food shops are open from 8:30; Other stores are open from 9:30 to 18:00 on weekdays, on Friday evenings until 21:00 and on Saturdays until 17:00. Some stores open earlier, and the larger supermarkets usually stay open until 22:00.

== Culture ==
=== Interesting buildings and squares ===
Because Zutphen contains many historical buildings with a tower, Zutphen is often called the tower city. As there are almost no modern high-rise buildings in the city centre, the historical tower spires are very visible and form the skyline. The title of &#x27;tower city&#x27; is often used in advertising to draw tourists.

==== Religious architecture ====
The was built as a Roman collegiate church around 1050 and initiated by the Bishop Burchard of Utrecht in 1105. After that, between 1200 and 1270, the church was rebuilt to a Romano-Gothic basilica. Later in the 14th century additional parts were added. After a fire in the belfry in 1446, the stone tower was remodelled between 1482–1484 where a large needle spire was added, resulting in a total height of 107.5 meters. Higher than the Dom Tower of Utrecht which was 104 meters at the time, though, after a lightning strike in 1600 which resulted in a destructive fire, the current tower is 76 meters tall after restorations in 1633. There are six bells in the tower, which are still rung by hand.

Since 1561 a library called the Librije was added to the church. It was founded as a public library for the rich citizens of Zutphen. The library contains an important collection of 15th to 17th century books.

The Broederen (brothers) church is a largely early 14th-century monastery church of the Dominican order. Since 1983 the church has been used as the city&#x27;s public library, and it has recently been extensively restored. On top of the church, a roof turret from 1771 contains the porter&#x27;s bell. This bell is still rung every day between 9:50 and 22:00 the time at which, until 1853, the city gates would be closed.

The Nieuwstadt (new city) church houses the Catholic community. It was founded as a parish church around 1250. Since then, it has been expanded, remodelled and restored many times. It has four original medieval bells.

==== Civic architecture ====
The Drogenaps tower was built between 1444 and 1446 as a city gate. In 1465 the entrance was bricked up, after which it became known as a tower instead of a gate. City musician Tonis Drogenap lived there around 1555, and the tower&#x27;s current name is derived from him. From 1888 to 1927, the tower was used as a water tower.

The Wijnhuis (Winery) Tower was built between 1618 and 1642 by the city master builder Emond Hellenraet, influenced by Hendrick de Keyser. In 1644 the brothers Pieter and François Hemony made the world&#x27;s first correctly tuned carillon for this tower. During the summer months, carillon concerts are regularly held.

The Bourgonje tower was a defensive turret built in 1457. It was built during the Gelderland-Burgundian war. In this tower, the Dutch theologian and philosopher wrote his &quot;Katechismus der Natuur&quot; (Catechism of Nature).

The Berkel gate is part of the city wall on the east side of the medieval city. This gate over the river Berkel connected the old and new cities. It was built in 1320. It also had a western counterpart, but that gate was demolished in 1772.

==== Other interesting sights in Zutphen ====
The city of Zutphen had almost 400 national monuments and over 500 local monuments. It is one of the most important and well-preserved historical city centers in the Netherlands. Zutphen has a great many medieval, especially 14th-century, houses. These houses, often with ornamental facades, can be seen throughout the city center. 
There are several large 18th and 19th century buildings near the old city market that used to belong to well-to-do citizens and merchants.

==Regional center==
===Juridical center===
Zutphen, although relatively small, is a center for Dutch legal institutions. Zutphen houses one of the 13 Dutch courts, as well as the national training institution for judges and public prosecutors (SSR), the national police academy for senior police investigators, three prisons, and a large number of lawyers. The early emergence of Zutphen in the Middle Ages as the main town of a county explains its prominent position in the juridical system.

Besides a &#x27;normal&#x27; prison, the JPC de Sprengen penitentiary facility for boys is also located in Zutphen. There are several buildings: new institutions replacing the old facilities, but the old prisons remained open after the completion of the new facilities. Only the old prison called Lunette did not meet today&#x27;s standards and closed in 2008.

===Medical centre===
Located in Zutphen is the &quot;Spittal&quot;, location of the Gelre Ziekenhuizen (Gelre Hospitals) group. This regular hospital offers all common specialties (no cardio-thoracic or neurosurgery) and a 24/7 emergency department. It is located in the southeastern part of the town, in the district of Leesten. A sizable number of practitioners of alternative medicine are located in Zutphen.

===Educational centre===
Zutphen is home to several well-known schools for secondary education on all levels. These include the &quot;Het Stedelijk&quot; (Dalton plan education and bilingual education), &quot;Baudartius College&quot;, &quot;Vrije School Zutphen&quot;, (a &quot;Vrije School&quot; being a Waldorf School), and &quot;Isendoorn College&quot; (with bilingual education, located in Warnsveld). Students from a wide area around Zutphen learn at these schools.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Zutphen railway station is an important regional railway centre. The main electrified lines, to Deventer and Zwolle in the north, and to Arnhem and Nijmegen in the south, are run by the national railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS). The secondary lines to Winterswijk and Apeldoorn are operated by Arriva. The secondary line to Hengelo is operated by Blauwnet (a division of Syntus). The regional rail service is run by a special subsidiary of the NS. All secondary lines run diesel trains. Zutphen&#x27;s old station building (1863), upgraded in 1875, was partly destroyed during World War II. In the early 1950s a modern new station was built, a typical post-war building with concrete as its main material.
However, in October 2007, the station building was designated as a State Monument. In 2006 and 2007, the railway station area was completely renovated: a new bus terminal and an underground bicycle parking lot were constructed, and the main road leading from the railway station to the town centre was turned into a road for pedestrians and cyclists only.

===Road===
Zutphen lies 10 kilometers south of the A1 motorway, which can be entered where it passes Deventer. From there the A1 leads East to Hengelo and West past Apeldoorn to Amsterdam. Main roads are the N348 (Arnhem to Zutphen, Deventer and Ommen), N314 (Zutphen to Doetinchem), N319 (Zutphen to Vorden and Winterswijk), N345 (Zutphen to Lochem and Hengelo), N826 (Zutphen to Almen and Laren).

===Bus===
Almost all buses in and around Zutphen are Arriva. There are three internal city bus lines, and regional lines to Doetinchem, Deventer, Almen-Laren and Vorden. The bus lines towards Apeldoorn and Dieren were canceled in the past; these towns and the destinations in between can now only be reached by car or by train.

==Sister cities==
Zutphen is twinned with:
Delegations including the mayors of the cities visit each other, and developmental aid programs are in place with Satu Mare, Tartu and Villa Sandino.

<doc id="58592" wikidata="Q43668" url="?curid=58592" title="Louisville, Kentucky">
<text>Louisville is the most populous city in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, sixth-most populous city in the Southeast, and the 28th-most-populous city in the United States. By land area, it is the country&#x27;s 24th-largest city, although by population density, it is the 265th most dense city. Louisville is the historical county seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County, on the Indiana border.

Named after King Louis XVI of France, Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark, making it one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachians. With the nearby Falls of the Ohio as the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a system across 13 states.

Today, the city is known as the home of boxer Muhammad Ali, the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, the University of Louisville and its Cardinals, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company Humana. Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the city&#x27;s main commercial airport, hosts UPS&#x27;s worldwide hub.

Since 2003, Louisville&#x27;s borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County, after a city-county merger. The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, abbreviated to Louisville Metro. Despite the merger and renaming, the term &quot;Jefferson County&quot; continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including the incorporated cities outside the &quot;balance&quot; which make up Louisville proper. The city&#x27;s total consolidated population as of the 2020 United States census was 782,969. However, the balance total of 633,045 excludes other incorporated places within the county and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings.

The Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 surrounding counties, seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana. As of 2023, the MSA had a population of 1,365,557, the 43rd largest in the nation.

== Pronunciation ==
The correct pronunciation of the name of &quot;Louisville&quot; is heatedly debated. The three most popular pronunciations are, in order:
# , and

All three are generally considered acceptable; the Louisville Visitor Center says that only the rare is completely unacceptable (though it is the correct pronunciation for the name of the much smaller Louisville, Colorado). There are also acceptable hybrid ways of saying the name, such as , a mixture of the first and second pronunciations.

The dominant local pronunciation, the pronunciation is widely practiced and accepted. Some even refer to it as the &quot;only&quot; correct way to pronounce the name of the city. , while respecting the proper pronunciation of the name of the French king who gave Louisville its name, is significantly less common among locals. It is, however, frequently used by those not from the area. In 2001, local journalist and historian George H. Yater noted that older natives tended toward the second pronunciation, and that both the first and second pronunciations were used equally in local radio and television broadcasting; however, new personalities were taught that the first one was &quot;correct&quot;.

 is a less common, particularly rural way of saying the name. While it is considered acceptable, it is not as widely heard as the others.

==History==

The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area&#x27;s geography and proximity to the Falls of the Ohio River.

===Early history and founding===

Since the Falls created a barrier to river travel, settlements grew at this portage point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on Corn Island in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the community are named after him.

Two years later, in 1780, the Virginia General Assembly approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was named in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose soldiers were then aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War. Early residents lived in forts to protect themselves from raids from the local indigenous population, but they moved out by the late 1780s. In 1803, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark organized their expedition across America in the town of Clarksville, Indiana at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.
===19th century===


The city&#x27;s early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had grown to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city.

Early Louisville was a major shipping port and enslaved African Americans worked in a variety of associated trades. The city was often a point of escape for fugitive slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state.

During this point in the 1850s, the city was growing and vibrant, but that also came with negativity. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater. Ethnic tensions rose, and on August 6, 1855, known as &quot;Bloody Monday&quot;, Protestant mobs attacked German and Irish Catholic neighborhoods on election day, resulting in 22 deaths and widespread property damage. Then by 1861, the civil war had broken out. During the Civil War, Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces, which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. By the end of the war, the city of Louisville itself had not been attacked, although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Perryville and Corydon, took place nearby. After the war, returning Confederate veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over.
The first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed Churchill Downs). The Derby was originally shepherded by Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city&#x27;s founder George Rogers Clark. Horse racing had a strong tradition in Kentucky, whose Inner Bluegrass Region had been a center of breeding high-quality livestock throughout the 19th century. Ten thousand spectators watched the first Derby, which Aristides won.

On March 27, 1890, the city was devastated and its downtown nearly destroyed when what scientists now estimate was an F4 tornado tore through as part of the middle Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak. It is estimated that between 74 and 120 people were killed and 200 were injured. The damage cost the city $2.5 million (equivalent to $69 million in 2019). Established in 1896, Neighborhood House Louisville was the first settlement movement house in the state.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Following the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, freed slaves settled in a neighborhood of Louisville called Little Africa, nicknamed &quot;the gateway to the South&quot;, near the present neighborhood of Park DuValle. The neighborhood was described as a &quot;thriving community&quot; by the 1920s, and declined between the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1914, the city of Louisville passed a racially based residential zoning code, following Baltimore, Atlanta, and a handful of cities in the Carolinas. The NAACP challenged the ordinance in two cases. Two weeks after the ordinance enacted, an African-American named Arthur Harris moved into a house on a block designated for whites. He was prosecuted and found guilty. The second case was planned to create a test case. William Warley, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, tendered a purchase offer on a white block from Charles Buchanan, a white real estate agent. Warley also wrote a letter declaring his intention to build a house on that lot and reside there. With the understanding that the Louisville ordinance made it illegal for him to live there, Warley withheld payment, setting in motion a breach of contract suit by Buchanan. By 1917 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of &quot;Buchanan v. Warley&quot;. The court struck down the Louisville residential segregation ordinance, ruling that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause.

In 1917, shortly after the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, Louisville was selected as the site of Camp Zachary Taylor. Camp Taylor was one of the country&#x27;s largest World War I training camps. It was home of the 84th Infantry Division and trained over 150,000 men by the end of war, including F. Scott Fitzgerald. The camp was closed in 1921. Many of the buildings and infrastructure in the Camp Taylor neighborhood of Louisville are there as a result of the training camp.

In 1929, Louisville completed the lock and dam in the Falls of the Ohio and the city began referring to itself as &quot;where Northern enterprise and Southern hospitality meet&quot;. Between the industrial boom of that year and through the Great Depression, Louisville gained 15,000 new residents, about 3% of them black, most fleeing poverty in rural areas.

Throughout January 1937, of rain fell in Louisville, and by January 27, the Ohio River crested at a record , almost above flood stage. These events triggered the &quot;Great Flood of 1937&quot;, which lasted into early February. The flood submerged 60–70 percent of the city, caused complete loss of power for four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending on sources. Ninety people died as a result of the flood. It led to dramatic changes in where residents lived. Today, the city is protected by numerous flood walls. After the flood, the areas of high elevation in the eastern part of the city had decades of residential growth.

Louisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville&#x27;s air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to International Harvester, which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Louisville&#x27;s population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black.

Throughout the 1940s, there were more black police officers than any other Southern city, though they were allowed to patrol only black districts. This, in part, made Louisville seem like a more racially progressive city than other Southern cities, although only when black citizens accepted a lower status than white citizens. Many historians have referred to this &quot;veil&quot; of segregation as a &quot;polite&quot; racism. Historian George Wright stated that polite racism &quot;often deluded both blacks and well-meaning whites into believing that real progress was being made in their city&quot;. For example, in the city Jim Crow practices were not maintained by law so much as by custom.

Similar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.
In 1974, a major (F4) tornado hit Louisville as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states. It covered and destroyed several hundred homes in the Louisville area, causing two deaths.

Since the 1980s, many of the city&#x27;s urban neighborhoods have been revitalized into areas popular with young professionals and college students. The greatest change has occurred along the Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue and Frankfort Avenue corridors as well as the Old Louisville neighborhood. In recent years, such change has also occurred in the East Market District (NuLu).

Since the late 1990s, Downtown has experienced significant residential, tourist and retail growth, including the addition of major sports complexes KFC Yum! Center, Lynn Family Stadium and Louisville Slugger Field, conversion of waterfront industrial sites into Waterfront Park, openings of varied museums (see Museums, galleries and interpretive centers below), and the refurbishing of the former Galleria into the bustling entertainment complex Fourth Street Live!, which opened in 2004.

On March 13, 2020, four plainclothed officers from Louisville Metro Police Department executed a &quot;no-knock&quot; search warrant which led to the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman. For months afterward, Taylor&#x27;s family, members of the local community, and people around the world protested to demand that officers involved in the shooting be fired and criminally charged. These protests and demonstrations coincided and intertwined with the international George Floyd protests, as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and a broader movement of racial unrest. As a result of the incident, the police chief was fired and four officers received federal charges, but no significant systemic changes were made.

On April 10, 2023, a mass shooting occurred at the Old National Bank, killing five people, and injuring nine others. The suspect, who was a bank employee and who officials said was livestreaming the rampage, was killed by the police after exchanging fire with them.

==Geography==


Louisville and Jefferson County have a combined area of , of which is land and (4.33%) is covered by water.

Louisville is southeasterly situated along the border between Kentucky and Indiana, the Ohio River, in north-central Kentucky at the Falls of the Ohio. Louisville is an Upper South city located in a Southern state that is influenced by both Southern and Midwestern culture. It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost Northern cities in the United States.

Louisville is located in Kentucky&#x27;s outer Bluegrass region. Its development has been influenced by its location on the Ohio River, which spurred Louisville&#x27;s growth from an isolated camp site into a major shipping port. Much of the city is located on a very wide and flat floodplain surrounded by hill country on all sides. Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent flooding and disease outbreaks.

Areas generally east of I-65 are above the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped Knobs region, which is home to Jefferson Memorial Forest.

The Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 43rd largest in the United States, includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson ( with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties—seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana. Louisville&#x27;s MSA is included in the Louisville–Elizabethtown–Madison, KY–IN Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which also includes the Elizabethtown, KY MSA, as well as the Madison, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The Louisville area is near several other urban areas, especially Frankfort, Kentucky (the state&#x27;s capital); Cincinnati, Ohio (the two cities&#x27; metropolitan statistical areas almost border each other); Lexington, Kentucky; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; and the Indianapolis, Indiana area (especially Columbus, Indiana, to the north of Southern Indiana).

===Cityscape===

The downtown business district of Louisville is located immediately south of the Ohio River and southeast of the Falls of the Ohio. Major roads extend outwards from the downtown area in all directions. The airport is about south of the downtown area. The industrial sections of town are to the south and west of the airport, while most of the residential areas of the city are to the southwest, south, and east of downtown. In 2010, the 22,000-seat KFC Yum! Center was completed. Twelve of the 15 buildings in Kentucky over are located in downtown Louisville.

Another primary business and industrial district is located in the suburban area east of the city on Hurstbourne Parkway.

Louisville&#x27;s late 19th- and early 20th-century development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges of the city in 1890.

The city&#x27;s architecture contains a blend of old and new. The Old Louisville neighborhood is the largest historic preservation district solely featuring Victorian homes and buildings in the United States; it is also the third-largest district containing such architectural distinctions in the United States. Many modern skyscrapers are located downtown, as well as older preserved structures, such as the Southern National Bank building. The buildings of West Main Street in downtown Louisville have the largest collection of cast iron facades of anywhere outside of New York&#x27;s SoHo neighborhood.

Since the mid-20th century, Louisville has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a University of Louisville geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north of Algonquin Parkway, is &quot;a euphemism for the African American part of town&quot; although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents are black. Nevertheless, he says the perception is still strong. The South End has long had a reputation as a white, working-class part of town, while the East End has been seen as middle and upper class.

According to the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors, the area with the lowest median home sales price is west of Interstate 65, in the West and South Ends. The middle range of home sales prices are between Interstates 64 and 65 in the South and East Ends, and the highest median home sales price are north of Interstate 64 in the East End. Immigrants from Southeast Asia tend to settle in the South End, while immigrants from Eastern Europe settle in the East End.

===Climate===

Louisville has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), typical of the Upper South, and is located in USDA plant hardiness zones 6b and 7a. Springlike conditions typically begin in mid-to-late March, summer from mid-to-late-May to late September, with fall in the October–November period. Seasonal extremes in both temperature and precipitation are not uncommon during early spring and late fall; severe weather is not uncommon, with occasional tornado outbreaks in the region. Winter typically brings a mix of rain, sleet, and snow, with occasional heavy snowfall and icing. Louisville averages 4.5 days with low temperatures dipping to ; the first and last freezes of the season on average fall on November2 and April5, respectively. Summer is typically hazy, hot, and humid with long periods of temperatures and drought conditions at times. Louisville averages 38 days a year with high temperatures at or above . The mean annual temperature is , with an average annual snowfall of and an average annual rainfall of .

The wettest seasons are spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant year round. During the winter, particularly in January and February, several days of snow can be expected. January is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of . July is the average hottest month with a mean of . The highest recorded temperature was , which last occurred on July 14, 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature was on January 19, 1994. In 2012, Louisville had the fourth-hottest summer on record, with the temperature rising up to in July and the June all-time monthly record high temperature being broken on two consecutive days. As the city exemplifies the urban heat island effect, temperatures in commercial areas and in the industrialized areas along interstates are often higher than in the suburbs, often as much as .

==Demographics==

Between 1970 and 2000, Louisville lost population each decade. As of the 2000 census, Louisville had a population of 256,231, down from the 1990 census population of 269,063. Due to the city-county merger that occurred in 2003, which expanded the city limits, the city&#x27;s population increased to 597,337 at the 2010 census count.

===2020 Census===
Louisville is the largest city in Kentucky, with 17.1% of the state&#x27;s total population as of 2010; the balance&#x27;s percentage was 13.8%.

===Religion===

Louisville hosts religious institutions of various faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and the Baháʼí Faith.

The 135,421 Roman Catholic Louisvillians are part of the Archdiocese of Louisville, covering 24 counties in central Kentucky, and consisting of 121 parishes and missions spread over . The Cathedral of the Assumption in downtown Louisville is the seat of the Archdiocese of Louisville. Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey, the monastic home of Catholic writer Thomas Merton, is in nearby Bardstown, Kentucky, and also in the archdiocese. Most of Louisville&#x27;s Roman Catholic population is of German descent, the result of large-scale 19th-century immigration.

Bellarmine University and Spalding University in Louisville are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.

One in three Louisvillians is Southern Baptist, belonging to one of 147 local congregations. This denomination increased in number when large numbers of people moved into Louisville in the early 20th century from rural Kentucky and Tennessee to work in the city&#x27;s factories; some of these migrants also formed Holiness and Pentecostal churches and Churches of Christ.

German immigrants in the 19th century brought not only a large Catholic population, but also the Lutheran and Evangelical faiths, which are represented today in Louisville by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and the United Church of Christ, respectively.

The largest Methodist Church in Kentucky, Christ Church United Methodist, is located in Louisville, and the city has boasted a large Methodist population since the cities founding.

The city is home to two megachurches. Southeast Christian Church, with its main campus in Middletown and three others in the surrounding region, is, , the eighth-largest church in the US by average weekend attendance. St. Stephen Church has the largest African American congregation in Kentucky.

The city is home to several religious institutions: the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville Bible College, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the denominational headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (USA).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints maintains a temple in suburban Crestwood.

The Jewish population of around 14,200 in the metro area is served by five synagogues. Most Jewish families emigrated from Eastern Europe at the start of the 20th century; around 800 Soviet Jews have moved to Louisville since 1991. Jewish immigrants founded Jewish Hospital in what was once the center of the city&#x27;s Jewish district. From 2005 to 2012, Jewish Hospital merged with two Kentucky-based Catholic healthcare systems to form KentuckyOne Health, which later in 2012 announced a partnership with the University of Louisville Hospital. A significant focal point for Louisville&#x27;s Jewish community is located near Bowman Field, where there are two Orthodox synagogues (including Anshei Sfard, founded in 1893), the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Family and Career Services, and an affordable housing complex.

Muslims in Louisville number around 10,000, both indigenous and immigrants who arrived in the early 1960s from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, and Turkey. Immigrants from Afghanistan arrived in the early 1980s. Those from Iraq, Somalia, and Bosnia arrived in the 1990s, and the 2010s saw the arrival of immigrants from Kosovo. Many mosques and Islamic organizations exist in the metro area. 

Since 1996, every May, the Festival of Faiths, a five-day national interfaith gathering, is held featuring music, poetry, film, art, and dialogue. The festival is organized by the Center for Interfaith Relations and is held at Actors Theatre of Louisville.

Louisville first welcomed the Baháʼí Faith in 1920. The Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼí of Louisville was formed in 1944 when their community reached the required amount of nine adult Baháʼís. The first Baháʼí center opened in Louisville in 1967 in Crescent Hill. When the community outgrew the space in 1985, it was sold and another center opened in Buechel in 1998.

===Crime===

In a 2005 survey, Morgan Quitno Press ranked Louisville as the seventh safest large city in the United States. The 2006 edition of the survey ranked Louisville eighth.

In 2004, Louisville recorded 70 murders. The numbers for 2005 ranged from 55 to 59 (FBI says 55, LMPD says 59), which was down 16 percent from 2004. In 2006, Louisville-Jefferson County recorded 50 murders, which was significantly lower than previous years. In 2008, Louisville recorded 79 murders.

The Louisville Metro Area&#x27;s overall violent crime rate was 412.6 per 100,000 residents in 2005. The Elizabethtown, Kentucky Metro Area, which is part of Louisville&#x27;s Combined Statistical Area, was the 17th safest Metro in the U.S. Kentucky has the 5th lowest violent crime rate out of the 50 states.

In 2020, Louisville recorded 173 murders; and, in 2021, Louisville recorded 188 murders amidst an ongoing violent crime wave in the city.

The city has also been one of the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. In 2021, Louisville broke the record for overdoses in the city. Heroin, fentanyl and other opioids have also attributed to an overall increase in violent crime, property crime and homelessness in the past decade.

Violent crime is most concentrated west of downtown, especially in the Russell neighborhood. The West End, located north of Algonquin Parkway and West of 9th Street, had 32 of the city&#x27;s 79 murders in 2007.

==Economy==



Louisville today is home to dozens of companies and organizations across several industrial classifications. However, the underpinning of the city&#x27;s economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, as well as its unique position in the central United States (within one day&#x27;s road travel to 60 percent of the cities in the continental U.S.) make it a practical location for the transfer of cargo along its route to other destinations. The Louisville and Portland Canal and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad were important links in water and rail transportation.

Louisville&#x27;s importance to the shipping industry continues today with the presence of the Worldport global air-freight hub for UPS at Louisville International Airport. Louisville&#x27;s location at the crossroads of three major interstate highways (I64, I65, and I71) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the shipping and cargo industry. In addition, the Port of Louisville continues Louisville&#x27;s river shipping presence at Jefferson Riverport International. As of 2003, Louisville ranks as the seventh-largest inland port in the United States.

Louisville is a significant center of manufacturing, with two major Ford Motor Company plants, and the headquarters and major home appliance factory of GE Appliances (a subsidiary of Haier). The city is also a major center of the American whiskey industry, with about one-third of all bourbon whiskey coming from Louisville. Brown-Forman, one of the major makers of American whiskey, is headquartered in Louisville and operates a distillery in the Louisville suburb of Shively. The current primary distillery site operated by Heaven Hill, called the Bernheim distillery, is also located in Louisville near Brown-Forman&#x27;s distillery. Other distilleries and related businesses can also be found in neighboring cities in Kentucky, such as Bardstown, Clermont, Lawrenceburg, and Loretto. Similar to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that links these central Kentucky locations, Louisville offers tourists its own &quot;Urban Bourbon Trail&quot;, where people can stop at nearly 20 &quot;area bars and restaurants, all offering at least 50 labels of America&#x27;s only native spirit&quot;.

Not typically known for high tech outside of the previously identified industries, Code Louisville, the city&#x27;s public–private partnership for teaching people entry level software development skills, received recognition in 2015 from then-President Barack Obama.

Omega Mirror Products, which at the height of the disco era in the 1970s manufactured 90% of all mirror balls in the US, is based in Louisville.

Several major motion pictures have been filmed in or near Louisville, including &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;, &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;, and &quot;Secretariat&quot;.

===Top Employers===
As of the city&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, Louisville&#x27;s top employers are:

===Annual festivals and other events===

Louisville is home to many annual cultural events. Perhaps most well known is the Kentucky Derby, held annually during the first Saturday of May. The Derby is preceded by a two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival, which starts with the annual Thunder Over Louisville, the largest annual fireworks display in North America. The Kentucky Derby Festival also features notable events such as the Pegasus Parade, The Great Steamboat Race, Great Balloon Race, a combined marathon/mini marathon and about seventy events in total. Esquire magazine has called the Kentucky Derby &quot;the biggest party in the south&quot;.

The summer season in Louisville also features a series of cultural events such as the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival (commonly called &quot;Shakespeare in Central Park&quot;), held every summer from May to August and presents free Shakespeare plays in Central Park in Old Louisville.
Before pausing in 2023, the Forecastle Festival during Memorial Day weekend drew 75,000 visitors () to Louisville Waterfront Park in celebration of the best in music, art and environmental activism. Past performers include The Black Keys, The Flaming Lips, Widespread Panic, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Avett Brothers, The Black Crowes and hundreds more. It was replaced in 2024 with the Gazebo Festival, co-headlined by Louisville&#x27;s Jack Harlow and SZA.

The Kentucky State Fair is held every August at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville as well, featuring an array of culture from all areas of Kentucky. In places, the African American community celebrates Juneteenth commemorating June 19, 1865, when enslaved African Americans in the western territories learned of their freedom.

The Jeffersontown neighborhood is also the home of the annual Gaslight Festival, a series of events spread over a week. Attendance is estimated at 200,000–300,000 for the week.

The month of October features the St. James Court Art Show in Old Louisville. Thousands of artists gather on the streets and in the courtyard to exhibit and sell their wares, and the event is attended by many art collectors and enthusiasts. The show typically brings in a crowd of over 150,000 people and $3 million in sales.

Another art-related event that occurs every month is the First Friday Hop.

===Indie scene===

A Louisville locale that highlights the city&#x27;s indie scene is Bardstown Road, an area located in the heart of the Highlands. Bardstown Road is known for its cultural diversity and local trade. Though it is only about a mile (1.6 km) long, this strip of Bardstown Road constitutes much of the city&#x27;s culture and diverse lifestyle, contributing to the unofficial &quot;Keep Louisville Weird&quot; slogan.

In downtown Louisville, 21c Museum Hotel, a hotel that showcases contemporary art installations and exhibitions throughout its public spaces, and features a red penguin on its roof, is, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;an innovative concept with strong execution and prompt and enthusiastic service&quot;.

Louisville is home to a thriving indie music scene with bands such as Love Jones, Tantric, Squirrel Bait, CABIN, Slint, My Morning Jacket, Houndmouth, Young Widows and Wax Fang. Acclaimed singer-songwriters Will Oldham, who performs under the moniker &quot;Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy&quot;, is a resident, as was country/rock singer-songwriter Tim Krekel. Cellist Ben Sollee splits his time between Louisville and Lexington. Long running rock/jazz fusion band NRBQ also formed in Louisville in the late 1960s as well as 1980s psychobilly band Bodeco. Post-grunge band Days of the New, at one time including Nicole Scherzinger, formed in Louisville in the mid-1990s. Popular local singer Bryson Tiller paid homage to Louisville in his chart-topping &quot;T R A P S O U L&quot; with the song &quot;502 Come Up&quot;, referencing the city&#x27;s area code, and rapper Jack Harlow also calls the city home.

Especially catering to Louisville&#x27;s music scene is 91.9 WFPK Radio Louisville, a local public radio station funded, in part, from local listeners.

===Museums, galleries and interpretive centers===


The West Main District in downtown Louisville features what is locally known as &quot;Museum Row&quot;. In this area is the Frazier History Museum, which opened in 2004 as an armaments museum but since has expanded its focus. It originally featured the only collection of Royal Armouries artifacts outside of the United Kingdom until remaining display items were returned in 2015.

Also nearby is the Kentucky Science Center, which is Kentucky&#x27;s largest hands-on science center and features interactive exhibits, IMAX films, educational programs and technology networks. The Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, opened in 1981, is a nonprofit organization. The Muhammad Ali Center opened November 2005 in &quot;Museum Row&quot; and features Louisville native Muhammad Ali&#x27;s boxing memorabilia. 

The National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) is a patriotic, historical, and educational non-profit organization and a leading male lineage society that perpetuates the ideals of the American war for independence and the founding of the United States. The SAR opened its National Genealogical Research Library in 2010.

The Speed Art Museum opened in 1927 and is the oldest and largest art museum in Kentucky. The museum was closed for three years, re-opening in 2016 with 220,000 sq. ft. of renovations. Located adjacent to the University of Louisville, the museum features over 12,000 pieces of art in its permanent collection and hosts traveling exhibitions. Multiple art galleries are located in the city, but they are especially concentrated in the East Market District (NuLu), immediately to the east of downtown. This row of galleries, plus others in the West Main District, are prominently featured in the monthly First Friday Hop.

Several local history museums are in the Louisville area. The most prominent among them is The Filson Historical Society, founded in 1884, which has holdings exceeding 1.5 million manuscript items and over 50,000 volumes in the library. The Filson&#x27;s extensive collections focus on Kentucky, the Upper South and the Ohio River Valley, and contain a large collection of portraiture and over 10,000 museum artifacts. Other local history museums include the Portland Museum, Historic Locust Grove, Conrad-Caldwell House Museum, the Falls of the Ohio State Park interpretive center (Clarksville, Indiana), Howard Steamboat Museum (Jeffersonville, Indiana) and the Carnegie Center for Art and History (New Albany, Indiana). The Falls interpretive center, part of the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area, also functions as a natural history museum, covering findings in the nearby exposed Devonian fossil bed.
There are also several historical properties and items of interest in the area, including the &quot;Belle of Louisville&quot;, the oldest Mississippi-style steamboat in operation in the United States. The United States Marine Hospital of Louisville is considered by the National Park Service to be the best remaining antebellum hospital in the United States. It was designed by Robert Mills, who is best known as the designer of the Washington Monument. Fort Knox, spread out among Bullitt, Hardin and Meade Counties (two of which are in the Louisville metropolitan area), is home to the U.S. Bullion Depository and the General George Patton Museum. The previously mentioned Locust Grove, former home of Louisville Founder George Rogers Clark, portrays life in the early days of the city. Other notable properties include the Farmington Historic Plantation (home of the Speed family), Riverside, The Farnsley-Moremen Landing and the restored Union Station, which opened in 1891. The Louisville area is also home to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a turn-of-the-century (20th) hospital that was originally built to accommodate tuberculosis patients, and subsequently has been reported and sensationalized to be haunted.The Little Loomhouse maintains historical records of local spinning and weaving patterns and techniques.

This is also the home of the Louisville Ballet, Louisville Orchestra, Bourbon Baroque, Actors Theatre of Louisville, StageOne Family Theatre, Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, which operates the oldest professional outdoor Shakespeare festival, and the Kentucky Opera, which is the twelfth oldest opera in the United States.

Actors Theatre of Louisville presents approximately six hundred performances of about thirty productions annually. From 1976 to 2021, it hosted the Humana Festival of New American Plays, a month-long festival of plays in the spring; the last festival took place virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was discontinued after the festival&#x27;s chief sponsor, the Humana Foundation, refocused its philanthropic endeavors to support health-based initiatives.

The Louisville Orchestra was founded in 1937 by conductor Robert Whitney. The orchestra today performs more than 125 concerts per year. The orchestra won the 2024 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Classical Instrumental Solo&quot;.

Iroquois Park is the home of the renovated Iroquois Amphitheater, which hosts a variety of musical concerts in a partially covered outdoor setting.

==Sports==


College sports are popular in the Louisville area. The Louisville Cardinals have competed as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), since joining that league in July 2014.

College basketball is particularly popular. The Louisville Cardinals&#x27;s Freedom Hall averaged sellouts for 10 straight years and the Downtown KFC Yum! Center following suit with regular sellouts. The Cardinals ranked third nationally in attendance in 2012–13, the most recent of the program&#x27;s three national championship seasons (1980, 1986, 2013). The Cardinals also hold the Big East conference women&#x27;s basketball paid attendance record with nearly 17,000 attending the game against the Kentucky Wildcats in 2008.
The Louisville market has ranked first in ratings for the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament every year since 1999. The Kentucky Wildcats used to play an annual game in Freedom Hall.

The Louisville Cardinals football team has produced successful NFL players such as Lamar Jackson, Johnny Unitas, Deion Branch, Teddy Bridgewater, Sam Madison, David Akers, Joe Jacoby, DeVante Parker and Ray Buchanan. The Cardinals won the 1991 Fiesta Bowl, the 2007 Orange Bowl, and the 2013 Sugar Bowl. In 2016, sophomore quarterback Lamar Jackson took the football team to new heights. Lamar was the school&#x27;s first Heisman Trophy winner, which is awarded to the most outstanding college football player nationwide during that season. He was also one of the youngest players to ever receive the award. The team also matched their highest ranking in school history at No. 3. The University of Louisville baseball team advanced to the College World Series in Omaha in 2007, 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2019 as one of the final eight teams to compete for the national championship.

==Parks and recreation==


Louisville Metro has 122 city parks covering more than . Several of these parks were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed New York City&#x27;s Central Park as well as parks, parkways, college campuses and public facilities in many U.S. locations. The Louisville Waterfront Park is prominently located on the banks of the Ohio River near downtown and features large open areas, which often hold free concerts and other festivals. The Big Four Bridge, a former railroad bridge spanning but is now a pedestrian bridge connecting Waterfront Park with Jeffersonville, Indiana&#x27;s waterfront park, fully opened in May 2014 with the completion of Jeffersonville&#x27;s ramp. Cherokee Park, one of the most visited parks in the nation, features a mixed-use loop and many well-known landscaping and architectural features including the Hogan&#x27;s Fountain Pavilion. Other notable parks in the system include Iroquois Park, Shawnee Park, Seneca Park and Central Park.

Further from the downtown area is the Jefferson Memorial Forest, which at is one of the largest municipal urban forests in the US. The forest is designated as a National Audubon Society wildlife refuge and offers nearly of hiking and equestrian trails.

Otter Creek Outdoor Recreation Area, owned and operated by the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, is another large park in nearby Brandenburg, Kentucky. The park&#x27;s namesake, Otter Creek, winds along the eastern side of the park. A scenic bend in the Ohio River, which divides Kentucky from Indiana, can be seen from northern overlooks within the park.

Other outdoor points of interest in the Louisville area include Cave Hill Cemetery (the burial location of Col. Harland Sanders), Zachary Taylor National Cemetery (the burial location of President Zachary Taylor), the Louisville Zoo and the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area.

In development is the City of Parks, a project to create a continuous paved pedestrian and biking trail called the Louisville Loop around Louisville Metro while also adding a large amount of park land. Current plans call for making approximately of the Floyds Fork flood plain in eastern Jefferson County into a new park system called The Parklands of Floyds Fork, expanding area in the Jefferson Memorial Forest, and adding riverfront land and wharfs along the Riverwalk and the Levee Trail, both completed segments of the Louisville Loop.

==Government==

Until 2015, Louisville was one of two cities in Kentucky designated by the state as first-class (along with Lexington, the state&#x27;s second-largest). Since January 6, 2003, Louisville has merged its government with that of Jefferson County, forming borders. Louisville was the second and only other city in the state to merge with its county. (Lexington had merged with Fayette County in 1974.)

Louisville Metro is governed by an executive called the Metro Mayor and a city legislature called the Metro Council. The third and current Metro Mayor is Craig Greenberg (D), who entered office on January 3, 2023.

Before merger, under the Kentucky Constitution and statutory law Louisville was designated as a first-class city in regard to local laws affecting public safety, alcohol beverage control, revenue options, and various other matters; as of 2014, it is the only such designated city in the state.

The Official Seal of the City of Louisville, no longer used following the merger, reflected its history and heritage in the fleur-de-lis representing French aid given during the Revolutionary War and the thirteen stars signifying the original colonies. The new Seal of Louisville Metro retains the fleur-de-lis, but has only two stars, one representing the city and the other the county.

Kentucky&#x27;s 3rd congressional district encompasses most of Louisville Metro, and is represented by Rep. Morgan McGarvey (D). Far eastern portions of the county are part of the 2nd congressional district, which is represented by Brett Guthrie (R).

==Education==

Louisville is home to several institutions of higher learning. There are six four-year universities, the University of Louisville, Bellarmine University, Boyce College, Spalding University, Sullivan University and Simmons College of Kentucky; Louisville Bible College; a two-year community college, Jefferson Community and Technical College; and several other business or technical schools such as Spencerian College, Strayer University and Sullivan College of Technology and Design. Indiana University Southeast is located across the Ohio River in New Albany, Indiana.

The University of Louisville has had notable achievements including several hand transplants and the world&#x27;s first self-contained artificial heart transplant.

Two major graduate-professional schools of religion are also located in Louisville. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, with more than 5,300 students, is the flagship institution of the Southern Baptist Convention. It was founded in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1859 and moved to Louisville in 1877, occupying its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926. Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, product of a 1901 merger of two predecessor schools founded at Danville, Kentucky in 1853 and in Louisville in 1893, occupied its present campus on Alta Vista Road in 1963.

According to the U.S. Census, of Louisville&#x27;s population over 25, 21.3% (the national average is 24%) hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher and 76.1% (80% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent.

The public school system, Jefferson County Public Schools, consists of more than 100,000 students in 173 schools. Dupont Manual High School ranks 30th in the nation overall for best high schools, and 13th in best magnet high schools. Due to Louisville&#x27;s large Catholic population, there are 27 Catholic schools in the city. The Kentucky School for the Blind, for all of Kentucky&#x27;s blind and visually impaired students, is located on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood.

==Media==

Louisville&#x27;s newspaper of record is &quot;The Courier Journal&quot;. The alternative paper is the progressive alt-weekly &quot;Louisville Eccentric Observer&quot; (commonly called &#x27;LEO&#x27;), which was founded by 3rd district U.S. Representative John Yarmuth (D).

WAVE 3, an NBC affiliate, was Kentucky&#x27;s first TV station. Another prominent TV station is ABC affiliate WHAS 11, formerly owned by the Bingham family (who also owned &quot;The Courier Journal&quot;), which hosts the regionally notable annual fundraiser, the WHAS Crusade for Children. Other television stations in the city include CBS affiliate WLKY 32 and Fox affiliate WDRB 41 (along with its dual The CW/MyNetworkTV affiliated sister station WBKI 58).

The most popular radio stations are WGZB-FM and 84 WHAS 840 AM. The latter was designated by the FCC as a clear-channel station, and was formerly owned by the Binghams (now iHeartMedia), and is a talk radio station that also broadcasts regional sports.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===


Louisville has inner and outer interstate beltways, I264 and I265 respectively. Interstates I64 and I65 pass through Louisville, and I-71 has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of downtown, this spot has become known as &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;. Three bridges carry I64 and I65 over the Ohio River, and a fourth automobile bridge carries non-interstate traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown is the Big Four Bridge, a former railroad bridge that has been renovated into as a pedestrian bridge.

The Ohio River Bridges Project, a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012. One bridge, the Abraham Lincoln Bridge, is located downtown beside the existing Kennedy Bridge for relief of I65 traffic. The other, named the Lewis and Clark Bridge, connects I265 between the portions located in southeast Clark County, Indiana and northeast Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville Metro). Both bridges and corresponding construction were finished in 2016.

Louisville&#x27;s main airport is the centrally located Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, whose IATA Airport code (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford Field. The airport is also home to UPS&#x27;s Worldport global air hub. UPS operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport and bases its UPS Airlines division there. Over 4.2 million passengers and over 4.7 billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport each year. It is also the second busiest airport in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and fourth busiest for such in the world. Only about 35 minutes from Fort Knox, the airport is also a major hub for armed services personnel. The historic but smaller Bowman Field is used mainly for general aviation while nearby Clark Regional Airport is used mostly by private jets.

The McAlpine Locks and Dam is located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks were constructed to allow shipping past the Falls of the Ohio.

Public transportation consists mainly of buses run by the Transit Authority of River City (TARC). The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and Jefferson County, as well as Kentucky suburbs in Oldham County, Bullitt County, and the Indiana suburbs of Jeffersonville, Clarksville and New Albany. In addition to regular city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts is served by a fleet of zero-emissions buses called LouLift. In late 2014, these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the &quot;Toonerville II Trolley&quot;. A light rail system has been studied and proposed for the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007.

Louisville has historically been a major center for railway traffic. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by CSX Transportation. Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, CSX (with a major classification yard in the southern part of the metro area) and Norfolk Southern. Five major main lines connect Louisville to the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the Paducah and Louisville Railway and the Louisville and Indiana Railroad, also serve the city. With the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly route between New York and Chicago, the &quot;Kentucky Cardinal&quot; no longer serves the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger rail service.

In 2016 Walk Score ranked Louisville 43rd &quot;most walkable&quot; of 141 U.S. cities with a population greater than 200,000.

===Utilities===

Electricity is provided to the Louisville Metro area by Louisville Gas &amp; Electric.
Water is provided by the Louisville Water Company, which provides water to more than 800,000 residents in Louisville as well as parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties. Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of Shelby, Spencer and Nelson.

The Ohio River provides for most of the city&#x27;s source of drinking water. Water is drawn from the river at two points: the raw water pump station at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of Harrods Creek. Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two water treatment plants serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country.

===Public safety===

The primary law enforcement agencies are the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) and the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (JCSO). &quot;911&quot; emergency medical services are provided by the government as Louisville Metro EMS.

Fire protection is provided by 16 independent fire departments working in concert through mutual aid agreements. The only fire department operated by Metro Government is Louisville Fire &amp; Rescue, the successor to the pre-merger Louisville Division of Fire. The city of Shively in western Jefferson County possesses an independent fire department that uses the same dispatch and radio channels as Louisville Fire and Rescue.

==Notable people==


==Firsts==

Important events occurring in the city include the second-largest American exhibition to date (1883), which had the largest to-date installation of light bulbs by their recent inventor and then-former resident Thomas Edison, as well as the first free public library in the US to be staffed by and provide services exclusively for African Americans (1905). Medical advances include the 1999 first human hand transplant in the US and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant in 2001.

==Sister cities==

Louisville&#x27;s sister cities are:

* Adapazarı, Turkey
* Jiujiang, China

* Mainz, Germany
* Montpellier, France
* La Plata, Argentina
* Quito, Ecuador
* Tamale, Ghana
Louisville was sister cities with Perm, Russia. However, this relationship was temporarily suspended by Mayor Greg Fischer in June 2022 in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In addition, Louisville has been recognized as a &quot;friendship city&quot;. The two cities have engaged in many cultural exchange programs, particularly in the fields of nursing and law, and cooperated in several private business developments, including the Frazier History Museum.

Although not a sister city, Louisville has friendly and cooperative relations with Chengdu, China.

<text>El ( ; also Il, &quot;ʾīlu&quot;; &quot;ʾīl&quot;; &quot;ʾēl&quot;; &quot;ʾīyl&quot;; or ; cognate to ) is a Northwest Semitic word meaning &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;deity&#x27;, or referring (as a proper name) to any one of multiple major ancient Near Eastern deities. A rarer form, &quot;ila&quot;, represents the predicate form in the Old Akkadian and Amorite languages. The word is derived from the Proto-Semitic .

Specific deities known as &quot;El&quot;, &quot;Al&quot; or &quot;Il&quot; include the supreme god of the ancient Canaanite religion and the supreme god of East Semitic speakers in Early Dynastic Period of Mesopotamia. Among the Hittites, El was known as [[Elkunirša]] ( &quot;Elkunīrša&quot;).

Although El gained different appearances and meanings in different languages over time, it continues to exist as &quot;-il&quot; or &quot;-el&quot; in compound proper noun phrases such as Ishmael, Israel, Samuel, Daniel, Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel.

==Linguistic forms and meanings==
Cognate forms of El are found throughout the Semitic languages. They include Ugaritic , pl. ; Phoenician pl. ; Hebrew , pl. ; Aramaic ; Akkadian , pl. .

In northwest Semitic use, &quot;ʼel&quot; was a generic word for any god as well as the special name or title of a particular god who was distinguished from other gods as being &quot;the god&quot;. El is listed at the head of many pantheons. In some Canaanite and Ugaritic sources, El played a role as father of the gods, of creation, or both.

However, because the word &quot;el&quot; sometimes refers to a god other than the great god El, it is frequently ambiguous as to whether El followed by another name means the great god El with a particular epithet applied or refers to another god entirely. For example, in the Ugaritic texts, &quot;ʾil mlk&quot; is understood to mean &quot;El the King&quot; but &quot;ʾil hd&quot; as &quot;the god Hadad&quot;.

The Semitic root &quot;ʾlh&quot; (Arabic &quot;&quot;, Aramaic &quot;ʾAlāh&quot;, &quot;ʾElāh&quot;, Hebrew &quot;ʾelōah&quot;) may be &quot;ʾl&quot; with a parasitic h, and &quot;ʾl&quot; may be an abbreviated form of &quot;ʾlh&quot;. In Ugaritic the plural form meaning &quot;gods&quot; is , equivalent to Hebrew &quot;powers&quot;. In the Hebrew texts this word is interpreted as being semantically singular for &quot;god&quot; by biblical commentators. However, according to the documentary hypothesis, at least four different authors – the Jahwist (J), Elohist (E), Deuteronomist (D), and Priestly (P) sources – were responsible for editing stories from a polytheistic religion into those of a monotheistic religion. These sources were joined together at various points in time by a series of editors or &quot;redactors&quot;. Inconsistencies that arise between monotheism and polytheism in the texts are reflective of this hypothesis.

The stem &quot;ʾl&quot; is found prominently in the earliest strata of east Semitic, northwest Semitic, and south Semitic groups. Personal names including the stem &quot;ʾl&quot; are found with similar patterns in both the Amorite and Sabaic languages.

== Historical development ==

There is evidence that the Canaanite/Phoenician and Aramaic conception of El is essentially the same as the Amorite conception of El, which was popularized in the 18th century BCE but has origins in the Pre-Sargonic period. Any &quot;changes&quot; in El&#x27;s status can be explained by the randomness of available data. Tribal organizations in West Semitic culture also influenced El&#x27;s portrayal as a &quot;treaty partner&quot; in covenants, where the clan is seen as the &quot;kin&quot; of the deity.

Eventually, El&#x27;s cult became central to the ethnogenesis of Iron Age Israelites but so far, scholars are unable to determine how much of the population were El worshippers. It is more likely that different locales held different views of El.

==Proto-Sinaitic, Phoenician, Aramaic, and Hittite texts==
The Egyptian god Ptah is given the title &quot;ḏū gitti&quot; &#x27;Lord of Gath&#x27; in a prism from Tel Lachish which has on its opposite face the name of Amenhotep II ( BCE). The title &quot;ḏū gitti&quot; is also found in Serābitṭ text 353. Frank Moore Cross (1973, p. 19) points out that Ptah is often called &quot;the Lord (or one) of eternity&quot; and thinks it may be this identification of El with Ptah that lead to the epithet &quot;ʿolam&quot; &#x27;eternal&#x27; being applied to El so early and so consistently. Yet another connection is seen with the Mandaean angel Ptahil, whose name combines both the terms Ptah and Il. Wyatt, however, notes that in Ugaritic texts, Ptah is seemingly identified with the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis, not El.

In an inscription in the Proto-Sinaitic script, William F. Albright transcribed the phrase &quot;ʾL Ḏ ʿLM&quot;, which he translated as the appellation &quot;El, (god) of eternity&quot;.

The name Raphael or Rapha-El, meaning &#x27;God has healed&#x27; in Ugarit, is attested to in approximately 1350 BCE in one of the Amarna Letters EA333, found in Tell-el-Hesi from the ruler of Lachish to &#x27;The Great One&#x27;

A Phoenician inscribed amulet of the seventh century BCE from Arslan Tash may refer to El. The text was translated by Rosenthal (1969, p. 658) as follows:

However, Cross (1973, p. 17) translated the text as follows:

In some inscriptions, the name &quot;ʾĒl qōne ʾarṣ&quot; (Punic: 𐤀𐤋 𐤒𐤍 𐤀𐤓𐤑 &quot;ʾl qn ʾrṣ&quot;) meaning &quot;El creator of Earth&quot; appears, even including a late inscription at Leptis Magna in Tripolitania dating to the second century. In Hittite texts, the expression becomes the single name &quot;Ilkunirsa&quot;, this Ilkunirsa appearing as the husband of Asherdu (Asherah) and father of 77 or 88 sons.

In a Hurrian hymn to El (published in &quot;Ugaritica V&quot;, text RS 24.278), he is called &quot;il brt&quot; and &quot;il dn&quot;, which Cross (p. 39) takes as &#x27;El of the covenant&#x27; and &#x27;El the judge&#x27; respectively.

==Ugarit and the Levant==
For the Canaanites and the ancient Levantine region as a whole, ʼĒl or ʼIl was the supreme god, the father of mankind and all creatures. He also fathered many gods, most importantly Baal, Yam, and Mot, each sharing similar attributes to the Greco-Roman gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades respectively.

As recorded on the clay tablets of Ugarit, El is the husband of the goddess Asherah.

Three pantheon lists found at Ugarit (modern —, Syria) begin with the four gods &quot;ʾil-ʾib&quot; (which according to Cross; is the name of a generic kind of deity, perhaps the divine ancestor of the people), El, Dagnu (that is Dagon), and Ba&#x27;l Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or Hadad). Though Ugarit had a large temple dedicated to Dagon and another to Hadad, there was no temple dedicated to El.

El had a variety of epithets and forms. He is repeatedly referred to as &quot;ṯr il&quot; (&quot;Bull El&quot; or &quot;the bull god&quot;) and &quot;ʾil milk&quot; (&quot;El the King&quot;). He is &quot;bny bnwt&quot; (&quot;Creator of creatures&quot;), &quot;abū banī &#x27;ili&quot; (&quot;father of the gods&quot;), and &quot;ʾab ʾadm&quot; (&quot;father of man&quot;). The appellations of &quot;eternal&quot;, &quot;creator&quot; and &quot;eternal&quot; or &quot;ancient creator&quot; are &quot;characteristic designations of &#x27;El in Canaanite myths and liturgies&quot;. He is &quot;ḥātikuka&quot; (&quot;your patriarch&quot;). El is the grey-bearded ancient one, full of wisdom, &quot;malku&quot; (&quot;King&quot;), &quot;ʾab šnm&quot; (&quot;Father of years&quot;), &quot;ʾEl gibbōr&quot; (&quot;El the warrior&quot;). He is also called &quot;lṭpn ʾil d pʾid&quot; (&quot;the Gracious One, the Benevolent God&quot;) and &quot;lṭpn wqdš&quot; (&quot;the Gracious and Holy One&quot;).

&quot;El&quot; (Father of Heaven / Saturn) and his major son: &quot;Hadad&quot; (Father of Earth / Jupiter), are symbolized both by the bull, and both wear bull horns on their headdresses.

The mysterious Ugaritic text &quot;Shachar and Shalim&quot; tells how (perhaps near the beginning of all things) El came to shores of the sea and saw two women who bobbed up and down. El was sexually aroused and took the two with him, killed a bird by throwing a staff at it, and roasted it over a fire. He asked the women to tell him when the bird was fully cooked, and to then address him either as husband or as father, for he would thenceforward behave to them as they called him. They saluted him as husband. He then lay with them, and they gave birth to &quot;Shachar&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;) and &quot;Shalim&quot; (&quot;Dusk&quot;). Again El lay with his wives and the wives gave birth to &quot;the gracious gods&quot;, &quot;cleavers of the sea&quot;, &quot;children of the sea&quot;. The names of these wives are not explicitly provided, but some confusing rubrics at the beginning of the account mention the goddess Athirat, who is otherwise El&#x27;s chief wife and the goddess Raḥmayyu (&quot;the one of the womb&quot;).

In the Ugaritic Ba&#x27;al cycle, El is introduced having an assembly of gods on Mount Lel (Lel possibly meaning &quot;Night&quot;), and dwelling on (or in) the fountains of the two rivers at the spring of the two deeps. He dwells in a tent according to some interpretations of the text which may explain why he had no temple in Ugarit. As to the rivers and the spring of the two deeps, these might refer to real streams, or to the mythological sources of the salt water ocean and the fresh water sources under the earth, or to the waters above the heavens and the waters beneath the earth. A few miles from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the &quot;manbaa al-nahrayn&quot; (&quot;Source of the Two Rivers&quot;), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.

In the episode of the &quot;Palace of Ba&#x27;al&quot;, the god Ba&#x27;al Hadad invites the &quot;seventy sons of Athirat&quot; to a feast in his new palace. Presumably these sons have been fathered on Athirat by El; in following passages they seem to be the gods (&quot;ʾilm&quot;) in general or at least a large portion of them. The only sons of El named individually in the Ugaritic texts are Yamm (&quot;Sea&quot;), Mot (&quot;Death&quot;), and Ashtar, who may be the chief and leader of most of the sons of El. Ba&#x27;al Hadad is a few times called El&#x27;s son rather than the son of Dagan as he is normally called, possibly because El is in the position of a clan-father to all the gods.

The fragmentary text R.S. 24.258 describes a Marzēaḥ banquet to which El invites the other gods and then disgraces himself by becoming outrageously drunk and passing out after confronting an otherwise unknown Hubbay, &quot;he with the horns and tail&quot;. The text ends with an incantation for the cure for a hangover.

El&#x27;s characterization in Ugarit texts is not always favorable. His authority is unquestioned, but sometimes exacted through threat or roundly mocked. He is &quot;both comical and pathetic&quot; in a &quot;role of impotence.&quot; But this is arguably a misinterpretation since El had complementary relationships with other deities. Any &quot;differences&quot; they had pertained to function. For example, El and Baal were divine kings but El was the executive whilst Baal was the sustainer of the cosmos.

==Hebrew Bible==
One scholarly position is that the identification of Yahweh with El is a later interpretation. Earlier Yahweh was thought of as one of many gods, separate from El. Theological interpretations of the Hebrew Bible consider El as an alternative name for Yahweh. This is in contrast to the Elohist and Priestly traditions in which El is considered to be an earlier deity than Yahweh.
Mark Smith has argued that Yahweh and El were originally separate, but were considered synonymous from very early on. The name Yahweh is used in , while says that at that time, people began to &quot;call upon the name of the LORD&quot;. El&#x27;s title of &quot;El Shadday&quot;, which envisions him as the &quot;god of the steppe&quot;, may also derive from the cultural beliefs of Upper Mesopotamian (i.e. Amurru) immigrants, who were ancestors of the Israelites.

In Deuteronomy 32, as preserved in the Septuagint and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Yahweh was described as a son of El. In Abraham accepted the blessing of El, when Melchizedek, the king of Salem and high priest of its deity El Elyon blessed him.

According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to World Mythology&quot;,
It seems almost certain that the God of the Jews evolved gradually from the Canaanite El, who was in all likelihood the &quot;God of Abraham&quot; ... If El was the high God of Abraham—Elohim, the prototype of Yahveh—Asherah was his wife, and there are archaeological indications that she was perceived as such before she was in effect &quot;divorced&quot; in the context of emerging Judaism of the 7th century BCE. (See .)

In some instances, such as in , Yahweh is envisioned as a storm god, something not true for El. It is Yahweh who is prophesied to one day battle Leviathan the serpent, and slay the dragon in the sea in . The slaying of the serpent in myth is a deed attributed to both Ba&#x27;al Hadad and &#x27;Anat in the Ugaritic texts, but not to El.

Such mythological motifs are variously seen as late survivals from a period when Yahweh held a place in theology comparable to that of Hadad at Ugarit; or as late henotheistic/monotheistic applications to Yahweh of deeds more commonly attributed to Hadad; or simply as examples of eclectic application of the same motifs and imagery to various different gods. Similarly, it is argued inconclusively whether Ēl Shaddāi, Ēl &#x27;Ôlām, Ēl &#x27;Elyôn, and so forth, were originally understood as separate divinities. Albrecht Alt presented his theories on the original differences of such gods in &quot;Der Gott der Väter&quot; in 1929.

But others have argued that from patriarchal times, these different names were generally understood to refer to the same single great god, El. This is the position of Frank Moore Cross (1973). What is certain is that the form &#x27;El does appear in Israelite names from every period including the name &quot;Yiśrā&#x27;ēl&quot; (&quot;Israel&quot;), meaning &quot;El strives&quot;. There are verses where El and Yahweh are unambiguously conflated () but some scholars believe this is an attempt to portray El as a warrior god, as Israelite society grew and evolved into a nation-state. 

=== Jewish Interpretation ===

The Hebrew form (אל) appears in Latin letters in Standard Hebrew transcription as El and in Tiberian Hebrew transcription as ʾĒl. ʾ&quot;el&quot; is a generic word for &quot;god&quot; that could be used for any god, including Hadad, Moloch, or Yahweh.

In the Tanakh, &quot;ʾelōhîm&quot; is the normal word for a god or the great God (or gods, given that the &#x27;im&#x27; suffix makes a word plural in Hebrew). But the form &quot;ʾEl&quot; also appears, mostly in poetic passages and in the patriarchal narratives attributed to the Priestly source of the documentary hypothesis. It occurs 217 times in the Masoretic Text: seventy-three times in the Psalms and fifty-five times in the Book of Job, and otherwise mostly in poetic passages or passages written in elevated prose. It occasionally appears with the definite article as &quot;hā&#x27;Ēl&quot; &#x27;the god&#x27; (for example in ).

The theological position of the Tanakh is that the names &quot;ʼĒl&quot; and &quot;Ĕlōhîm&quot;, when used in the singular to mean the supreme god, refer to Yahweh, beside whom other gods are supposed to be either nonexistent or insignificant. Whether this was a long-standing belief or a relatively new one has long been the subject of inconclusive scholarly debate about the prehistory of the sources of the Tanakh and about the prehistory of Israelite religion. In the P strand, may be translated:
I revealed myself to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai, but was not known to them by my name, YHWH.

==Sanchuniathon==
Philo of Byblos (c. 64–141 AD) was a Greek writer whose account &quot;Sanchuniathon&quot; survives in quotation by Eusebius and may contain the major surviving traces of Phoenician mythology. El (rendered &quot;Elus&quot; or called by his standard Greek counterpart Cronus) is not the creator god or first god. El is rather the son of Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Ge). Sky and Earth are themselves children of &#x27;Elyôn &#x27;Most High&#x27;. El is brother to the God Bethel, to Dagon and to an unknown god, equated with the Greek Atlas and to the goddesses Aphrodite/&#x27;Ashtart, Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (equated with Ba&#x27;alat Gebal). El is the father of Persephone and of Athena (presumably the goddess &#x27;Anat).

Sky and Earth have separated from one another in hostility, but Sky insists on continuing to force himself on Earth and attempts to destroy the children born of such unions. At last, with the advice of his daughter Athena and the god Hermes Trismegistus (perhaps Thoth), El successfully attacks his father Sky with a sickle and spear of iron. He and his military allies the &quot;Eloim&quot; gain Sky&#x27;s kingdom.

In a later passage it is explained that El castrated Sky. One of Sky&#x27;s concubines (who was given to El&#x27;s brother Dagon) was already pregnant by Sky. The son who is born of the union, called Demarûs or Zeus, but once called Adodus, is obviously Hadad, the Ba&#x27;al of the Ugaritic texts who now becomes an ally of his grandfather Sky and begins to make war on El.

El has three wives, his sisters or half-sisters Aphrodite/Astarte (&#x27;Ashtart), Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (identified by Sanchuniathon with Ba&#x27;alat Gebal the tutelary goddess of Byblos, a city which Sanchuniathon says that El founded).

El is depicted primarily as a warrior; in Ugaritic sources Baal has the warrior role and El is peaceful, and it may be that the &quot;Sanchuniathon&quot; depicts an earlier tradition that was more preserved in the southern regions of Canaan.

Eusebius, through whom the &quot;Sanchuniathon&quot; is preserved, is not interested in setting the work forth completely or in order. But we are told that El slew his own son Sadidus (a name that some commentators think might be a corruption of &quot;Shaddai&quot;, one of the epithets of the Biblical El) and that El also beheaded one of his daughters. Later, perhaps referring to this same death of Sadidus we are told:

A fuller account of the sacrifice appears later:
The account also relates that Thoth:
This is the form under which El/Cronus appears on coins from Byblos from the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BCE) four spread wings and two folded wings, leaning on a staff. Such images continued to appear on coins until after the time of Augustus.

==Poseidon==

A bilingual inscription from Palmyra dated to the 1st century equates &quot;El-Creator-of-the-Earth&quot; with the Greek god Poseidon. Going back to the 8th century BCE, the bilingual inscription at Karatepe in the Taurus Mountains equates &quot;El-Creator-of-the-Earth&quot; to Luwian hieroglyphs read as &quot;da-a-ś&quot;, this being the Luwian form of the name of the Babylonian water god Ea, lord of the abyss of water under the earth. (This inscription lists El in second place in the local pantheon, following Ba&#x27;al Shamîm and preceding the &quot;Eternal Sun&quot;.)

Poseidon is known to have been worshipped in Beirut, his image appearing on coins from that city. Poseidon of Beirut was also worshipped at Delos where there was an association of merchants, shipmasters, and warehousemen called the Poseidoniastae of Berytus founded in 110 or 109 BCE. Three of the four chapels at its headquarters on the hill northwest of the Sacred Lake were dedicated to Poseidon, the Tyche of the city equated with Astarte (that is &#x27;Ashtart), and to Eshmun.

Also at Delos, that association of Tyrians, though mostly devoted to Heracles-Melqart, elected a member to bear a crown every year when sacrifices to Poseidon took place. A banker named Philostratus donated two altars, one to Palaistine Aphrodite Urania (&#x27;Ashtart) and one to Poseidon &quot;of Ascalon&quot;.

Though Sanchuniathon distinguishes Poseidon from his Elus/Cronus, this might be a splitting off of a particular aspect of El in a euhemeristic account. Identification of an aspect of El with Poseidon rather than with Cronus might have been felt to better fit with Hellenistic religious practice, if indeed this Phoenician Poseidon really is the El who dwells at the source of the two deeps in Ugaritic texts. More information is needed to be certain.

<doc id="58596" wikidata="Q1540319" url="?curid=58596" title="Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing">
<text>The Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, often shortened to Triple Crown, is a series of horse races for Thoroughbreds, often restricted to three-year-olds. Winning all three of these Thoroughbred horse races is considered the greatest accomplishment in Thoroughbred racing. The term originated in mid-19th-century England and nations where Thoroughbred racing is popular each have their own Triple Crown series.

==England== 
In England, where the term Triple Crown originated with West Australian&#x27;s three wins in 1853, it is made up of:

# The 2,000 Guineas Stakes, run over 1 mile (1,609 metres) at Newmarket Racecourse in Newmarket, Suffolk
# The Derby, run over 1 mile 4 furlongs and 10 yards (2,423 metres) at Epsom Downs Racecourse in Epsom, Surrey
# The St Leger Stakes, run over 1 mile 6 furlongs and 132 yards (2,937 metres) at Town Moor in Doncaster, Yorkshire

Since the 2,000 Guineas was first run in 1809, fifteen horses (including three winners of substitute races at Newmarket during the First World War) have won the English Triple Crown. The most recent – and only winner since World War II – was Nijinsky, in 1970. For many years, it was considered unlikely that any horse would ever win the English Triple Crown again. In the winter of 2006/2007, however, trainer Jim Bolger was training his unbeaten colt Teofilo for the Triple Crown and bookmaker William Hill plc was offering odds of only 12/1 Teofilo winning the 2007 Triple Crown. The horse was withdrawn from the 2000 Guineas two days before the race after suffering a setback and never raced again.

Since Nijinsky, only Nashwan (1989), Sea the Stars (2009), and Camelot (2012) have won both the Guineas and the Derby. Between Reference Point in 1987 and Camelot in 2012, no Derby winner (not even the potential Triple Crown winners Nashwan and Sea the Stars) even entered the St. Leger. This reluctance to compete in the St. Leger is said to be because of the impact it would have on a horse&#x27;s stud value in a market where speed is preferred to stamina.

===Triple Crown winners===
For a list of the annual individual race winners, see English Triple Crown race winners.

Triple Crown winners:

†Wartime winners Pommern, Gay Crusader and Gainsborough are not counted, according to many judges, as the three races were all held at Newmarket and racing itself was too disrupted. By this reckoning, there were only 12 triple crown winners, and only three in the 20th century.

===Failed Triple Crown attempts===
The following horses won the 2000 Guineas and Derby but were beaten in the St Leger:
* Cotherstone (1843): second to Nutwith
* Pretender (1869): fourth to Pero Gomez
* Shotover (1882): third to Dutch Oven
* Ayrshire (1888): sixth to Seabreeze
* Ladas (1894): second to Throstle
* St. Amant (1904): seventh and last to Pretty Polly
* Minoru (1909): fourth to Bayardo
* Manna (1925): tenth to Solario
* Cameronian (1931): tenth and last to Sandwich
* Camelot (2012): second to Encke

Additionally:
* Blue Peter won 2000 Guineas and Derby in 1939 but St Leger was cancelled due to World War II.

===Fillies Triple Crown===

There is also a Fillies Triple Crown for a filly winning the 1,000 Guineas Stakes, Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes. In the past, this was not considered a true Triple Crown as the best fillies would often run in the Derby and Two Thousand Guineas. As this is no longer the case, the Fillies&#x27; Triple Crown would now be considered as comparable as the original. Winners of the Fillies Triple Crown are:
* Formosa – 1868 (also dead heated in the Two Thousand Guineas)
* Hannah – 1871
* Apology – 1874 (also won the Ascot Gold Cup)
* La Fleche – 1892 (also won the Ascot Gold Cup)
* Sceptre – 1902 (also won the Two Thousand Guineas)
* Pretty Polly – 1904
* Sun Chariot – 1942
* Meld – 1955
* Oh So Sharp – 1985

===Stayers&#x27; Triple Crown===

The so-called Stayers Triple Crown consists of the most prestigious long-distance races in the British flat racing season:
# The Ascot Gold Cup, raced over 2m 4f during Royal Ascot, 
# The Goodwood Cup, raced over 2m during the Goodwood Festival,
# The Doncaster Cup, raced over 2m 2f during the St Leger Festival.

==United States==

=== Triple Crown winners ===

In the United States, the three races that make up the Triple Crown are:
# Kentucky Derby, run over on a dirt track at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky
# Preakness Stakes, run over on a dirt track at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland
# Belmont Stakes, run over on a dirt track at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, just east of New York City
===Triple Tiara===
There have been several different versions of the &quot;Triple Tiara&quot; (sometimes known as the Filly Triple Crown) in the United States. One of them was a national version that consisted of undercard events on the same weekends as the associated Triple Crown races:
# Kentucky Oaks, run over on a dirt track, at Churchill Downs;
# Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, run over (previously ) on a dirt track, at Pimlico Race Course;
# Acorn Stakes, run over (previously ) on a dirt track, at Belmont Park;
Only one filly won this version of the Triple Tiara, Davona Dale in 1979. Few have even tried as the short time between the Kentucky Oaks and Black-Eyed Susan is generally considered too short for fillies.

The most commonly accepted version of the Triple Tiara is the American Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing which uses three races from New York. From 1957 to 2002, and 2007 to 2009, these three races were the Acorn Stakes, the Mother Goose Stakes, and the Coaching Club American Oaks. Eight fillies won this version of the New York Triple Tiara:
* Dark Mirage – 1968
* Shuvee – 1969
* Chris Evert – 1974
* Ruffian – 1975
* Davona Dale – 1979
* Mom&#x27;s Command – 1985
* Open Mind – 1989
* Sky Beauty – 1993

In 2010, the NYRA changed the configuration of the Triple Tiara to include the Alabama Stakes instead of the Mother Goose. As of 2022, no filly has won the reconfigured Triple Tiara.

=== New York Handicap Triple ===

The New York Handicap Triple is a series of three handicap races run in New York. Although historically notable, the series is now essentially defunct, as two of the races are run on the same day, making a sweep impossible. In addition, only the Metropolitan Handicap maintains a top-level designation and continues to be run as a handicap. The series consists of:

# Metropolitan Handicap, run over on a dirt track, at Belmont Park;
# Brooklyn Handicap (now run as the Brooklyn Invitational Stakes), run over (now ) on a dirt track, at Belmont Park;
# Suburban Handicap (now run as the Suburban Stakes), run over on a dirt track, at Belmont Park;

The triple has been won by four horses:

* Whisk Broom II – 1913
* Tom Fool – 1953
* Kelso – 1961
* Fit to Fight – 1984

=== Turf Triple Series ===
In 2019, the New York Racing Association established two series of races for three-year-olds on the turf: the Turf Trinity and the Turf Tiara. As of 2022, neither has been swept by a singular horse.

The Turf Trinity consists of:

# Belmont Derby, run over on a turf track at Belmont Park

<doc id="58597" wikidata="Q7127362" url="?curid=58597" title="Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs">
<text>The Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA; ) was founded in Jerusalem in March 1987 by Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi and a group of Palestinian academics and intellectuals. PASSIA is a member of the Palestinian NGOs Network and claims no affiliation with any government, political party organization. PASSIA deals with the various national, Arab and international aspects of the Palestinian Question through its academic Research Studies Program, dialogue and publication.

A major component of PASSIA’s activities is its Roundtable Meetings Program, and with over 100 publications to its credit, many of which include the minutes of these meetings. As part of its Religious Studies Unit PASSIA also holds regular meetings with religious leaders (mainly local Muslim and Christian dignitaries, but also involving Jews and foreign scholars) in an effort to foster scholarly understanding.

Its Seminar Program provides a venue for Palestinian graduates to benefit from the experience and knowledge of local and foreign experts. PASSIA’s educational and training seminars are divided into two categories: International Affairs – including seminars on Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Strategic Studies and Security, the EU, Education on Democracy, The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Japan and the Middle East, and The United States and Canada: Political Systems, Policy-Making and the Middle East – and Civil Society Empowerment, with seminars held to date including those on Policy-Making, Strategic Planning &amp; Media &amp; Communication Skills.

Jerusalem is the focus of the majority of PASSIA’s activities. PASSIA hosts regular workshops that address different but inter-connected issues pertaining to Jerusalem. In these meetings, as during all other events held at PASSIA, it is the desire to promote communication, cooperation and coordination between those with an interest in the fate of this region that overrides any other consideration, and which inevitably results in a dialogue that is as stimulating as it is productive.

==PASSIA Publications==

PASSIA seeks to present the Palestine Question in its national, Arab and international contexts through academic research, dialogue, education, documentation and publication. PASSIA works to achieve its goals through the implementation of the following regular programs: Research, Dialogue, Training and Education in International Affairs, Civil Society Empowerment, Religious Studies, the Question of Jerusalem, and the annual PASSIA Diary.

PASSIA has dedicated a large part of its various program and project activities to the provision of background information, in-depth studies and documentation on issues of concern, as well as the promotion of a better understanding of the Palestinian cause. PASSIA publications aim to be specialized, scientific and objective, yet they often address controversial or neglected issues and allow the expression of a wide range of perspectives. The authors of PASSIA publications throughout the years have been as diverse as the subjects covered and include Palestinian, Arab, Israeli and inter national academics, scholars and experts.

PASSIA publications are classified as follows: 
* Research Studies: Studies – in English or Arabic - conducted by researchers commissioned by PASSIA on a huge diversity of subjects relevant to the Palestine Question. 
* Jerusalem Studies: Research studies and shorter papers on the various aspects of the Question of Jerusalem, dealing with issues such as Israeli settlements, land use, the Old City, religion, Israeli municipal policies, and future scenarios for the status of the city. 
* Religious Studies: Research studies and shorter papers on religious and interfaith issues pertaining to the Palestinian context. 
* Information Papers: Monograph-length studies, essays and briefings, covering many contemporary and historical issues pertaining to the Palestine Question.
* Documentation: Documentary records such as chronologies, historical and contemporary documents, maps and bios of personalities.
* Bulletins: Easy-to-read publications focusing on specific topics (e.g., Jerusalem, negotiations, prisoners, settlements, etc.) with the aim to make available background information, analyses, and facts and figures in a concise but comprehensive manner.
* Translations: Translation into Arabic and/or English of other foreign-language works of relevance to Palestine and the Palestinians.
* Meetings and Seminar Proceedings: Occasional compilations containing full length or summarized versions of lectures and presentations given at PASSIA during a certain period or as part of a special project. Subcategories include (I) Dialogue Program (proceedings of workshops and roundtable meetings); (II.)

<text>In the United States, a state court is a law court with jurisdiction over disputes with some connection to a U.S. state. State courts handle the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in the United States; the United States federal courts are far smaller in terms of both personnel and caseload, and handle different types of cases. States often provide their trial courts with general jurisdiction (the hearing of all matters in which personal jurisdiction exists and which are not committed to another court) and state trial courts regularly have concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and their subject-matter jurisdiction arises only under federal law.

Each state &quot;is free to organize its courts as it sees fit,&quot; and consequently, &quot;no two states have identical court structures.&quot; Generally, state courts are common law courts, and apply their respective state laws and procedures to decide cases. They are organized pursuant to and apply the law in accordance with their state&#x27;s constitution, state statutes, and binding decisions of courts in their state court hierarchy. Where applicable, they also apply federal law, or need to make a choice of law from another jurisdiction.

Generally, a single judicial officer, usually called a judge, exercises original jurisdiction by presiding over contested criminal or civil actions which culminate in trials, which may include empaneling a jury, although most matters stop short of reaching trial. The decisions of lower courts may be reviewed by a panel of a state court of appeals. Generally, there is also a highest court for appeals, a state supreme court, that oversees the court system. In matters that involve issues of federal law, the final decision of the state&#x27;s highest court (including refusals to hear final appeals) may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court (which also has the discretion to refuse to hear them).

==Types of state courts==

===Trial court===
Cases in state courts begin in a trial court where lawsuits and criminal cases are filed and evidence is eventually presented if a case proceeds to a hearing or trial. Trials in these courts are often held only after extensive pretrial procedures that in more than 90% of cases lead to a default judgment in a civil case, an agreed resolution settling the case or plea bargain resolving a criminal case, or pretrial resolution of the case by a judge either on the merits or on procedural grounds. Although the United States is supposedly a highly litigious society, very few cases actually go to a jury verdict and a final judgment, let alone an appeal that results in a published appellate opinion. In other words, the reported case law studied in American law schools does not reflect the way the vast majority of cases are handled and resolved—by &quot;bargain[ing] [in the] shadow of the law&quot;.

Territory outside of any state in the United States, such as the District of Columbia or American Samoa, often has a court system established under federal or territorial law which substitutes for a state court system and is distinct from the ordinary federal court system.

State trial courts are usually located in a courthouse, which is often in the county seat. Even when state trial courts include more than one county in a judicial district, it is not uncommon for the state trial court to hold regular sessions at each county seat in its jurisdiction and function from the point of view of litigants as if it were a county-based court.

===Appellate court===
If one of the litigants is unsatisfied with the decision of the lower court, the matter may be taken up on appeal (but an acquittal in a criminal trial may not be appealed by the state due to the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy). Usually, an intermediate appellate court, if there is one in that state, often called the state court of appeals, will review the decision of the trial court. If still unsatisfied, the litigant can appeal to the highest appellate court in the state, which is usually called the state supreme court and is usually located in or near the state capital. Appellate courts in the United States, unlike their civil law counterparts, are generally not permitted to correct mistakes concerning the facts of the case on appeal, only mistakes of law, or findings of fact with no support in the trial court record.

===Municipal court===

Many states have courts of limited jurisdiction (inferior jurisdiction), presided over by, for example, a magistrate or justice of the peace who hears criminal arraignments and tries petty offenses and small civil cases. Appeals from courts of limited jurisdiction are frequently sent to state trial courts of general jurisdiction rather than to an appellate court.

Larger cities often have city courts (also known as municipal courts) which hear traffic offenses and violations of city ordinances; in some states, such as New York, these courts have slightly broader jurisdiction and can also handle small claims and misdemeanors. Other courts of limited jurisdiction include alderman&#x27;s courts, police court, mayor&#x27;s courts, recorder&#x27;s courts, county courts, probate courts, municipal courts, juvenile courts, courts of claims, courts of common pleas, family courts, small claims courts, tax courts, water courts (present in some western states such as Colorado and Montana), and workers&#x27; compensation courts (Rhode Island).

Lawrence M. Friedman has described courts of limited jurisdiction as &quot;the bargain basement of justice,&quot; where procedures are often informal and &quot;slapdash&quot; and the quality of justice is poor. In states that still use justices of the peace or equivalent judicial officers, many judges of courts of limited jurisdiction are laypersons who never attended law school or passed a bar examination.

Courts of limited jurisdiction should not be confused with the administrative courts seen in other countries. The United States does not use administrative courts, as a result of the strict separation of powers imposed by the United States Constitution. Instead, at both the federal and state levels, administrative law judges (ALJs) preside over tribunals within executive branch agencies (although their decisions can usually be appealed to real judges in the judicial branch). In state governments, ALJs handle matters such as driver&#x27;s license revocations, workers&#x27; compensation claims, unemployment insurance claims, and land use disputes.

===Superior court===
All these courts are distinguished from courts of general jurisdiction (also known as &quot;superior jurisdiction&quot;), which are the default type of trial court that can hear any case which is not required to be first heard in a court of limited jurisdiction. Most such cases are civil cases involving large sums of money or criminal cases arising from serious felonies like rape and murder. Typically, felonies are handled in general jurisdiction courts, while misdemeanors and other lesser offenses are handled in inferior jurisdiction courts. Unlike most European courts (in both common law and civil law countries), American state courts do not usually have a separate court that handles serious crimes; jurisdiction lies with the court that handles all other felony cases in a given county. But, many state courts that handle criminal cases have separate divisions or judges assigned to handle certain types of crimes such as a drug court, sometimes also known as a &quot;problem-solving court&quot;.

Courts of general jurisdiction tend to be better funded, better staffed, more professional, more dignified, and more solemn than courts of limited jurisdiction. They also tend to have jurisdiction over larger geographical areas and more people. 
A few states like California have unified all courts of general and inferior jurisdiction to make the judicial process more efficient. In such judicial systems, there are still &quot;departments&quot; of limited jurisdiction within the trial courts, and often these departments occupy exactly the same facilities they once occupied as independent courts of limited jurisdiction. However, as mere administrative divisions, departments can be rearranged at the discretion of each trial court&#x27;s presiding judge in response to changing caseloads.

==State court judges==

Unlike federal courts, where judges are presidential appointees confirmed by the U.S. Senate serving life terms of office, the vast majority of states have some judges who are elected, while some judges are appointed. The methods of judicial appointment vary widely.

The American habit of electing state court judges originates with Alexander Hamilton and Federalist No. 78, in which Hamilton brought about a fundamental reconceptualization of the idea of separation of powers with respect to the judiciary. Before Hamilton, both English and American people had thought of judges as mere appendages of royal authority, and that a government had only two branches, the executive and the legislative. Hamilton implied and others later developed the idea that American judges were coequal to legislatures and executives in their responsibility to carry out the people&#x27;s will (popular sovereignty), which extended to the power to make law (through case law). Therefore, if the judiciary was a coequal third branch of government, and the judges were the people&#x27;s agents, then like the other branches, they ought to be elected by the people. However, problems with partisan judicial elections led many states to later adopt judicial appointment systems, while also using retention elections as a check on appointed judges.

State court judges are usually distinguished attorneys who have had some political involvement, who are pursuing second careers on the bench. But a small number of state court judges, particularly in limited jurisdiction trial courts in rural areas or small towns, are nonlawyers, who are often elected to their posts.

A disproportionate share of state court judges previously served as prosecutors, or less commonly as criminal defense attorneys or trial lawyers, although no particular background as an attorney is required to serve as a judge. The judiciary is not a separate profession in the American legal system as it is in many civil law jurisdictions. While in many civil law jurisdictions a common judicial career involves an entry-level assignment in an inferior court followed by promotions to more senior courts over the course of a career, no U.S. court system makes experience in an inferior judicial position a prerequisite to higher judicial office.

While many countries consider criminal prosecutors to be part of the judicial branch, in the United States, all criminal prosecutors are considered part of the executive branch. The fact that all attorneys admitted to the practice of law are somewhat confusingly called &quot;officers of the court&quot; in U.S. legal practice is a legal fiction that calls attention to the special professional ethical obligations that all lawyers have to the court, and does not mean that all lawyers are employees or agents of the judicial branch.

State court judges are typically paid less, have smaller staffs, and handle larger caseloads than their counterparts in the federal judiciary.

==Differences among the states==

The foregoing summary is only a very rough generalization. There are a great many &quot;oddities&quot; and &quot;extra wrinkles&quot; from one state court system to the next, although the tendency in most states has been towards rationalization and simplification: &quot;the further back in history one goes, the more confused the situation gets&quot;.

*Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee and Wyoming make a distinction between a &quot;court of law&quot; and a &quot;court of equity&quot; (chancery court). For the most part in the American legal system, while the distinction between law and equity still has some legal consequences, separate court systems are not maintained at the federal level or in other states.
*Texas and Oklahoma have separate courts of last resort for criminal cases and other cases. In all other states, there is a single court of last resort. While collateral attacks on criminal convictions, such as state level habeas corpus petitions, are usually considered to be technically civil cases, because they are not brought by a prosecutor and do not seek to convict someone of a crime, these suits are, in both states, appealed to the criminal court of last resort, rather than the civil court of last resort.
*The highest appellate court in New York and the only appellate court in the District of Columbia, is called Court of Appeals rather than &quot;Supreme Court.&quot; In New York, the Supreme Court is the court of general jurisdiction, and has both county trial divisions and four regional Appellate Divisions that serve as the intermediate appellate courts in the New York judiciary.
*The courts of Louisiana and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are organized under a civil law model with significantly different procedures from those of the courts in all other states and the District of Columbia, which are based upon the traditions of the common law of England. The court process used in these jurisdictions differs considerably from that used in the federal courts and the courts of other states in non-criminal cases. However, the U.S. Constitution requires these jurisdictions to use procedures similar to those of other U.S. jurisdictions in criminal cases.
*The courts of one state are generally not required to follow the decisions of the courts of another state, but in the common law legal system it is customary for the courts of one state to look to decisions of other states as persuasive statements of what the law should be in the state making the decision, where express statutory provisions or prior precedent in that state do not control.
*A small number of states lack an intermediate appellate court. In those states, litigants in general jurisdiction courts usually have the right to appeal their cases directly to the state supreme court. One of the great informal traditions of American law is that everyone is generally entitled to at least one appeal of right on the merits from an adverse judgment, but the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that appeal is not a federal constitutional right, meaning that states are not obligated to provide it. Many states have rules that permit certain cases such as death penalty cases and election cases to be appealed directly to the state supreme court, even though most civil cases must be appealed first to an intermediate appellate court.
* One major difference is whether states conceptualize of their trial court of general jurisdiction as a single unified court of statewide jurisdiction that merely happens to sit in particular counties or districts, or as a set of separate and coequal courts, one for each county or district. The most extreme exponent of the first position is New York, which has a single Supreme Court that sits as a trial court with general jurisdiction throughout the entire state. The most extreme exponent of the second position is Texas, where each trial court is constituted as a legally distinct entity with a single judge. The language in the Texas Constitution requiring one judge per court was not fixed until 1985. Thus, an urban courthouse in Texas normally houses multiple single-judge trial courts sharing concurrent jurisdiction over the same county.
*In Utah, civil cases are appealed directly to the state supreme court, which then has the power to refer the case instead to an intermediate appellate court, rather than being appealed first to an intermediate appellate court and then to a state supreme court. Oklahoma has a similar structure: civil cases are appealed directly to the Supreme Court, which can refer them down to the Courts of Civil Appeals. (Criminal cases are appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals and there is no intermediate court for such cases).

==Nature of matters handled in state courts==

===Civil cases===

The vast majority of non-criminal cases in the United States are handled in state courts, rather than federal courts. For example, in Colorado, roughly 97% of all civil cases were filed in state courts and 89% of the civil cases filed in federal court were bankruptcies in 2002, a typical year. Just 0.3% of the non-bankruptcy civil cases in the state were filed in federal court.

A large share of all civil cases filed in state courts are debt collection cases. For example, in Colorado in 2002, about 87% of all civil cases filed in the courts of inferior jurisdiction were debt collection and eviction cases, while in the court of general jurisdiction, about 60% of all civil cases (other than domestic relations and probate cases) were debt collection, foreclosure, and tax collection cases. A large share of the balance of civil cases in courts of limited jurisdiction involve temporary restraining orders, typically in non-marital domestic relations contexts, and name change petitions (generally for child custody reasons or related to taking an American alternative to a non-U.S. name, marriage and divorce related name changes are normally handled elsewhere). A large share of the balance of civil cases in courts of general jurisdiction involve divorces, child custody disputes, child abuse cases, uncontested probate administrations, and personal injury cases that do not involve workplace injuries (which are usually handled through a non-judicial workers&#x27; compensation process).

Many state court civil cases produce quick default judgments or pretrial settlements, but even considering only cases that actually go to trial, state courts are the dominant forum for civil cases. In Colorado, in 2002, there were 79 civil trials in federal court (41 jury and 38 non-jury), and 5950 civil trials in state court (300 jury and 5650 non-jury). Essentially all probate and divorce cases are also brought in state court, even if the parties involved live in different states. In practice, almost all real property evictions and foreclosures are handled in state court.

State courts systems always contain some courts of &quot;general jurisdiction&quot;. All disputes which are capable of being brought in courts, arising under either state or federal law may be brought in one of the state courts, except in a few narrow case where federal law specifically limits jurisdiction exclusively to the federal courts. Some of the most notable cases exclusively in federal jurisdiction are suits between state governments, suits involving ambassadors, certain intellectual property cases, federal criminal cases, bankruptcy cases, large interstate class action cases, and most securities fraud class actions. There are also a handful of federal laws under which lawsuits can be pursued only in state court, such as those arising under the federal &quot;junk fax&quot; law. There have been times in U.S. history where almost all small claims, even if they arose under federal law, were required to be brought in state courts.

State court systems usually have expedited procedures for civil disputes involving small dollar amounts (typically under $5,000 to $25,000 depending upon the state court in question), most of which involve collection of small contractual debts (such as unpaid credit cards) and landlord-tenant matters. Many states have small claims divisions where all parties proceed in civil cases without lawyers, often before a magistrate or justice of the peace. Federal courts do not have parallel small claims procedures and apply the same civil rules to all civil cases, which makes federal court an expensive venue for a private party to pursue a claim for a small dollar amount.

Unlike state courts, federal courts are courts of &quot;limited jurisdiction&quot;, that can only hear the types of cases specified in the Constitution and federal statutes (primarily federal crimes, cases arising under federal law, cases with a United States government party, and cases involving a diversity of citizenship between the parties).

Often, a plaintiff can bring a matter either to state court or to federal court, because it arises under federal law, or involves a substantial monetary dispute (in excess of $75,000 as of October 26, 2007) arising under state law between parties that do not reside in the same state. If a plaintiff files suit in state court in such a case, the defendant can remove the case to federal court.

There is no federal constitutional right to a trial by jury in a state civil case under the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, and not all states preserve a right to a civil jury in either their state constitution or state statutes. In practice, however, civil jury trials are available, generally on a similar basis to their availability in federal court, in every state except Louisiana. In these states, there is a general right to a jury trial in cases that would arise at law in colonial England, which generally includes most cases seeking simple money damages and no other relief. In practice, about three-quarters of all civil jury trials involved personal injury cases, and most of the rest involve breaches of contracts. In states where a state constitution provides for a right to a jury trial, or a right to open courts, this has sometimes been interpreted to confer not only a procedural right to a certain type of trial, but also a substantive right to have redress through the courts for the kinds of injuries that were compensable at common law.

Prior to trial, most proceedings in non-criminal courts are conducted via papers filed in the court, often through lawyers. In limited jurisdiction courts, it is not uncommon for an initial appearance to be made in person at which a settlement is often reached. In general jurisdiction state courts, it is not uncommon for all pre-trial matters to be conducted outside the court, with attorneys negotiating scheduling matters, pre-trial examinations of witnesses taking place in lawyer&#x27;s office through depositions, and a settlement conference conducted by a private mediator at the mediator&#x27;s office.

===Criminal cases===

As of 2019, about 1,255,689 people currently behind bars in the United States—or 87.7% out of a total of 1,430,805 prisoners—had been convicted in state court for violating state criminal laws, rather than in federal court for violating federal criminal laws.

The proportion of criminal cases brought in state court rather than federal court is higher than 87.7% because misdemeanor and petty offense prosecutions are disproportionately brought in state courts and most criminal prosecutions involve misdemeanors and petty offenses. The number of trials conducted in each system is another way to illustrate the relative size of the two criminal justice systems. In Colorado, in 2002, there were approximately 40 criminal trials in federal court, and there were 1,898 criminal trials (excluding hundreds of quasi-criminal trials in juvenile cases, municipal cases and infraction cases) in state courts, so only about 2% of criminal trials took place in federal court. Most jury trials in the United States (roughly five out of six jury trials conducted in any U.S. Court) take place in criminal cases in state courts.

State courts do not have jurisdiction over criminal cases arising on Indian reservations even if those reservations are located in their state. Less serious crimes on Indian reservations are prosecuted in tribal courts. A large share of violent crimes that are prosecuted in federal court arise on Indian reservations or federal property, where state courts lack jurisdiction, since tribal court jurisdiction is usually limited to less serious offenses. Federal crimes on federal property in a state are often defined with reference to state criminal law.

Federal courts disproportionately handle white-collar crimes, immigration-related crimes and drug offenses (these crimes make up about 70% of the federal docket, but just 19% of the state court criminal docket). Federal courts have the power to bring death penalty charges under federal law, even if they arise in states where there is no death penalty under state law, but the federal government rarely utilizes this right.

Many rights of criminal defendants in state courts arise under federal law (or both state and federal law), but federal courts only examine federal violations of such rights, ie., if the state courts applied those federal rights correctly, on a direct appeal from the conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, after state court direct appeals have been exhausted, or in a collateral attack on a conviction in a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; proceeding after all state court remedies (usually including a state court &quot;habeas corpus&quot; proceeding) have been exhausted. Some rights of criminal defendants that apply in federal court do not exist in state court. For example, in many states there is no constitutional right to be indicted by a grand jury before facing a criminal prosecution for a felony or infamous misdemeanor. Oregon does not require unanimous juries in non-capital criminal cases.

Unlike non-criminal cases, criminal proceedings in state courts are primarily conducted orally, in person, in open court.

==Administration==

In most, but not all states (California and New York are significant exceptions), the state supreme court or a related administrative body has the power to write the rules of procedure that govern the courts through a rulemaking process. In a minority of the states, criminal and civil procedure are largely governed by state statutes.

Most states model their general jurisdiction trial court rules closely upon the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with modifications to address types of cases that come up only in state practice (like traffic violations), and model their professional ethics rules closely upon models drafted by the American Bar Association with minor modifications. A minority of states, however, have idiosyncratic procedural rules, often based on the Field Code in place in many states before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted. Importantly, neither California nor New York state follow federal models.

Typically, state trial courts of limited jurisdiction have generally similar rules to state trial courts of general jurisdiction, but are stripped of rules applicable to special cases like class actions and many pretrial procedures (such as out-of-court discovery in the absence of a court order).

Most state supreme courts also have general supervisory authority over the state court system. In this capacity they are responsible, for example, for making budget requests and administrative management decisions for the court system as a whole. In most states, such administrative authority has been transferred or delegated to a state judicial council which includes members of lower courts.

===State court regulation of lawyers===

All state supreme courts are the &quot;de jure&quot; primary regulatory body for all lawyers in their state and determine who can practice law and when lawyers are sanctioned for violations of professional ethical rules, which are generally also put in place as state court rules. (Federal courts sitting within the state, usually require the lawyer to be admitted first to that state&#x27;s bar). In all states, such powers have been delegated either to the state bar association or various committees, commissions, or offices directly responsible to the state supreme court. The result is that such subordinate entities generally have original jurisdiction over lawyer admissions and discipline, nearly all &quot;de facto&quot; lawyer regulation takes place through such entities, and the state supreme court becomes directly involved only when petitioned to &quot;not&quot; ratify the decisions made by some subordinate entity in its name.

==Relationship to federal courts==

Although the United States Constitution and federal laws override state laws where there is a conflict between federal and state law, state courts are not subordinate to federal courts. Rather, as instruments of separate sovereigns (under the U.S. system of dual sovereignty), they are two parallel sets of courts with different but often overlapping jurisdiction.

As the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in &quot;Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins&quot; (1938), no part of the federal Constitution actually grants federal courts the power to directly decide the content of state law. Clause 1 of Section 2 of Article Three of the United States Constitution describes the scope of federal judicial power, but only extended it to &quot;the Laws of the United States&quot; and not the laws of the several or individual states.

The U.S. Supreme Court can but is not required to review final decisions of state courts, after a party exhausts all remedies up to a request for relief from the state&#x27;s highest appellate court, if the Court believes that the case involves an important question of federal law. Because of the aforementioned silence in the Constitution (as well as Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and successor sections), the Court cannot and &quot;never&quot; reviews decisions of state courts that depend entirely on the resolution of a state law issue; there &quot;must&quot; be an issue of federal law (such as the federal constitutional right to due process) implicit in the state case before the Court will even agree to hear it. Since there really is no such issue in the vast majority of state cases, the decision of the state supreme court in such cases is effectively final, as any petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court will be summarily denied without comment.

==Nomenclature==
The following table notes the names of the courts in the states and territories of the United States. Listed are the principal trial courts of general jurisdiction, the principal intermediate appellate courts, and the state supreme courts.

Courts are described below in the singular when state law defines only one statewide court of that name (whose judges may be assigned to particular counties, circuits, or districts, but still remain part of a single court). Courts are described below in the plural when they are defined by state law as a set of separate courts, each exercising jurisdiction only over a specifically defined territory within the state.

In some states, the number of county-based courts does not exactly match the number of actual counties in the state. This occurs when a single court has jurisdiction over more than one county.

<text>The Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) is the official guide to the conduct of courts-martial in the United States military. An Executive Order of the President of the United States, the &quot;MCM&quot; details and expands on the military law established in the statute Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). It gathers both executive orders as well as opinions of said executive orders. The &quot;MCM&quot; contains five parts plus 22 appendices:
*Part I is the Preamble, which gives background and jurisdictional information
*Part II explains the Rules for Courts-martial (Rules 101 through 1307)
*Part III lays out the Military Rules of Evidence (Rules 101 through 1103)
*Part IV sets forth the elements and punishments of offenses (Punitive Articles, paragraphs 101 through 108)
*Part V provides guidelines for the imposition of non-judicial punishment (NJP)
*Appendices provide the Constitution of the United States, the UCMJ itself, analysis of the Parts, historical Executive Orders, forms, etc.

In June 2019, the &quot;Federal Register&quot; published the 2019 Manual for Courts-Martial with all recent changes.

<doc id="58607" wikidata="Q74359" url="?curid=58607" title="Hobbit">
<text>Hobbits are a fictional race of people in the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien. About half average human height, Tolkien presented hobbits as a variety of humanity, or close relatives thereof. Occasionally known as halflings in Tolkien&#x27;s writings, they live barefooted, and traditionally dwell in homely underground houses which have windows, built into the sides of hills, though others live in houses. Their feet have naturally tough leathery soles (so they do not need shoes) and are covered on top with curly hair.

Hobbits first appeared in the 1937 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, whose titular Hobbit is the protagonist Bilbo Baggins, who is thrown into an unexpected adventure involving a dragon. In its sequel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took, and Merry Brandybuck are primary characters who all play key roles in fighting to save their world (&quot;Middle-earth&quot;) from evil. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, hobbits live together in a small town called Hobbiton, which in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is identified as being part of a larger rural region called the Shire, the homeland of the hobbits in the northwest of Middle-earth. Some also live in a region east of the Shire, Bree-land, where they co-exist with Men. 

The origins of the name and idea of &quot;Hobbits&quot; have been debated; literary antecedents include Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;, and Edward Wyke Smith&#x27;s 1927 &quot;The Marvellous Land of Snergs&quot;. The word &quot;hobbit&quot; also appears in a list of ghostly beings in The Denham Tracts (1895), though these bear no similarity to Tolkien&#x27;s Hobbits. Scholars have noted Tolkien&#x27;s denial of a relationship with the word &quot;rabbit&quot;, pointing to several lines of evidence to the contrary. Hobbits are modern, unlike the heroic ancient-style cultures of Gondor and Rohan, with familiar things like umbrellas, matches, and clocks. As such they mediate between the modern world known to readers and the heroic ancient world of Middle-earth. 

Halflings appear as a race in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and the works of other fantasy authors including Terry Brooks, Jack Vance, and Clifford D. Simak.

== Origins of the word ==
 
Tolkien claimed that he started &quot;The Hobbit&quot; suddenly, without premeditation, in the midst of grading a set of student essay exams in 1930 or 1931, writing its famous opening line on a blank piece of paper: &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&quot;.

=== In English literature ===

The term &quot;hobbit&quot;, however, has real antecedents in modern English. One is a fact that Tolkien admitted: the title of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;, about a &quot;complacent American businessman&quot; who goes through a journey of some kind of self-discovery, facing &quot;near-disgrace&quot;; the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey observes that there are some parallels here with Bilbo&#x27;s own journey.

According to a letter from Tolkien to W. H. Auden, one &quot;probably ... unconscious&quot; inspiration was Edward Wyke Smith&#x27;s 1927 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Marvellous Land of Snergs&quot;. Tolkien described the Snergs as &quot;a race of people only slightly taller than the average table but broad in the shoulders and [who] have the strength of ten men.&quot;

Another possible origin emerged in 1977 when the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; announced that it had found the source that it supposed Tolkien to have used: James Hardy wrote in his 1895 &quot;The Denham Tracts, Volume 2&quot;: &quot;The whole earth was overrun with ghosts, boggles ... hobbits, hobgoblins.&quot; Shippey writes that the list was of ghostly creatures without bodies, nothing like Tolkien&#x27;s solid flesh-and-blood hobbits. Tolkien scholars consider it unlikely that Tolkien saw the list.

=== Rabbit ===

An additional connection is with rabbit, one that Tolkien &quot;emphatically rejected&quot;, although the word appears in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in connection with other characters&#x27; opinions of Bilbo in several places. Bilbo compares himself to a rabbit when he is with the eagle that carries him; the eagle, too, tells Bilbo not to be &quot;frightened like a rabbit&quot;. The giant bear-man Beorn teases Bilbo and jokes that &quot;little bunny is getting nice and fat again&quot;, while the dwarf Thorin shakes Bilbo &quot;like a rabbit&quot;.

Shippey writes that the rabbit is not a native English species, but was deliberately introduced in the 13th century, and has become accepted as a local wild animal. Shippey compares this &quot;situation of anachronism-cum-familiarity&quot; with the lifestyle of the Hobbit, giving the example of smoking &quot;pipeweed&quot;. He argues that Tolkien did not want to write &quot;tobacco&quot;, as it did not arrive until the 16th century, so Tolkien invented a calque made of English words. 
Donald O&#x27;Brien, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, notes, too, that Aragorn&#x27;s description of Frodo&#x27;s priceless &quot;mithril&quot; mail-shirt, &quot;here&#x27;s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in&quot;, is a &quot;curious echo&quot; of the English nursery rhyme &quot;To find a pretty rabbit-skin to wrap the baby bunting in.&quot;

=== Fictional etymology ===

Tolkien has King Théoden of Rohan say &quot;the Halflings, that some among us call the Holbytlan&quot;. Tolkien set out a fictional etymology for the word &quot;Hobbit&quot; in an appendix to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, that it was derived from &quot;holbytla&quot; (plural &quot;holbytlan&quot;), meaning &quot;hole-builder&quot;. This was Tolkien&#x27;s own new construction from Old English &quot;hol&quot;, &quot;a hole or hollow&quot;, and &quot;bytlan&quot;, &quot;to build&quot;.

== Description ==

=== Characteristics ===

Tolkien describes hobbits as between two and four feet (0.6–1.2 m) tall, with the average height being . They dress in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. They are usually shy, but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances. They are adept at throwing stones. For the most part, they cannot grow beards, but a few Stoor hobbits can. Their feet are covered with curly hair (usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) and have leathery soles, so Hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. Hobbits are not quite as stocky as the similarly sized dwarves, but still tend to be stout, with slightly pointed ears. Tolkien clarified their appearance in a 1938 letter to his American publisher:

Tolkien presented hobbits as relatives of the human race, or a &quot;variety&quot; or separate &quot;branch&quot; of humanity. In Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world, hobbits and other races are aware of the similarities between humans and hobbits (hence the colloquial terms for each other of &quot;Big People&quot; and &quot;Little People&quot;); nevertheless, hobbits consider themselves a separate people.

The race&#x27;s average life expectancy is 100 years, but some of Tolkien&#x27;s main Hobbit characters live much longer: Bilbo Baggins and the Old Took are described as living to the age of 130 or beyond, though Bilbo&#x27;s long lifespan owes much to his possession of the One Ring. Hobbits are considered to &quot;come of age&quot; on their 33rd birthday, so a 50-year-old hobbit would be regarded as entering middle-age.

=== Types ===

Tolkien devised a fictional history with three types of hobbits, with different physical characteristics and temperaments: &quot;Harfoots&quot;, &quot;Fallohides&quot;, and &quot;Stoors&quot;. By the time of Bilbo and Frodo, these kinds had intermixed for centuries, though unevenly, so that some families and regions skewed more towards descent from one of the three groups.

The Harfoots were by far the most numerous group of hobbits and were the first to enter the land of Eriador, which contains the Shire and Bree. They were the smallest in stature, &quot;browner of skin&quot; in complexion, and the most typical of the race as described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. They lived in holes, or &quot;smials&quot;, and had closer relations with Dwarves than other hobbits did. Harfoots tended to live in gentle rolling hill country, and were mostly agrarian. They were the first group to cross the Misty Mountains, settling in the lands around Bree starting in Third Age 1050 (about 2,000 years before the time of Bilbo and Frodo, and five and a half centuries before the founding of the Shire in Third Age 1601). Tolkien coined the term &quot;Harfoot&quot; as analogous to &quot;hairfoot&quot;.

The Fallohides were the least numerous, and the second group to enter Eriador. They were generally fair-haired, and taller and slimmer than other Hobbits. While the other two types of hobbit were on average about three and a half feet tall, Fallohides were closer on average to four feet. They were more adventurous than the other breeds and preferred living in woodlands, where they became skilled huntsmen, known for their accuracy with ranged weapons. They had closer relations with Elves, who also tended to live in forests. Due to their contact with the Elves, Fallohides were the first hobbits to learn literacy, and therefore were the only ones who preserved even vague knowledge of their past before crossing the Misty Mountains. The Fallohides crossed into Eriador about a century after the Harfoots did, and settled in the pre-existing Harfoot villages of the Bree-land. Never very numerous, the Fallohides intermixed with and were largely absorbed by the Harfoots during this time, though several prominent families such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland had a substantial Fallohide descent, unlike many of the people that they led. After about four centuries, a large expedition of hobbits migrated westward from Bree-land led by the Fallohide brothers Marcho and Blancho, who settled and founded the Shire in TA 1601.

Bilbo and three of the four principal hobbit characters in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (Frodo, Pippin, and Merry) had Fallohide blood through their common ancestor, the Old Took. The one physical description given for Frodo matches this, as Gandalf identifies him as &quot;taller than some, and fairer than most&quot;. Tolkien created the name from the archaic meanings of English words &quot;fallow&quot; and &quot;hide&quot;, meaning &quot;pale skin&quot;.

The Stoors were the second most numerous group of hobbits and the last to enter Eriador. They were quite different from the other two groups: they were stockier than other hobbits, though slightly shorter, and they were also the only group whose males were able to grow beards. They had an affinity for water, dwelt mostly beside rivers, and were the only hobbits to use boats and swim, activities which other hobbits considered dangerous and frightening. Their hands and feet were also sturdier than those of other hobbits, who generally didn&#x27;t wear shoes for cushioning their steps, though because the Stoors tended to live near muddy riverbanks they often wore boots to keep their feet dry, making them the only hobbits to use footwear of any kind. Tolkien says they were &quot;less shy of Men&quot;. The Stoors migrated into Eriador two centuries after the Fallohides did, but instead of settling in Bree-land they headed farther south to Dunland by Third Age 1300, finally migrating to the newly founded Shire in Third Age 1630, the last of the three groups to arrive. The Stoors mostly settled along the banks of the River Brandywine in the east of the Shire, thus many hobbits of Buckland and the Marish were of Stoor descent. Due to the time the Stoors spent living in Dunland before migrating to the Shire, their names have a slight Celtic influence.

A small group of Stoors did not go as far south as Dunland but settled in the wetlands of the Angle in southern Rhudaur, between Dunland and Bree. When the evil power of Angmar rose in the north many of these Stoors joined their kin in Dunland, but some fled back east over the mountains and settled in the marshes of the Gladden Fields: Déagol and Sméagol/Gollum both belonged to this group. Tolkien used the Old English word &quot;stor&quot; or &quot;stoor&quot;, meaning &quot;strong&quot;.

=== Lifestyle and culture ===

In his writings, Tolkien depicted hobbits as fond of an unadventurous, bucolic and simple life of farming, eating, and socializing, although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises. They would enjoy six meals a day, if they could get them. They claimed to have invented the art of smoking pipe-weed. 
They were extremely &quot;clannish&quot; and had strong &quot;predilections for genealogy&quot;; accordingly, Tolkien included several Hobbit family trees in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Most hobbits married and had large families, although Bilbo and Frodo were exceptions to this general rule.

The hobbits of the Shire developed the custom of giving away gifts on their birthdays, instead of receiving them, although this custom was not universally followed among other hobbit cultures or communities. The term &quot;&quot; is used for old and useless objects, but which hobbits are unwilling to throw away. &quot;Mathoms&quot; are invariably given as presents many times over, sometimes returning to the original owner, or are stored in a museum (&quot;mathom-house&quot;).

The hobbits had a distinct calendar: every year started on a Saturday and ended on a Friday, with each of the twelve months consisting of thirty days. Some special days did not belong to any month—Yule 1 and 2 (New Year&#x27;s Eve &amp; New Years Day) and three Lithedays in mid-summer. Every fourth year there was an extra Litheday, most likely as an adaptation, similar to a leap year, to ensure that the calendar remained in time with the seasons.

Hobbits traditionally live in &quot;hobbit-holes&quot;, or &quot;smials&quot;, underground homes found in hillsides, downs, and banks, though others lived in houses. It has been suggested that the soil or ground of the Shire consists of loess and that this facilitates the construction of hobbit-holes. Loess is a yellow soil, which would explain the colour of the Brandywine River, and the nature of the bricks made at Stock, the main Shire brickyard. Hobbit architecture favours round doors and windows.

Tolkien likened his own tastes to those of hobbits in a 1958 letter:

== Fictional history ==

=== In Rhovanion ===

In their earliest folk tales, hobbits appear to have lived in Rhovanion, in the Valley of Anduin, between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains. According to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, they had lost the genealogical details of how they are related to the Big People. Still, Tolkien clearly states in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; that hobbits are not technically a distinct race from Men, the way that Elves or Dwarves are, but branched off from other humans in the distant past of the Elder Days. Many eons later, but still early in the Third Age, the ancient hobbits lived in the valley of the Anduin River, close by the Éothéod, the ancestors of the Rohirrim. This led to some contact between the two, and as a result many old words and names in &quot;Hobbitish&quot; are derivatives of words in Rohirric (which Tolkien &quot;translated&quot; into his text by presenting it as Old English).

The Harfoots lived on the lowest slopes of the Misty Mountains in Hobbit-holes dug into the hillsides. They were not only smaller and shorter, but also beard- and bootless. The Stoors lived on the marshy Gladden Fields where the Gladden River met the Anduin, and were broader and heavier in build; and the Fallohides preferred to live in the woods under the Misty Mountains. They were described as fairer of skin and hair, as well as taller and slimmer than the rest of the hobbits.

=== Migration to the West ===

In the Third Age, hobbits undertook the arduous task of crossing the Misty Mountains - a migration period they refer to as the &quot;Wandering Days&quot;, the earliest remembered time in their history. Reasons for this trek are unknown, but they possibly had to do with Sauron&#x27;s growing power in nearby Greenwood, which later became known as Mirkwood as a result of the shadow that fell upon it during his search of the forest for the One Ring. Hobbits took different routes in their journey westward, but as they began to settle together in Bree-land, Dunland, and the Angle formed by the rivers Mitheithel and Bruinen, the divisions between the hobbit-kinds began to blur. Shippey explains that the name &quot;Angle&quot; has a special resonance, as the name &quot;England&quot; comes from the Angle (Anglia) between the Flensburg Fjord and the River Schlei, in the north of Germany next to Denmark, the origin of the Angles among the Anglo-Saxons who founded England. Further, the migrations of the three types of hobbit mirror those of England&#x27;s founders.

=== Foundation of the Shire ===

In the year 1601 of the Third Age (year 1 in the Shire Reckoning), two Fallohide brothers named Marcho and Blanco gained permission from the King of Arnor at Fornost to cross the River Brandywine and settle on the other side. The new land that they founded on the west bank of the Brandywine was called The Shire. Many hobbits followed them, and by the end of the Third Age most hobbits outside The Shire could be found in their village of Staddle on the southeastern slopes of Bree-hill. However, some also lived with Men in the village of Bree itself and in nearby Archet and Combe. 

Originally the hobbits of the Shire swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arnor, being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against Angmar at the Battle of Fornost, the hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded. After the battle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in the absence of the king, the hobbits elected a Thain of the Shire from among their own chieftains.

The first Thain of the Shire was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the Oldbuck family. However, the Oldbuck family later crossed the Brandywine River to create the separate land of Buckland and the family name changed to the familiar &quot;Brandybuck&quot;. Their patriarch then became Master of Buckland. With the departure of the Oldbucks/Brandybucks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thain: the Took family (Pippin Took was son of the Thain and would later become Thain himself). The Thain was in charge of Shire Moot and Muster and the Hobbitry-in-Arms, but as the hobbits of the Shire generally led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives the office of Thain came to be seen as something of a formality.

Hobbits first appear in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as the rural people of the Shire; the book tells of the unexpected adventure that happened to one of them, Bilbo, as a party of Dwarves seeks to recover an ancient treasure from the hoard of a dragon. They are again central to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, an altogether darker tale, where Bilbo&#x27;s younger cousin Frodo sets out from the Shire to destroy the Ring that Bilbo had brought home.

== Analysis ==

=== Moral significance ===

The Tolkien critic Paul H. Kocher notes that Tolkien&#x27;s literary techniques require readers to view hobbits as like humans, especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land. Frodo becomes in some ways the symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; which Tolkien wrote at the same time as the first nine chapters of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: &quot;it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything&quot;. After discipline in Purgatory, however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development. Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by the Witch-King of Angmar on Weathertop, Gandalf speculates that the hobbit Frodo &quot;may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can&quot;. Similarly, as Frodo nears Mount Doom he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: &quot;For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane&quot;.

=== Modern mediators ===

Tolkien scholars including Shippey and Dimitra Fimi have stated that the hobbits are misfits in Middle-earth&#x27;s heroic cultures like Gondor and Rohan. Those have a basis in ancient societies such as ancient Rome and the Anglo-Saxons. In contrast, Tolkien placed the Shire in a society he had personally experienced, &quot;more or less a Warwickshire village of about the period of the Diamond Jubilee [of Queen Victoria, in 1897]&quot;. Shippey described hobbit culture, complete with tobacco and potatoes, as a &quot;creative anachronism&quot; on Tolkien&#x27;s part. In his view, anachronism is the &quot;essential function&quot; of hobbits, enabling Tolkien to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; by mediating between readers&#x27; lives in the modern world and the dangerous ancient world of Middle-earth. 

Fimi comments that this applies both to the style of language used by hobbits, and to their material culture of &quot;umbrellas, camping kettles, matches, clocks, pocket handkerchiefs and fireworks&quot;, all of which are plainly modern, as are the fish and chips that Sam Gamgee thinks of on his journey to Mordor. Most striking, in her view, however, is Tolkien&#x27;s description of the enormous dragon firework at Bilbo&#x27;s party which rushed overhead &quot;like an express train&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s drawing of the hall of Bilbo&#x27;s home, Bag End, shows both a clock and a barometer (mentioned in an early draft), and he had another clock on his mantelpiece. To arrange a party, hobbits rely on a daily postal service. The effect, the scholars agree, is to bring the reader comfortably into the ancient heroic world.

== In popular culture ==

=== Fantasy ===

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; began using the name &quot;halfling&quot; as an alternative to &quot;hobbit&quot; for legal reasons. Fantasy authors including Terry Brooks, Jack Vance, and Clifford D. Simak use races of halflings.

Peter Jackson&#x27;s films of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; made extensive use of prosthetics. Wētā Workshop spent a year creating hobbit feet to look like large, furry feet, yet act as shoes for the actors. In total, 1,800 pairs were worn by the four lead hobbit actors during production. In addition, actors went in for face casts to create pointed ears and false noses.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, a series screened from 2022, has attracted &quot;fierce debate&quot; about its handling of race, and racism aimed at the actors playing the Harfoots. The fantasy author Neil Gaiman, defending the casting, commented that &quot;Tolkien described the Harfoots as &quot;browner of skin&quot; than the other Hobbits. So I think anyone grumbling is either racist or hasn&#x27;t read their Tolkien.&quot; Commentators have observed that the hobbit-like Harfoots speak in Irish accents, behave as friendly peasants, and are accompanied by Celtic music; and that they resemble the 19th century caricaturist John Leech&#x27;s &quot;wildly unflattering&quot; depictions of the Irish in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine.

=== Popular music ===

The comic horror rock band Rosemary&#x27;s Billygoat recorded a song and video called &quot;Hobbit Feet&quot;, about a man who takes a girl home from a bar only to discover she has horrifying &quot;hobbit feet&quot;. According to lead singer Mike Odd, the band received over 100 pieces of hate mail from angry Tolkien fans.

=== Fossil hominids ===

The skeletal remains of several diminutive paleolithic hominids were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2004. The fossils, of a species named &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; after the island on which the remains were found, were informally dubbed &quot;Hobbits&quot; by their discoverers in a series of articles published in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;. The excavated skeletons reveal a hominid that (like a Hobbit) grew no larger than a three-year-old modern child and had proportionately larger feet than modern humans.

<text>Trusted Computing (TC) is a technology developed and promoted by the Trusted Computing Group. The term is taken from the field of trusted systems and has a specialized meaning that is distinct from the field of confidential computing. With Trusted Computing, the computer will consistently behave in expected ways, and those behaviors will be enforced by computer hardware and software. Enforcing this behavior is achieved by loading the hardware with a unique encryption key that is inaccessible to the rest of the system and the owner.

TC is controversial as the hardware is not only secured for its owner, but also against its owner, leading opponents of the technology like free software activist Richard Stallman to deride it as &quot;treacherous computing&quot;, and certain scholarly articles to use scare quotes when referring to the technology.

Trusted Computing proponents such as International Data Corporation, the Enterprise Strategy Group and Endpoint Technologies Associates state that the technology will make computers safer, less prone to viruses and malware, and thus more reliable from an end-user perspective. They also state that Trusted Computing will allow computers and servers to offer improved computer security over that which is currently available. Opponents often state that this technology will be used primarily to enforce digital rights management policies (imposed restrictions to the owner) and not to increase computer security.

Chip manufacturers Intel and AMD, hardware manufacturers such as HP and Dell, and operating system providers such as Microsoft include Trusted Computing in their products if enabled. The U.S. Army requires that every new PC it purchases comes with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). As of July 3, 2007, so does virtually the entire United States Department of Defense.

==Key concepts==
Trusted Computing encompasses six key technology concepts, of which all are required for a fully Trusted system, that is, a system compliant to the TCG specifications:
# Endorsement key
# Secure input and output
# Memory curtaining / protected execution
# Sealed storage
# Remote attestation
# Trusted Third Party (TTP)

===Endorsement key===
The endorsement key is a 2048-bit RSA public and private key pair that is created randomly on the chip at manufacture time and cannot be changed. The private key never leaves the chip, while the public key is used for attestation and for encryption of sensitive data sent to the chip, as occurs during the TPM_TakeOwnership command.

This key is used to allow the execution of secure transactions: every Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is required to be able to sign a random number (in order to allow the owner to show that he has a genuine trusted computer), using a particular protocol created by the Trusted Computing Group (the direct anonymous attestation protocol) in order to ensure its compliance of the TCG standard and to prove its identity; this makes it impossible for a software TPM emulator with an untrusted endorsement key (for example, a self-generated one) to start a secure transaction with a trusted entity. The TPM should be designed to make the extraction of this key by hardware analysis hard, but tamper resistance is not a strong requirement.

===Memory curtaining===
Memory curtaining extends common memory protection techniques to provide full isolation of sensitive areas of memory—for example, locations containing cryptographic keys. Even the operating system does not have full access to curtained memory. The exact implementation details are vendor specific.

===Sealed storage===
Sealed storage protects private information by binding it to platform configuration information including the software and hardware being used. This means the data can be released only to a particular combination of software and hardware. Sealed storage can be used for DRM enforcing. For example, users who keep a song on their computer that has not been licensed to be listened will not be able to play it. Currently, a user can locate the song, listen to it, and send it to someone else, play it in the software of their choice, or back it up (and in some cases, use circumvention software to decrypt it). Alternatively, the user may use software to modify the operating system&#x27;s DRM routines to have it leak the song data once, say, a temporary license was acquired. Using sealed storage, the song is securely encrypted using a key bound to the trusted platform module so that only the unmodified and untampered music player on his or her computer can play it. In this DRM architecture, this might also prevent people from listening to the song after buying a new computer, or upgrading parts of their current one, except after explicit permission of the vendor of the song.

===Remote attestation===
Remote attestation allows changes to the user&#x27;s computer to be detected by authorized parties. For example, software companies can identify unauthorized changes to software, including users modifying their software to circumvent commercial digital rights restrictions. It works by having the hardware generate a certificate stating what software is currently running. The computer can then present this certificate to a remote party to show that unaltered software is currently executing. Numerous remote attestation schemes have been proposed for various computer architectures, including Intel, RISC-V, and ARM.

Remote attestation is usually combined with public-key encryption so that the information sent can only be read by the programs that requested the attestation, and not by an eavesdropper.

To take the song example again, the user&#x27;s music player software could send the song to other machines, but only if they could attest that they were running an authorized copy of the music player software. Combined with the other technologies, this provides a more restricted path for the music: encrypted I/O prevents the user from recording it as it is transmitted to the audio subsystem, memory locking prevents it from being dumped to regular disk files as it is being worked on, sealed storage curtails unauthorized access to it when saved to the hard drive, and remote attestation prevents unauthorized software from accessing the song even when it is used on other computers. To preserve the privacy of attestation responders, Direct Anonymous Attestation has been proposed as a solution, which uses a group signature scheme to prevent revealing the identity of individual signers.

Proof of space (PoS) have been proposed to be used for malware detection, by determining whether the L1 cache of a processor is empty (e.g., has enough space to evaluate the PoSpace routine without cache misses) or contains a routine that resisted being evicted.

===Trusted third party===
==Known applications==
The Microsoft products Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows RT make use of a Trusted Platform Module to facilitate BitLocker Drive Encryption. Other known applications with runtime encryption and the use of secure enclaves include the Signal messenger and the e-prescription service (&quot;E-Rezept&quot;) by the German government.

==Possible applications==
===Digital rights management===
Trusted Computing would allow companies to create a digital rights management (DRM) system which would be very hard to circumvent, though not impossible. An example is downloading a music file. Sealed storage could be used to prevent the user from opening the file with an unauthorized player or computer. Remote attestation could be used to authorize play only by music players that enforce the record company&#x27;s rules. The music would be played from curtained memory, which would prevent the user from making an unrestricted copy of the file while it is playing, and secure I/O would prevent capturing what is being sent to the sound system. Circumventing such a system would require either manipulation of the computer&#x27;s hardware, capturing the analogue (and thus degraded) signal using a recording device or a microphone, or breaking the security of the system.

New business models for use of software (services) over Internet may be boosted by the technology. By strengthening the DRM system, one could base a business model on renting programs for a specific time periods or &quot;pay as you go&quot; models. For instance, one could download a music file which could only be played a certain number of times before it becomes unusable, or the music file could be used only within a certain time period.

===Preventing cheating in online games===
Trusted Computing could be used to combat cheating in online games. Some players modify their game copy in order to gain unfair advantages in the game; remote attestation, secure I/O and memory curtaining could be used to determine that all players connected to a server were running an unmodified copy of the software.

===Verification of remote computation for grid computing===
Trusted Computing could be used to guarantee participants in a grid computing system are returning the results of the computations they claim to be instead of forging them. This would allow large scale simulations to be run (say a climate simulation) without expensive redundant computations to guarantee malicious hosts are not undermining the results to achieve the conclusion they want.

==Criticism==

The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Free Software Foundation criticize that trust in the underlying companies is not deserved and that the technology puts too much power and control into the hands of those who design systems and software. They also state that it may cause consumers to lose anonymity in their online interactions, as well as mandating technologies Trusted Computing opponents say are unnecessary. They suggest Trusted Computing as a possible enabler for future versions of mandatory access control, copy protection, and DRM.

Some security experts, such as Alan Cox and Bruce Schneier, have spoken out against Trusted Computing, believing it will provide computer manufacturers and software authors with increased control to impose restrictions on what users are able to do with their computers. There are concerns that Trusted Computing would have an anti-competitive effect on the IT market.

There is concern amongst critics that it will not always be possible to examine the hardware components on which Trusted Computing relies, the Trusted Platform Module, which is the ultimate hardware system where the core &#x27;root&#x27; of trust in the platform has to reside. If not implemented correctly, it presents a security risk to overall platform integrity and protected data. The specifications, as published by the Trusted Computing Group, are open and are available for anyone to review. However, the final implementations by commercial vendors will not necessarily be subjected to the same review process. In addition, the world of cryptography can often move quickly, and that hardware implementations of algorithms might create an inadvertent obsolescence. Trusting networked computers to controlling authorities rather than to individuals may create digital imprimaturs.

Cryptographer Ross Anderson, University of Cambridge, has great concerns that:

TC can support remote censorship [...] In general, digital objects created using TC systems remain under the control of their creators, rather than under the control of the person who owns the machine on which they happen to be stored [...] So someone who writes a paper that a court decides is defamatory can be compelled to censor it — and the software company that wrote the word processor could be ordered to do the deletion if she refuses. Given such possibilities, we can expect TC to be used to suppress everything from pornography to writings that criticize political leaders.

He goes on to state that:

[...] software suppliers can make it much harder for you to switch to their competitors&#x27; products. At a simple level, Word could encrypt all your documents using keys that only Microsoft products have access to; this would mean that you could only read them using Microsoft products, not with any competing word processor. [...]

The [...] most important benefit for Microsoft is that TC will dramatically increase the costs of switching away from Microsoft products (such as Office) to rival products (such as OpenOffice). For example, a law firm that wants to change from Office to OpenOffice right now merely has to install the software, train the staff and convert their existing files. In five years&#x27; time, once they have received TC-protected documents from perhaps a thousand different clients, they would have to get permission (in the form of signed digital certificates) from each of these clients in order to migrate their files to a new platform. The law firm won&#x27;t in practice want to do this, so they will be much more tightly locked in, which will enable Microsoft to hike its prices.

Anderson summarizes the case by saying:

The fundamental issue is that whoever controls the TC infrastructure will acquire a huge amount of power. Having this single point of control is like making everyone use the same bank, or the same accountant, or the same lawyer. There are many ways in which this power could be abused.

===Digital rights management===
One of the early motivations behind trusted computing was a desire by media and software corporations for stricter DRM technology to prevent users from freely sharing and using potentially copyrighted or private files without explicit permission.
An example could be downloading a music file from a band: the band&#x27;s record company could come up with rules for how the band&#x27;s music can be used. For example, they might want the user to play the file only three times a day without paying additional money. Also, they could use remote attestation to only send their music to a music player that enforces their rules: sealed storage would prevent the user from opening the file with another player that did not enforce the restrictions. Memory curtaining would prevent the user from making an unrestricted copy of the file while it is playing, and secure output would prevent capturing what is sent to the sound system.

===Users unable to modify software===
A user who wanted to switch to a competing program might find that it would be impossible for that new program to read old data, as the information would be &quot;locked in&quot; to the old program. It could also make it impossible for the user to read or modify their data except as specifically permitted by the software.

===Users unable to exercise legal rights===
The law in many countries allows users certain rights over data whose copyright they do not own (including text, images, and other media), often under headings such as fair use or public interest. Depending on jurisdiction, these may cover issues such as whistleblowing, production of evidence in court, quoting or other small-scale usage, backups of owned media, and making a copy of owned material for personal use on other owned devices or systems. The steps implicit in trusted computing have the practical effect of preventing users exercising these legal rights.

===Users vulnerable to vendor withdrawal of service===
A service that requires external validation or permission - such as a music file or game that requires connection with the vendor to confirm permission to play or use - is vulnerable to that service being withdrawn or no longer updated. A number of incidents have already occurred where users, having purchased music or video media, have found their ability to watch or listen to it suddenly stop due to vendor policy or cessation of service, or server inaccessibility, at times with no compensation. Alternatively in some cases the vendor refuses to provide services in future which leaves purchased material only usable on the present -and increasingly obsolete- hardware (so long as it lasts) but not on any hardware that may be purchased in future.

===Users unable to override===
Some opponents of Trusted Computing advocate &quot;owner override&quot;: allowing an owner who is confirmed to be physically present to allow the computer to bypass restrictions and use the secure I/O path. Such an override would allow remote attestation to a user&#x27;s specification, e.g., to create certificates that say Internet Explorer is running, even if a different browser is used. Instead of preventing software change, remote attestation would indicate when the software has been changed without owner&#x27;s permission.

Trusted Computing Group members have refused to implement owner override. Proponents of trusted computing believe that owner override defeats the trust in other computers since remote attestation can be forged by the owner. Owner override offers the security and enforcement benefits to a machine owner, but does not allow them to trust other computers, because their owners could waive rules or restrictions on their own computers. Under this scenario, once data is sent to someone else&#x27;s computer, whether it be a diary, a DRM music file, or a joint project, that other person controls what security, if any, their computer will enforce on their copy of those data. This has the potential to undermine the applications of trusted computing to enforce DRM, control cheating in online games and attest to remote computations for grid computing.

===Loss of anonymity===
Because a Trusted Computing equipped computer is able to uniquely attest to its own identity, it will be possible for vendors and others who possess the ability to use the attestation feature to zero in on the identity of the user of TC-enabled software with a high degree of certainty.

Such a capability is contingent on the reasonable chance that the user at some time provides user-identifying information, whether voluntarily, indirectly, or simply through inference of many seemingly benign pieces of data. (e.g. search records, as shown through simple study of the AOL search records leak). One common way that information can be obtained and linked is when a user registers a computer just after purchase. Another common way is when a user provides identifying information to the website of an affiliate of the vendor.

While proponents of TC point out that online purchases and credit transactions could potentially be more secure as a result of the remote attestation capability, this may cause the computer user to lose expectations of anonymity when using the Internet.

Critics point out that this could have a chilling effect on political free speech, the ability of journalists to use anonymous sources, whistle blowing, political blogging and other areas where the public needs protection from retaliation through anonymity.

The TPM specification offers features and suggested implementations that are meant to address the anonymity requirement. By using a third-party Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), the information that identifies the computer could be held by a trusted third party. Additionally, the use of direct anonymous attestation (DAA), introduced in TPM v1.2, allows a client to perform attestation while not revealing any personally identifiable or machine information.

The kind of data that must be supplied to the TTP in order to get the trusted status is at present not entirely clear, but the TCG itself admits that &quot;attestation is an important TPM function with significant privacy implications&quot;. It is, however, clear that both static and dynamic information about the user computer may be supplied (Ekpubkey) to the TTP (v1.1b), it is not clear what data will be supplied to the “verifier” under v1.2. The static information will uniquely identify the endorser of the platform, model, details of the TPM, and that the platform (PC) complies with the TCG specifications . The dynamic information is described as software running on the computer. If a program like Windows is registered in the user&#x27;s name this in turn will uniquely identify the user. Another dimension of privacy infringing capabilities might also be introduced with this new technology; how often you use your programs might be possible information provided to the TTP. In an exceptional, however practical situation, where a user purchases a pornographic movie on the Internet, the purchaser nowadays, must accept the fact that he has to provide credit card details to the provider, thereby possibly risking being identified. With the new technology a purchaser might also risk someone finding out that he (or she) has watched this pornographic movie 1000 times. This adds a new dimension to the possible privacy infringement. The extent of data that will be supplied to the TTP/Verifiers is at present not exactly known, only when the technology is implemented and used will we be able to assess the exact nature and volume of the data that is transmitted.

===TCG specification interoperability problems===
Trusted Computing requests that all software and hardware vendors will follow the technical specifications released by the Trusted Computing Group in order to allow interoperability between different trusted software stacks. However, since at least mid-2006, there have been interoperability problems between the TrouSerS trusted software stack (released as open source software by IBM) and Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s stack. Another problem is that the technical specifications are still changing, so it is unclear which is the standard implementation of the trusted stack.

===Shutting out of competing products===
People have voiced concerns that trusted computing could be used to keep or discourage users from running software created by companies outside of a small industry group. Microsoft has received a great deal of bad press surrounding their Palladium software architecture, evoking comments such as &quot;Few pieces of vaporware have evoked a higher level of fear and uncertainty than Microsoft&#x27;s Palladium&quot;, &quot;Palladium is a plot to take over cyberspace&quot;, and &quot;Palladium will keep us from running any software not personally approved by Bill Gates&quot;. The concerns about trusted computing being used to shut out competition exist within a broader framework of consumers being concerned about using bundling of products to obscure prices of products and to engage in anti-competitive practices. Trusted Computing is seen as harmful or problematic to independent and open source software developers.

===Trust===
In the widely used public-key cryptography, creation of keys can be done on the local computer and the creator has complete control over who has access to it, and consequentially their own security policies. In some proposed encryption-decryption chips, a private/public key is permanently embedded into the hardware when it is manufactured, and hardware manufacturers would have the opportunity to record the key without leaving evidence of doing so. With this key it would be possible to have access to data encrypted with it, and to authenticate as it. It is trivial for a manufacturer to give a copy of this key to the government or the software manufacturers, as the platform must go through steps so that it works with authenticated software.

Therefore, to trust anything that is authenticated by or encrypted by a TPM or a Trusted computer, an end user has to trust the company that made the chip, the company that designed the chip, the companies allowed to make software for the chip, and the ability and interest of those companies not to compromise the whole process. A security breach breaking that chain of trust happened to a SIM card manufacturer Gemalto, which in 2010 was infiltrated by US and British spies, resulting in compromised security of cellphone calls.

It is also critical that one be able to trust that the hardware manufacturers and software developers properly implement trusted computing standards. Incorrect implementation could be hidden from users, and thus could undermine the integrity of the whole system without users being aware of the flaw.

==Hardware and software support==

Since 2004, most major manufacturers have shipped systems that have included Trusted Platform Modules, with associated BIOS support. In accordance with the TCG specifications, the user must enable the Trusted Platform Module before it can be used.

The Linux kernel has included trusted computing support since version 2.6.13, and there are several projects to implement trusted computing for Linux. In January 2005, members of Gentoo Linux&#x27;s &quot;crypto herd&quot; announced their intention of providing support for TC—in particular support for the Trusted Platform Module. There is also a TCG-compliant software stack for Linux named TrouSerS, released under an open source license. There are several open-source projects that facilitate the use of confidential computing technology, including EGo, EdgelessDB and MarbleRun from Edgeless Systems, as well as Enarx, which originates from security research at Red Hat.

Some limited form of trusted computing can be implemented on current versions of Microsoft Windows with third-party software. Major cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform have virtual machines with trusted computing features available. With the Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) and AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) processors, there is hardware available for runtime memory encryption and remote attestation features.

The Intel Classmate PC (a competitor to the One Laptop Per Child) includes a Trusted Platform Module.

PrivateCore vCage software can be used to attest x86 servers with TPM chips.

Mobile T6 secure operating system simulates the TPM functionality in mobile devices using the ARM TrustZone technology.

Samsung smartphones come equipped with Samsung Knox that depend on features like Secure Boot, TIMA, MDM, TrustZone and SE Linux.

<text>A courthouse or court house is a structure which houses judicial functions for a governmental entity such as a state, region, province, county, prefecture, regency, or similar governmental unit. A courthouse is home to one or more courtrooms, the enclosed space in which a judge presides over a court, and one or more chambers, the private offices of judges. Larger courthouses often also have space for offices of judicial support staff such as court clerks and deputy clerks.

The term is commonly used in the English-speaking countries of North America. In most other English-speaking countries, buildings which house courts of law are simply called &quot;courts&quot; or &quot;court buildings&quot;. In most of continental Europe and former non-English-speaking European colonies, the equivalent term is a palace of justice (French: palais de justice, Italian: palazzo di giustizia, Portuguese: palácio da justiça).

==United States==


In the United States, most counties maintain trial courts in a county-based courthouse, which also house other county government offices. The courthouse may be a part of a wider county government building or complex. The courthouse is usually located in the county seat, although large metropolitan counties may have satellite or annex offices for their courts.

In some cases, the building housing the courthouse may be named in some way or its function divided as between a judicial building and administrative office building. Philadelphia City Hall, for instance, serves as the seat of the legislative and executive functions of the consolidated city and county of Philadelphia, but most of its floor space is devoted to the Civil Division of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania shares space with three local governments and with the legislative and executive branches of the state government of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia City Hall in Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, which it shares with the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the Governor of Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh City-County Building in Pittsburgh, which it shares with the governments of the City of Pittsburgh and of Allegheny County.

Many judges also officiate at civil marriage ceremonies in their courthouse chambers. In some places, the courthouse also contains the main administrative office for the county government, or when a new courthouse is constructed, the former one will often be used for other local government offices. Either way, a typical courthouse will have one or more courtrooms and a court clerk&#x27;s office with a filing window where litigants may submit documents for filing with the court.

Each United States district court also has a federally owned building that houses courtrooms, chambers and clerk&#x27;s offices. Many federal judicial districts are further split into divisions, which may also have their own courthouses. However, sometimes divisional court facilities are located in buildings that also house other agencies or offices of the United States government; for instance, the Mitchell H. Cohen United States Courthouse in Camden, New Jersey houses a United States post office as well as court facilities for the District of New Jersey.

Some branches of U.S. federal government courts are housed in rented office space in buildings housing commercial tenants; for instance, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is located in an office building in Wilmington, Delaware, across the street from the main courthouse of the district court. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California has a courthouse in Yosemite to hear misdemeanors and petty crimes for Yosemite National Park. Most of the United States courts of appeals are based in the main courthouses of the federal district court in the city in which they are seated.

The courthouse is part of the iconography of American life and is equivalent to the city hall as the symbol of the municipium in European free cities. Courthouses are often shown in American cinema (i.e. &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, and &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;). They range from small-town rural buildings with a few rooms to huge metropolitan courthouses that occupy large plots of land. The style of American architecture used varies, with common styles including federal, Greek Revival, neoclassicist, and modern.

===Security===

Due to the modalities involved in the hearing of complex cases, including civil, criminal, and family law disputes, the architecture of court buildings can present significant security challenges to enforcement officers. Architects typically use two main tools to mitigate security risks within the adjudicative space depending upon local needs, such as the proliferation of weapons: secure entrance vestibules and separation of circulation pathways and adjacencies within the footprint of the building.

Secure entrance vestibules provide court staff the opportunity to screen visitors to the building for contraband, such as weapons and narcotics, as well as for unauthorized access. Mid size to larger courthouses often have separate entrances to the building for the public, prisoners, judges, and witnesses. These entrances may be monitored remotely from a central security station. In lower risk settings, the security screening may be more perfunctory and serve as an information desk to direct visitors to the various agencies and offices housed within the court building.

Once users of the court have entered the building through security screenings and access control checkpoints, the circulation systems of passageways through the building provide discrete pathways by which the public, court staff, and in-custody defendants access to courtrooms and other court services, such as attorneys, pretrial and probation services, and clerks&#x27; offices. The circulation pathways and adjacency diagrams designed for newer and larger courthouses often ensure that the only place the systems of circulation, including hallways, stairwells, and elevators overlap is within the monitored setting of the courtroom. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to court materials by the public, such as court clerk record vaults, as well as the risk of in-custody defendants intimidating witnesses or jurors while being escorted through the public areas of the courthouse.

For example, the Los Angeles Superior Court added such checkpoints to all entrances to its main courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles after a woman was shot and killed by her ex-husband in open court in September 1995. The Supreme Court of California ruled in 2002 that Los Angeles County (which at the time was responsible for maintaining the courthouses) was not liable to her three children under the California Government Tort Claims Act.

After the Oklahoma City bombing, the federal government proceeded to heavily fortify all large federal buildings, including many urban courthouses.

Some courthouses in areas with high levels of violent crime have redundant layers of security. For example, when the Supreme Court of California hears oral argument in San Francisco or Los Angeles, visitors must pass through one security checkpoint to enter the building, and another to enter the courtroom.

== Canada ==
In Canada, each municipality constructs its own courthouse, or several in the case of large cities. In smaller communities the court is in the same building as the city hall and other municipal offices. In the past many courthouses also included the local prison.

One well-known court house in Canada is the Romanesque Revival (Neo-Romanesque) Old City Hall in Toronto, Ontario. Designed by E.J. Lennox, Old City Hall was completed in 1899 and has been functioning as a municipal building ever since. It was originally constructed to facilitate Toronto&#x27;s City Council, legal and municipal offices and the city&#x27;s courts however following the construction of the fourth city hall (adjacent to the third, on Queen Street) the building&#x27;s purpose was limited to being solely a courthouse for the Ontario Court of Justice. The building can be described as Romanesque Revival due to multiple characteristics it shares with Romanesque architecture, despite being constructed seven centuries later in a completely different continent. These characteristics include the materiality in terms of large stone construction, the repetitive rhythmic use of windows containing various sized arches and barrel vaults directing attention towards them, decorated spandrels (wall section connecting arches) and the inclusion of gabled walls (pointed sections). Old City Hall has been designated a National Historical Site since 1989.

<doc id="58610" wikidata="Q233858" url="?curid=58610" title="Non-Euclidean geometry">
<text>In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those that specify Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises by either replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative, or relaxing the metric requirement. In the former case, one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional non-Euclidean geometries. When the metric requirement is relaxed, then there are affine planes associated with the planar algebras, which give rise to kinematic geometries that have also been called non-Euclidean geometry.

==Principles==
The essential difference between the metric geometries is the nature of parallel lines. Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate, the parallel postulate, is equivalent to Playfair&#x27;s postulate, which states that, within a two-dimensional plane, for any given line and a point &quot;A&quot;, which is not on , there is exactly one line through &quot;A&quot; that does not intersect . In hyperbolic geometry, by contrast, there are infinitely many lines through &quot;A&quot; not intersecting , while in elliptic geometry, any line through &quot;A&quot; intersects .

Another way to describe the differences between these geometries is to consider two straight lines indefinitely extended in a two-dimensional plane that are both perpendicular to a third line (in the same plane):
* In Euclidean geometry, the lines remain at a constant distance from each other (meaning that a line drawn perpendicular to one line at any point will intersect the other line and the length of the line segment joining the points of intersection remains constant) and are known as parallels.
* In hyperbolic geometry, they diverge from each other, increasing in distance as one moves further from the points of intersection with the common perpendicular; these lines are often called ultraparallels.
* In elliptic geometry, the lines converge toward each other and intersect.

==History==
===Background===

Euclidean geometry, named after the Greek mathematician Euclid, includes some of the oldest known mathematics, and geometries that deviated from this were not widely accepted as legitimate until the 19th century.

The debate that eventually led to the discovery of the non-Euclidean geometries began almost as soon as Euclid wrote &quot;Elements&quot;. In the &quot;Elements&quot;, Euclid begins with a limited number of assumptions (23 definitions, five common notions, and five postulates) and seeks to prove all the other results (propositions) in the work. The most notorious of the postulates is often referred to as &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Fifth Postulate&quot;, or simply the &quot;parallel postulate&quot;, which in Euclid&#x27;s original formulation is:
If a straight line falls on two straight lines in such a manner that the interior angles on the same side are together less than two right angles, then the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.
Other mathematicians have devised simpler forms of this property. Regardless of the form of the postulate, however, it consistently appears more complicated than Euclid&#x27;s other postulates:

# To draw a straight line from any point to any point.
# To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
# To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius].
# That all right angles are equal to one another.

For at least a thousand years, geometers were troubled by the disparate complexity of the fifth postulate, and believed it could be proved as a theorem from the other four. Many attempted to find a proof by contradiction, including Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 11th century), Omar Khayyám (12th century), Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī (13th century), and Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (18th century).

The theorems of Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi on quadrilaterals, including the Lambert quadrilateral and Saccheri quadrilateral, were &quot;the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries&quot;. These theorems along with their alternative postulates, such as Playfair&#x27;s axiom, played an important role in the later development of non-Euclidean geometry. These early attempts at challenging the fifth postulate had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Levi ben Gerson, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri. All of these early attempts made at trying to formulate non-Euclidean geometry, however, provided flawed proofs of the parallel postulate, depending on assumptions that are now recognized as essentially equivalent to the parallel postulate. These early attempts did, however, provide some early properties of the hyperbolic and elliptic geometries.

Khayyam, for example, tried to derive it from an equivalent postulate he formulated from &quot;the principles of the Philosopher&quot; (Aristotle): &quot;Two convergent straight lines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straight lines to diverge in the direction in which they converge.&quot; Khayyam then considered the three cases right, obtuse, and acute that the summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral can take and after proving a number of theorems about them, he correctly refuted the obtuse and acute cases based on his postulate and hence derived the classic postulate of Euclid, which he didn&#x27;t realize was equivalent to his own postulate. Another example is al-Tusi&#x27;s son, Sadr al-Din (sometimes known as &quot;Pseudo-Tusi&quot;), who wrote a book on the subject in 1298, based on al-Tusi&#x27;s later thoughts, which presented another hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. &quot;He essentially revised both the Euclidean system of axioms and postulates and the proofs of many propositions from the &quot;Elements&quot;.&quot; His work was published in Rome in 1594 and was studied by European geometers, including Saccheri who criticised this work as well as that of Wallis.

Giordano Vitale, in his book &quot;Euclide restituo&quot; (1680, 1686), used the Saccheri quadrilateral to prove that if three points are equidistant on the base AB and the summit CD, then AB and CD are everywhere equidistant.

In a work titled &quot;Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus&quot; (&quot;Euclid Freed from All Flaws&quot;), published in 1733, Saccheri quickly discarded elliptic geometry as a possibility (some others of Euclid&#x27;s axioms must be modified for elliptic geometry to work) and set to work proving a great number of results in hyperbolic geometry.

He finally reached a point where he believed that his results demonstrated the impossibility of hyperbolic geometry. His claim seems to have been based on Euclidean presuppositions, because no &quot;logical&quot; contradiction was present. In this attempt to prove Euclidean geometry he instead unintentionally discovered a new viable geometry, but did not realize it.

In 1766 Johann Lambert wrote, but did not publish, &quot;Theorie der Parallellinien&quot; in which he attempted, as Saccheri did, to prove the fifth postulate. He worked with a figure now known as a &quot;Lambert quadrilateral&quot;, a quadrilateral with three right angles (can be considered half of a Saccheri quadrilateral). He quickly eliminated the possibility that the fourth angle is obtuse, as had Saccheri and Khayyam, and then proceeded to prove many theorems under the assumption of an acute angle. Unlike Saccheri, he never felt that he had reached a contradiction with this assumption. He had proved the non-Euclidean result that the sum of the angles in a triangle increases as the area of the triangle decreases, and this led him to speculate on the possibility of a model of the acute case on a sphere of imaginary radius. He did not carry this idea any further.

At this time it was widely believed that the universe worked according to the principles of Euclidean geometry.

===Development of non-Euclidean geometry===
The beginning of the 19th century would finally witness decisive steps in the creation of non-Euclidean geometry.
Circa 1813, Carl Friedrich Gauss and independently around 1818, the German professor of law Ferdinand Karl Schweikart had the germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results. Schweikart&#x27;s nephew Franz Taurinus did publish important results of hyperbolic trigonometry in two papers in 1825 and 1826, yet while admitting the internal consistency of hyperbolic geometry, he still believed in the special role of Euclidean geometry.

Then, in 1829–1830 the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky and in 1832 the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai separately and independently published treatises on hyperbolic geometry. Consequently, hyperbolic geometry is called Lobachevskian or Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry. Gauss mentioned to Bolyai&#x27;s father, when shown the younger Bolyai&#x27;s work, that he had developed such a geometry several years before, though he did not publish. While Lobachevsky created a non-Euclidean geometry by negating the parallel postulate, Bolyai worked out a geometry where both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic geometry are possible depending on a parameter &quot;k&quot;. Bolyai ends his work by mentioning that it is not possible to decide through mathematical reasoning alone if the geometry of the physical universe is Euclidean or non-Euclidean; this is a task for the physical sciences.

Bernhard Riemann, in a famous lecture in 1854, founded the field of Riemannian geometry, discussing in particular the ideas now called manifolds, Riemannian metric, and curvature.
He constructed an infinite family of non-Euclidean geometries by giving a formula for a family of Riemannian metrics on the unit ball in Euclidean space. The simplest of these is called elliptic geometry and it is considered a non-Euclidean geometry due to its lack of parallel lines.

By formulating the geometry in terms of a curvature tensor, Riemann allowed non-Euclidean geometry to apply to higher dimensions. Beltrami (1868) was the first to apply Riemann&#x27;s geometry to spaces of negative curvature.

===Terminology===
It was Gauss who coined the term &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot;. He was referring to his own work, which today we call &quot;hyperbolic geometry&quot; or &quot;Lobachevskian geometry&quot;. Several modern authors still use the generic term &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot; to mean &quot;hyperbolic geometry&quot;.

Arthur Cayley noted that distance between points inside a conic could be defined in terms of logarithm and the projective cross-ratio function. The method has become called the Cayley–Klein metric because Felix Klein exploited it to describe the non-Euclidean geometries in articles in 1871 and 1873 and later in book form. The Cayley–Klein metrics provided working models of hyperbolic and elliptic metric geometries, as well as Euclidean geometry.

Klein is responsible for the terms &quot;hyperbolic&quot; and &quot;elliptic&quot; (in his system he called Euclidean geometry &quot;parabolic&quot;, a term that generally fell out of use). His influence has led to the current usage of the term &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot; to mean either &quot;hyperbolic&quot; or &quot;elliptic&quot; geometry.

There are some mathematicians who would extend the list of geometries that should be called &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; in various ways.

There are many kinds of geometry that are quite different from Euclidean geometry but are also not necessarily included in the conventional meaning of &quot;non-Euclidean geometry&quot;, such as more general instances of Riemannian geometry.

==Axiomatic basis of non-Euclidean geometry==
Euclidean geometry can be axiomatically described in several ways. However, Euclid&#x27;s original system of five postulates (axioms) is not one of these, as his proofs relied on several unstated assumptions that should also have been taken as axioms. Hilbert&#x27;s system consisting of 20 axioms most closely follows the approach of Euclid and provides the justification for all of Euclid&#x27;s proofs. Other systems, using different sets of undefined terms obtain the same geometry by different paths. All approaches, however, have an axiom that is logically equivalent to Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate, the parallel postulate. Hilbert uses the Playfair axiom form, while Birkhoff, for instance, uses the axiom that says that, &quot;There exists a pair of similar but not congruent triangles.&quot; In any of these systems, removal of the one axiom equivalent to the parallel postulate, in whatever form it takes, and leaving all the other axioms intact, produces absolute geometry. As the first 28 propositions of Euclid (in &quot;The Elements&quot;) do not require the use of the parallel postulate or anything equivalent to it, they are all true statements in absolute geometry.

To obtain a non-Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) &quot;must&quot; be replaced by its negation. Negating the Playfair&#x27;s axiom form, since it is a compound statement (... there exists one and only one ...), can be done in two ways:

* Either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel to the given line or there will exist no lines through the point parallel to the given line. In the first case, replacing the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) with the statement &quot;In a plane, given a point P and a line not passing through P, there exist two lines through P, which do not meet &quot; and keeping all the other axioms, yields hyperbolic geometry.
* The second case is not dealt with as easily. Simply replacing the parallel postulate with the statement, &quot;In a plane, given a point P and a line not passing through P, all the lines through P meet &quot;, does not give a consistent set of axioms. This follows since parallel lines exist in absolute geometry, but this statement says that there are no parallel lines. This problem was known (in a different guise) to Khayyam, Saccheri and Lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known as the &quot;obtuse angle case&quot;. To obtain a consistent set of axioms that includes this axiom about having no parallel lines, some other axioms must be tweaked. These adjustments depend upon the axiom system used. Among others, these tweaks have the effect of modifying Euclid&#x27;s second postulate from the statement that line segments can be extended indefinitely to the statement that lines are unbounded. Riemann&#x27;s elliptic geometry emerges as the most natural geometry satisfying this axiom.

==Models==

Models of non-Euclidean geometry are mathematical models of geometries which are non-Euclidean in the sense that it is not the case that exactly one line can be drawn parallel to a given line &quot;l&quot; through a point that is not on &quot;l&quot;. In hyperbolic geometric models, by contrast, there are infinitely many lines through &quot;A&quot; parallel to &quot;l&quot;, and in elliptic geometric models, parallel lines do not exist. (See the entries on hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry for more information.)

Euclidean geometry is modelled by our notion of a &quot;flat plane.&quot; 
The simplest model for elliptic geometry is a sphere, where lines are &quot;great circles&quot; (such as the equator or the meridians on a globe), and points opposite each other are identified (considered to be the same). 
The pseudosphere has the appropriate curvature to model hyperbolic geometry.

===Elliptic geometry===

The simplest model for elliptic geometry is a sphere, where lines are &quot;great circles&quot; (such as the equator or the meridians on a globe), and points opposite each other (called antipodal points) are identified (considered the same). This is also one of the standard models of the real projective plane. The difference is that as a model of elliptic geometry a metric is introduced permitting the measurement of lengths and angles, while as a model of the projective plane there is no such metric.

In the elliptic model, for any given line and a point &quot;A&quot;, which is not on , all lines through &quot;A&quot; will intersect .

===Hyperbolic geometry===

Even after the work of Lobachevsky, Gauss, and Bolyai, the question remained: &quot;Does such a model exist for hyperbolic geometry?&quot;. The model for hyperbolic geometry was answered by Eugenio Beltrami, in 1868, who first showed that a surface called the pseudosphere has the appropriate curvature to model a portion of hyperbolic space and in a second paper in the same year, defined the Klein model, which models the entirety of hyperbolic space, and used this to show that Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry were equiconsistent so that hyperbolic geometry was logically consistent if and only if Euclidean geometry was. (The reverse implication follows from the horosphere model of Euclidean geometry.)

In the hyperbolic model, within a two-dimensional plane, for any given line and a point &quot;A&quot;, which is not on , there are infinitely many lines through &quot;A&quot; that do not intersect .

In these models, the concepts of non-Euclidean geometries are represented by Euclidean objects in a Euclidean setting. This introduces a perceptual distortion wherein the straight lines of the non-Euclidean geometry are represented by Euclidean curves that visually bend. This &quot;bending&quot; is not a property of the non-Euclidean lines, only an artifice of the way they are represented.

===Three-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry===

In three dimensions, there are eight models of geometries. There are Euclidean, elliptic, and hyperbolic geometries, as in the two-dimensional case; mixed geometries that are partially Euclidean and partially hyperbolic or spherical; twisted versions of the mixed geometries; and one unusual geometry that is completely anisotropic (i.e. every direction behaves differently).

==Uncommon properties==

Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries naturally have many similar properties, namely those that do not depend upon the nature of parallelism. This commonality is the subject of absolute geometry (also called &quot;neutral geometry&quot;). However, the properties that distinguish one geometry from others have historically received the most attention.

Besides the behavior of lines with respect to a common perpendicular, mentioned in the introduction, we also have the following:
* A Lambert quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with three right angles. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, a right angle if the geometry is Euclidean or obtuse if the geometry is elliptic. Consequently, rectangles exist (a statement equivalent to the parallel postulate) only in Euclidean geometry.
* A Saccheri quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with two sides of equal length, both perpendicular to a side called the &quot;base&quot;. The other two angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are called the &quot;summit angles&quot; and they have equal measure. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, right angles if the geometry is Euclidean and obtuse angles if the geometry is elliptic.
* The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is less than 180° if the geometry is hyperbolic, equal to 180° if the geometry is Euclidean, and greater than 180° if the geometry is elliptic. The &quot;defect&quot; of a triangle is the numerical value (180° − sum of the measures of the angles of the triangle). This result may also be stated as: the defect of triangles in hyperbolic geometry is positive, the defect of triangles in Euclidean geometry is zero, and the defect of triangles in elliptic geometry is negative.

==Importance==
Before the models of a non-Euclidean plane were presented by Beltrami, Klein, and Poincaré, Euclidean geometry stood unchallenged as the mathematical model of space. Furthermore, since the substance of the subject in synthetic geometry was a chief exhibit of rationality, the Euclidean point of view represented absolute authority.

The discovery of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which went far beyond the boundaries of mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant&#x27;s treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic — our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.

Non-Euclidean geometry is an example of a scientific revolution in the history of science, in which mathematicians and scientists changed the way they viewed their subjects. Some geometers called Lobachevsky the &quot;Copernicus of Geometry&quot; due to the revolutionary character of his work.

The existence of non-Euclidean geometries impacted the intellectual life of Victorian England in many ways and in particular was one of the leading factors that caused a re-examination of the teaching of geometry based on Euclid&#x27;s Elements. This curriculum issue was hotly debated at the time and was even the subject of a book, &quot;Euclid and his Modern Rivals&quot;, written by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898) better known as Lewis Carroll, the author of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

==Planar algebras==
In analytic geometry a plane is described with Cartesian coordinates: 

:formula_1

The points are sometimes identified with generalized complex numbers where ε2 ∈ { –1, 0, 1}.

The Euclidean plane corresponds to the case , an imaginary unit. Since the modulus of is given by
:formula_2 this quantity is the square of the Euclidean distance between and the origin.
For instance, is the unit circle.

For planar algebra, non-Euclidean geometry arises in the other cases.
When , a hyperbolic unit. Then is a split-complex number and conventionally replaces epsilon. Then
:formula_3
and is the unit hyperbola.

When , then is a dual number.

This approach to non-Euclidean geometry explains the non-Euclidean angles: the parameters of slope in the dual number plane and hyperbolic angle in the split-complex plane correspond to angle in Euclidean geometry. Indeed, they each arise in polar decomposition of a complex number .

==Kinematic geometries==
Hyperbolic geometry found an application in kinematics with the physical cosmology introduced by Hermann Minkowski in 1908. Minkowski introduced terms like worldline and proper time into mathematical physics. He realized that the submanifold, of events one moment of proper time into the future, could be considered a hyperbolic space of three dimensions.
Already in the 1890s Alexander Macfarlane was charting this submanifold through his &quot;Algebra of Physics&quot; and hyperbolic quaternions, though Macfarlane did not use cosmological language as Minkowski did in 1908. The relevant structure is now called the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry.

The non-Euclidean planar algebras support kinematic geometries in the plane. For instance, the split-complex number &quot;z&quot; = e&quot;a&quot;j can represent a spacetime event one moment into the future of a frame of reference of rapidity &quot;a&quot;. Furthermore, multiplication by &quot;z&quot; amounts to a Lorentz boost mapping the frame with rapidity zero to that with rapidity &quot;a&quot;.

Kinematic study makes use of the dual numbers formula_4 to represent the classical description of motion in absolute time and space:
The equations formula_5 are equivalent to a shear mapping in linear algebra:formula_6
With dual numbers the mapping is formula_7

Another view of special relativity as a non-Euclidean geometry was advanced by E. B. Wilson and Gilbert Lewis in &quot;Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot; in 1912. They revamped the analytic geometry implicit in the split-complex number algebra into synthetic geometry of premises and deductions.

==Fiction==
Non-Euclidean geometry often makes appearances in works of science fiction and fantasy.

* In 1895, H. G. Wells published the short story &quot;The Remarkable Case of Davidson&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. To appreciate this story one should know how antipodal points on a sphere are identified in a model of the elliptic plane. In the story, in the midst of a thunderstorm, Sidney Davidson sees &quot;Waves and a remarkably neat schooner&quot; while working in an electrical laboratory at Harlow Technical College. At the story&#x27;s close, Davidson proves to have witnessed H.M.S. &quot;Fulmar&quot; off Antipodes Island.
* Non-Euclidean geometry is sometimes connected with the influence of the 20th-century horror fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft. In his works, many unnatural things follow their own unique laws of geometry: in Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, the sunken city of R&#x27;lyeh is characterized by its non-Euclidean geometry. It is heavily implied this is achieved as a side effect of not following the natural laws of this universe rather than simply using an alternate geometric model, as the sheer innate wrongness of it is said to be capable of driving those who look upon it insane.
* The main character in Robert Pirsig&#x27;s &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; mentioned Riemannian geometry on multiple occasions.
* In &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Dostoevsky discusses non-Euclidean geometry through his character Ivan.
* Christopher Priest&#x27;s novel &quot;Inverted World&quot; describes the struggle of living on a planet with the form of a rotating pseudosphere.
* Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; utilizes non-Euclidean geometry to explain instantaneous transport through space and time and between parallel and fictional universes.
* Zeno Rogue&#x27;s &quot;HyperRogue&quot; is a roguelike game set on the hyperbolic plane, allowing the player to experience many properties of this geometry. Many mechanics, quests, and locations are strongly dependent on the features of hyperbolic geometry.
* In the Renegade Legion science fiction setting for FASA&#x27;s wargame, role-playing-game and fiction, faster-than-light travel and communications is possible through the use of Hsieh Ho&#x27;s Polydimensional Non-Euclidean Geometry, published sometime in the middle of the 22nd century.
* In Ian Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Flatterland&quot; the protagonist Victoria Line visits all kinds of non-Euclidean worlds.

<doc id="58617" wikidata="Q188572" url="?curid=58617" title="Fact">
<text>A fact is a true datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.

For example, &quot;This sentence contains words.&quot; accurately describes a linguistic fact, and &quot;The sun is a star&quot; accurately describes an astronomical fact. Further, &quot;Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States&quot; and &quot;Abraham Lincoln was assassinated&quot; both accurately describe historical facts. Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion.

Facts are different from inferences, theories, values, and objects.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word &quot;fact&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;factum&quot;. It was first used in English with the same meaning: &quot;a thing done or performed&quot;a meaning now obsolete outside the law. The common usage of &quot;something that has really occurred or is the case&quot; dates from the mid-16th century.

Barbara J. Shapiro wrote in her book &quot;A Culture of Fact&quot; how the concept of a fact evolved, starting within the English legal tradition of the 16th century.

In 1870, Charles Sanders Peirce described in his book &quot;The Fixation of Belief&quot; four methods which people use to decide what they should believe: tenacity, method of authority, a priori and scientific method.

The term &quot;fact&quot; also indicates a &quot;matter under discussion&quot; deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., &quot;... the &quot;fact&quot; of the matter is ...&quot;).

Alternatively, &quot;fact&quot; may also indicate an allegation or stipulation of something that may or may not be a &quot;true fact&quot;, (e.g., &quot;the author&#x27;s facts are not trustworthy&quot;). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English according to the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates this use to 1729.

&quot;Fact&quot; may also indicate findings derived through a &quot;process of evaluation&quot;, including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation. This use is reflected in the terms &quot;fact-find&quot; and &quot;fact-finder&quot; (e.g., &quot;set up a fact-finding commission&quot;).

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority. Roger Bacon wrote &quot;If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics.&quot;

==In philosophy==

In philosophy, the concept &quot;fact&quot; is considered in the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, called epistemology and ontology, which studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality. Questions of objectivity and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A fact can be defined as something that is the case, in other words, a state of affairs.

Facts may be understood as information, which makes a true sentence true: &quot;A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true.&quot; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement &quot;Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system&quot; is &quot;about&quot; the fact that Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

Pascal Engel&#x27;s version of the correspondence theory of truth explains that what makes a sentence true is that it &quot;corresponds&quot; to a fact. This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The Slingshot argument claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing, the truth value &quot;true&quot;. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then one arrives at the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact: &quot;the truth&quot;.

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about reality is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of objects and properties or relations. Facts &quot;possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations&quot;. For example, the fact described by the true statement &quot;Paris is the capital city of France&quot; implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a &quot;place&quot; or a &quot;government&quot;, and so on. The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact, that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.

===Fact–value distinction===

Moral philosophers since David Hume have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what &quot;ought&quot; to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what &quot;is&quot; the case. This is called the is–ought distinction. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between facts and values, such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values (e.g., &quot;it is good to give food to hungry people&quot;) from facts (e.g., &quot;people will die if they can&#x27;t eat&quot;), include G. E. Moore, who called attempting to do so the naturalistic fallacy.

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality: what &quot;might have&quot; occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or &quot;if–then&quot;) statement indicating what &quot;would be&quot; the case if events had been other than they were. For example, &quot;If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome.&quot; This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what &quot;is&quot; (in fact) the case if its antecedent &quot;is&quot; (in fact) true—for example, &quot;If you drink this, it will make you well.&quot; Such sentences are important to modal logic, especially since the development of possible world semantics.

==In mathematics==

In mathematics, a &quot;fact&quot; is a statement (called a theorem) that can be proven by logical argument from certain axioms and definitions.

==In science==
The definition of a &quot;scientific fact&quot; is different from the definition of fact, as it implies knowledge. A scientific fact is the result of a repeatable careful observation or measurement by experimentation or other means, also called empirical evidence. These are central to building scientific theories. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the scientific method, and the scope and validity of scientific reasoning.

In the most basic sense, a &quot;scientific fact&quot; is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a &quot;hypothesis&quot; or &quot;theory&quot;, which is intended to explain or interpret facts.

Various scholars have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation. Philosophers and scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) &quot;states of affairs&quot; in the external world and 2) &quot;assertions&quot; of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact. Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which &quot;established fact&quot; becomes recognized and accepted as such;
* whether and to what extent &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;theoretic explanation&quot; can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;
* to what extent &quot;facts&quot; are influenced by the mere act of observation; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.

Consistent with the idea of confirmation holism, some scholars assert &quot;fact&quot; to be necessarily &quot;theory-laden&quot; to some degree. Thomas Kuhn points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of fossils is based on radiometric dating, which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a Poisson process rather than a Bernoulli process. Similarly, Percy Williams Bridgman is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined, by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method. Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote &quot;factual accuracy&quot; among other interests in scientific study.

== In history ==
A common rhetorical cliché states, &quot;History is written by the winners&quot;. This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

E. H. Carr in his 1961 volume &quot;What is History?&quot; argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical perspective idealistic and impossible. Facts are, &quot;like fish in the Ocean&quot;, of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean&#x27;s surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding – all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past – and that one&#x27;s methods of fact gathering should be openly examined. The set of highlighted historical facts, and their interpretations, therefore changes over time, and reflect present consensuses.

==In law==

This section of the article emphasizes common law jurisprudence as primarily represented in Anglo-American–based legal tradition. Nevertheless, the principles described herein have analogous treatment in other legal systems such as civil law systems as well.

In most common law jurisdictions, the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of jurisprudence, and is supported by several well-established standards. Matters of fact have various formal definitions under common law jurisdictions.

These include:

* an element required in legal pleadings to demonstrate a cause of action;

* the determinations of the finder of fact after evaluating admissible evidence produced in a trial or hearing;
* a potential ground of reversible error forwarded on appeal in an appellate court; and
* any of various matters subject to investigation by official authority to establish whether a crime has been perpetrated, and to establish culpability.

=== Legal pleadings ===

A party (e.g., plaintiff) to a civil suit generally must clearly state the relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a claim. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading. In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that when considered together may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This seemingly logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies such as &quot;res judicata&quot; that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts and ruling of the court.

<doc id="58619" wikidata="Q589485" url="?curid=58619" title="The Wasp Factory">
<text>The Wasp Factory is the first novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1984. Before the book came out, Banks had written several science fiction novels that had not been accepted for publication. He decided to try a more mainstream novel in the hopes that it would be more readily accepted, and wrote about a psychopathic teenager living on a remote Scottish island. According to Banks, this allowed him to treat the story as something resembling science fiction – the island could be envisaged as a planet, and Frank, the protagonist, almost as an alien. Following the success of &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot;, Banks began to write full-time.

&quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; is written from a first person perspective, told by 16-year-old Francis Cauldhame (&quot;Frank&quot;), describing his childhood and all that remains of it. Frank observes many shamanistic rituals of his own invention, and it is soon revealed that Frank killed three children before he reached the age of ten himself.

The book sold well, but was greeted with a mixture of acclaim and criticism, due to its gruesome depiction of violence. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; called it &quot;a work of unparalleled depravity&quot;.

==Plot==
The story is told from the perspective of 16-year-old Frank Cauldhame. Frank lives with his father on a small island in rural Scotland, and he has not seen his mother in many years. There is no official record of his birth, meaning his existence is largely unknown.

Frank occupies his time with rituals, building dams, and maintaining an array of weapons (a small catapult, pipe bombs, and a crude flamethrower) for killing small animals around the island. He takes long walks to patrol the island and occasionally gets drunk with his only friend, a dwarf. Otherwise, Frank has almost no contact with the outside world. He&#x27;s haunted by the memory of a dog attack during his youth, which resulted in the loss of his genitalia. He resents others for his impotence, particularly women. This is in part due to the mauling coinciding with the last time he saw his mother, who had come back to give birth to his younger brother, and left immediately afterward.

Frank&#x27;s older brother, Eric, escapes from a psychiatric institution, having been arrested some years prior for arson and terrorising the local children by force-feeding them live maggots. Eric often calls him from a pay-phone to inform Frank of his progress back to the island. Eric is extremely erratic; their conversations end badly, with Eric exploding in fits of rage. However, it&#x27;s clear Frank loves his brother.

The Wasp Factory is a mechanism invented by Frank, consisting of a huge clock face, salvaged from the local dump, encased in a glass box. Behind each of the 12 numerals is a trap that leads to a different ritual death (such as burning, crushing, or drowning in Frank&#x27;s urine) for the wasp that Frank puts into it via the hole at the centre. Frank believes the death &quot;chosen&quot; by the wasp predicts something about the future. The Factory is in the house&#x27;s loft, which Frank&#x27;s father cannot access because of a leg injury. There are also “Sacrifice Poles” constructed by Frank. The corpses of animals, such as mice that he has killed, are placed onto the poles for the purpose of attracting birds which will fly away and alert Frank of anybody approaching the island.

It&#x27;s revealed that when Frank was much younger, he killed three of his relatives: two cousins and his younger half-brother. He also exhumed the skull of the dog that castrated him, and uses it as part of his rituals. Eric is described as having been extremely sensitive before the incident that drove him mad: a tragic case of neglect at the hospital where Eric was a volunteer when studying to become a doctor. While attempting to feed a brain-damaged newborn with acalvaria, Eric notes how the child is unresponsive and smiling, despite usually appearing expressionless. The child&#x27;s skull is held together by a metal plate over his head. Eric checks underneath the plate to find the child&#x27;s exposed brain tissue infested and being consumed by day-old maggots.

Frank&#x27;s father is distant and spends most of his time in his study, which he keeps locked at all times. Frank longs to know what is inside. He is used to being lied to by his father, who seemingly does it purely for his own amusement. At the end of the novel, Frank is alerted of Eric&#x27;s return when he sees a dog that has been burned alive and discovers Eric&#x27;s campsite. This knowledge incites Frank&#x27;s father to get drunk before forgetting to conceal the keys to his study, where Frank discovers male hormone drugs, tampons, and what appears to be the remains of his own genitals in a jar. He assumes that his findings mean that his father is actually female. After disrobing his father at knifepoint, Frank discovers this is not the case. At the same time, Eric arrives. During the ensuing confrontation, Eric attempts to destroy the house by setting light to the large stock of cordite kept in the cellar. Frank stops him, and Eric runs into the distance. 

Frank&#x27;s father explains that it was Frank who was born a female; the hormones had been fed to him by his father since the dog attack in an experiment to see whether Frank would transition from female to male. The remains of his genitals were fake, fashioned from wax as evidence in case Frank ever questioned his father&#x27;s story. It is suggested that his father&#x27;s reasoning for doing this was to distance himself from the women he felt had ruined his life. In the end, Frank finds Eric, half asleep. He sits with him and considers his life up to this point and whether he should leave the island.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The book was initially greeted with a mixture of acclaim and criticism, due to its gruesome depiction of violence. While this is mostly against animals, Frank also recollects killing three younger children. The murders are described in an honest and matter-of-fact way, often with grotesque humour. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; called it &quot;a work of unparalleled depravity.&quot; Banks&#x27; response to this criticism is that readers understood the humour of these scenes in a way that many critics did not in their reviews.

Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that it &quot;will delight horror fans with its mixture of black humour and horrible, imaginative, beautiful deaths&quot;.

A 1997 poll of over 25,000 readers of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; as one of the top 100 books of the 20th century.

== Adaptations ==
In 1992, Malcolm Sutherland adapted the novel for the stage. The production was performed at the Glasgow Citizen&#x27;s Theatre. It was revived in 1997 and shown in Yorkshire and London.

In 1997, Craig Warner adapted the novel into a 10-part serial (15-minute episodes) for BBC Radio 4.

In 2008, the Sutherland production went on tour again.

In 2013, the Australian producer and composer Ben Frost directed an opera adaptation of the Iain Banks novel, in which all characters are represented by three female singers.

<text>Espedair Street is a novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1987.

==Plot introduction==
The book tells the (fictional) story of the rise to fame of Dan Weir (&#x27;Weird&#x27;), a bass guitar player in a rock and roll band called Frozen Gold, and of his struggles to be happy now that he is rich and famous.

==Plot summary==


Weird starts out in the Ferguslie Park area of Paisley in a very underprivileged Catholic family. He is impressed by a group named Frozen Gold when he sees them live, in the Union of Paisley College of Technology, and auditions with them. Christine Brice likes his songs, and he joins the band. He ends up writing all their material and playing bass guitar (after trying unsuccessfully to get them to change their name), as the band rises in the drug- and booze-fuelled rock and roll of the 1970s, assisted by A&amp;R man Rick Tumber of ARC Records. In the Three Chimneys tour, singer Davey Balfour takes Dan along on an attempt to break an unofficial (and illegal) speed record for flying around three power station chimneys in Kent in his private aeroplane.

He reminisces about this from 1980s Glasgow, where he lives as a recluse in a Victorian folly (St Jutes), ever since the tragic events which led to the demise of the band. He is posing as his own caretaker, and his friends McCann and Wee Tommy know him as Jimmy Hay. After a memorable fight in a nightclub called &#x27;Monty&#x27;s&#x27;, his real identity is revealed. He has grown uncomfortable with fame and wealth, and eventually visits his first girlfriend, Jean Webb, now living in Arisaig.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
The band is loosely modelled on Pink Floyd or Fleetwood Mac although Banks has said that the character of Weird was in part inspired by Fish, the ex-Marillion singer and lyricist (&quot;When I created Weird [...] I think Fish was at the back of my mind as a wee subliminal influence&quot;). There is a tone of rock journalism in the parts of the book about Frozen Gold. Coincidentally, onetime aspiring rock musician Sandy Robertson, who later became a well known rock journalist at Sounds magazine, lived in Espedair Street in the early 70s before the book was written.

As Banks&#x27; first novel to eschew &#x27;special effects&#x27;, not being Gothic horror like &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot;, a literary mystery like &quot;Walking on Glass&quot;, or science fiction like &quot;The Bridge&quot;, most critics regard it as one of his most accessible works.

Espedair Street is also a real street in Charleston, Paisley, where some of the significant events in the book take place.

A four-part BBC radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 1998.

<text>The Crow Road is a novel by the Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1992.

==Plot introduction==
The novel describes Prentice McHoan&#x27;s preoccupation with death, sex, his relationship with his father, unrequited love, sibling rivalry, a missing uncle, cars, alcohol and other intoxicants, and God, against the background of the Scottish landscape.

==Plot summary==
This Bildungsroman is set in the fictional Argyll town of Gallanach, the real village of Lochgair, and in Glasgow, where the adult Prentice McHoan lives. Prentice&#x27;s uncle Rory disappeared eight years previously while writing a book called &quot;The Crow Road.&quot; Prentice becomes obsessed with papers his uncle left behind and sets out to solve the mystery. Along the way he must cope with estrangement from his father, unrequited love, sibling rivalry, and failure at his studies.

The estrangement from his father concerns Prentice&#x27;s belief in a higher power and purpose, and in life after death, all of which his father denies.

A parallel plot is Prentice&#x27;s gradual transition from an adolescent fixation on one young woman to a more mature love for another.

Prentice&#x27;s efforts to make sense of Uncle Rory&#x27;s fragmentary notes and the minimal clues surrounding his disappearance mirror his efforts to understand the world and his place in it. The narrative is nonlinear, leaping back and forth with little or no warning, requiring the reader to piece things together.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The novel combines menace (it contains an account of a &quot;perfect murder&quot;) and dark humour (note the opening sentence: &quot;It was the day my grandmother exploded.&quot;) with an interesting treatment of love. Banks uses multiple voices and points of view, jumping freely in both time and character. Even minor characters like Prentice&#x27;s grandmother, the fictional town of Gallanach, and his family&#x27;s home in Lochgair receive careful description, giving Prentice&#x27;s life depth and context.

The book follows Prentice&#x27;s journey of discovery about himself, those he loves, and the ways of the world.

&quot;The Crow Road&quot; is the name of a street in the west of Glasgow, but serves as well as a metaphor for death, as in &quot;He&#x27;s away the Crow Road&quot;. The appropriateness of this title becomes apparent as the novel progresses.

==Adaptation==
&quot;The Crow Road&quot; was adapted for television by Bryan Elsley for the BBC in 1996. See &quot;The Crow Road&quot;.

<doc id="58622" wikidata="Q261728" url="?curid=58622" title="Consider Phlebas">
<text>Consider Phlebas, first published in 1987, is a space opera novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks. It is the first in a series of novels about an interstellar post-scarcity society called the Culture.

The novel revolves around the Idiran–Culture War, and Banks plays on that theme by presenting various microcosms of that conflict. Its protagonist Bora Horza Gobuchul is an enemy of the Culture.

&quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; is Banks&#x27;s first published science fiction novel, and takes its title from a line in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. A subsequent Culture novel, &quot;Look to Windward&quot; (2000), whose title comes from the previous line of the same poem, can be considered a loose follow-up.

==Plot summary==
The Culture and the Idiran Empire are at war in a galaxy-spanning conflict. A Culture Mind, fleeing the destruction of its ship in an Idiran ambush, takes refuge on Schar&#x27;s World. The Dra&#x27;Azon, godlike incorporeal beings, maintain Schar&#x27;s World as a monument to the world&#x27;s extinct civilisation and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, forbidding access to both the Culture and the Idirans. Horza, a shape-changing mercenary, is rescued from execution by the Idirans who believe the Dra&#x27;Azon guardian may let him onto the planet as in the past he was part of a small group of Changers who acted as stewards. They instruct him to retrieve the Mind.

During Horza&#x27;s extraction, the Idirans also capture a Special Circumstances agent, Perosteck Balveda. However, the Idiran starship on which he is travelling is soon attacked by a Culture vessel, and Horza is ejected. He is picked up by a pirate ship, the &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot; (&quot;CAT&quot;). He is forced to fight and kill one of the crew to earn a place. The captain, Kraiklyn, leads them on two disastrous pirate raids in which several of the crew perish. After the second raid Horza is taken prisoner by a cult living on an island on the orbital Vavatch, which is scheduled to be destroyed by the Culture. He escapes after poisoning the cult leader and makes his way to Evanauth, the main city of Vavatch, where he finds Kraiklyn, who is playing &quot;Damage&quot;—a high-stakes card game played by the most notorious characters in the galaxy, usually at a location about to be destroyed.

Having now changed his appearance to mimic that of the &quot;CAT&quot; captain, Horza follows him back to the &quot;CAT&quot;, kills him and returns to the &quot;CAT&quot; meeting the few remaining original crew. He is introduced to a newly recruited member, whom he recognises as a disguised Perosteck Balveda. Culture agents outside try to capture the ship. Horza manages to lift off and as the fugitives warp away from Vavatch, they see the evacuated Orbital destroyed by the Culture warships to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Balveda reveals Horza&#x27;s identity and he convinces the crew to carry out his mission. A sentient Vavatch drone, Unaha-Closp, has been trapped on the ship and reluctantly joins the team.

They land on Schar&#x27;s World and search for the Mind in the Command System, a complex of subterranean train stations formerly part of a nuclear missile complex. These were built by the inhabitants of Schar before their extinction. They soon discover that the Mind is being hunted by a pair of Idiran soldiers who have killed all the Changers stationed on the planet, and who regard Horza and his crew as enemies, having no knowledge of the Changers&#x27; alliance with the Idirans. Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The &quot;CAT&quot;″s crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking the Mind to another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members of the &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot; are killed. Horza pursues Xoxarle and is fatally injured, but the Idiran is killed by Balveda.

Horza dies soon after Balveda gets him to the surface and the Mind is returned to the Culture. In an epilogue, the Mind becomes a starship, and reveals its name to be &quot;Bora Horza Gobuchul&quot;.

== Characters ==
* Bora Horza Gobuchul is a Changer and an operative of the Idiran Empire. He was one of a party of Changers allowed on Schar&#x27;s World, and for that reason is tasked by the Idirans with retrieving a Mind that had crashed to the planet. Horza is humanoid, but committed to the Idiran cause despite the fact that he does not believe in their god and does not agree with their harsh and aggressive expansion. He despises the Culture for its dependence on machines, and the fact that Culture&#x27;s machines seemingly rule over the Culture humans, which he perceives to be spiritually empty and an evolutionary dead end.
* Juboal-Rabaroansa Perosteck Alseyn Balveda dam T&#x27;seif, usually referred to as Perosteck Balveda, is an operative of the Culture assigned to track and apprehend Bora Horza Gobuchul. She works for the Special Circumstances branch of Contact, and despite being ambivalent about the methods they use, deeply believes in their objectives.
* Kraiklyn is the captain of the &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot;.
* Yalson is a slightly furry humanoid woman working aboard the &quot;Clear Air Turbulence&quot;. She forms an intimate relationship with Horza during the time he is aboard the ship.

==History and theme==
&quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, like most of Banks&#x27;s early SF output, was a rewritten version of an earlier book, as he explained in a 1994 interview:

On the theme of the novel, he said:

== Literary significance and criticism ==
The book was generally very well received as a fast-paced space opera with a morally ambiguous hero and much grand scenery and devices. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;Overextended and jarring&quot;, but &quot;imaginative and gripping in places.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #90, and stated that &quot;Banks pumps in enough high spirits to keep this rattling along to his slam-bang finale in the bowels of an ancient deep-shelter system whose nuclear-powered high-speed trains are used for... well, not commuting.&quot;

==In other media==
===Cancelled TV adaptation===
Amazon announced in February 2018 that it acquired the global television rights to &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, to be adapted by Dennis Kelly into a television series and produced by Plan B Entertainment. The project was cancelled in August 2020.

<text>The Culture is a fictional interstellar post-scarcity civilisation or society created by the Scottish writer Iain Banks and features in a number of his space opera novels and works of short fiction, collectively called the &quot;Culture&quot; series.

In the series, the Culture is composed primarily of sentient beings of the humanoid alien variety, artificially intelligent sentient machines, and a small number of other sentient &quot;alien&quot; life forms. Machine intelligences range from human-equivalent drones to hyper-intelligent Minds. Artificial intelligences with capabilities measured as a fraction of human intelligence also perform a variety of tasks, e.g. controlling spacesuits. Without scarcity, the Culture has no need for money; instead, Minds voluntarily indulge humanoid and drone citizens&#x27; pleasures, leading to a largely hedonistic society. Many of the series&#x27; protagonists are humanoids who have chosen to work for the Culture&#x27;s diplomatic or espionage organs, and interact with other civilisations whose citizens act under different ideologies, morals, and technologies.

The Culture has a grasp of technology that is advanced relative to most other civilisations with which it shares the galaxy. Most of the Culture&#x27;s citizens do not live on planets but in artificial habitats such as orbitals and ships, the largest of which are home to billions of individuals. The Culture&#x27;s citizens have been genetically enhanced to live for centuries and have modified mental control over their physiology, including the ability to introduce a variety of psychoactive drugs into their systems, change biological sex, or switch off pain at will. Culture technology is able to transfer individuals into vastly different body forms, although the Culture standard form remains fairly close to human.

The Culture holds peace and individual freedom as core values, and a central theme of the series is the ethical struggle it faces when interacting with other societies – some of which brutalise their own members, pose threats to other civilisations, or threaten the Culture itself. It tends to make major decisions based on the consensus formed by its Minds and, if appropriate, its citizens. In one instance, a direct democratic vote of trillions – the entire population – decided The Culture would go to war with a rival civilisation. Those who objected to the Culture&#x27;s subsequent militarisation broke off from the meta-civilisation, forming their own separate civilisation; a hallmark of the Culture is its ambiguity. In contrast to the many interstellar societies and empires which share its fictional universe, the Culture is difficult to define, geographically or sociologically, and &quot;fades out at the edges&quot;.

==Overview==
The Culture is characterized as being a post-scarcity society, having overcome most physical constraints on life and being an egalitarian, stable society without the use of any form of force or compulsion, except where necessary to protect others. That being said, some citizens, including the extremely powerful artificial intelligences, Minds, sometimes engage in the manipulation of others. This can include influencing or controlling the development of alien societies, through the group known as Contact.

The novels of the Culture cycle mostly deal with people at the fringes of the Culture: diplomats, spies, or mercenaries; those who interact with other civilisations, and who do the Culture&#x27;s dirty work in moving those societies closer to the Culture ideal, sometimes by force.

==Fictional history==
In this fictional universe, the Culture exists concurrently with human society on Earth. The time frame for the published Culture stories is from 1267 CE to roughly 2970 CE, with Earth being contacted around 2100 CE, though the Culture had covertly visited the planet in the 1970s in &quot;The State of the Art&quot;.

The Culture itself is described as having been created when several humanoid species and machine sentiences reached a certain social level, and took not only their physical, but also their civilisational evolution into their own hands. In &quot;The Player of Games&quot;, the Culture is described as having existed as a space-faring society for eleven thousand years. In &quot;The Hydrogen Sonata&quot;, one of these founding civilisations was named as the Buhdren Federality.

==Society and culture==

===Economy===
The Culture is a symbiotic society of artificial intelligences (AIs) (Minds and drones), humanoids and other alien species who all share equal status. All essential work is performed (as far as possible) by non-sentient devices, freeing sentients to do only things that they enjoy (administrative work requiring sentience is undertaken by the AIs using a bare fraction of their mental power, or by people who take on the work out of free choice). As such, the Culture is a post-scarcity society, where technological advances ensure that no one lacks any material goods or services. Energy is farmed from a fictitious &quot;energy grid&quot;, and matter to build orbitals is collected mostly from asteroids. As a consequence, the Culture has no need of economic constructs such as money (as is apparent when it deals with civilisations in which money is still important). The Culture rejects all forms of economics based on anything other than voluntary activity. &quot;Money implies poverty&quot; is a common saying in the Culture.

===Language===
Marain is the Culture&#x27;s shared constructed language. The Culture believes the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language influences thought, and Marain was designed by early Minds to exploit this effect, while also &quot;appealing to poets, pedants, engineers and programmers&quot;. Designed to be represented either in binary or symbol-written form, Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language by the Culture. The symbols of the Marain alphabet can be displayed in three-by-three grids of binary (yes/no, black/white) dots and thus correspond to nine-bit binary numbers.

Related comments are made by the narrator in &quot;The Player of Games&quot; regarding gender-specific pronouns, which Marain speakers do not use in typical conversation unless specifying one&#x27;s gender is necessary, and by general reflection on the fact that Marain places much less structural emphasis on (or even lacks) concepts like possession and ownership, dominance and submission, and especially aggression. Many of these concepts would in fact be somewhat theoretical to the average Culture citizen. Indeed, the presence of these concepts in other civilization signify the brutality and hierarchy associated with forms of empire that the Culture strives to avoid.

Marain itself is also open to encryption and dialect-specific implementations for different parts of the Culture. M1 is basic Nonary Marain, the three-by-three grid. All Culture citizens can communicate in this variant. Other variants include M8 through M16, which are encrypted by various degrees, and are typically used by the Contact Section. Higher level encryptions exist, the highest of these being M32. M32 and lower level encrypted signals are the province of Special Circumstances (SC). Use of M32 is reserved for extremely secret and reserved information and communication within Special Circumstances. That said, M32 has an air of notoriety in the Culture, and in the thoughts of most may best be articulated as &quot;the Unbreakable, Inviolable, Holy of Holies Special Circumstances M32&quot; as described by prospective SC agent Ulver Seich. Ships and Minds also have a slightly distasteful view of SC procedure associated with M32, one Ship Mind going so far as to object to the standard SC attitude of &quot;Full scale, stark raving M32 don&#x27;t-talk-about-this-or-we&#x27;ll-pull-your-plugs-out-baby paranoia&quot; on the use of the encryption.

===Laws===
There are no laws as such in the Culture. Social norms are enforced by convention (personal reputation, &quot;good manners&quot;, and by, as described in &quot;The Player of Games&quot;, possible ostracism and involuntary supervision for more serious crimes). Minds generally refrain from using their all-seeing capabilities to influence people&#x27;s reputations, though they are not necessarily themselves above judging people based on such observations, as described in &quot;Excession&quot;. Minds also judge each other, with one of the more relevant criteria being the quality of their treatment of sentients in their care. Hub Minds for example are generally nominated from well-regarded GSV (the largest class of ships) Minds, and then upgraded to care for the billions living on the artificial habitats.

The only serious prohibitions that seem to exist are against harming sentient beings, or forcing them into undertaking any act (another concept that seems unnatural to and is, in fact, almost unheard of by almost all Culture citizens). As mentioned in &quot;The Player of Games&quot;, the Culture does have the occasional &quot;crime of passion&quot; (as described by an Azadian) and the punishment was to be &quot;slap-droned&quot;, or to have a drone assigned to follow the offender and &quot;make sure [they] don&#x27;t do it again&quot;.

While the enforcement in theory could lead to a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens&#x27; lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient&#x27;s mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of &quot;Look to Windward&quot; relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent&#x27;s mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU &quot;Grey Area&quot;). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one&#x27;s own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books.

This gives some measure of privacy and protection; though the very nature of Culture society would, strictly speaking, make keeping secrets irrelevant: most of them would be considered neither shameful nor criminal. It does allow the Minds in particular to scheme amongst themselves in a very efficient manner, and occasionally withhold information.

=== Symbols ===
The Culture has no flag, symbol or logo. According to &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, people can recognize items made by the Culture implicitly, by the way they are simple, efficient and aesthetic. The main outright symbol of the Culture is its language, Marain, which is used far beyond the Culture itself. It is often employed in the galaxy as a de facto lingua franca among people who don&#x27;t share a language. Marain has a similar purpose to other constructed languages encountered in utopian and dystopian fiction including Pravic in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; and Newspeak in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

==Citizens==

===Biological===
The Culture is a posthuman society, which originally arose when seven or eight roughly humanoid space-faring species coalesced into a quasi-collective (a group-civilisation) ultimately consisting of approximately thirty trillion (short scale) sentient and sapient beings (this includes artificial intelligences). In Banks&#x27;s universe, a good part (but by no means an overwhelming percentage) of all sentient species is of the &quot;pan-human&quot; type, as noted in &quot;Matter&quot;.

Although the Culture was originated by humanoid species, subsequent interactions with other civilisations have introduced many non-humanoid species into the Culture (including some former enemy civilisations), though the majority of the biological Culture is still pan-human. Little uniformity exists in the Culture, and its citizens are such by choice, free to change physical form and even species (though some stranger biological conversions are irreversible, and conversion from biological to artificial sentience is considered to be what is known as an Unusual Life Choice). All members are also free to join, leave, and rejoin, or indeed declare themselves to be, say, 80% Culture.

Within the novels, opponents of the Culture have argued that the role of humans in the Culture is nothing more than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing genuinely useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds&#x27; dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the Idiran-Culture War, and the existence of a very small number of &quot;Referrers&quot; (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.

On the other hand, the Culture can be seen as fundamentally hedonistic (one of the main objectives for any being, including Minds, is to have fun rather than to be &quot;useful&quot;). Also, Minds are constructed, by convention, to care for and value human beings. While a General Contact Unit (GCU) does not strictly need a crew (and could construct artificial avatars when it did), a real human crew adds richness to its existence, and offers distraction during otherwise dull periods. In &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; it is noted that Minds still find humans fascinating, especially their odd ability to sometimes achieve similarly advanced reasoning as their much more complex machine brains.

To a large degree, the freedoms enjoyed by humans in the Culture are only available because Minds choose to provide them. The freedoms include the ability to leave the Culture when desired, often forming new associated but separate societies with Culture ships and Minds, most notably the Zetetic Elench and the ultra-pacifist and non-interventionist Peace Faction.

====Physiology====
Techniques in genetics have advanced in the Culture to the point where bodies can be freed from built-in limitations. Citizens of the Culture refer to a normal human as &quot;human-basic&quot; and the vast majority opt for significant enhancements: severed limbs grow back, sexual physiology can be voluntarily changed from male to female and back (though the process takes time), sexual stimulation and endurance are strongly heightened in both sexes (something that is often the subject of envious debate among other species), pain can be switched off, toxins can be bypassed away from the digestive system, autonomic functions such as heart rate can be switched to conscious control, reflexes like blinking can be switched off, and bones and muscles adapt quickly to changes in gravity without the need to exercise. The degree of enhancement found in Culture individuals varies to taste, with certain of the more exotic enhancements limited to Special Circumstances personnel (for example, weapons systems embedded in various parts of the body).

Most Culture individuals opt to have drug glands that allow for hormonal levels and other chemical secretions to be consciously monitored, released and controlled. These allow owners to secrete on command any of a wide selection of synthetic drugs, from the merely relaxing to the mind-altering: &quot;Snap&quot; is described in &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; and &quot;The Player of Games&quot; as &quot;The Culture&#x27;s favourite breakfast drug&quot;. &quot;Sharp Blue&quot; is described as a utility drug, as opposed to a sensory enhancer or a sexual stimulant, that helps in problem solving. &quot;Quicken&quot;, mentioned in &quot;Excession&quot;, speeds up the user&#x27;s neural processes so that time seems to slow down, allowing them to think and have mental conversation (for example with artificial intelligences) in far less time than it appears to take to the outside observer. &quot;Sperk&quot;, as described in &quot;Matter&quot;, is a mood- and energy-enhancing drug, while other such self-produced drugs include &quot;Calm&quot;, &quot;Gain&quot;, &quot;Charge&quot;, &quot;Recall&quot;, &quot;Diffuse&quot;, &quot;Somnabsolute&quot;, &quot;Softnow&quot;, &quot;Focal&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Drill&quot;, &quot;Gung&quot;, &quot;Winnow&quot; and &quot;Crystal Fugue State&quot;. The glanded substances have no permanent side-effects and are non-habit-forming.

====Phenotypes====

For all their genetic improvements, the Culture is by no means eugenically uniform. Human members in the Culture setting vary in size, colour and shape as in reality, and with possibly even further natural differences: in the novella &quot;The State of the Art&quot;, it is mentioned that a character &quot;looks like a Yeti&quot;, and that there is variance among the Culture in minor details such as the number of toes or of joints on each finger. It is mentioned in &quot;Excession&quot; that:

Some Culture citizens opt to leave the constraints of a human or even humanoid body altogether, opting to take on the appearance of one of the myriad other galactic sentients (perhaps in order to live with them) or even non-sentient objects as commented upon in &quot;Matter&quot; (though this process can be irreversible if the desired form is too removed from the structure of the human brain). Certain eccentrics have chosen to become drones or even Minds themselves, though this is considered rude and possibly even insulting by most humans and AIs alike.

While the Culture is generally pan-humanoid (and tends to call itself &quot;human&quot;), various other species and individuals of other species have become part of the Culture.

As all Culture citizens are of perfect genetic health, the very rare cases of a Culture citizen showing any physical deformity are almost certain to be a sort of fashion statement of somewhat dubious taste.

====Personality====
Almost all Culture citizens are very sociable and of great intellectual capability and learning, and possess very well-balanced psyches. Their biological make-up and their growing up in an enlightened society make neuroses and lesser emotions like greed or (strong) jealousy practically unknown, and produce persons that, in any lesser society, appear very self-composed and charismatic. Character traits like strong shyness, while very rare, are not fully unknown, as shown in &quot;Excession&quot;. As described there and in &quot;Player of Games&quot;, a Culture citizen who becomes dysfunctional enough to pose a serious nuisance or threat to others would be offered (voluntary) psychological adjustment therapy and might potentially find themself under constant (non-voluntary) oversight by representatives of the local Mind. In extreme cases, as described in &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; and &quot;Surface Detail&quot;, dangerous individuals have been known to be assigned a &quot;slap-drone&quot;, a robotic follower who ensures that the person in question doesn&#x27;t continue to endanger the safety of others.

===Artificial===
As well as humans and other biological species, sentient artificial intelligences are also members of the Culture. These can be broadly categorised into drones and Minds. Also, by custom, as described in &quot;Excession&quot;, any artefact (be it a tool or vessel) above a certain capability level has to be given sentience.

====Drones====
Drones are roughly comparable in intelligence and social status to that of the Culture&#x27;s biological members. Their intelligence is measured against that of an average biological member of the Culture; a so-called &quot;1.0 value&quot; drone would be considered the mental equal of a biological citizen, whereas lesser drones such as the menial service units of Orbitals are merely proto-sentient (capable of limited reaction to unprogrammed events, but possessing no consciousness, and thus not considered citizens; these take care of much of the menial work in the Culture). The sentience of advanced drones has various levels of redundancy, from systems similar to that of Minds (though much reduced in capability) down to electronic, to mechanical and finally biochemical back-up brains.

Although drones are artificial, the parameters that prescribe their minds are not rigidly constrained, and sentient drones are full individuals, with their own personalities, opinions and quirks. Like biological citizens, Culture drones generally have lengthy names. They also have a form of sexual intercourse for pleasure, called being &quot;in thrall&quot;, though this is an intellect-only interfacing with another sympathetic drone.

While civilian drones do generally match humans in intelligence, drones built especially as Contact or Special Circumstances agents are often several times more intelligent, and imbued with extremely powerful senses, powers and armaments (usually forcefield and effector-based, though occasionally more destructive weaponry such as lasers or, exceptionally, &quot;knife-missiles&quot; are referred to) all powered by antimatter reactors. Despite being purpose-built, these drones are still allowed individual personalities and given a choice in lifestyle. Indeed, some are eventually deemed psychologically unsuitable as agents (for example as Mawhrin-Skel notes about itself in &quot;The Player of Games&quot;) and must choose either mental reprofiling or demilitarisation and discharge from Special Circumstances.

Physically, drones are floating units of various sizes and shapes, usually with no visible moving parts. Drones get around the limitations of this inanimation with the ability to project &quot;fields&quot;: both those capable of physical force, which allow them to manipulate objects, as well as visible, coloured fields called &quot;auras&quot;, which are used to enable the drone to express emotion. There is a complex drone code based on aura colours and patterns (which is fully understood by biological Culture citizens as well). Drones have full control of their auras and can display emotions they&#x27;re not feeling or can switch their aura off. The drone, Jase, in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, is described as being constructed before the use of auras, and refuses to be retrofitted with them, preferring to remain inscrutable.

In size drones vary substantially: the oldest still alive (eight or nine thousand years old) tend to be around the size of humans, whereas later technology allows drones to be small enough to lie in a human&#x27;s cupped palm; modern drones may be any size between these extremes according to fashion and personal preference. Some drones are also designed as utility equipment with its own sentience, such as the gelfield protective suit described in &quot;Excession&quot;.

====Minds====
By contrast to drones, Minds are orders of magnitude more powerful and intelligent than the Culture&#x27;s other biological and artificial citizens. Typically they inhabit and act as the controllers of large-scale Culture hardware such as ships or space-based habitats. Unsurprisingly, given their duties, Minds are tremendously powerful: capable of running all of the functions of a ship or habitat, while holding potentially billions of simultaneous conversations with the citizens that live aboard them. To allow them to perform at such a high degree, they exist partially in hyperspace to get around hindrances to computing power such as the speed of light.

Some inhabited planets and all orbitals have their own Minds: sapient, hyperintelligent machines originally built by biological species, which have evolved, redesigned themselves, and become many times more intelligent than their original creators. According to &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, a Mind is an ellipsoid object roughly the size of a bus and weighing around tons. A Mind is in fact a entity, meaning that the ellipsoid is only the protrusion of the larger four dimensional device into our &#x27;real space&#x27;.

In the Culture universe, Minds have become an indispensable part of the prevailing society, enabling much of its post-scarcity amenities by planning and automating societal functions, and by handling day-to-day administration with mere fractions of their mental power.

The main difference between Minds and other extremely powerful artificial intelligences in fiction is that they are highly humanistic and benevolent. They are so both by design, and by their shared culture. They are often even rather eccentric. Yet, by and large, they show no wish to supplant or dominate their erstwhile creators.

On the other hand, it can also be argued that to the Minds, the human-like members of the Culture amount to little more than pets, whose wants are followed on a Mind&#x27;s whim. Within the Series, this dynamic is played on more than once. In &#x27;Excession&#x27;, it is also played on to put a Mind in its place—in the mythology, a Mind is not thought to be a god, still, but an artificial intelligence capable of surprise, and even fear.
;
Although the Culture is a type of utopian anarchy, Minds most closely approach the status of leaders, and would likely be considered godlike in less rational societies. As independent, thinking beings, each has its own character, and indeed, legally (insofar as the Culture has a &#x27;legal system&#x27;), each is a Culture citizen. Some Minds are more aggressive, some more calm; some don&#x27;t mind mischief, others simply demonstrate intellectual curiosity. But above all they tend to behave rationally and benevolently in their decisions.

As mentioned before, Minds can serve several different purposes, but Culture ships and habitats have one special attribute: the Mind and the ship or habitat are perceived as one entity; in some ways the Mind &quot;is&quot; the ship, certainly from its passengers&#x27; point of view. It seems normal practice to address the ship&#x27;s Mind as &quot;Ship&quot; (and an Orbital hub as &quot;Hub&quot;). However, a Mind can transfer its &#x27;mind state&#x27; into and out of its ship &#x27;body&#x27;, and even switch roles entirely, becoming (for example) an Orbital Hub from a warship.

More often than not, the Mind&#x27;s character defines the ship&#x27;s purpose. Minds do not end up in roles unsuited to them; an antisocial Mind simply would not volunteer to organise the care of thousands of humans, for example.
On occasion groupings of two or three Minds may run a ship. This seems normal practice for larger vehicles such as s, though smaller ships only ever seem to have one Mind.

Banks also hints at a Mind&#x27;s personality becoming defined at least partially before its creation or &#x27;birth&#x27;. Warships, as an example, are designed to revel in controlled destruction; seeing a certain glory in achieving a &#x27;worthwhile&#x27; death also seems characteristic. The presence of human crews on board warships may discourage such recklessness, since in the normal course of things, a Mind would not risk beings other than itself.

With their almost godlike powers of reasoning and action comes a temptation to bend (or break) Cultural norms of ethical behaviour, if deemed necessary for some greater good. In &quot;The Player of Games&quot;, a Culture citizen is blackmailed, apparently by Special Circumstances Minds, into assisting the overthrow of a barbaric empire, while in &quot;Excession&quot;, a conspiracy by some Minds to start a war against an oppressive alien race nearly comes to fruition. Yet even in these rare cases, the essentially benevolent intentions of Minds towards other Culture citizens is never in question. More than any other beings in the Culture, Minds are the ones faced with the more complex and provocative ethical dilemmas.
;
While Minds would likely have different capabilities, especially seeing their widely differing ages (and thus technological sophistication), this is not a theme of the books. It might be speculated that the older Minds are upgraded to keep in step with the advances in technology, thus making this point moot. It is also noted in &quot;Matter&quot; that every Culture Mind writes its own , thus continually improving itself and, as a side benefit, becoming much less vulnerable to outside takeover by electronic means and viruses, as every Mind&#x27;s processing functions work differently.

The high computing power of the Mind is apparently enabled by thought processes (and electronics) being constantly in hyperspace (thus circumventing the light speed limit in computation). Minds do have back-up capabilities functioning with light-speed if the hyperspace capabilities fail - however, this reduces their computational powers by several orders of magnitude (though they remain sentient).

The storage capability of a GSV Mind is described in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; as 1030 bytes (1 million yottabytes).

The Culture is a society undergoing slow (by present-day Earth standards) but constant technological change, so the stated capacity of Minds is open to change. In the last 3,000 years, the capacity of Minds has increased considerably. By the time of the events of the novel &quot;Excession&quot; in the mid 19th century, Minds from the first millennium are referred to jocularly as minds, with a small &#x27;m&#x27;. Their capacities only allow them to be considered equivalent to what are now known as Cores, small (in the literal physical sense) Artificial intelligences used in shuttles, trans-light modules, Drones, and other machines not large enough for a full scale Mind. While still considered sentient, a mind&#x27;s power at this point is considered greatly inferior to a contemporary Mind. That said, It is possible for Minds to have upgrades, improvements and enhancements given to them since construction, to allow them to remain up to date.

Using the sensory equipment available to the Culture, Minds can see inside solid objects; in principle they can also read minds by examining the cellular processes inside a living brain, but Culture Minds regard such mindreading as taboo. The only known Mind to break this Taboo, the &quot;Grey Area&quot; seen in &quot;Excession&quot;, is largely ostracized and shunned by other Minds as a result. In &quot;Look to Windward&quot; an example is cited of an attempt to destroy a Culture Mind by smuggling a minuscule antimatter bomb onto a Culture orbital inside the head of a Chelgrian agent. However the bomb ends up being spotted without the taboo being broken.

In &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, a typical Mind is described as a mirror-like ellipsoid of several dozen cubic metres, but weighing many thousands of tons, due to the fact that it is made up of hyper-dense matter. It is noted that most of its &#x27;body&#x27; only exists in the real world at the outer shell, the inner workings staying constantly within hyperspace.

The Mind in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; is also described as having internal power sources which function as back-up shield generators and space propulsion, and seeing the rational, safety-conscious thinking of Minds, it would be reasonable to assume that all Minds have such features, as well as a complement of drones and other remote sensors as also described.

Other equipment available to them spans the whole range of the Culture&#x27;s technological capabilities and its practically limitless resources. However, this equipment would more correctly be considered emplaced in the ship or orbital that the Mind is controlling, rather than being part of the Mind itself.
;
Minds are constructed entities, which have general parameters fixed by their constructors (other Minds) before &#x27;birth&#x27;, not unlike biological beings. A wide variety of characteristics can be and are manipulated, such as introversion-extroversion, aggressiveness (for warships) or general disposition.

However, the character of a Mind evolves as well, and Minds often change over the course of centuries, sometimes changing personality entirely. This is often followed by them becoming eccentric or at least somewhat odd. Others drift from the Culture-accepted ethical norms, and may even start influencing their own society in subtle ways, selfishly furthering their own views of how the Culture should act.

Minds have also been known to commit suicide to escape punishment, or because of grief.

Minds are constructed with a personality typical of the Culture&#x27;s interests, i.e. full of curiosity, general benevolence (expressed in the &#x27;good works&#x27; actions of the Culture, or in the protectiveness regarding sentient beings) and respect for the Culture&#x27;s customs.

Nonetheless, Minds have their own interests in addition to what their peers expect them to do for the Culture, and may develop fascinations or hobbies like other sentient beings do.

The mental capabilities of Minds are described in &quot;Excession&quot; to be vast enough to run entire universe-simulations inside their own imaginations, exploring metamathical (a fictional branch of metamathematics) scenarios, an activity addictive enough to cause some Minds to totally withdraw from caring about our own physical reality into &quot;Infinite Fun Space&quot;, their own, ironic and understated term for this sort of activity.
;
One of the main activities of Ship Minds is the guidance of spaceships from a certain minimum size upwards. A culture spaceship &quot;is&quot; the Mind and vice versa; there are no different names for the two, and a spaceship without a Mind would be considered damaged or incomplete to the Culture.

Ship Mind classes include General Systems Vehicle (GSV), Medium Systems Vehicle (), Limited Systems Vehicle (), General Contact Vehicle (), General Contact Unit (GCU), Limited Contact Unit (), Rapid Offensive Unit (), General Offensive Unit (), Limited Offensive Unit (), Demilitarised ROU (), Demilitarised GOU (), Demilitarised LOU (), Very Fast Picket (–synonym for dROU), Fast Picket (–synonym for dGOU or dLOU), and Superlifter.

These ships provide a convenient &#x27;body&#x27; for a Mind, which is too large and too important to be contained within smaller, more fragile shells. Following the &#x27;body&#x27; analogy, it also provides the Mind with the capability of physical movement. As Minds are living beings with curiosity, emotion and wishes of their own, such mobility is likely very important to most.

Culture Minds (mostly also being ships) usually give themselves whimsical names, though these often hint at their function as well. Even the names of warships retain this humorous approach, though the implications are much darker.
;
Some Minds also take on functions which either preclude or discourage movement. These usually administer various types of Culture facilities:

* Orbital Hubs – A Culture Orbital is a smaller version of a ringworld, with large numbers of people living on the inside surface of them, in a planet-like environment.
* Rocks – Minds in charge of planetoid-like structures, built/accreted, mostly from the earliest times of the Culture before it moved into space-built orbitals.
* Stores – Minds of a quiet temperament run these asteroids, containing vast hangars, full of mothballed military ships or other equipment. Some &#x27;Rocks&#x27; also act as &#x27;Stores&#x27;.
* University Sages – Minds that run Culture universities / schools, a very important function as every Culture citizen has an extensive education and further learning is considered one of the most important reasons for life in the Culture.
;
* Eccentric – Culture Minds who have become &quot;... a bit odd&quot; (as compared to the very rational standards of other Culture Minds). Existing at the fringe of the Culture, they can be considered (and consider themselves) as somewhat, but not wholly part of the Culture.
* Sabbaticaler – Culture Minds who have decided to abdicate from their peer-pressure based duties in the Culture for a time.
* Ulterior – Minds of the Culture Ulterior, an umbrella term for all the no-longer-quite-Culture factions.
* Converts – Minds (or sentient computers) from other societies who have chosen to join the Culture.
* Absconder – Minds who have completely left the Culture, especially when in doing so having deserted some form of task.
* Deranged – A more extreme version of Eccentric as implied in The Hydrogen Sonata
;
Minds (and, as a consequence, Culture starships) usually bear names that do a little more than just identify them. The Minds themselves choose their own names, and thus they usually express something about a particular Mind&#x27;s attitude, character or aims in their personal life. They range from funny to just plain cryptic. Some examples are:

* &quot;Sanctioned Parts List&quot; – a habitation / factory ship
* &quot;So Much For Subtlety&quot; – a habitation / factory ship
* &quot;All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff&quot; – a warship
* &quot;Attitude Adjuster&quot; – a warship
* &quot;Of Course I Still Love You&quot; – an ambassador ship
* &quot;Funny, It Worked Last Time...&quot; – an ambassador ship

===Names===
Some humanoid or drone Culture citizens have long names, often with seven or more words. Some of these words specify the citizen&#x27;s origin (place of birth or manufacture), some an occupation, and some may denote specific philosophical or political alignments (chosen later in life by the citizen themselves), or make other similarly personal statements. An example would be Diziet Sma, whose full name is Rasd-Coduresa Diziet Embless Sma da&#x27; Marenhide:
* &quot;Rasd-Coduresa&quot; is the planetary system of her birth, and the specific object (planet, orbital, Dyson sphere, etc.). The &quot;-sa&quot; suffix is roughly equivalent to &quot;-er&quot; in English. By this convention, Earth humans would all be named &quot;Sun-Earthsa&quot; (or &quot;Sun-Earther&quot;).
* &quot;Diziet&quot; is her given name. This is chosen by a parent, usually the mother.
* &quot;Embless&quot; is her chosen name. Most Culture citizens choose this when they reach adulthood (according to &quot;The Player of Games&quot; this is known as &quot;completing one&#x27;s name&quot;). As with all conventions in the Culture, it may be broken or ignored: some change their chosen name during their lives, some never take one.
* &quot;Sma&quot; is her surname, usually taken from one&#x27;s mother.
* &quot;da&#x27; Marenhide&quot; is the house or estate she was raised within, the &quot;da″&quot; or &quot;dam&quot; being similar to &quot;von&quot; in German. (The usual formation is &quot;dam&quot;; &quot;da″&quot; is used in Sma&#x27;s name because the house name begins with an M, eliding an awkward phoneme repetition.)
Iain Banks gave his own Culture name as &quot;Sun-Earther Iain El-Bonko Banks of North Queensferry&quot;.

===Death===
The Culture has a relatively relaxed attitude towards death. Genetic manipulation and the continual benevolent surveillance of the Minds make natural or accidental death almost unknown. Advanced technology allows citizens to make backup copies of their personalities, allowing them to be resurrected in case of death. The form of that resurrection can be specified by the citizen, with personalities returning either in the same biological form, in an artificial form (see below), or even just within virtual reality. Some citizens choose to go into &quot;storage&quot; (a form of suspended animation) for long periods of time, out of boredom or curiosity about the future.

Attitudes individual citizens have towards death are varied (and have varied throughout the Culture&#x27;s history). While many, if not most, citizens make some use of backup technology, many others do not, preferring instead to risk death without the possibility of recovery (for example when engaging in extreme sports). These citizens are sometimes called &quot;disposables&quot;, and are described in &quot;Look to Windward&quot;. Taking into account such accidents, voluntary euthanasia for emotional reasons, or choices like sublimation, the average lifespan of humans is described in &quot;Excession&quot; as being around 350 to 400 years. Some citizens choose to forgo death altogether, although this is rarely done and is viewed as an eccentricity. Other options instead of death include conversion of an individual&#x27;s consciousness into an AI, joining of a group mind (which can include biological and non-biological consciousnesses), or subliming (usually in association with a group mind).

Concerning the lifespan of drones and Minds, given the durability of Culture technology and the options of mindstate backups, it is reasonable to assume that they live as long as they choose. Even Minds, with their utmost complexity, are known to be backed up (and reactivated if they for example die in a risky mission, see &quot;GSV Lasting Damage&quot;). It is noted that even Minds themselves do not necessarily live forever either, often choosing to eventually sublime or even killing themselves (as does the double-Mind &quot;GSV Lasting Damage&quot; due to its choices in the Culture-Idiran war).

==Science and technology==

===Anti-gravity and forcefields===
The Culture (and other societies) have developed powerful anti-gravity abilities, closely related to their ability to manipulate forces themselves.

In this ability they can create action-at-a-distance – including forces capable of pushing, pulling, cutting, and even fine manipulation, and forcefields for protection, visual display or plain destructive ability. Such applications still retain restrictions on range and power: while forcefields of many cubic kilometres are possible (and in fact, orbitals are held together by forcefields), even in the chronologically later novels, such as &quot;Look to Windward&quot;, spaceships are still used for long-distance travel and drones for many remote activities.

With the control of a Mind, fields can be manipulated over vast distances. In &quot;Use of Weapons&quot;, a Culture warship uses its electromagnetic effectors to hack into a computer light years away.

===Artificial intelligence===
Artificial intelligences (and to a lesser degree, the non-sentient computers omnipresent in all material goods), form the backbone of the technological advances of the Culture. Not only are they the most advanced scientists and designers the Culture has, their lesser functions also oversee the vast (but usually hidden) production and maintenance capabilities of the society.

The Culture has achieved artificial intelligences where each Mind has thought processing capabilities many orders of magnitude beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in filing cabinets, would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;). Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilisations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital Minds are capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.

At the same time, it has achieved drone sentiences and capability of Special Circumstance proportions in forms that could fit easily within a human hand, and built extremely powerful (though not sentient) computers capable of fitting into tiny insect-like drones. Some utilitarian devices (such as spacesuits) are also provided with artificial sentience. These specific types of drones, like all other Culture AI, would also be considered citizens - though as described in the short story &quot;Descendant&quot;, they may spend most of the time when their &quot;body&quot; is not in use in a form of remote-linked existence outside of it, or in a form of AI-level virtual reality.

===Energy manipulation===
A major feature of its post-scarcity society, the Culture is obviously able to gather, manipulate, transfer and store vast amounts of energy. While not explained in detail in the novels, this involves antimatter and the &quot;energy grid&quot;, a postulated energy field dividing the universe from neighboring anti-matter universes, and providing practically limitless energy. Transmission or storage of such energy is not explained, though these capabilities must be powerful as well, with tiny drones capable of very powerful manipulatory fields and forces.

The Culture also uses various forms of energy manipulation as weapons, with &quot;gridfire&quot;, a method of creating a dimensional rift to the energy grid, releasing astronomical amounts of energy into a region of non-hyperspace, being described as a sort of ultimate weapon more destructive than collapsed antimatter bombardment. One character in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; refers to gridfire as &quot;the weaponry of the end of the universe&quot;. Gridfire resembles the zero-point energy used within many popular science fiction stories.

===Matter displacement===
The Culture (at least by the time of &quot;The Player of Games&quot;) has developed a form of teleportation capable of transporting both living and unliving matter instantaneously via wormholes. This technology has not rendered spacecraft obsolete – in &quot;Excession&quot; a barely apple-sized drone was displaced no further than a light-second at maximum range (mass being a limiting factor determining range), a tiny distance in galactic terms. The process also still has a very small chance of failing and killing living beings, but the chance is described as being so small (1 in 61 million) that it normally only becomes an issue when transporting a large number of people and is only regularly brought up due to the Culture&#x27;s safety conscious nature.

Displacement is an integral part of Culture technology, being widely used for a range of applications from peaceful to belligerent. Displacing warheads into or around targets is one of the main forms of attack in space warfare in the Culture universe. &quot;The Player of Games&quot; mentions that drones can be displaced to catch a person falling from a cliff before they impact the ground, as well.

===Brain–computer interfaces===
Through &quot;neural lace&quot;, a form of brain–computer interface that is implanted into the brains of young people and grows with them, the Culture has the capability to read and store the full sentience of any being, biological or artificial, and thus reactivate a stored being after its death. The neural lace also allows wireless communication with the Minds and databases. This also necessitates the capability to read thoughts, but as described in &quot;Look to Windward&quot;, doing this without permission is considered taboo.

===Starships and warp drives===
Starships are living spaces, vehicles and ambassadors of the Culture. A proper Culture starship (as defined by hyperspace capability and the presence of a Mind to inhabit it) may range from several hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. The latter may be inhabited by billions of beings and are artificial worlds in their own right, including whole ecosystems, and are considered to be self-contained representations of all aspects of Culture life and capability.

The Culture (and most other space-faring species in its universe) use a form of Hyperspace-drive to achieve faster-than-light speeds. Banks has evolved a (self-confessedly) technobabble system of theoretical physics to describe the ships&#x27; acceleration and travel, using such concepts as &quot;infraspace&quot; and &quot;ultraspace&quot; and an &quot;energy grid&quot; between universes (from which the warp engines &quot;push off&quot; to achieve momentum). An &quot;induced singularity&quot; is used to access infra or ultra space from real space; once there, &quot;engine fields&quot; reach down to the Grid and gain power and traction from it as they travel at high speeds.

These hyperspace engines do not use reaction mass and hence do not need to be mounted on the surface of the ship. They are described as being very dense exotic matter, which only reveals its complexity under a powerful microscope. Acceleration and maximum speed depend on the ratio of the mass of the ship to its engine mass. As with any other matter aboard, ships can gradually manufacture extra engine volume or break it down as needed. In &quot;Excession&quot; one of the largest ships of the Culture redesigns itself to be mostly engine (by combining the hyperspace engine fields of thousands of semi-slaved warships which have been constructed in secret, and housed within the ship itself, and out of view) and reaches a speed of 233,000 times lightspeed. Within the range of the Culture&#x27;s influence in the galaxy, most ships would still take years of travelling to reach the more remote spots.

Other than the engines used by larger Culture ships, there are a number of other propulsion methods such as gravitic drive at sublight speeds, with antimatter, fusion and other reaction engines occasionally seen with less advanced civilisations, or on Culture hobby craft.

Warp engines can be very small, with Culture drones barely larger than fist-size described as being thus equipped. There is also at least one (apparently non-sentient) species (the &quot;Chuy-Hirtsi&quot; animal), that possesses the innate capability of warp travel. In &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, it is being used as a military transport by the Idirans, but no further details are given.

===Nanotechnology===
The Culture has highly advanced nanotechnology, though descriptions of such technology in the books is limited. Many of the described uses are by or for Special Circumstances, but there are no indications that the use of nanotechnology is limited in any way. (In a passage in one of the books, there is a brief reference to the question of sentience when comparing the human brain or a &quot;pico-level substrate&quot;.)

One of the primary clandestine uses of nanotechnology is information gathering. The Culture likes to be in the know, and as described in &quot;Matter&quot; &quot;they tend to know everything.&quot; Aside from its vast network of sympathetic allies and wandering Culture citizens one of the primary ways that the Culture keeps track of important events is by the use of practically invisible nanobots capable of recording and transmitting their observations. This technique is described as being especially useful to track potentially dangerous people (such as ex-Special Circumstances agents). Via such nanotechnology, it is potentially possible for the Culture (or similarly advanced societies) to see everything happening on a given planet, orbital or any other habitat. The usage of such devices is limited by various treaties and agreements among the Involved.

In addition, EDust assassins are potent Culture terror weapons, composed entirely of nano machines called EDust, or &quot;Everything Dust.&quot; They are capable of taking almost any shape or form, including swarms of insects or entire humans or aliens, and possess powerful weaponry capable of levelling entire buildings.

==Living space==
Much of the Culture&#x27;s population lives on orbitals, vast artificial worlds that can accommodate billions of people. Others travel the galaxy in huge space ships such as General Systems Vehicles (GSVs) that can accommodate hundreds of millions of people. Almost no Culture citizens are described as living on planets, except when visiting other civilisations. The reason for this is partly because the Culture believes in containing its own expansion to self-constructed habitats, instead of colonising or conquering new planets. With the resources of the universe allowing permanent expansion (at least assuming non-exponential growth), this frees them from having to compete for living space.

The Culture, and other civilisations in Banks&#x27; universe, are described as living in these various, often constructed habitats:

===Airspheres===
These are vast, brown dwarf-sized bubbles of atmosphere enclosed by force fields, and (presumably) set up by an ancient advanced race at least one and a half billion years ago (see: Look to Windward). There is only minimal gravity within an airsphere. They are illuminated by moon-sized orbiting planetoids that emit enormous light beams.

Citizens of the Culture live there only very occasionally as guests, usually to study the complex ecosystem of the airspheres and the dominant life-forms: the &quot;dirigible behemothaurs&quot; and &quot;gigalithine lenticular entities&quot;, which may be described as inscrutable, ancient intelligences looking similar to a cross between gigantic blimps and whales. The airspheres slowly migrate around the galaxy, taking anywhere from 50 to 100 million years to complete one circuit. In the novels no one knows who created the airspheres or why, but it is presumed that whoever did has long since sublimed but may maintain some obscure link with the behemothaurs and lenticular entities. Guests in the airspheres are not allowed to use any force-field technology, though no reason has been offered for this prohibition.

The airspheres resemble in some respects the orbit-sized ring of breathable atmosphere created by Larry Niven in &quot;The Integral Trees&quot;, but spherical not toroidal, require a force field to retain their integrity, and arose by artificial rather than natural processes.

===Orbitals===
One of the main types of habitats of the Culture, an orbital is a ring structure orbiting a star as would a megastructure akin to a bigger Bishop ring. Unlike a ringworld or a Dyson sphere, an orbital does not enclose the star (being much too small). Like a ringworld, the orbital rotates to provide an analog of gravity on the inner surface. A Culture orbital rotates about once every 24 hours and has gravity-like effect about the same as the gravity of Earth, making the diameter of the ring about (nearly five times the diameter of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around Earth), and ensuring that the inhabitants experience night and day. Orbitals feature prominently in many Culture stories.

===Planets===
Though many other civilisations in the Culture books live on planets, the Culture as currently developed has little direct connection to on-planet existence. Banks has written that he presumes this to be an inherent consequence of space colonisation, and a foundation of the liberal nature of the Culture. A small number of home worlds of the founding member-species of the Culture receive a mention in passing, and a few hundred human-habitable worlds were colonised (some of them terraformed) before the Culture elected to turn towards artificial habitats, preferring to keep the planets it encounters wild. Since then, the Culture has come to look down on terraforming as inelegant, ecologically problematic and possibly even immoral. Less than one per cent of the population of the Culture lives on planets, and many find the very concept somewhat bizarre.

This attitude is not absolute though; in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, some Minds suggest testing a new technology on a &quot;spare planet&quot; (knowing that it could be destroyed in an antimatter explosion if unsuccessful). One could assume – from Minds&#x27; usual ethics – that such a planet would have been lifeless to start with. It is also quite possible, even probable, that the suggestion was not made in complete seriousness.

===Rings===
Ringworld-like megastructures exist in the Culture universe; the texts refer to them simply as &quot;Rings&quot; (with a capital &quot;R&quot;). As opposed to the smaller orbitals which revolve around a star, these structures are massive and completely encircle a star. Banks does not describe these habitats in detail, but records one as having been destroyed (along with three Spheres) in the Idiran-Culture war. In &quot;Matter&quot;, the Morthanveld people possesses ringworld-like structures made of innumerable various-sized tubes. Those structures, like Niven&#x27;s Ringworld, encircle a star and are about the same size.

===Rocks===
These are asteroids and other non-planetary bodies hollowed out for habitation and usually spun for centrifugal artificial gravity. Rocks (with the exception of those used for secretive purposes) are described as having faster-than-light space drives, and thus can be considered a special form of spaceship. Like Orbitals, they are usually administered by one or more Minds.

Rocks do not play a large part in most of the Culture stories, though their use as storage for mothballed military ships (&quot;Pittance&quot;) and habitats (&quot;Phage Rock&quot;, one of the founding communities of the Culture) are both key plot points in &quot;Excession&quot;.

===Shellworlds===
Shellworlds are introduced in &quot;Matter&quot;, and consist of multilayered levels of concentric spheres in four dimensions held up by countless titanic interior towers. Their extra dimensional characteristics render some products of Culture technology too dangerous to use and yet others ineffective, notably access to hyperspace. About 4000 were built millions of years ago as vast machines intended to cast a forcefield around the whole of the galaxy for unknown purposes; less than half of those remain at the time of &quot;Matter&quot;, many having been destroyed by a departed species known as the Iln. The species that developed this technology, known as the Veil or the Involucra, are now lost, and many of the remaining shellworlds have become inhabited, often by many different species throughout their varying levels. Many still hold deadly secret defence mechanisms, often leading to great danger for their new inhabitants, giving them one of their other nicknames: Slaughter Worlds.

===Ships===
Ships in the Culture are intelligent individuals, often of very large size, controlled by one or more Minds. The ship is considered by the Culture generally and the Mind itself to be the Mind&#x27;s body (compare avatars). Some ships (GSVs, for example) are tens or even hundreds of kilometres in length and may have millions or even billions of residents who live on them full-time; together with Orbitals, such ships represent the main form of habitat for the Culture. Such large ships may temporarily contain smaller ships with their own populations, and/or manufacture such ships themselves.

In &quot;Use of Weapons&quot;, the protagonist Zakalwe is allowed to acclimatise himself to the Culture by wandering for days through the habitable levels of a ship (the GSV &quot;Size Isn&#x27;t Everything&quot;, which is described as over long), eating and sleeping at the many locations which provide food and accommodation throughout the structure and enjoying the various forms of contact possible with the friendly and accommodating inhabitants.

===Spheres===
Dyson spheres also exist in the Culture universe but receive only passing mention as &quot;Spheres&quot;. Three spheres are recorded as having been destroyed in the Idiran-Culture war.

== Interaction with other civilisations==
The Culture, living mostly on massive spaceships and in artificial habitats, and also feeling no need for conquest in the typical sense of the word, possesses no borders. Its sphere of influence is better defined by the (current) concentration of Culture ships and habitats as well as the measure of effect its example and its interventions have already had on the &quot;local&quot; population of any galactic sector. As the Culture is also a very graduated and constantly evolving society, its societal boundaries are also constantly in flux (though they tend to be continually expanding during the novels), peacefully &quot;absorbing&quot; societies and individuals.

While the Culture is one of the most advanced and most powerful of all galactic civilisations, it is still but one of the &quot;high-level Involved&quot; (called &quot;Optimae&quot; by some less advanced civilisations), the most powerful non-sublimed civilisations which mentor or control the others.

An Involved society is a highly advanced group that has achieved galaxy-wide involvement with other cultures or societies. There are a few dozen Involved societies and hundreds or thousands of well-developed (interstellar) but insufficiently influential societies or cultures. The well-developed societies which do not take a dynamic role in the galaxy as a whole are designated as &quot;galactically mature&quot;. In the novels, the Culture might be considered the premier Involved society, or at least the most dynamic and energetic, especially given that the Culture itself is a growing multicultural fusion of Involved societies. 

The Involved are contrasted with the Sublimed, groups that have reached a high level of technical development and galactic influence but subsequently abandoned physical reality, ceasing to take serious interventionist interest in galactic civilisation. They are also contrasted with what some Culture people loosely refer to as &quot;barbarians&quot;, societies of intelligent beings which lack the technical capacity to know about or take a serious role in their interstellar neighbourhood. There are also the elder civilisations, which are civilisations that reached the required level of technology for sublimation, but chose not to, and have retreated from the larger galactic meta-civilisation.

The Involved are also contrasted with hegemonising swarms (a term used in several of Banks&#x27; Culture novels). These are entities that exist to convert as much of the universe as possible into more of themselves; most typically these are technological in nature, resembling more sophisticated forms of grey goo, but the term can be applied to cultures that are sufficiently single-minded in their devotion to mass conquest, control, and colonisation. Both the Culture and the author (in his &quot;Notes on the Culture&quot;) find this behaviour quixotic and ridiculous. Most often, societies categorised as hegemonising swarms consist of species or groups newly arrived in the galactic community with highly expansionary and exploitative goals. The usage of the term &quot;hegemonising swarm&quot; in this context is considered derisive in the Culture and among other Involved and is used to indicate their low regard for those with these ambitions by comparing their behaviour to that of mindless self-replicating technology. The Culture&#x27;s central moral dilemma regarding intervention in other societies can be construed as a conflict between the desire to help others and the desire to avoid becoming a hegemonising swarm themselves.

===Foreign policy===
Although they lead a comfortable life within the Culture, many of its citizens feel a need to be useful and to belong to a society that does not merely exist for their own sake but that also helps improve the lot of sentient beings throughout the galaxy. For that reason the Culture carries out &quot;good works&quot;, covertly or overtly interfering in the development of lesser civilisations, with the main aim to gradually guide them towards less damaging paths. As Culture citizens see it, these good works provide the Culture with a &quot;moral right to exist&quot;.

A group within the Culture, known as Contact, is responsible for its interactions (diplomatic or otherwise) with other civilisations. Non-Contact citizens are apparently not prevented from travelling or interacting with other civilisations, though the effort and potential danger involved in doing so alone makes it much more commonly the case for Culture people simply to join Contact if they long to &quot;see the world&quot;. Further within Contact, an intelligence organisation named Special Circumstances exists to deal with interventions which require more covert behaviour; the interventionist approach that the Culture takes to advancing other societies may often create resentment in the affected civilisations and thus requires a rather delicate touch (see: &quot;Look to Windward&quot;).

In &quot;Matter&quot;, it is described that there are a number of other galactic civilisations that come close to or potentially even surpass the Culture in power and sophistication. The Culture is very careful and considerate of these groupings, and while still trying to convince them of the Culture ideal, will be much less likely to openly interfere in their activities.

In &quot;Surface Detail&quot;, three more branches of Contact are described: Quietus, the Quietudinal Service, whose purview is dealing with those entities who have retired from biological existence into digital form and/or those who have died and been resurrected; Numina, which is described as having the charge of contact with races that have sublimed; and Restoria, a subset of Contact which focuses on containing and negating the threat of swarms of self-replicating creatures (&quot;hegswarms&quot;).

===Behaviour in war===
While the Culture is normally pacifist, Contact historically acts as its military arm in times of war and Special Circumstances can be considered its secret service and its military intelligence. During war, most of the strategic and tactical decisions are taken by the Minds, with apparently only a small number of especially gifted humans, the &quot;Referrers&quot;, being involved in the top-level decisions, though they are not shown outside &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;. It is shown in &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; that actual decisions to go to war (as opposed to purely defensive actions) are based on a vote of all Culture citizens, presumably after vigorous discussion within the whole society.

It is described in various novels that the Culture is extremely reluctant to go to war, though it may start to prepare for it long before its actual commencement. In the Idiran-Culture War (possibly one of the most hard-fought wars for the normally extremely superior Culture forces), various star systems, stellar regions and many orbital habitats were overrun by the Idirans before the Culture had converted enough of its forces to military footing. The Culture Minds had had enough foresight to evacuate almost all its affected citizens (apparently numbering in the many billions) in time before actual hostilities reached them. As shown in &quot;Player of Games&quot;, this is a standard Culture tactic, with its strong emphasis on protecting its citizens rather than sacrificing some of them for short-term goals.

War within the Culture is mostly fought by the Culture&#x27;s sentient warships, the most powerful of these being war-converted GSVs, which are described as powerful enough to oppose whole enemy fleets. The Culture has little use for conventional ground forces (as it rarely occupies enemy territory); combat drones equipped with knife missiles do appear in &quot;Descendant&quot; and &quot;terror weapons&quot; (basically intelligent, nano-form assassins) are mentioned in &quot;Look to Windward&quot;, while infantry combat suits of great power (also usable as capable combat drones when without living occupants) are used in &quot;Matter&quot;.

==Relevance to real-world politics==

The inner workings of The Culture are not especially described in detail though it is shown that the society is populated by an empowered, educated and augmented citizenry in a direct democracy or highly democratic and transparent system of self-governance. In comparisons to the real world, intended or not, the Culture could resemble various posited egalitarian societies including in the writings of Karl Marx, the end condition of communism after a withering away of the state, the anarchism of Bakunin and Fourier et al., libertarian socialism, council communism and anarcho-communism. Other characteristics of The Culture that are recognisable in real world politics include pacifism, post-capitalism, and transhumanism. Banks deliberately portrayed an imperfect utopia whose imperfection or weakness is related to its interaction with the &#x27;other&#x27;, that is, exterior civilisations and species that are sometimes variously warred with or mishandled through the Culture&#x27;s Contact section which cannot always control its intrigues and the individuals it either &#x27;employs&#x27; or interacts with. This &#x27;dark side&#x27; of The Culture also alludes to or echoes mistakes and tragedies in 20th century Marxist–Leninist countries, although the Culture is generally portrayed as far more &#x27;humane&#x27; and just.

===Utopia===
Comparisons are often made between the Culture and twentieth and twenty first century Western civilisation and nation-states, particularly their interventions in less-developed societies. These are often confused with regard to the author&#x27;s assumed politics.

Ben Collier has said that the Culture is a utopia carrying significantly greater moral legitimacy than the West&#x27;s, by comparison, proto-democracies. While Culture interventions can seem similar at first to Western interventions, especially when considered with their democratising rhetoric, the argument is that the Culture operates completely without material need, and therefore without the possibility of baser motives. This is not to say that the Culture&#x27;s motives are purely altruistic; a peaceful, enlightened universe full of good neighbours lacking ethnic, religious, and sexual chauvinisms is in the Culture&#x27;s interest as well. Furthermore, the Culture&#x27;s ideals, in many ways similar to those of the liberal perspective today, are to a much larger extent realised internally in comparison to the West.

===Criticism===
Examples are the use of mercenaries to perform the work that the Culture does not want to get their hands dirty with, and even outright threats of invasion (the Culture has issued ultimatums to other civilisations before). Some commentators have also argued that those Special Circumstances agents tasked with civilising foreign cultures (and thus potentially also changing them into a blander, more Culture-like state) are also those most likely to regret these changes, with parallels drawn to real-world special forces trained to operate within the cultural mindsets of foreign nations.

The events of &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; are an example of just how dirty Special Circumstances will play in order to get their way and the conspiracy at the heart of the plot of &quot;Excession&quot; demonstrates how at least some Minds are prepared to risk killing sentient beings when they conclude that these actions are beneficial for the long term good. Special Circumstances represents a very small fraction of Contact, which itself is only a small fraction of the entire Culture, making it comparable again to size and influence of modern intelligence agencies.

==Issues raised==
The Culture stories are largely about problems and paradoxes that confront liberal societies. The Culture itself is an &quot;ideal-typical&quot; liberal society; that is, as pure an example as one can reasonably imagine. It is highly egalitarian; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions are expected to be determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a progressive system of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have and do what they want. If they do not like the behaviour or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behaviour.

Even the Culture has to compromise its ideals where diplomacy and its own security are concerned. Contact, the group that handles these issues, and Special Circumstances, its secret service division, can employ only those on whose talents and emotional stability it can rely, and may even reject self-aware drones built for its purposes that fail to meet its requirements. Hence these divisions are regarded as the Culture&#x27;s elite and membership is widely regarded as a prize; yet also something that can be shameful as it contradicts many of the Culture&#x27;s moral codes.

Within Contact and Special Circumstances, there are also inner circles that can take control in crises, somewhat contradictory to the ideal notions of democratic and open process the Culture espouses. Contact and Special Circumstances may suppress or delay the release of information, for example to avoid creating public pressure for actions they consider imprudent or to prevent other civilisations from exploiting certain situations.

In dealing with less powerful regressive civilisations, the Culture usually intervenes discreetly, for example by protecting and discreetly supporting the more liberal elements, or subverting illiberal institutions. For instance, in &quot;Use of Weapons&quot;, the Culture operates within a less advanced illiberal society through control of a business cartel which is known for its humanitarian and social development investments, as well as generic good Samaritanism. In &quot;Excession&quot;, a sub-group of Minds conspires to provoke a war with the extremely sadistic Affront, although the conspiracy is foiled by a GSV that is a deep cover Special Circumstances agent. Only one story, &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, pits the Culture against a highly illiberal society of approximately equal power: the aggressive, theocratic Idirans. Though they posed no immediate, direct threat to the Culture, the Culture declared war because it would have felt useless if it allowed the Idirans&#x27; ruthless expansion to continue. The Culture&#x27;s decision was a value-judgement rather than a utilitarian calculation, and the &quot;Peace Faction&quot; within the Culture seceded. Later in the timeline of the Culture&#x27;s universe, the Culture has reached a technological level at which most past civilisations have Sublimed, in other words disengaged from Galactic politics and from most physical interaction with other civilisations. The Culture continues to behave &quot;like an idealistic adolescent&quot;.

As of 2008, three stories force the Culture to consider its approach to more powerful civilisations. In one incident during the Culture–Idiran War, they strive to avoid offending a civilisation so advanced that it has disengaged from Galactic politics, and note that this hyper-advanced society is not a threat to either the welfare or the values of the Culture. In &quot;Excession&quot;, an overwhelmingly more powerful individual from an extremely advanced civilisation is simply passing through on its way from one plane of the physical Reality to another, and there is no real interaction. In the third case it sets up teams to study a civilisation that is not threatening but is thought to have eliminated aggressors in the past.

<doc id="58624" wikidata="Q1375827" url="?curid=58624" title="Polyglotta Africana">
<text>Polyglotta Africana is a study published in 1854 by the German missionary Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle (1823–1902), in which the author compares 280 words from 200 African languages and dialects (or about 120 separate languages according to today&#x27;s classification; several varieties considered distinct by Koelle were later shown to belong to the same language). As a comparative study it was a major breakthrough at the time.

Koelle based his material on first-hand observations, mostly with freed slaves in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He transcribed the data using a uniform phonetic script. Koelle&#x27;s transcriptions were not always accurate; for example, he persistently confused with and with . His data were consistent enough, however, to enable groupings of languages based on vocabulary resemblances. Notably, the groups which he set up correspond in a number of cases to modern groups: 
*North-West Atlantic — Atlantic
*North-Western High Sudan/Mandenga — Mande
*North-Eastern High Sudan — Gur

Although Koelle&#x27;s was not the first such study comparing different African languages, (for example, a missionary called John Clarke had produced a similar work in 1848, and still earlier Hannah Kilham had produced her &quot;Specimens of African Languages, Spoken in the Colony of Sierra Leone&quot; in 1828), yet in its accuracy and thoroughness it outclassed all the others and still proves useful today.

==Value of the work==
The &quot;Polyglotta Africana&quot; was the second work carried out by Koelle during his five years in Sierra Leone, the first being a grammar of the Vai language in 1849. The idea of this was to use the fact that Sierra Leone was a melting pot of ex-slaves from all over Africa to compile a list of 280 basic words (a sort of early Swadesh list) in some 160 languages and dialects. These were then grouped as far as possible in families. Most of the informants who contributed to this work came from West Africa, but there were also others from as far away as Mozambique. One area that was lacking was the Swahili coast of Kenya and Tanzania, since it seems that slaves from this region were generally taken northwards to Zanzibar and Arabia rather than southward towards America and Brazil. The pronunciations of all the words were carefully noted using an alphabet similar, though not identical, to that devised by Karl Richard Lepsius, which was not yet available at that time. The name of the book was imitated from a well-known work called &quot;Asia Polyglotta&quot; (1823) by the German scholar Julius Klaproth. 

The value of the list is not merely linguistic, since the work not only includes the words themselves, but Koelle also added a short biography of each informant, with geographical information about their place of origin, and an indication of how many other people they knew in Sierra Leone who spoke the same language. This information, combined with a census of Sierra Leone conducted in 1848, has proved invaluable to historians researching the African slave trade in the 19th century. Of the 210 informants, there were 179 ex-slaves (two of them women), while the rest were mostly traders or sailors. An analysis of the data shows that typically Koelle&#x27;s informants were middle-aged or elderly men who had been living in Freetown for ten years or more. Three-quarters of the ex-slaves had left their homeland more than ten years earlier, and half of them more than 20 years before; and three-quarters of the informants were over 40 years old. Another interesting facet of the book is the manner in which the informants had been made slaves. Some had been captured in war, some kidnapped, some sold by a relative, others condemned for a debt or sentenced for a crime.

Included with a book is a map of Africa showing the approximate location, as far as it could be ascertained, of each language, prepared by the cartographer August Heinrich Petermann.

==The transcription==
It was Koelle&#x27;s aim not to use any previously published material on the languages he was writing down, but to achieve uniformity by having one person using a single phonetic system for every language. The orthography he eventually chose, after discussions in London, was not that of Karl Richard Lepsius (as is sometimes claimed), since it had not yet been published, but was based on a short document issued in 1848 by Henry Venn of the Church Missionary Society entitled &quot;Rules for Reducing Unwritten Languages to Alphabetical Writing in Roman Characters With Reference Specially to the Languages Spoken in Africa&quot;. The aim of this was to produce a simple practical system of orthography for teaching purposes with the use of as few diacritics as possible. Koelle, however, sought a more accurate phonetic system, and added diacritics. He retained seven of the eight vowels of Venn&#x27;s system (&quot;i, e, ẹ, a, ọ, o, u&quot;, omitting &quot;ạ&quot; as in &quot;but&quot;) but added length marks, a dot for nasalisation, and an accent to indicate the prominent syllable. (Unlike in Lepsius&#x27;s alphabet, the dotted &quot;ẹ&quot; and &quot;ọ&quot; are open not closed sounds.) He modified Venn&#x27;s alphabet by writing &quot;dṣ&quot; for the sound of &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;church&quot; (apparently confusing these two), and n followed by a dot (&quot;n˙&quot;) for the &quot;ng&quot; sound of &quot;sing&quot;. When Koelle learnt of Lepsius&#x27;s alphabet in 1854, he made immediate use of it in his Kanuri grammar, in which he wrote:

:&quot;I much regret that this System was not propounded sooner, so that I might also have adopted it in my Vei-Grammar and Polyglotta Africana. Happily, however, the Orthography which I employed in those books already so nearly approaches the System of Prof. Lepsius, as to only require some minor alterations.&quot;

==Koelle&#x27;s word list==
In the introduction Koelle tells us that he wanted a selection of words that would be simple enough for each informant to be interviewed on a single day, and for this reason he omitted pronouns, which would have taken much longer to elicit. He adds that a few years earlier during a long vacation he had made a similar such list, of just 71 languages, and that in making the present list he had learnt from that experience.

The actual list (the spelling is Koelle&#x27;s) is as follows:
# One
# Two
# Three
# Four 
# Five
# Six
# Seven
# Eight
# Nine
# Ten
# Eleven
# Twelve
# Thirteen
# Fourteen
# Fifteen
# Sixteen

==The languages==
As the list of languages and countries below shows, most of Koelle&#x27;s languages came from West Africa. This is mainly because the majority of the slaves themselves who were intercepted by the British Navy and taken to Sierra Leone were from that region. Another factor was that the number of different languages in West Africa is greater than in some other parts of Africa. For example, Cameroon alone is said to have 255 different languages. One area missing is the Swahili coast of Kenya and Tanzania, apparently because slaves intercepted there were taken not to Sierra Leone but to Zanzibar.

Koelle&#x27;s language names are given in the left-hand column of the table below: some of the diacritics (such as the dot beneath ẹ and ọ, and the acute accent) have been omitted. The groupings are Koelle&#x27;s own. The larger groups are subdivided by Koelle into smaller groups, which are not shown in the table. 

Names in square brackets such as [Aku] are subheadings of a group of languages, and do not themselves have any words. The number of languages or dialects represented on each double-page spread of Koelle&#x27;s book is therefore exactly 200, divided into four columns of 50 languages each.

<text>A court-martial (plural &quot;courts-martial&quot; or &quot;courts martial&quot;, as &quot;martial&quot; is a postpositive adjective) is a military court or a trial conducted in such a court. A court-martial is empowered to determine the guilt of members of the armed forces subject to military law, and, if the defendant is found guilty, to decide upon punishment. In addition, courts-martial may be used to try prisoners of war for war crimes. The Geneva Conventions require that POWs who are on trial for war crimes be subject to the same procedures as would be the holding military&#x27;s own forces. Finally, courts-martial can be convened for other purposes, such as dealing with violations of martial law, and can involve civilian defendants.

Most navies have a standard court-martial which convenes whenever a ship is lost; this does not presume that the captain is suspected of wrongdoing, but merely that the circumstances surrounding the loss of the ship be made part of the official record. Most military forces maintain a judicial system that tries defendants for breaches of military discipline. Some countries like France have no courts-martial in times of peace and use civilian courts instead.

== Hyphenation ==
Court-martial is hyphenated in US usage, whether used as a noun or verb. However, in British usage, a hyphen is used to distinguish between the noun, &quot;court martial&quot;, and the verb, &quot;to court-martial&quot;.

== Composition ==
Usually, a court-martial takes the form of a trial with a presiding judge, a prosecutor and a defense attorney (all trained lawyers as well as officers). The precise format varies from one country to another and may also depend on the severity of the accusation.

== Jurisdiction ==
Courts-martial have the authority to try a wide range of military offences, many of which closely resemble civilian crimes like fraud, theft or perjury. Others, like cowardice, desertion, and insubordination, are purely military crimes. Military offences are defined in the Armed Forces Act 2006 for members of the British military. Regulations for the Canadian Forces are found in the Queen&#x27;s Regulations and Orders as well as the National Defence Act. For members of the United States Armed Forces offenses are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). These offences, as well as their corresponding punishments and instructions on how to conduct a court-martial, are explained in detail based on each country and/or service.

== By country ==

=== Canada ===

In Canada, there is a two-tier military trial system. Summary trials are presided over by superior officers, while more significant matters are heard by courts martial, which are presided over by independent military judges serving under the independent Office of the Chief Military Judge. Appeals are heard by the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. Capital punishment in Canada was abolished generally in 1976, and for military offences in 1998. Harold Pringle was the last Canadian soldier executed pursuant to a court martial, in 1945, having been convicted of murder.

===China===

The Military Court of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army is the highest level military court (High Military Court, a special people&#x27;s court executing the authority of the High People&#x27;s Court) established by the People&#x27;s Republic of China within the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army with jurisdiction over the nation&#x27;s armed forces (including the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the People&#x27;s Armed Police), organized as a unit under the dual leadership of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court and the Political and Legal Committee of the Central Military Commission.

===Finland===
In Finland, the military has jurisdiction over two types of crimes: those that can be committed only by military personnel and those normal crimes by military persons where both the defendant and the victim are military persons or organizations and the crime has been defined in law as falling under military jurisdiction. The former category includes military offences such as various types of disobedience and absence without leave, while the latter category includes civilian crimes such as murder, assault, theft, fraud and forgery. However, war crimes and sexual crimes are not under military jurisdiction.

In crimes where the military has jurisdiction, the military conducts the investigation. In non-trivial cases, this is done by the investigative section of Defence Command or by civilian police, but trivial cases are investigated by the defendant&#x27;s own unit. The civilian police has always the right to take the case from the military.

If the case does not warrant a punishment greater than a fine or a disciplinary punishment, the punishment is given summarily by the company, battalion or brigade commander, depending on severity of the crime. If the brigade commander feels that the crime warrants a punishment more severe than he can give, he refers the case to the local district attorney who commences prosecution.

The crimes with military jurisdiction are handled by the civilian district court which has a special composition. In military cases, the court consists of a civilian legally trained judge and two military members: an officer and a warrant officer, an NCO or a private soldier. The verdict and the sentence are decided by a majority of votes. However, the court cannot give a more severe sentence than the learned member supports. The appeals can be made as in civilian trials. If a court of appeals handles a military matter, it will have an officer member with at least a major&#x27;s rank. The Supreme Court of Finland has, in military cases, two general officers as members.

Courts-martial proper are instituted only during a war, by decree of the government. Such courts-martial have jurisdiction over all crimes committed by military persons. In addition, they may handle criminal cases against civilians in areas where ordinary courts have ceased operation, if the matter is urgent. Such courts-martial have a learned judge as a president and two military members: an officer and an NCO, warrant officer or a private soldier. The verdicts of a war-time court-martial can be appealed to a court of appeals.

=== Germany ===
The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) (adopted after the Second World War in 1949) establishes in Art. 96 para. 2 that courts-martial can be established by federal law. Such courts-martial would take action in a State of Defense (Verteidigungsfall) or against soldiers abroad or at sea.

===Greece===
The existence of military courts, naval courts and air courts is provided for in the Constitution of Greece, which in article 96 paragraph 4 states that:

&quot;Special laws define: a. Those related to military courts, naval courts and air courts, to the jurisdiction of which private individuals cannot be subject&quot;.

The first chapter of the procedural part of the Military Penal Code (MPC) regulates the matters related to the courts and judicial persons that make up the Military Justice. Specifically in article 167 of the MPC, it is defined that criminal justice in the Army is awarded by the military courts (military courts, air courts, naval courts, review court) and the Supreme Court.

=== India ===

There are four kinds of courts-martial in India. These are the General Court Martial (GCM), District Court Martial (DCM), Summary General Court Martial (SGCM) and Summary Court Martial (SCM). According to the Army Act, army courts can try personnel for all kinds of offenses, except for murder and rape of a civilian, which are primarily tried by a civilian court of law. 
The President of India can use the judicial power under Article 72 of the constitution to pardon, reprieve, respite or remission of punishment or sentence given by a court martial.

===Ireland===
Courts martial are provided for in the Constitution of Ireland, which states in Article 38.4.1 that:

&quot;Military tribunals may be established for the trial of offences against military law alleged to have been committed by persons while subject to military law and also to deal with a state of war or armed rebellion.&quot;

There are three classes of courts martial in the Irish Defence Forces:
* The Summary Court-Martial (SCM) is tried by a Military Judge sitting alone. Sentences are limited to six months imprisonment.
* The Limited Court-Martial (LCM) is tried by a Military Judge and a board of three members of the Defence Forces. Sentences are limited to two years imprisonment.
* The General Court-Martial (GCM) is tried by a Military Judge and a board of five members of the Defence Forces. The GCM has no sentencing limit. Officers of Lieutenant-Colonel rank and higher can only be tried by a GCM.

===Israel===
Outside of the Israeli settlements, the West Bank remains under direct Israeli military rule, and under the jurisdiction of martial law in the form of military courts. The international community maintains that Israel does not have sovereignty in the West Bank, and considers Israel&#x27;s control of the area to be the longest military occupation in modern history.

The military court system for the occupied territories, modeled partially on the British military court system set up in 1937, was established in 1967.

Sociology professor Lisa Hajjar argues that Israeli military courts criminalize not only Palestinian violence, but also certain forms of expression deemed to threaten Israeli security. She states the incarceration rate of Palestinians is high compared to other states, and that Palestinians in the West Bank are being treated as &quot;foreign civilians&quot;.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, any criminal offense conducted by military personnel will be held in trial by military court. There are four levels of military jurisdiction:
* Military Court (&quot;Pengadilan Militer&quot;), composed of one major as presiding judge, two captains as judge, one captain as military prosecuting attorney, and one second lieutenant as clerk of court.
* High Military Court (&quot;Pengadilan Militer Tinggi&quot;), composed of one lieutenant colonel as presiding judge, two majors as judge, one major as military prosecuting attorney, and one captain as clerk of court.
* Supreme Military Court (&quot;Pengadilan Militer Utama&quot;), composed of one colonel as presiding judge, two lieutenant colonels as judge, one lieutenant colonel as military prosecuting attorney, and one major as clerk of court.
* Warzone Military Court (&quot;Pengadilan Militer Pertempuran&quot;), composed of one colonel as presiding judge, two lieutenant colonels as judge, one lieutenant colonel as military prosecuting attorney, and one major as clerk of court. This level of military court only applies during wartime.

The judges will receive temporary rank the same as the defendant if the rank of the defendant is higher than the judges.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, there are three levels of military jurisdiction:
* The lowest is the &quot;Council of War&quot; which is composed of one lieutenant-colonel (or higher), one captain (or higher) and one civilian judge of a District Court.
* The &quot;Military Court of Appeal&quot; is composed of two high magistrates of a civilian Court of Appeal and one Major (or higher).
* At the top is the &quot;Military High Court&quot; which deals not only with military cases, but also with acts of high treason, sabotage, organized forms of terrorism and crimes against humanity. It is composed of two magistrates of a civilian Court of Appeal, one judge of a civilian District Court and one Lieutenant-Colonel (or higher) of the Army.

=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, members of the military are tried by a special military section of the civilian court in Arnhem. This section consists of a military member and two civilian judges. The decision whether or not to prosecute is primarily made by the (civilian) attorney general.

=== New Zealand===
Service members of the New Zealand Defence Force are tried under a court martial for offences pertaining to the most serious offences against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971. Offences such as mutiny, murder, sexual offences, serious assaults, drug offences, or offences where the maximum punishment exceeds a 7-year prison term will be heard by court martial. Below this 7-year threshold the accused is dealt with by their commanding officer in what is known as a summary trial.

During court martial the appointed judge is either a New Zealand High Court or District Court judge and they preside over the trial. Defendants are assigned legal counsel, and for the prosecution, a lawyer is assigned who generally comes from a military background. The judge advocate is usually made up of senior NZDF officers and warrant officers who hear the defence and prosecution evidence during court martial. Punishment on guilty findings of a defendant will see them face being charged with a punishment such as serious reprimand, loss of rank, dismissal from the NZDF, or being sent to military or civilian prison.

=== Poland===
In Poland, military courts are military garrison courts and military district courts. They are criminal courts with jurisdiction over offences committed by soldiers in active military service, as well as certain offences committed by civilian military personnel and soldiers of the armed forces of foreign countries (Article 647 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). Garrison courts rule in the first instance, appeals against their decisions and orders are heard by district courts, which also have first-instance jurisdiction in the most serious cases. The Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court then acts as the second instance; in addition, cassation appeals against judgments rendered in the second instance are heard in the Criminal Chamber. The military courts are therefore subject to the adjudicatory supervision of the Supreme Court (which, by the way, follows from Article 183(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland), and the Minister of Justice has superior organizational and administrative supervision.

=== Philippines===
In 2005, ex-AFP Major General Carlos Garcia (PMA Class of 1971, assigned comptroller of the AFP was court martialled for violating two articles of the Articles of War for the alleged Php 303 million Peso Money Laundering/Plunder and direct Bribery against him.

=== Singapore ===

Under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, any commissioned officer is allowed to represent servicemen when they are tried for military offences in the military courts. The cases are heard at the Court-Martial Centre at Kranji Camp II. Some of the courts martial in Singapore include that of Capt. G. R. Wadsworth in 1946 due to use of insubordinate language and, in the modern day, misbehaviour by conscripted servicemen.

=== Thailand ===
The governing law in Thailand&#x27;s military courts is the &quot;Military Court Organisation Act 1955&quot; (). The act allows the Judge Advocate General of Thailand () to establish court regulations. In wartime or during the imposition of martial law, military courts may adopt special procedures.

=== United Kingdom ===

The court martial is one of the Military Courts of the United Kingdom. The Armed Forces Act 2006 establishes the court martial as a permanent standing court. Previously courts-martial were convened on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis with several traditions, including usage of swords. The court martial may try any offence against service law. The court is made up of a judge advocate, and between three and seven (depending on the seriousness of the offence) officers and warrant officers. Rulings on matters of law are made by the judge advocate alone, whilst decisions on the facts are made by a majority of the members of the court, not including the judge advocate, and decisions on sentence by a majority of the court, this time including the judge advocate.

=== United States ===
Most commonly, courts-martial in the United States are convened to try members of the U.S. military for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which is the U.S. military&#x27;s criminal code. However, they can also be convened for other purposes, including military tribunals and the enforcement of martial law in an occupied territory. Courts-martial are governed by the rules of procedure and evidence laid out in the Manual for Courts-Martial, which contains the Rules for Courts-Martial, Military Rules of Evidence, and other guidance. There are three types: Special, Summary, and General.

== Fictional examples ==

In Herman Melville&#x27;s novella &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (first published 1924), the title character is convicted at a drumhead court-martial of striking and killing his superior officer on board HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;, is sentenced to death, and is hanged. The novella has been adapted for the stage, film and television; notably in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1951 opera &quot;Billy Budd&quot;.

In C.S. Forester&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Flying Colours&quot;, Captain Horatio Hornblower is court-martialled for the loss of HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot;. He is &quot;most honourably acquitted&quot;.

In Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s novel &quot;Private Peaceful&quot;, the main character of &quot;Tommo&quot; reflects on the childhoods of himself and his brother, Charlie as Charlie awaits a court martial during WWI, which he receives at the end of the story for disobeying orders and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

Several courts-martial occur in the British naval TV series &quot;Warship&quot;, including notably that of Lieutenant Palfrey, a Royal Marines officer accused of killing a foreign officer during a military exercise, and that of Fleet Air Arm pilot Edward Glenn, brother of Alan Glenn, one the principal characters, charged with a range of offences relating to a dangerous flight manœuvre.

In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Battle&quot; it was stated that, as the loss of a starship was a court martial offense, Picard was court-martialled for the loss of the &quot;Stargazer&quot;, zealously prosecuted by Phillipa Louvois. In the end, he was absolved of all charges.

The 1992 movie &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (and the play on which it was based) deals almost entirely with the court martial of two enlisted Marines.

In the 2008 to 2014 sci-fiction animated TV show &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&#x27;s 2011 fourth season&#x27;s episode &quot;Plan of Dissent&quot; clone troopers Fives and Jesse, both serving in the Grand Army of the Republic, act against orders from their acting superior in a war situation and in revenge are threatened with court-martial and consequent execution. They found themselves court-martialed and about to be executed by firing squad in the next episode, although the final execution did not happen despite them being found guilty.

<text>Leopold Zunz (—&quot;Yom Tov Tzuntz&quot;, —&quot;Lipmann Zunz&quot;; 10 August 1794 – 17 March 1886) was the founder of academic Judaic Studies (&quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot;), the critical investigation of Jewish literature, hymnology and ritual. Zunz&#x27;s historical investigations and contemporary writings had an important influence on contemporary Judaism.

==Biography==

Leopold Zunz was born at Detmold, the son of Talmud scholar Immanuel Menachem Zunz (1759–1802) and Hendel Behrens (1773–1809), the daughter of Dov Beer, an assistant cantor of the Detmold community. The year following his birth his family moved to Hamburg, where, as a young boy, he began learning Hebrew grammar, the Pentateuch, and the Talmud. His father, who was his first teacher, died in July 1802, when Zunz was not quite eight years old. He subsequently gained admission to the Jewish &quot;free school&quot; (Freischule) founded by Philipp Samson, in Wolfenbüttel. Departing from home in July 1803, he saw his mother for the last time (she died in 1809 during his years in Wolfenbüttel). A turning point in Zunz&#x27;s development came in 1807, when , a reform-minded educator, took over the directorship of the Samson School. Ehrenberg reorganized the curriculum, introducing, alongside traditional learning, new subjects such as religion, history, geography, French, and German; he became Zunz&#x27;s mentor, and they remained friends until Ehrenberg&#x27;s death in 1853.

The summer of 1811 is noteworthy as the time when Zunz made his first acquaintance with Johann Christoph Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Hebræa&quot;, which, together with David Gans&#x27;s &quot;Tzemach David&quot;, gave him his first introduction to Jewish literature and the first impulse to think of the &quot;Science of Judaism.&quot;

He settled in Berlin in 1815, studying at the University of Berlin and obtaining a doctorate from the University of Halle. He was ordained by the Hungarian rabbi Aaron Chorin, an early supporter of religious reform, and served for two years teaching and giving sermons in the Beer reformed synagogue in Berlin. He found the career uncongenial, and in 1840 he was appointed director of a &quot;Lehrerseminar,&quot; a post which relieved him from pecuniary troubles. Zunz was always interested in politics, and in 1848 addressed many public meetings. In 1850 he resigned his headship of the Teachers&#x27; Seminary, and was awarded a pension. Throughout his early and married life he was the champion of Jewish rights, and he did not withdraw from public affairs until 1874, the year of the death of his wife Adelheid Beermann, whom he had married in 1822.

Together with other young men, among them the poet Heinrich Heine, Zunz founded the &quot;Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden&quot; (The Society for the Culture and Science of the Jews) alongside Joel Abraham List, Isaac Marcus Jost, and Eduard Gans in Berlin in 1819. In 1823, Zunz became the editor of the &quot;Zeitschrift für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums&quot; (Journal for the Science of Judaism). The ideals of this &quot;Verein&quot; were not destined to bear religious fruit, but the &quot;Science of Judaism&quot; survived. Zunz &quot;took no large share in Jewish reform&quot;, but never lost faith in the regenerating power of &quot;science&quot; as applied to the traditions and literary legacies of the ages. He influenced Judaism from the study rather than from the pulpit.

Although affiliated with the Reform movement, Zunz appeared to show little sympathy for it, though this has been attributed to his disdain for ecclesiastical ambition and fears that rabbinical autocracy would result from the Reform crusade. Further, Isidore Singer and Emil Hirsch have stated that &quot;the point of (Geiger&#x27;s) protest against Reform was directed against Samuel Holdheim and the position maintained by this leader as an autonomous rabbi.&quot; Later in life Zunz went so far as to refer to rabbis as &quot;soothsayers and quacks&quot;.

The violent outcry raised against the Talmud by some of the principal spirits of the Reform party was repugnant to Zunz&#x27;s historic sense. Zunz himself was temperamentally inclined to assign a determinative potency to sentiment, this explaining his tender reverence for ceremonial usages. Although Zunz kept to the Jewish ritual practises, he understood them as symbols (see among others his meditation on tefillin, reprinted in &quot;Gesammelte Schriften,&quot; ii. 172-176). This contrasts with the traditional view of the validity of divine ordinances according to which the faithful are bound to observe without inquiry into their meaning. His position accordingly approached that of the symbolists among the reformers who insisted that symbols had their function, provided their suggestive significance was spontaneously comprehensible. He emphasized most strongly the need of a moral regeneration of the Jews.

He wrote precise philological studies but also impassioned speeches on the Jewish nation and history that had an influence on later Jewish historians. Zunz wrote in 1855:

&quot;If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the nations; if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they are borne ennoble, the Jews can challenge the aristocracy of every land; if a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic tragedies—what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years, in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?&quot;

In 1840 he became director of the Berlin Jewish Teachers&#x27; Seminary.

He was friendly with the traditional Enlightenment figure Nachman Krochmal whose &quot;Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman&quot; (Lemberg, 1851), was edited, according to the author&#x27;s last will, by his friend Leopold Zunz.

Zunz died in Berlin in 1886.

==Works==

Zunz’ famous article “Etwas über die rabbinische Litteratur” (“On Rabbinical Literature”), published in 1818, established the intellectual agenda of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (“Science of Judaism”), while adumbrating the main themes of his own future work as well. Even at this early stage of his academic career, Zunz mapped out his concept of the Wissenschaft des Judentums which he intended to serve as a medium for presenting, preserving, and transmitting the corpus of Jewish literary works. Zunz believed that only an academic approach to Jewish texts and a comprehensive and interdisciplinary academic framework would allow for the adequate study of Jewish themes and Judaism. In 1832 appeared &quot;the most important Jewish book published in the 19th century.&quot; This was Zunz&#x27;s &quot;Gottesdienstliche Vorträge der Juden&quot;, i.e. a history of the Sermon. It lays down principles for the investigation of the Rabbinic exegesis (Midrash) and of the siddur (prayer-book of the synagogue). This book raised Zunz to the supreme position among Jewish scholars. In 1845 appeared his &quot;Zur Geschichte und Literatur&quot;, in which he threw light on the literary and social history of the Jews. He had visited the British Museum in 1846, and this confirmed him in his plan for his third book, &quot;Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters&quot; (1855). It was from this book that George Eliot translated the following opening of a chapter of &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;: &quot;If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the nations...&quot;. After its publication Zunz again visited England, and in 1859 issued his &quot;Ritus&quot;. In this he gives a masterly survey of synagogal rites. His last great book was his &quot;Literaturgeschichte der synagogalen Poesie&quot; (1865). A supplement appeared in 1867. Besides these works, Zunz published a new translation of the Bible, and wrote many essays which were afterwards collected as &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot;.

<text>Tomás de Zumalacárregui e Imaz (Basque: Tomas Zumalakarregi Imatz; 29 December 178824 June 1835), known among his troops as &quot;Uncle Tomás&quot;, was a Spanish Basque officer who led the Carlist faction as Captain general of the Army during the First Carlist War. He was occasionally nicknamed the &quot;Wolf of the Amezcoas&quot;, making reference to his famous military victory in the region of Navarre.

Zumalacárregui is popularly credited as the inventor of the Spanish omelette (or &quot;tortilla de patatas&quot;), which he may have elaborated during the Siege of Bilbao.

==From the Peninsula War to Ferdinand VII==
Zumalacárregui was born in Ormaiztegi in Gipuzkoa, a Basque province in Spain, on 29 December 1788. His father, Francisco Antonio de Zumalacárregui Muxica, was a lawyer who possessed some property, and the son was articled to a solicitor. His mother was Maria Ana Imaz Altolaguirre.

When the Peninsular War began with a French invasion of Spain in 1808 he enlisted in Zaragoza. He served in the 1808 First Siege of Zaragoza, at the Battle of Tudela, and during the 1809 Second Siege of Zaragoza until he was taken prisoner in a sortie. He succeeded in escaping and in reaching his family in Navarre. For a short time he served with Gaspar de Jáuregui, another Gipuzkoan known as &quot;The Shepherd&quot; (), one of the guerrilla leaders, who later became a general in the regular army against which Zumalacarregui fought.

But Zumalacárregui, who was noted for his grave and silent disposition and his strong religious principles, disliked the disorderly life of the guerrillas, and when regular forces were organized in the north he entered the 1st battalion of Gipuzkoa as an officer. During the remainder of the war he served in the regular army. His brother Miguel Antonio de Zumalacárregui was in Cádiz at the time the Cortes passed the Constitution of 1812, going on to be elected chief deputy of Gipuzkoa. Tomas was then sent with dispatches to the Regency at Cádiz, and received his commission as captain. In that rank he was present at the Battle of San Marcial in August 1813. After the restoration of Ferdinand VII he continued in the army, and is said to have made a careful study of the theory of war.

== During Ferdinand VII&#x27;s rule ==

Zumalacárregui had no sympathy with the liberal principles which were spreading in Spain, and became noted as what was called a &quot;servil&quot; or strong Royalist. He attracted no attention at headquarters, and was still a captain when the Revolution of 1820 broke out and the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot; was established. His brother officers, whose leanings were liberal, denounced him to the revolutionary government, and asked that he might be removed. The recommendation was not acted on, but Zumalacárregui knew of it, and laid up the offence in his mind. Finding that he was suspected (probably with truth) of an intention to bring the soldiers over to the royalist side, he escaped to France.

In 1823 he returned as an officer in one of the royalist regiments which had been organized on French soil by the consent of the government. He was now known as a thoroughly trustworthy servant of the royalty, but he was too proud to be a courtier. For some years he was employed in bringing regiments which the government distrusted to order. He became lieutenant-colonel in 1825 and colonel in 1829. In 1832 he was named military governor of Ferrol, Galicia. Before King Ferdinand VII died in 1833, Zumalacárregui was marked out as a natural supporter of the traditionalist party, which favoured the king&#x27;s brother, Infante Carlos, Count of Molina.

== The Carlist War ==
The proclamation of the king&#x27;s daughter Isabel as heiress was almost the occasion of an armed conflict between him and the naval authorities at Ferrol, who were partisans of the liberal and so-called &quot;constitutional&quot; cause. He was put on half pay by the new authorities and ordered to live under police observation at Pamplona in Navarre.

When the Carlist uprising began on the death of Ferdinand VII, he is said to have held back because he knew that the first leaders would be politicians and talkers. He did not take the field until the Carlist cause appeared to be at a very low ebb, and until he had received a commission from Don Carlos as Commander-in-Chief in Navarre.

He escaped Pamplona on the night of 29 October 1833 and took the command next day in the Araquil Valley. At that time the Carlist forces comprised no more than a few hundred ill-armed and dispirited &quot;guerrilleros&quot;; in a few months Zumalacárregui had organized them into a regular army. The difficulty he found in obtaining supplies was enormous, for the coast towns and notably Bilbao supported the &quot;Cristino&quot; (liberal) cause. It was mainly by seizing equipment from the government troops that he armed his forces. He gradually obtained full possession of the Southern Basque Country, outside of the fortresses, which he had not the means to besiege. He organized the forces known as &quot;aduaneros&quot; and the &quot;Guías de Navarra&quot;. His chief bodyguard, and later biographer, was Charles Frederick Henningsen.

Whether as a guerrilla leader, or as a general conducting regular war in the mountains, he proved unconquerable. He won the battles of Alsasua, Alegría de Álava, and Venta de Echavarri, for example, by employing guerrilla tactics.

By July 1834 he had made it safe for Don Carlos to join his headquarters. Zumalacárregui was by then strongly envied by the courtiers that surrounded the pretender, as well as by other military officers. Besides, Don Carlos was a somewhat naïve and easily suggestible man, and Zumalacárregui had therefore to drag behind him the whole weight of the distrust and intrigues of the court. Yet by the beginning of June 1835 he had made the Carlist cause triumphant to the north of the Ebro, and had formed an army of more than 30,000 men, of much better quality than the constitutional forces. He won the battle of Artaza (20–22 April 1835).
If Zumalacárregui had been allowed to follow his own plans, which were to concentrate his forces and march on Madrid, firstly seizing Logroño (La Rioja, Castile), he might well have put Don Carlos in possession of the capital. But the court was eager to obtain command of a seaport, because they thought this would facilitate the official recognition of Don Carlos as the legitimate heir to the Spanish Throne by other European courts. Thus, Zumalacárregui was ordered to besiege Bilbao. He obeyed reluctantly, and on 14 June 1835 was wounded in the calf by a musket shot, near the Basilica of Begoña. The wound was trifling and would probably have been cured with ease, but Zumalacárregui decided to employ a famous Gipuzkoan quack called &quot;Petriquillo&quot;, whom he trusted. Petriquillo proceeded to remove the bullet from Zumalacárregui&#x27;s leg, provoking a great loss of blood and probably an infection. Don Carlos had insisted on sending his own physicians, but they hesitated about the best prognosis to follow, losing precious time and failing to stop Petriquillo from trying his &quot;procedure&quot; (he acted when they were not present) and in their hands the general died on 24 June 1835, not without suspicion of poison and after Petriquillo had hastily left the scene.

Zumalacárregui is often popularly credited as the inventor of Spanish omelette (or &quot;tortilla de patatas&quot;), which he allegedly elaborated during the Siege of Bilbao, as a simple, fast and nutritious dish with which to satisfy the hardships of the Carlist Army. In search of nourishment, he came across a poor housewife who had nothing other than eggs, onion and potatoes. When he mixed it up, he liked the result and fed it to his starving troops. It is said that after this, the tortilla became incredibly popular throughout the rest of the First Carlist War, and is now one of the most renowned dishes in the world.

Zumalacárregui was a fine type of the old royalist and religious principles of his people. The Carlist forces under his command were repeatedly refused quarter by the government&#x27;s forces (which for years didn&#x27;t recognize them as legitimate combatants). The increasing ferocity of the war, substantiated in routine executions of Carlist soldiers and officers, convinced him of the necessity of a similar retaliation against the liberal forces. Zumalacárregui, however, would later sign the Lord Eliot Convention, shortly before his own death, which aimed to end the indiscriminate executions by firing squad of prisoners on both sides.

== Popularity ==

The most trustworthy account of Zumalacarregui&#x27;s Carlist campaign can be found in Juan Antonio de Zaratiegui&#x27;s &quot;Vida y hechos de Don Tomás de Zumalacárregui&quot;. Zaratiegui was his personal assistant, secretary and friend throughout the war, and also himself an important carlist military officer. Accounts of Zumalacárregui include &quot;The Most Striking Events of a Twelvemonth Campaign with Zumalacarregui in Navarre and the Basque Provinces&quot;, by Charles Frederick Henningsen (London, 1836) as well as a chapbook called &quot;Vida política y militar de Don Tomás Zumalacárregui&quot;. Of Zumalacárregui, Henningsen writes:
In 2017 the People&#x27;s Party of the Basque Country called for a street named after him to be renamed.

==Zumalacárregui in the &quot;Episodios nacionales&quot;==
Zumalacárregui is the main character of an eponymous &quot;Episodio nacional&quot;, by Benito Pérez Galdós. He is portrayed as an intelligent man and an excellent strategist who fights for what he believes in.

<text>Ignacio Zuloaga y Zabaleta (July 26, 1870October 31, 1945) was a Spanish painter, born in Eibar, Guipuzcoa, near the monastery of Loyola.

==Family==
He was the son of metalworker and damascener Plácido Zuloaga and grandson of the organizer and director of the royal armoury (Don Eusebio) in Madrid. His uncle was Daniel Zuloaga. His great-grandfather who was also the royal armourer was a friend and contemporary of Goya.
==Biography==
In his youth, he drew and worked in the armourer&#x27;s workshop of his father, Plácido. His father&#x27;s craftmanship, a familial trade, was highly respected throughout Europe, but he intended his son for either commerce, engineering, or architecture, but during a short trip to Rome with his father, he decided to become a painter. His first painting was exhibited in Paris in 1890.

At the age of 18 he moved to Paris, settling in Montmartre, to find work and training as a painter. He was nearly destitute, and lived off some meager contributions by his mother and the benevolence of fellow Spaniards, including Paco Durrio, Pablo Uranga, and Santiago Rusiñol. 

After only six months&#x27; work he completed his first picture, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1890. Continuing his studies in Paris, where he lived for five years, he was in contact with post-impressionists such as Ramon Casas, Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec, yet his tendencies were always to a thematic that was more ethnic in scope.

He attempted to gain success during a sojourn in London; but lackluster patronage led him to return to Spain, settling in Seville, then Segovia, and developed a style based on a realist Spanish tradition, recalling Velázquez and Murillo in their earthy colouring and genre themes. He painted portraits of attired bullfighters and flamenco dancers; or portraits of family members and friends in such attire. He also painted village dwarves (&quot;El enano Gregorio el Botero&quot;; Hermitage, St Petersburg, Russia) and beggars, often as stark figures in a dreary landscape with a traditional landscape or town in the background. He also painted some village-scape scenes. He favored earth or muted tones, including maroon, black, and grey, with the exception of colorful folk attire or the bright red cassock in some paintings.

Zuloaga married Valentine Dethomas on May 18, 1899. Valentine&#x27;s brother, Maxime Dethomas, was a fellow student of Zuloaga in Paris.

Zuloaga and his patrons felt slighted in 1900, when his painting &quot;Before the Bull-fight&quot; was rejected for inclusion into the Spanish representation at the Universal Exposition in Brussels. In 1899, one of his paintings exhibited in Paris had been purchased for the Luxembourg Palace. However, he did exhibit the painting at the Exposition of the Libre Esthetique in Brussels, and did see it acquired by the Modern Gallery in Brussels. He was accepted into the Venice Biennale in 1901 and 1903, and displayed 34 canvases at the Barcelona International exposition of 1907.

Among the more prominently displayed works is his &quot;Cristo de la Sangre&quot; (Christ of the Blood) or &quot;Hermandad del Cristo Crucificado&quot; (Brotherhood of the Crucified Christ), on display at the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid. He also painted a similarly painting of individuals undergoing a traditional mortification of the flesh and a bleeding crucified Christ called &quot;The Flagellants&quot; (1900). These paintings were praised by Unamuno in his book on &quot;De Arte Pictorico&quot; as being honest representation of Spain: a Spain &quot;religious and tragic, a black Spain&quot;. rooted in the particularly Spanish Catholic fascination with mutilating penance. 

Brinton in his review of an exposition in America in 1909, he states that: It is this racy and picturesque life which Zuloaga seeks above all else to place on record, and it is these popular types unspoiled by ruthless modernism which he pursues into the farthest corners of his native land. In this zealous quest of congenial models he hesitates at nothing. He will haunt for hours a fiesta on the outskirts of some provincial town, or hasten away to the mountains, passing months at a time with smugglers and muleteers, with the superstitious fanatics of Anso in the extreme north of Aragon or with the monkish cutthroats of Las Baluecas, a little village on the southern boundary line of Salamanca.

Gil says that the faces of the old folk he paints are severe, roughly mystical, beset by painful thoughts, shadowed by the remembrance of the glory they once were, they have sad souls, moaning under the weight of an ideal of centuries, they are not individual representations, but the synthesis of the sadness of the Spanish Soul.

One of the American collections to feature Zuloaga&#x27;s work is the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Evergreen Museum &amp; Library, Baltimore, Maryland. Officially owned by the Evergreen House Foundation, an independent entity started by Zuloaga&#x27;s great friend, philanthropist Alice Warder Garrett (1877–1952), Evergreen&#x27;s works include full-length portraits of Mrs. Garrett (1915; 1928); a seated portrait of Ambassador John Work Garrett (1872–1942); a Spanish landscape; a painting based on the opera &quot;Goyescas&quot;; and a landscape of Calatayud (Spain).

An Iberia airline Airbus A340-642 aircraft, registration EC-IZY, is named after him.

==Zuloaga during and after the Spanish Civil War==

Zuloaga was committed to the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War and the Spanish State of the &quot;caudillo&quot; Franco, whose portrait he painted in 1940. During the war, Zuloaga honored the defenders of the &quot;Siege of the Alcázar&quot; in 1936, when the building&#x27;s Nationalist defenders refused to surrender despite the building being in flames. This siege, and other events such as the death of General Moscardo&#x27;s son, served as a rallying cry for the Nationalist forces. In January 1939, this painting was hung in adjacent room displaying Picasso&#x27;s modernist painting of Guernica during an exhibition of Spanish art in London. The nationalist content of his depiction of the Alcazar was allied to Zuloaga&#x27;s celebration of folk traditions. Stylistically, the directness of the &quot;Siege&quot; painting also avoids modernity&#x27;s challenge to realistic depictions: Fascism was not endeared to complex symbolism such as found in works such as &quot;Guernica&quot;.

In an April 1939 letter to his patron, Mrs Garret, Zuloaga stated:Thanks to God, and to Franco, at last the war is won and over! And over, despite the goodwill of those so-called democratic countries – what a farce, what shame, when those countries learn the truth of this drama! We all will work with all our strength to rebuild a new Spain (free, great and unified) to Spanishize Spain, and get rid of all outside influences, so that we can keep our great nature. That’s my dream in art. I hate fads (which are destructive to racial characteristics) One must (for good or bad) be oneself, and not ape the style of anyone else. I will dedicate the years that are left to me to that end. What shame there will be in the future, for those countries who inflicted crime, savage vandalism, which reigned within the soviet clan in Spain!

He was later to claim that he was aghast, as a francophile, when Hitler defeated France in 1940. After his death in 1945, he appeared on Spain&#x27;s 500 peseta banknote emitted by Francoist Spain in its 1954 series, with a depiction of Toledo on the back.

Brinton in his 1909 essay was prescient of Zuloaga&#x27;s future enamourment with Falangism: He personifies in extreme form the spirit of autocracy in art, the principle of absolutism so typical of his race and country. You will meet in these bold, affirmative canvases no hint of cowardice or compromise. The work is defiant, almost despotic. It does not strive to enlist sympathy nor does it fear to be frankly antipathetic...the tones not infrequently acidulous, and the surfaces sometimes hard and metallic. Reactionary if you will...

<text>Hudson Bay, sometimes called Hudson&#x27;s Bay (usually historically), is a large body of saltwater in northeastern Canada with a surface area of . It is located north of Ontario, west of Quebec, northeast of Manitoba, and southeast of Nunavut, but politically entirely part of Nunavut. It is an inland marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. The Hudson Strait provides a connection between the Labrador Sea and the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast, while the Foxe Channel connects Hudson Bay with the Arctic Ocean in the north. The Hudson Bay drainage basin drains a very large area, about , that includes parts of southeastern Nunavut, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, all of Manitoba, and parts of the U.S. states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana. Hudson Bay&#x27;s southern arm is called James Bay.

The Eastern Cree name for Hudson and James Bay is &#x27; (southern dialect) or &#x27; (northern dialect), meaning muddy or brackish water. Lake Winnipeg is similarly named by the local Cree, as is the location for the city of Winnipeg.

==Description==

The bay is named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, and after whom the river that he explored in 1609 is also named. Hudson Bay encompasses , making it the second-largest water body using the term &quot;bay&quot; in the world (after the Bay of Bengal). The bay is relatively shallow and is considered an epicontinental sea, with an average depth of about (compared to in the Bay of Bengal). It is about long and wide. On the east it is connected with the Arctic Ocean (Davis Strait) by Hudson Strait; on the north, with the Arctic Ocean by Foxe Basin (which is not considered part of the bay), and Fury and Hecla Strait.

Hudson Bay is often considered part of the Arctic Ocean: the International Hydrographic Organization, in its 2002 working draft of &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot;, defined Hudson Bay, with its outlet extending from 62.5 to 66.5 degrees north (just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle) as being part of the Arctic Ocean, specifically &quot;Arctic Ocean Subdivision 9.11&quot;. Other authorities include it in the Atlantic, in part because of its greater water budget connection with that ocean.

==History==

The search for a western route to Cathay and the East Indies, which had been actively pursued since the days of Christopher Columbus and John Cabot, in the latter part of the 15th century, directly resulted in the first sighting of Hudson Bay by Europeans. English explorers and colonists named Hudson Bay after Sir Henry Hudson who explored the bay beginning 2 August 1610, on his ship &quot;Discovery&quot;. On his fourth voyage to North America, Hudson worked his way around Greenland&#x27;s west coast and into the bay, mapping much of its eastern coast. &quot;Discovery&quot; became trapped in the ice over the winter, and the crew survived onshore at the southern tip of James Bay. In the spring, as the ice receded, Henry Hudson expressed a desire to continue exploring the uncharted region. However, on 22 June 1611, the crew mutinied. They left Hudson and others adrift in a small boat. The fate of Hudson and the other men stranded with him remains undetermined. Nevertheless, there is little evidence in historical documents to suggest that they persisted for a long time thereafter. In May 1612, Sir Thomas Button sailed from England with two ships to look for Henry Hudson, and to continue the search for the Northwest Passage to Asia.

In 1668, &quot;Nonsuch&quot; reached the bay and traded for beaver pelts, leading to the creation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), which still bears the historic name. The HBC negotiated a trading monopoly from the English Crown for the Hudson Bay watershed, called Rupert&#x27;s Land. In 1670, the English Crown granted a charter to facilitate fur trading within the Hudson Bay drainage basin. France contested this grant by sending several military expeditions to the region, but abandoned its claim in the Treaty of Utrecht (April 1713).

The Treaty of Utrecht, signed on 11 April 1713, marked a significant agreement between Britain and France. The treaty was negotiated in Utrecht, Netherlands, and marked a crucial stage in the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Its provisions had a significant impact in shaping the postwar landscape and establishing a new order in both Europe and North America. French concessions in North America as outlined in the Treaty of Utrecht included: Hudson Bay region, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland.

During this period, the HBC built several factories (forts and trading posts) along the coast at the mouth of the major rivers (such as Fort Severn; York Factory, Churchill; and the Prince of Wales Fort). The strategic locations were bases for inland exploration. More importantly, they were trading posts with Indigenous peoples who came to them with furs from their trapping season. The HBC shipped the furs to Europe and continued to use some of these posts well into the 20th century.

The HBC&#x27;s trade monopoly was abolished in 1870, by a British Order in Council called the Deed of Surrender, ceded Rupert&#x27;s Land to Canada, an area of approximately , as part of the Northwest Territories. In 1912, the western shore south of 60° and, following the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912, all the eastern shore were transferred to the adjacent provinces, but the bay and offshore islands remained part of the Northwest Territories. Starting in 1913, the bay was extensively charted by the Canadian government&#x27;s to develop it for navigation. This mapping progress led to the establishment of Churchill, Manitoba, as a deep-sea port for wheat exports in 1929, after unsuccessful attempts at Port Nelson.

The Port of Churchill was an important shipping link for trade with Europe and Russia until its closure in 2016 by owner OmniTRAX. The port and the Hudson Bay Railway were then sold to the Arctic Gateway Group—a consortium of First Nations, local governments, and corporate investors—in 2018.

On 9 July 2019, ships resupplying Arctic communities began stopping at the port for additional cargo, and the port began shipping grain again on 7 September 2019.

==Geography and climate==
===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the northern limit of Hudson Bay as follows:
===Climate===

Northern Hudson Bay has a polar climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;) being one of the few places in the world where this type of climate is found south of 60 °N, going farther south towards Quebec, where Inukjuak is still dominated by the tundra. From Arviat, Nunavut, to the west to the south and southeast prevails the subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;). This is because in the central summer months, heat waves can advance from the hot land and make the weather milder, with the result that the average temperature surpasses . The bay receives water from various surrounding rivers and currents originating from the Foxe Basin in the north, resulting in a counterclockwise overall flow. At the extreme southern tip of the extension known as James Bay arises a humid continental climate with a longer and generally hotter summer. (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in almost the entire bay is around or below. In the extreme northeast, winter temperatures average as low as .

The Hudson Bay region has very low year-round average temperatures. The average annual temperature for Churchill at 59°N is and Inukjuak, facing cool westerlies in summer at 58°N, an even colder . By comparison, Magadan, in a comparable position at 59°N on the Eurasian landmass in the Russian Far East and with a similar subarctic climate, has an annual average of . Vis-à-vis geographically closer Europe, contrasts stand much more extreme. Arkhangelsk at 64°N in northwestern Russia has an average of , while the mild continental coastline of Stockholm at 59°N on the shore of an analogous large hyposaline marine inlet – the Baltic Sea – has an annual average of .

Water temperature peaks at on the western side of the bay in late summer. It is largely frozen over from mid-December to mid-June, when it usually clears from its eastern end westwards and southwards. A steady increase in regional temperatures over the last 100 years has led to decreases in the extent of the sea ice in Hudson Bay by 19.5% per decade. As well as a lengthening of the ice-free period, which was as short as four months in the late 17th century.

The polar climate of Hudson Bay means it is home for a variety of polar climate animals, in the Western Hudson Bay (WHB) beluga whale population is the most significant known group in the Canadian Arctic, estimated to consist of approximately 54,473 individuals.


===Waters===
Hudson Bay has a lower average salinity level than that of ocean water. The main causes are the low rate of evaporation (the bay is ice-covered for much of the year), the large volume of terrestrial runoff entering the bay (about annually, the Hudson Bay watershed covering much of Canada, many rivers and streams discharging into the bay), and the limited connection with the Atlantic Ocean and its higher salinity. Sea ice is about three times the annual river flow into the bay, and its annual freezing and thawing significantly alters the salinity of the surface layer. Although its exact effects are not fully understood currently, the cyclonic storms in the bay are responsible for synoptic variability of salinity along the coast.

One consequence of the lower salinity of the bay is that the freezing point of the water is higher than in the rest of the world&#x27;s oceans, thus decreasing the time that the bay remains ice-free. The increase of river inflows during the winter has decreased the season of sea ice by more than one month since the 1960s.

The lower salinity of the bay also has effects on the distribution and prevalence of common marine life such as micro algae. Research has shown that the lower salinity of the Hudson Bay limits the growth of micro algae, which causes a notable change in biomass along the bay&#x27;s salinity gradient.

===Shores===
The western shores of the bay are a lowland known as the Hudson Bay Lowlands, covering , and are Canada&#x27;s largest continuous peatland. Much of the landform has been shaped by the actions of glaciers and the shrinkage of the bay over long periods of time. The coastal area, located in a region characterized by permanently frozen layers of soil, known as permafrost, is a low-lying wetland that receives water from lakes and fast-flowing rivers. Signs of numerous former beach fronts can be seen far inland from the current shore. A large portion of the lowlands in the province of Ontario is part of the Polar Bear Provincial Park, and a similar portion of the lowlands in Manitoba is contained in Wapusk National Park, the latter location being a significant maternity denning area for polar bears.

In contrast, most of the eastern shores (the Quebec portion) form the western edge of the Canadian Shield in Quebec. The area is rocky and hilly. Its vegetation is typically boreal forest.The northern shores are tundra.

Measured by shoreline, Hudson Bay is the largest bay in the world (the largest in area being the Bay of Bengal).

The distinctive arcuate segment on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay is referred to as the Nastapoka arc.

===Islands===
There are many islands in Hudson Bay, mostly near the eastern coast. All the islands, including those in James Bay, are part of Nunavut and lie in the Arctic Archipelago. Several are disputed by the Cree. One group of islands is the Belcher Islands. The Belcher Islands are located in the centre of the Nastapoka arc. Another group includes the Ottawa Islands which are located near the eastern shore of the Hudson Bay.

==Geology==
Hudson Bay occupies a large structural basin, known as the Hudson Bay basin, that lies within the Canadian Shield. The collection and interpretation of outcrop, seismic and drill hole data for exploration for oil and gas reservoirs within the Hudson Bay basin found that it is filled by, at most, of Ordovician to Devonian limestone, dolomite, evaporites, black shales, and various clastic sedimentary rocks that overlie less than of Cambrian strata that consist of quartz sandstones and conglomerates, overlain by sandy and stromatolitic dolomites. In addition, a minor amount of terrestrial fluvial sands and gravels of the Cretaceous period are preserved in the fill of a prominent ring-like depression about across created by the dissolution of Silurian evaporites during the Cretaceous period.

From the large quantity of published geologic data that has been collected as the result of hydrocarbon exploration, academic research, and related geologic mapping, a detailed history of the Hudson Bay basin has been reconstructed. During the majority of the Cambrian Period, this basin did not exist. Rather, this part of the Canadian Shield area was still topographically high and emergent. It was only during the later part of the Cambrian that the rising sea level of the Sauk marine transgression slowly submerged it. During the Ordovician, this part of the Canadian Shield continued to be submerged by rising sea levels except for a brief middle Ordovician marine regression. Only starting in the Late Ordovician and continuing into the Silurian did the gradual regional subsidence of this part of the Canadian Shield form the Hudson Bay basin. The formation of this basin resulted in the accumulation of black bituminous oil shale and evaporite deposits within its centre, thick basin-margin limestone and dolomite, and the development of extensive reefs that ringed the basin margins that were tectonically uplifted as the basin subsided. During Middle Silurian times, subsidence ceased and this basin was uplifted. It generated an emergent arch, on which reefs grew, that divided the basin into eastern and western sub-basins. During the Devonian Period, this basin filled with terrestrial red beds that interfinger with marine limestone and dolomites. Before deposition was terminated by marine regression, Upper Devonian black bituminous shale accumulated in the south-east of the basin.

The remaining history of the Hudson Bay basin is largely unknown as a major unconformity separates Upper Devonian strata from glacial deposits of the Pleistocene. Except for poorly known terrestrial Cretaceous fluvial sands and gravels that are preserved as the fills of a ring of subsided strata around the centre of this basin, strata representing this period of time are absent from the Hudson Bay basin and the surrounding Canadian Shield.

The Precambrian Shield underlying Hudson Bay and in which Hudson Bay basin formed is composed of two Archean proto-continents, the Western Churchill and Superior cratons. These cratons are separated by a tectonic collage that forms a suture zone between these cratons and the Trans-Hudson Orogen. The Western Churchill and Superior cratons collided at about 1.9–1.8 Ga in the Trans-Hudson orogeny. Because of the irregular shapes of the colliding cratons, this collision trapped between them large fragments of juvenile crust, a sizable microcontinent, and island arc terranes, beneath what is now the centre of modern Hudson Bay as part of the Trans-Hudson Orogen. The Belcher Islands are the eroded surface of the Belcher Fold Belt, which formed as a result of the tectonic compression and folding of sediments that accumulated along the margin of the Superior Craton before its collision with the Western Churchill Craton.

=== Free-air gravity anomaly ===
Hudson Bay and the associated structural basin lie within the centre of a large free-air gravity anomaly that lies within the Canadian Shield. The similarity in areal extent of the free-air gravity anomaly with the perimeter of the former Laurentide ice sheet that covered this part of Laurentia led to a long-held conclusion that this perturbation in the Earth&#x27;s gravity reflected still ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment to the melting and disappearance of this ice sheet. Data collected over Canada by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission allowed geophysicists to isolate the gravity signal associated with glacial isostatic adjustment from longer–time scale process of mantle convection occurring beneath the Canadian Shield. Based upon this data, geophysicists and other Earth scientists concluded that the Laurentide Ice Sheet was composed of two large domes to the west and east of Hudson Bay. Modelling glacial isostatic adjustment using the GRACE data, they concluded that ≈25 to ≈45% of the observed free-air gravity anomaly was due to ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment, and the remainder likely represents longer time-scale effects of mantle convection.

===Southeastern semicircle===
Earth scientists have disagreed about what created the semicircular feature known as the Nastapoka arc that forms a section of the shoreline of southeastern Hudson Bay. The Nastapoka arc forms a 155 degree curve and appears to be very circular. Noting the paucity of impact structures on Earth in relation to the Moon and Mars, Carlyle S. Beals proposed that it is possibly part of a Precambrian extraterrestrial impact structure that is comparable in size to the Mare Crisium on the Moon. In the same volume, John Tuzo Wilson commented on Beals&#x27; interpretation and alternately proposed that the Nastapoka arc may have formed as part of an extensive Precambrian continental collisional orogen, linked to the closure of an ancient ocean basin. The current general consensus is that it is an arcuate boundary of tectonic origin between the Belcher Fold Belt and undeformed basement of the Superior Craton created during the Trans-Hudson orogeny. This is because no credible evidence for such an impact structure has been found by regional magnetic, Bouguer gravity, or other geologic studies. However, other Earth scientists have proposed that the evidence of an Archean impact might have been masked by deformation accompanying the later formation of the Trans-Hudson orogen and regard an impact origin as a plausible possibility.

==Economy==
===Arctic Bridge===
The longer periods of ice-free navigation and the reduction of Arctic Ocean ice coverage have led to Russian and Canadian interest in the potential for commercial trade routes across the Arctic and into Hudson Bay. The so-called Arctic Bridge would link Churchill, Manitoba, and the Russian port of Murmansk. The increase in ships traversing the proposed Arctic Bridge will result in an increase in accidents that will release pollutants into the environment, due to the freezing of the water in the winter cleanup will be harder and with a shorter window of time.

=== Port ===

The biggest port in the Hudson bay is the city of Churchill, which lies on the river with the same name, Churchill River. The Port of Churchill is a privately owned port on Hudson Bay in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Routes from the port connect to the North Atlantic through the Hudson Strait. As of 2008, the port had four deep-sea berths capable of handling Panamax-size vessels for the loading and unloading of grain, bulk commodities, general cargo, and tanker vessels. The port is connected to the Hudson Bay Railway, which shares the same parent company, and cargo connections are made with the Canadian National Railway system at HBR&#x27;s southern terminus in The Pas. It is the only port of its size and scope in Canada that does not connect directly to the country&#x27;s road system; all goods shipped overland to and from the port must travel by rail.

The port was originally owned by the Government of Canada but was sold in 1997 to the American company OmniTRAX to run privately. In December 2015, OmniTRAX announced it was negotiating a sale of the port, and the associated Hudson Bay Railway, to a group of First Nations based in northern Manitoba. With no sale finalized by July 2016, OmniTRAX shut down the port and the major railroad freight operations in August 2016. The railway continued to carry cargo to supply the town of Churchill itself until the line was damaged by flooding on 23 May 2017. The Port and the Hudson Bay Railway were sold to Arctic Gateway Group—a consortium of First Nations, local governments, and corporate investors—in 2018. On 9 July 2019, ships resupplying Arctic communities began stopping at the port for additional cargo, and the port began shipping grain again on 7 September 2019.

==Coastal communities==
The coast of Hudson Bay is extremely sparsely populated; there are only about a dozen communities. Some of these were founded as trading posts in the 17th and 18th centuries by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, making them some of the oldest settlements in Western Canada. With the closure of the HBC posts and stores, although many are now run by The North West Company, in the second half of the 20th century, many coastal villages are now almost exclusively populated by Cree and Inuit. Two main historic sites along the coast were York Factory and Prince of Wales Fort.

Communities along the Hudson Bay coast or on islands in the bay are (all populations are as of 2016):

* Nunavut
** Arviat, population 2,657
** Chesterfield Inlet, population 437
** Coral Harbour, population 891
** Rankin Inlet, population 2,842
** Sanikiluaq, population 882
** Whale Cove, population 435
* Manitoba
** Churchill, population 899
* Ontario
** Fort Severn First Nation, population 361
* Quebec
** Akulivik, population 633
** Inukjuak, population 1,757
** Kuujjuarapik, population 686
** Puvirnituq, population 1,779
** Umiujaq, population 442
** Whapmagoostui, population 984

===Military development===
The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built forts as fur trade strongholds against the French or other possible invaders. One example is York Factory with angled walls to help defend the fort. In the 1950s, during the Cold War, a few sites along the coast became part of the Mid-Canada Line, watching for a potential Soviet bomber attack over the North Pole. The only Arctic deep-water port in Canada is the Port of Churchill, located at Churchill, Manitoba.

<doc id="58637" wikidata="Q207092" url="?curid=58637" title="Erysipelas">
<text>Erysipelas () is a relatively common bacterial infection of the superficial layer of the skin (upper dermis), extending to the superficial lymphatic vessels within the skin, characterized by a raised, well-defined, tender, bright red rash, typically on the face or legs, but which can occur anywhere on the skin. It is a form of cellulitis and is potentially serious.

Erysipelas is usually caused by the bacterium &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, also known as &quot;group A β-hemolytic streptococci&quot;, which enters the body through a break in the skin, such as a scratch or an insect bite. It is more superficial than cellulitis and is typically more raised and demarcated. The term comes from the Greek ἐρυσίπελας (&quot;erysípelas&quot;), meaning red skin.

In animals erysipelas is a disease caused by infection with the bacterium &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot;. In animals it is called Diamond Skin Disease and occurs especially in pigs. Heart valves and skin are affected. &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; can also infect humans but in that case the infection is known as erysipeloid and is an occupational skin disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms often occur suddenly. Affected individuals may develop a fever, shivering, chills, fatigue, headaches and vomiting and be generally unwell within 48 hours of the initial infection. The red plaque enlarges rapidly and has a sharply demarcated, raised edge. It may appear swollen, feel firm, warm and tender to touch and have a consistency similar to orange peel. Pain may be extreme.

More severe infections can result in vesicles (pox or insect bite-like marks), blisters, and petechiae (small purple or red spots), with possible skin necrosis (death). Lymph nodes may be swollen and lymphedema may occur. Occasionally a red streak extending to the lymph node can be seen.

The infection may occur on any part of the skin, including the face, arms, fingers, legs and toes; it tends to favour the extremities. The umbilical stump and sites of lymphoedema are also common sites affected.

Fat tissue and facial areas, typically around the eyes, ears and cheeks, are most susceptible to infection. Repeated infection of the extremities can lead to chronic swelling (lymphoedema).

==Cause==

Most cases of erysipelas are due to &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, also known as &quot;group A β-hemolytic streptococci&quot;, less commonly to group C or G streptococci and rarely to &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Newborns may contract erysipelas due to &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;, also known as &quot;group B streptococcus&quot; or GBS.

The infecting bacteria can enter the skin through minor trauma, human, insect or animal bites, surgical incisions, ulcers, burns and abrasions. There may be underlying eczema or athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis), and it can originate from streptococci bacteria in the subject&#x27;s own nasal passages or ear.

The rash is due to an exotoxin, not the &quot;Streptococcus&quot; bacteria, and is found in areas where no symptoms are present, e.g. the infection may be in the nasopharynx, but the rash is found usually on the epidermis and superficial lymphatics.

==Diagnosis==
Erysipelas is usually diagnosed by the clinician looking at the characteristic well-demarcated rash following a history of injury or recognition of one of the risk factors.

Tests, if performed, may show a high white cell count, raised CRP or positive blood culture identifying the organism. Skin cultures are often negative.

Erysipelas must be differentiated from herpes zoster, angioedema, contact dermatitis, erythema chronicum migrans of early Lyme disease, gout, septic arthritis, septic bursitis, vasculitis, allergic reaction to an insect bite, acute drug reaction, deep vein thrombosis and diffuse inflammatory carcinoma of the breast.

===Differentiating from cellulitis===
Erysipelas can be distinguished from cellulitis by two particular features: its raised advancing edge and its sharp borders. The redness in cellulitis is not raised and its border is relatively indistinct. Bright redness of erysipelas has been described as a third differentiating feature.

Erysipelas does not affect subcutaneous tissue. It does not release pus, only serum or serous fluid. Subcutaneous edema may lead the physician to misdiagnose it as cellulitis.

==Treatment==
Treatment is with antibiotics; (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefalexin, or cloxacillin) taken by mouth for five days; though sometimes longer. 

Because of the risk of reinfection, prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used after resolution of the initial condition.

==Prognosis==
The disease prognosis includes:
* Spread of infection to other areas of body can occur through the bloodstream (bacteremia), including septic arthritis. Glomerulonephritis can follow an episode of streptococcal erysipelas or other skin infection but not rheumatic fever.
* of infection: Erysipelas can recur in 18–30% of cases even after antibiotic treatment. A chronic state of recurrent erysipelas infections can occur with several predisposing factors, including alcoholism, diabetes and athlete&#x27;s foot. Another predisposing factor is chronic cutaneous edema, such as can in turn be caused by venous insufficiency or heart failure.
* Lymphatic damage
* Necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as ‘flesh-eating’ bacterial infection, is a potentially deadly exacerbation of the infection if it spreads to deeper tissue.

==Epidemiology==
There is currently no validated recent data on the worldwide incidence of erysipelas. From 2004 to 2005 UK hospitals reported 69,576 cases of cellulitis and 516 cases of erysipelas. One book stated that several studies have placed the prevalence rate between one and 250 in every 10,000 people. The development of antibiotics, as well as increased sanitation standards, has contributed to the decreased rate of incidence. Erysipelas caused systemic illness in up to 40% of cases reported by UK hospitals and 29% of people had recurrent episodes within three years. Anyone can be infected, although incidence rates are higher in infants and elderly. Several studies also reported a higher incidence rate in women. Four out of five cases occur on the legs, although historically the face was a more frequent site.

Risk factors for developing the disease include
* Arteriovenous fistula
* Chronic skin conditions such as psoriasis, athlete&#x27;s foot, and eczema
* Excising the saphenous vein
* Immune deficiency or compromise, such as
** Diabetes
** Alcoholism
** Obesity
** Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
* In newborns, exposure of the umbilical cord and vaccination site injury
* Issues in lymph or blood circulation
* Leg ulcers
* Lymphatic edema
* Lymphatic obstruction
* Lymphoedema
* Nasopharyngeal infection
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Pregnancy
* Previous episode(s) of erysipelas
* Toe web intertrigo
* Traumatic wounds
* Venous insufficiency or disease

=== Preventive measures ===
Individuals can take preventive steps to decrease their risk of catching the disease. Properly cleaning and covering wounds is important for people with an open wound. Effectively treating athlete&#x27;s foot or eczema if they were the cause of the initial infection will decrease the chance of the infection occurring again. People with diabetes should pay attention to maintaining good foot hygiene. It is also important to follow up with doctors to make sure the disease has not come back or spread. About one third of people who have had erysipelas will be infected again within three years. Rigorous antibiotics may be needed in the case of recurrent bacterial skin infections.

== Notable cases ==
* In Rodrigo Souza Leão&#x27;s autobiographical novel All Dogs are Blue, he says that his erysipelas is cured by the antibiotic Benzetacil (Benzathine benzylpenicillin).

==History==
It was historically known as St Anthony&#x27;s fire, with past treatments including muriated tincture of iron, a solution of Iron(III) chloride in alcohol.

<doc id="58638" wikidata="Q13587764" url="?curid=58638" title="Group A streptococcal infection">
<text>Group A streptococcal infections are a number of infections with &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, a group A streptococcus (GAS). &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is a species of beta-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria that is responsible for a wide range of infections that are mostly common and fairly mild. If the bacteria enters the bloodstream, the infection can become severe and life-threatening, and is called an invasive GAS (iGAS).

Infection of GAS may spread through direct contact with mucus or sores on the skin. GAS infections can cause over 500,000 deaths per year. Despite the emergence of antibiotics as a treatment for group A streptococcus, cases of iGAS are an increasing problem, particularly on the continent of Africa.

There are many other species of &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, including group B streptococcus &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, which cause other types of infections. Several virulence factors contribute to the pathogenesis of GAS, such as M protein, hemolysins, and extracellular enzymes.

==Types of infection==
Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus can cause infections of the throat and skin. These may vary from very mild conditions to severe, life-threatening diseases. Although it is not completely clear what causes different people to develop different diseases as a result of infection with the same pathogenic bacteria, it is suspected that host phenotypic and epigenetic factors are the source of such variation. Indeed, the many virulence factors of GAS can influence the epigenetics of the host. Furthermore, persons with suppressed or compromised immune systems may be more susceptible to certain diseases caused by GAS than other persons with intact immune systems. A 2019 study shows that GAS&#x27;s evasion of immune detection is facilitated by protein&quot; &quot;S, an extracellular and cell wall-associated protein that enables it to camouflage itself by binding fragments of lysed red blood cells.

Humans may also carry the GAS either on the skin or in the throat and show no symptoms. These carriers are less contagious than symptomatic carriers of the bacteria.

The non-invasive infections caused by GAS tend to be less severe and more common. They occur when the bacteria colonizes the throat area, where it recognizes epithelial cells. The two most prominent infections of GAS are both non-invasive: strep throat (pharyngitis) where it causes 15–30% of the childhood cases and 10% of adult cases, and impetigo. These may be effectively treated with antibiotics. Scarlet fever is also a non-invasive infection caused by GAS, although much less common.

The invasive infections caused by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus tend to be more severe and less common. These occurs when the bacterium is able to infect areas where bacteria are not usually found, such as blood and organs. The diseases that may be caused as a result of this include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), necrotizing fasciitis (NF), pneumonia, and bacteremia. 
In addition, infection of GAS may lead to further complications and health conditions, namely acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Most common:
* impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas – infections of the skin which can be complicated by necrotizing fasciitis – skin, fascia and muscle 
* strep throat AKA strep pharyngitis – pharynx

Less common:
* bacteremia can be associated with these infections, but is not typical. 
* septic arthritis – joints
* osteomyelitis – bones
* vaginitis – vagina (more common in pre-pubescent girls)
* meningitis* – meninges 
* sinusitis* – sinuses
* pneumonia* – pulmonary alveolus

(*Note that meningitis, sinusitis and pneumonia can all be caused by Group A Strep, but are &quot;much&quot; more commonly associated with &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and should not be confused.)

===Severe infections===
Some strains of group A streptococci (GAS) cause severe infection. Severe infections are usually invasive, meaning that the bacteria has entered parts of the body where bacteria are not usually found, such as the blood, lungs, deep muscle or fat tissue. Those at greatest risk include children with chickenpox; persons with suppressed immune systems; burn victims; elderly persons with cellulitis, diabetes, vascular disease, or cancer; and persons taking steroid treatments or chemotherapy. Intravenous drug users and homeless also are at high risk. GAS is an important cause of puerperal fever worldwide, causing serious infection and, if not promptly diagnosed and treated, death in newly delivered mothers. Severe GAS disease may also occur in healthy persons with no known risk factors.

All severe GAS infections may lead to shock, multisystem organ failure, and death. Early recognition and treatment are critical. Diagnostic tests include blood counts and urinalysis as well as cultures of blood or fluid from a wound site.

Severe Group A streptococcal infections often occur sporadically but can be spread by person-to-person contact. Close contacts of people affected by severe Group A streptococcal infections, defined as those having had prolonged household contact in the week before the onset of illness, may be at increased risk of infection. This increased risk may be due to a combination of shared genetic susceptibility within the family, close contact with carriers, and the virulence of the Group A streptococcal strain that is involved.

Public health policies internationally reflect differing views of how the close contacts of people affected by severe Group A streptococcal infections should be treated. Health Canada and the US CDC recommend close contacts see their doctor for full evaluation and may require antibiotics; current UK Health Protection Agency guidance is that, for a number of reasons, close contacts should not receive antibiotics unless they are symptomatic but that they should receive information and advice to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms. However, guidance is clearer in the case of mother-baby pairs: both mother and baby should be treated if either develops an invasive GAS infection within the first 28 days following birth (though some evidence suggests that this guidance is not routinely followed in the UK).

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis is by a swab of the affected area for laboratory testing. A Gram stain is performed to show Gram-positive cocci in chains. Then, the organism is cultured on blood agar. The rapid pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) test is commonly used, wherein a positive reaction confers a presumptive identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci if the appearance and clinical context is consistent. GBS gives a negative finding on the PYR test. There are also latex agglutination kits which can distinguish each of the main groups seen in clinical practice.

== Prevention ==
&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infections are best prevented through effective hand hygiene. No vaccines are currently available to protect against &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infection, although research has been conducted into the development of one. Difficulties in developing a vaccine include the wide variety of strains of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; present in the environment and the large amount of time and number of people that will be needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice is penicillin, and the duration of treatment is around 10 days. Antibiotic therapy (using injected penicillin) has been shown to reduce the risk of acute rheumatic fever. In individuals with a penicillin allergy, erythromycin, other macrolides, and cephalosporins have been shown to be effective treatments.

Treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or clindamycin is appropriate if deep oropharyngeal abscesses are present, in conjunction with aspiration or drainage. In cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, treatment consists of penicillin and clindamycin, given with intravenous immunoglobulin.

For toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, high-dose penicillin and clindamycin are used. Additionally, for necrotizing fasciitis, surgery is often needed to remove damaged tissue and stop the spread of the infection.

No instance of penicillin resistance has been reported to date, although since 1985, many reports of penicillin tolerance have been made. The reason for the failure of penicillin to treat &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is most commonly patient noncompliance, but in cases where patients have been compliant with their antibiotic regimen, and treatment failure still occurs, another course of antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins is common.

The 30-valent N-terminal M-protein-based vaccine as well as the M-protein vaccine (minimal epitope J8 vaccine) are two vaccines for GAS that are currently getting close or becoming clinical studies, however, other vaccines using conserved epitopes are progressing.

== Epidemiology ==
Cases of GAS are still present today, but were also evident before World War I. This was shown by a training camp located in Texas, where a harmful strain of pneumonia complicating measles was caused by a strain of Streptococcus. Existence of streptococci strains was additionally found in World War II. An epidemic of streptococcal infection in the United States Navy during this war indicated that this type of disease was able to exist and spread in formerly unexposed individuals by environments that serological types of group A streptococci preferred. In later years, a positive test result for the presence of group A streptococci was found in 32.1 percent of individuals after throat cultures were carried out in a 20-year-long (1953/1954–1973/1974) study performed in Nashville, Tennessee. Also, from 1972 to 1974, recurring GAS illness was observed with a prevalence of 19 percent in school-aged children as well as a prevalence rate of 25 percent in families. The severity of streptococcal infections has decreased over the years, and so has rheumatic fever (a sequelae of GAS) which is indicated by the change in numerous hospitals from containing wards allocated for the sole purpose of treating rheumatic fever to hardly seeing the disease at all. Environmental factors, such as less crowding and the increase of family living space, can account for the reduction in incidence and severity of group A streptococci. With more space for individuals to reside in, it provides the bacteria with less opportunities to spread from person to person. This is especially important considering an estimated 500,000 deaths worldwide all occurring after acute rheumatic fever, invasive infection, or subsequent heart disease can be accredited to GAS. This number is quite large, often leaving the health care system encumbered, since 91 percent of patients infected with invasive GAS need to be hospitalized with 8950–11,500 episodes and 1050–1850 deaths taking place each year. A later study that occurred from 2005 to 2012 found that there were 10,649–13,434 cases consequently resulting in 1136–1607 deaths per year.

== Complications ==

* Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
* Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS)
* Rheumatic fever
* Scarlet fever 
* Toxic shock syndrome

===Acute rheumatic fever===
Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a complication of respiratory infections caused by GAS. The M-protein generates antibodies that cross-react with autoantigens on interstitial connective tissue, in particular of the endocardium and synovium, that can lead to significant clinical illness.

Although common in developing countries, ARF is rare in the United States, possibly secondary to improved antibiotic treatment, with small isolated outbreaks reported only occasionally. It is most common among children between 5 and 15 years old and occurs 1–3 weeks after an untreated GAS pharyngitis, but caution is advised when interpreting the demographics of the contemporary picture of pediatric cases in the United States.

ARF is often clinically diagnosed based on Jones Criteria, which include: pancarditis, migratory polyarthritis of large joints, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and sydenham chorea (involuntary, purposeless movement). The most common clinical finding is a migratory arthritis involving multiple joints.

Other indicators of GAS infection such as a DNAase or ASO serology test must confirm the GAS infection. Other minor Jones Criteria are fever, elevated ESR and arthralgia. One of the most serious complications is pancarditis, or inflammation of all three heart tissues. A fibrinous pericarditis can develop with a classic friction rub that can be auscultated. This will give increasing pain upon reclining.

Further endocarditis can develop with aseptic vegetations along the valve closure lines, in particular the mitral valve. Chronic rheumatic heart disease mostly affects the mitral valve, which can become thickened with calcification of the leaflets, often causing fusion of the commissures and chordae tendineae.

Other findings of ARF include erythema marginatum (usually over the spine or other bony areas) and a red expanding rash on the trunk and extremities that recurs over weeks to months. Because of the different ways ARF presents itself, the disease may be difficult to diagnose.

A neurological disorder, Sydenham chorea, can occur months after an initial attack, causing jerky involuntary movements, muscle weakness, slurred speech, and personality changes. Initial episodes of ARF, as well as recurrences, can be prevented by treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

It is important to distinguish ARF from rheumatic heart disease. ARF is an acute inflammatory reaction with pathognomonic Aschoff bodies histologically and RHD is a non-inflammatory sequela of ARF.

===Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis===
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is an uncommon complication of either a strep throat or a streptococcal skin infection. It is classified as a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Symptoms of PSGN develop within 10 days following a strep throat or 3 weeks following a GAS skin infection. PSGN involves inflammation of the kidney. Symptoms include pale skin, lethargy, loss of appetite, headache, and dull back pain. Clinical findings may include dark-colored urine, swelling of different parts of the body (edema), and high blood pressure. Treatment of PSGN consists of supportive care.

===PANDAS===
Obsessive–compulsive disorder and tic disorders are hypothesized to arise in a subset of children as a result of a post-streptococcal autoimmune process. Its potential effect was described in 1998 by the controversial hypothesis called PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections), a condition thought to be triggered by GABHS infections. The PANDAS hypothesis is unconfirmed and unsupported by data, and two new categories have been proposed: PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) and CANS (childhood acute neuropsychiatric syndrome). The CANS/PANS hypotheses include different possible mechanisms underlying acute-onset neuropsychiatric conditions, but do not exclude GABHS infections as a cause in a subset of individuals. PANDAS, PANS and CANS are the focus of clinical and laboratory research but remain unproven.
