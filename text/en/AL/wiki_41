<text>Jacksonville ( ) is the most populous city proper in the U.S. state of Florida, located on the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida. It is the seat of Duval County, with which the City of Jacksonville consolidated in 1968. It was the largest city by area in the contiguous United States as of 2020, and became the 10th largest US city by population in 2023.

City-county consolidation greatly increased Jacksonville&#x27;s official population and extended its boundaries, placing most of Duval County&#x27;s population within the new municipal limits; Jacksonville grew to .

As of July 2022, Jacksonville&#x27;s population was 971,319, while the population of Duval County was about 1 million. After consolidation, Jacksonville became the most populous city in Florida and the Southeastern United States, and the largest in the South outside the state of Texas. With a population of 1,733,937, the Jacksonville metropolitan area ranks as Florida&#x27;s fourth-largest metropolitan region. The metropolitan area consists of Clay County, St. Johns County, Nassau County, and Baker County.

Jacksonville straddles the St. Johns River in the First Coast region of northeastern Florida, about south of the Georgia state line ( to the urban core/downtown) and north of Miami. The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British rule, a settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as &quot;Wacca Pilatka&quot; to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States.

Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its riverine location facilitates Naval Station Mayport, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, the U.S. Marine Corps Blount Island Command, and the Port of Jacksonville (JAXPORT), Florida&#x27;s largest seaport by volume. Jacksonville&#x27;s military bases and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States. Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics. As with much of Florida, tourism is important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf with the PGA Tour headquarters located in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach. People from Jacksonville are known as Jacksonvillians and, informally, as Jaxsons or Jaxons (both derived from Jax, the shortened nickname for the city).

==History==


===Early history===

The area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years. On Black Hammock Island in the national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a University of North Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BCE.

In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical era, the region was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people. At the time of contact with Europeans, all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa, centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River. One early French map shows a village called &quot;Ossachite&quot; at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area.

In 1562, French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River, calling it the River of May because that was the month of his discovery. Ribault erected a stone column at his landing site near the river&#x27;s mouth, claiming the newly discovered land for France. In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière established the first European settlement on the St. Johns River, Fort Caroline, near the main village of the Saturiwa.

Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to protect the interests of Spain by attacking the French at Fort Caroline. On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it. The Spanish renamed the fort as &quot;San Mateo&quot; and, following the expulsion of the French, St. Augustine became the most important European settlement in Florida. The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate, but a reconstruction of the fort was established in 1964 along the St. Johns River.
Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 as part of the Treaty of Paris in the aftermath of the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War on the North American front). The British soon constructed the King&#x27;s Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called &quot;Wacca Pilatka&quot; and the British called the Cow Ford; these names reflected the use of the ford for moving cattle across the river there.

The British introduced the cultivation of sugarcane, indigo, and fruits as cash crops on plantations, in addition to exporting lumber. A large number of British colonists who were &quot;energetic and of good character&quot; were given land grants in the region and emigrated to the region, becoming the first English-speaking population in Florida. These colonists came from England, Georgia, South Carolina and Bermuda. British judges introduced the system of common law to Florida, resulting in the Floridian legal system utilizing concepts such as trial-by-jury, habeas corpus and county-based government.

After their defeat in the American Revolutionary War, Britain returned control of the territory to Spain in 1783 via the Peace of Paris. The settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow.

===Founding and 19th century===


After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They named the town Jacksonville, after celebrated war hero and first Territorial Governor (later U.S. president) Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which the Florida Legislative Council approved on February 9, 1832.

During the American Civil War, Duval County produced several units that fought for the Confederate States Army. At least two were raised out of Jacksonville: the Jacksonville Light Infantry, a militia unit formed in 1859, and the Duval County Cow Boys, mustered in during the summer of 1861. Both units fought as part of the 3rd Florida Infantry. The St. John&#x27;s Greys, the Milton Artillery, and Company H of 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment were also all formed by men from Jacksonville.

Jacksonville was also a key supply point for hogs and cattle shipped from Florida to feed the Confederate forces. The city was blockaded by Union forces, who gained control of nearby Fort Clinch. Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper, the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces. In the Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862, Confederates won their first victory in the state. However, Union forces captured a Confederate position at the Battle of St. Johns Bluff, and occupied Jacksonville in 1862. Slaves escaped to freedom in Union lines. In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee, going down to defeat.

Union forces retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war. In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition in the Battle of Cedar Creek. Warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war.

During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous. Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad. President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22, 1888, during his trip to Florida. This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism. The city&#x27;s tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks. Extending the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas. From 1893 to 1938, Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home; it operated a nearby cemetery.

===20th and 21st centuries===

====1900 to 1939====
On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire. Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly. In a mere eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed seven residents. The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the few landmarks to survive the fire. Governor William Sherman Jennings declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order; on May 17, municipal authority resumed. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the &quot;Great Fire of 1901&quot;, it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho&#x27;s crowning achievement.

In the 1910s, northern film studios headquartered in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago were attracted to Jacksonville&#x27;s warm climate, exotic landscapes, excellent rail access, and cheap labor. More than 30 silent film studios were established over the decade, earning Jacksonville the title of &quot;Winter Film Capital of the World&quot;. However, the emergence of Hollywood as a major film production center ended the city&#x27;s film industry. One movie studio site, Norman Studios, remains in Arlington; it has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios.

During this time, Jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center, with companies such as Barnett Bank, Atlantic National Bank, Florida National Bank, Prudential, Gulf Life, Afro-American Insurance, Independent Life and American Heritage Life thriving in the business district. The Walker Business College was opened in Jacksonville and advertised that it was the largest African American business school in the United States.

====1940 to 1979====
During World War II, The U.S. Navy became a major employer and economic force, constructing three Navy bases in the city, while the U.S. Marine Corps established Blount Island Command.

Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from many negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II. The construction of federal highways essentially subsidized development of suburban housing, and wealthier, better established residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom. Mayor W. Haydon Burns&#x27; &quot;Jacksonville Story&quot; resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a sense of civic pride. Development of suburbs led to a growing middle class who lived outside the urban core. An increasing proportion of residents in Jacksonville&#x27;s urban core had a higher than average rate of poverty, especially as businesses and jobs also migrated to the suburbs.

Given the postwar migration of residents, businesses, and jobs, the city&#x27;s tax base declined. It had difficulty funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits. In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, such as sewage and building code enforcement. In 1958, a study recommended the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities to create the needed larger geographic tax base to improve services throughout the county. Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.

On August 27, 1960, a white mob attacked civil rights demonstrators in Hemming Park with clubs. The police largely stood by.

In 1962, a federal court ordered the city to prepare a plan for integration of public schools, in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954). A study found schools were in poor condition and poorly equipped.

On December 29, 1963, the Hotel Roosevelt fire killed 22 people, the highest one-day death toll in Jacksonville. On September 10, 1964, Hurricane Dora made landfall near St. Augustine, causing major damage to buildings in North Florida. Hurricane Dora was the first recorded hurricane to make a direct hit to North Florida.

In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals arose among city and some county officials, who were mainly part of a traditional white Democratic network that had dominated politics for the decades since the disenfranchisement of most African Americans at the turn of the 20th century which effectively hollowed out the Republican Party. After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign.

In 1963 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools threatened to withdraw accreditation of area schools in a year because of &quot;instructional deficiencies&quot;. But voters refused to approve new taxes to improve school conditions. In late 1963, Duval County was spending $299 per student compared to the state average spending of $372 per student. In 1964 all 15 of Duval County&#x27;s public high schools lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government reform.

Jacksonville Consolidation, led by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates, began to win more support during this period, from both inner-city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that provided federal oversight and enforcement of their right to vote, and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over the central city. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending, and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.

When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan with a 65 percent approval. On October 1, 1968, the city and county governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville. Fire, police, health &amp; welfare, recreation, public works, and housing &amp; urban development were all combined under the new government. In honor of the occasion, then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the &quot;Bold New City of the South&quot; at Florida 13 and Julington Creek. The consolidation created a 900-square-mile entity.

====1980 to present====
Tommy Hazouri supported passage of environmental regulations and reduced pollution odor during his single term as mayor, which began in 1987.

Ed Austin was elected as mayor in 1991. His most lasting contribution is the River City Renaissance program, a $235 million bond issued in 1993 by the city of Jacksonville which funded urban renewal and revamped the city&#x27;s historic downtown neighborhoods. Austin oversaw the city&#x27;s purchase and refurbishing of the St. James Building, which is now used as Jacksonville&#x27;s city hall. He was mayor in 1993 when Jacksonville was awarded its National Football League franchise, the Jacksonville Jaguars. They are the only major sports franchise in the city, making Jacksonville one of only two markets (the other one being Green Bay), and the only major city, to have a single sports franchise, and for that franchise to be an NFL team.

The Better Jacksonville Plan, promoted as a &quot;blueprint for Jacksonville&#x27;s future&quot; and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000, authorized a half-penny sales tax. This generated most of the revenue required for the $2.25 billion package of major projects, which have included road and infrastructure improvements, environmental preservation, targeted economic development, and new or improved public facilities.

In 2005, Jacksonville hosted Super Bowl XXXIX, which was seen by an estimated 86 million viewers.

The first notable retail cryptocurrency transaction involving physical goods was paid on May 22, 2010, by exchanging 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas delivered from a Papa John&#x27;s in Jacksonville, Florida. Laszlo Hanyecz, who lives in Jacksonville, created a thread on an online forum offering the bitcoins to anyone who would order him two pizzas. Jeremy Sturdivant, a user from England, accepted the offer and had the pizzas sent to Hayecz&#x27;s home. The 10,000 Bitcoins were worth about US$40 at the time. A plaque was mounted on the wall of the restaurant commemorating the day, with the declaration that Jacksonville is the &quot;Home of the first Bitcoin purchase.&quot; This event marks May 22 as &quot;Bitcoin Pizza Day&quot; for crypto-fans.

The city has suffered damage in natural disasters. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused major flooding and damage to Jacksonville, Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach, the first such damage in the area since 2004. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused record-breaking floods in Jacksonville, with a severity not seen since 1846.

As has been typical of other metropolitan areas across the country, suburban growth has continued around Jacksonville, where large areas of land were available for development, drawing more residents, businesses and jobs from the city. This has resulted in further demographic changes. The city&#x27;s largest ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% of the population in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.

==Geography==

===Cityscape===

===Topography===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , making Jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States; of this, 86.66% () is land and 13.34% () is water. Jacksonville completely surrounds the town of Baldwin. Nassau County lies to the north, Baker County lies to the west, and Clay and St. Johns counties lie to the south. Jacksonville has a coast on the Atlantic Ocean with the Jacksonville Beaches. The city developed along both sides of the St. Johns River. The Trout River, a major tributary of the St. Johns River, is entirely within Jacksonville.

Soil composition is primarily sand and clay rather than limestone, so few sinkholes develop; however, deep, large diameter sinkholes do occur.

===Architecture===
The architecture of Jacksonville varies in style. Few structures in the city center predate the Great Fire of 1901. The city is home to one of the largest collections of Prairie School style buildings outside the Midwest. Following the Great Fire of 1901, Henry John Klutho came to influence generations of local designers with his works by both the Chicago School, championed by Louis Sullivan, and the Prairie School of architecture, popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright. Jacksonville is also home to a notable collection of Mid-Century modern architecture. Local architects Robert C. Broward, Taylor Hardwick, and William Morgan adapted a range of design principles, including International style, Brutalism, Futurism and Organicism, all applied with an American interpretation generally referred to today as Mid-century modern design. The architecture firms of Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills (RS&amp;H) and Kemp, Bunch &amp; Jackson (KBJ) have also contributed a number of important works to the city&#x27;s modern architectural movement.

Jacksonville&#x27;s early predominant position as a regional center of business left an indelible mark on the city&#x27;s skyline. Many of the earliest skyscrapers in the state were constructed in Jacksonville, dating to 1902. The city last held the state height record from 1974 to 1981. The tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville&#x27;s skyline is the Bank of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center. It has a height of and includes 42 floors. Other notable structures include the 37-story 1 Independent Square (with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the Jacksonville skyline), originally built in 1972–1974 by the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company, and the 28-floor Riverplace Tower. When this tower was completed in 1967, it was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure in the world.

===Neighborhoods===
There are more than 500 neighborhoods within Jacksonville&#x27;s vast area. These include Downtown Jacksonville and its surrounding neighborhoods, including LaVilla, Brooklyn, Riverside and Avondale, Springfield, Eastside, Mandarin, and San Marco. Additionally, greater Jacksonville is traditionally divided into several amorphous areas, comprising large parts of Duval County. These are Northside, Westside, Southside, and Arlington, as well as the Jacksonville Beaches.

Four municipalities have retained their own governments since consolidation; these are Baldwin and the three Jacksonville Beaches towns of Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Jacksonville Beach. Four of Jacksonville&#x27;s neighborhoods, Avondale, Ortega, Springfield, and Riverside, have been identified as U.S. historic districts and are in the National Register of Historic Places.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification, Jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with hot humid summers, and warm to mild and drier winters. Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September, when brief but intense downpours with thunder and lightning are common, while the driest months are from November through April. Rainfall averages around a year.

Normal monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July; high temperatures average throughout the year.

The city of Jacksonville usually averages only about 10 to 15 nights at or below freezing. Such cold weather is usually short-lived. The coldest temperature recorded at Jacksonville International Airport was on January 21, 1985. Jacksonville has recorded four days with measurable snow since 1911, most recently a one-inch (2.5 cm) snowfall in December 1989, flurries in December 2010, and 1/10 of an inch of snow in January, 2025. 

Jacksonville has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871. The rarity of direct strikes is attributed to chance. However, the city has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to , making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. In 1979, Hurricane David passed offshore by , bringing winds around . Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach; the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged and later demolished.

In 2004, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area, and suffered minor damage from Tropical Storm Bonnie, which spawned a minor tornado. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008&#x27;s Tropical Storm Fay, which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Fay damaged, but did not destroy, the Jacksonville Beach pier that was rebuilt after Floyd. On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl, packing winds up to , which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach. Hurricane Matthew passed to the east with winds of 110 miles per hour. It caused storm surge, extensive flooding of the Atlantic Ocean and St. Johns River, and wind damage; the storm knocked out power for 250,000 people. In 2017, Hurricane Irma passed to the west with winds. It caused severe storm surge and flooding, passing the flood record of Hurricane Dora in 1964.

===Parks===

The City of Jacksonville has a unique park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, Florida State Parks and the City of Jacksonville Department of Parks and Recreation. Jacksonville operates the largest urban park system in the United States, providing facilities and services at more than 337 locations on more than throughout the city. A number of parks provide access for people to boat, swim, fish, sail, jetski, surf and waterski.

====National parks====

The Timucuan Preserve is a U.S. National Preserve comprising over of wetlands and waterways. It includes natural and historic areas such as the Fort Caroline National Memorial and the Kingsley Plantation, the oldest standing plantation in the state.

==Economy==


Jacksonville&#x27;s location on the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean proved instrumental to the growth of the city and its industry. Jacksonville has a sizable deepwater port, which helps make it a leading port in the U.S. for automobile imports, as well as the leading transportation and distribution hub in the state. The strength of the city&#x27;s economy lies in its broad diversification. While the area once had many thriving dairies, such as Gustafson&#x27;s Farm and Skinner Dairy, this aspect of the economy has declined over time. The area&#x27;s economy is balanced among distribution, financial services, biomedical technology, consumer goods, information services, manufacturing, insurance, and other industries.

Jacksonville is home to the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: CSX Corporation, Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity National Information Services and Southeastern Grocers. Interline Brands is based in Jacksonville and is owned by The Home Depot. Other notable companies based in Jacksonville or with a large presence include Florida Blue, Swisher International Group, BOA Merrill Lynch, Fanatics, Crowley Maritime, Web.com, Firehouse Subs and Deutsche Bank. Naval Air Station Jacksonville, SW of downtown, employs more than 25,000 people.

In 2008, Jacksonville had 2.8 million visitors who stayed overnight, spending nearly $1 billion. A study by Research Data Services of Tampa quantified the importance of tourism. The total economic impact was $1.6 billion and supported nearly 43,000 jobs, 10% of the local workforce.

===Banking and financial services===
Jacksonville has long had a regional legacy in banking and finance. Locally headquartered Atlantic National Bank, Florida National Bank and Barnett Bank dominated the industry in Florida from the turn of the 20th century through the 1980s, before all being acquired in a national wave of mergers and acquisitions throughout the entire financial sector. Acquired by NationsBank in 1997, Barnett Bank was the last of these banks to succumb to acquisition, and at the time was the largest banking merger in U.S. history. The city still holds distinction nationally and internationally, boasting two Fortune 500 financial services companies, Fidelity National Financial and FIS, FIS being well recognized as a global leader in financial technology. Headquartered on the banks of the St. Johns River in Downtown Jacksonville, EverBank holds the title of largest bank in the state by deposits. The city is home to other notable financial services institutions including Ameris Bancorp, Atlantic Coast Financial, Black Knight Financial Services, MedMal Direct Insurance Company, US Assure, Jax Federal Credit Union, and VyStar Credit Union. The city is also home to the Jacksonville Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Jacksonville&#x27;s financial sector has benefited from a rapidly changing business culture, as have other Sunbelt cities such as Atlanta, Tampa, and Charlotte. In a concept known as nearshoring, financial institutions are shifting operations away from high-cost addresses such as Wall Street, and have shifted some trading functions to Jacksonville. With relatively low-cost real estate, easy access by planes to New York City, high quality of life, and 19,000 financial sector employees, Jacksonville has become an option for relocating staff.

Deutsche Bank&#x27;s growth in the city is an example of such change. Jacksonville is the site of Deutsche Bank&#x27;s second largest US operation; only New York City is larger. They also are an example of a business that has moved operations to the suburbs. Other institutions with a notable presence in Jacksonville include Macquarie Group, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Citizens Property Insurance, Fidelity Investments, Ally Financial and Aetna.

===Logistics===
Jacksonville is a rail, air, and highway focal point and a busy port of entry, with Jacksonville International Airport, ship repair yards and extensive freight-handling facilities. Lumber, phosphate, paper, cigars and wood pulp are the principal exports; automobiles and coffee are among imports. The city&#x27;s manufacturing base provides 4.5% of local jobs, versus 8.5% nationally.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2007, Jacksonville ranked third among the top ten U.S. cities as destinations for jobs. Jacksonville was ranked as the tenth-fastest growing city in the U.S.

To emphasize the city&#x27;s transportation business and capabilities, the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce filed &quot;Jacksonville America&#x27;s Logistics Center&quot; as a trademark on November 9, 2007. It was formally registered on August 4, 2009. Cornerstone began promoting the city as &quot;Jacksonville: America&#x27;s Logistics Center&quot; in 2009. Signs were added to the existing city limit markers on Interstate 95.

The Port of Jacksonville, a seaport on the St. Johns River, is a large component of the local economy. Approximately 50,000 jobs in Northeast Florida are related to port activity and the port has an economic impact of $2.7 billion in Northeast Florida: The three maritime shippers who ship to Puerto Rico are all headquartered in Jacksonville: TOTE Maritime, Crowley Maritime, and Trailer Bridge.

Cecil Commerce Center is on the site of the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field, which closed in 1999 following the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision. Covering a total area of , it was the largest military base in the Jacksonville area. The parcel contains more than 3% of the total land area in Duval County (). The industrial and commercial-zoned center offers mid to large-size parcels for development; it has excellent transportation and utility infrastructure, including the third-longest runway in Florida.

===Media and technology===
&quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; is the major daily broadsheet newspaper in the State of Florida, headquartered in Jacksonville. Jacksonville.com is its official website. The &quot;Jacksonville Daily Record&quot; is also a daily broadsheet newspaper specialized for the business and legal communities. Weekly papers include the &quot;Jacksonville Business Journal&quot;, an American City Business Journals publication focused on business news, &quot;Folio Weekly&quot;, the city&#x27;s chief alternative weekly, and &quot;The Florida Star&quot; and the &quot;Jacksonville Free Press&quot;, two weeklies catering to African Americans. &quot;Jax4Kids&quot;, a monthly newspaper, caters to parents. &quot;EU Jacksonville&quot; is a monthly entertainment magazine. &quot;The Coastal&quot; is also a local magazine that is only online that also publishes a quarterly paper edition.

When it comes to broadcast media, as of 2023, Jacksonville was considered the 47th-largest local television market in the United States. Despite its large population, Jacksonville has always been a small-to-medium-sized market because of population trends towards suburban and once-traditionally rural areas around Duval County, Florida. They are served by television stations affiliated with major American networks including but not limited to: WTLV 12 (NBC) and its sister station WJXX 25 (ABC), WJAX-TV 47 (CBS) and WFOX-TV 30 (Fox; with MyNetworkTV/MeTV on DT2), which operates WJAX-TV under a joint sales and shared services agreement, WJCT 7 (PBS), and WCWJ 17 (CW). WJXT 4, WCWJ&#x27;s sister station, is a former longtime CBS affiliate that turned independent in 2002.

Jacksonville is also considered, after 2017, the 46th-largest local radio market in the U.S. and is also dominated by two of the largest media groups in the United States that also dominates the American radio industry, including the following: Cox Radio and iHeartMedia. The dominant AM radio station in terms of ratings - or households to use an industry term tuning in, is WOKV 690AM, which is also the flagship station for the Jacksonville Jaguars. In May 2013, WOKV began simulcasting on 104.5 FM as WOKV FM. There are two radio stations currently broadcasting, after 2017, primarily contemporary American (U.S. Based) Pop music, and they are the following: WAPE 95.1 which has somewhat dominated this niche for over 20 years but had competition originally based out of Atlanta, Georgia and Los Angeles, California linked to Ryan Seacrest. And more recently has been challenged to a certain extent by WKSL 97.9 FM (KISS FM).

For other popular genres of music, this would be WJBT 93.3 (The Beat) which is a mostly gangster-oriented Hip-Hop/R&amp;B station and 96.9 The Eagle WJGL which is mostly a Classical or Hard Rock station, while its HD subchannel WJGL-HD2 operates an Urban CHR format under the moniker Power 106.1. WPLA 107.3 is its competitor specializing in Contemporary Rock music under the moniker &quot;107.3 Planet Radio.&quot; And moreover, WEZI 102.9 is considered another competitor that specializes in Alternative R&amp;B or Adult Contemporary that is often branded as &quot;Easy 102.9&quot; along with 96.1 WEJZ branded as &quot;96.1 WEJZ&quot;, WHJX &quot;Hot 106.5&quot; specializing in urban adult contemporary, and WQIK 99.1 simply specializing in traditional country or Americana as well as WGNE-FM 99.9, and WJCT 89.9 lastly being the local National Public Radio affiliate. Moreover, a Christian Contemporary alternative would be WJKV 90.9 FM that is also an Educational Media Foundation K-LOVE outlet.

===Military and defense===
Jacksonville is home to three US naval facilities. Together with the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Jacksonville is the third-largest naval complex in the country. Only Norfolk, Virginia and San Diego, California are bigger. The United States military is the largest employer in Jacksonville and its total economic impact is approximately $6.1 billion annually. Several veterans&#x27; service organizations are also headquartered in Jacksonville, including Wounded Warrior Project.

Naval Air Station Jacksonville is a military airport south of the central business district. Approximately 23,000 civilian and active-duty personnel are employed on the base. There are 35 operational units/squadrons assigned there. Support facilities include an airfield for pilot training, and a maintenance depot capable of tasks ranging from changing a tire to intricate micro-electronics, or total engine disassembly. Also on-site is a Naval Hospital, a Fleet Industrial Supply Center, a Navy Family Service Center, and recreational facilities.
Naval Station Mayport is a Navy Ship Base that is the third-largest fleet concentration area in the U.S. Mayport has a busy harbor capable of accommodating 34 ships, and an runway capable of handling any aircraft used by the Department of Defense. Until 2007, it was home to the aircraft carrier , which locals called &quot;Big John&quot;. In January 2009, the Navy committed to stationing a nuclear-powered carrier at Mayport when the official &quot;Record of Decision&quot; was signed. The port will require approximately $500 million in facility enhancements to support the larger vessel, which took several years to complete. The carrier was projected to arrive in 2019; however, an amphibious group was sent before the carrier.

Blount Island Command is a Marine Corps Logistics Base whose mission is to support the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF). This provides for rapid deployment of personnel to link up with pre-positioned equipment and supplies embarked aboard forward-deployed Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS).

Jacksonville&#x27;s two universities compete in NCAA Division I: the University of North Florida Ospreys and the Jacksonville University Dolphins, both in the Atlantic Sun Conference.

==Government and politics==

===Government===

In 1968 Jacksonville and Duval County consolidated their governments in the Jacksonville Consolidation. This eliminated a separate county executive or legislature, and supplanted these positions with the Mayor of Jacksonville and the City Council of the City of Jacksonville, respectively. Because of this, voters who live &quot;outside&quot; of the city limits of Jacksonville but &quot;inside&quot; Duval County may vote in elections for these positions and run for them. In 1995, John Delaney, a resident of Neptune Beach within Duval County, was elected as mayor of the city of Jacksonville.

Jacksonville is organized under the city charter and provides for a &quot;strong&quot; mayor–council form of city government. The Mayor of Jacksonville is elected to four-year terms and serves as the head of the government&#x27;s executive branch. The Jacksonville City Council comprises nineteen members, fourteen representing single-member electoral districts of roughly equal populations, and five elected for at-large seats. The mayor oversees most city departments, though some are independent or quasi-independent. Law enforcement is provided by the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office, headed by an elected sheriff; public schools are overseen by Duval County Public Schools, and several services are provided by largely independent authorities. The mayor holds veto power over all resolutions and ordinances made by the city council and also has the power to hire and fire the heads of various city departments.

As before the consolidation, some government services are operated independently of city and county authority. In accordance with Florida law, the elected school board has nearly complete autonomy. Jacksonville also has several quasi-independent government agencies which only nominally answer to the consolidated authority, including electric authority, port authority, transportation authority, housing authority and airport authority. The main environmental and agricultural body is the Duval County Soil and Water Conservation District, which works closely with other area, state, and federal agencies.
The Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency responsible for public housing and subsidized housing in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create a community service-oriented, public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers.

===Politics===
The present mayor is Donna Deegan, who assumed office on July 1, 2023. Deegan&#x27;s predecessor was Lenny Curry.

Most of the city lies in the Florida&#x27;s 4th congressional district, and is represented by Republican Aaron Bean. Most of central Jacksonville is in the 5th district, represented by Republican John Rutherford. 
In 2010, Duval County&#x27;s crime rate was 5,106 per 100,000 people, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The county&#x27;s murder rate had been the highest among Florida&#x27;s counties with a population of 500,000 or more for eleven years as of 2009, leading to widespread discussion in the community about how to deal with the problem. In 2010, Duval County&#x27;s violent crime rate decreased by 9.3% from the previous year, with total crime decreasing 7.3%, putting the murder rate behind that of Miami-Dade County.

Jacksonville and Duval County historically maintained separate police agencies: the Jacksonville Police Department and Duval County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. As part of consolidation in 1968, the two merged, creating the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office (JSO). The JSO is headed by the elected Sheriff of Jacksonville, currently T. K. Waters. 
The sheriff&#x27;s office is responsible for law enforcement and corrections in the county. Likewise the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department became the consolidated city/county agency. 

However, the cities of Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach each retained responsibility for their own policing and fire protection.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===


Public primary and secondary schools in Jacksonville and Duval County are administered by Duval County Public Schools, which is governed by an elected, seven-member Duval County School Board. In the 2009–2010 school year, the district enrolled 123,000 students. It administers 172 total schools, including 103 elementary schools, 25 middle schools, 19 high schools, three K–8 schools, and one 6–12 school, as well as 13 charter schools and a juvenile justice school program. Of these, 62 are designated magnet schools.

Three of Jacksonville&#x27;s high schools, Stanton College Preparatory School, Darnell-Cookman School of the Medical Arts and Paxon School for Advanced Studies regularly appear at the top of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the country&#x27;s top public high schools, coming in respectively at #3, #7, and #8 in the 2010 edition. Five other schools, Douglas Anderson School of the Arts (#33), Mandarin High School (#97), Duncan U. Fletcher High School (#205), Sandalwood High School (#210), and Englewood High School (#1146) were also included in the list.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates a number of Catholic schools in Jacksonville, including two high schools, Bishop Kenny High School and Bishop John J. Snyder High School. Other private schools in Jacksonville include Arlington Country Day School, the Bolles School, Trinity Christian Academy, and the Episcopal School of Jacksonville.

===Colleges and universities===
Jacksonville is home to a number of institutions of higher education. The University of North Florida (UNF), opened in 1972, is a public institution and a member of the State University System of Florida. Jacksonville University (JU) is a private institution founded in 1934. Edward Waters University (EWU), established in 1866, is the oldest college in Jacksonville and the state&#x27;s oldest historically black college. Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ) is a state college and a member of the Florida College System, offering two-year associate&#x27;s degrees as well as some four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The University of Florida has its second campus of the J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center in Jacksonville.

Other colleges and universities in Jacksonville include Trinity Baptist College, and Jones College. Also in the area are St. Johns River State College, a state college with campuses in Clay, St. Johns, and Putnam Counties, and Flagler College in St. Augustine. The Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science also offers educational programs from its Mayo Clinic Jacksonville campus.

===Public libraries===


The Jacksonville Public Library began when May Moore and Florence Murphy started the Jacksonville Library and Literary Association in 1878. The Association was populated by various prominent Jacksonville residents and sought to create a free public library and reading room for the city.

Over the course of 127 years, the system has grown from that one room library to become one of the largest in the state. The Jacksonville library system includes the Main Library and 20 branches, ranging in size from the West Regional Library to smaller neighborhood libraries like Westbrook and Eastside. The Library annually receives nearly four million visitors and circulates over six million items. Nearly 500,000 library cards are held by area residents.

On November 12, 2005, the new Main Library opened to the public, replacing the 40-year-old Haydon Burns Library. The largest public library in the state, the opening of the new main library marked the completion of an unprecedented period of growth for the system under the Better Jacksonville Plan. The new Main Library offers specialized reading rooms, public access to hundreds of computers and public displays of art, an extensive collection of books, and special collections ranging from the African-American Collection to the recently opened Holocaust Collection.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Roadways and bridges====

There are seven bridges over the St. Johns River at Jacksonville. They include (starting from furthest downstream) the Napoleon Bonaparte Broward Bridge (Dames Point) (which carries Interstate 295 Eastern Beltway traffic), the John E. Mathews Bridge, the Isaiah D. Hart Bridge, the John T. Alsop Jr. Bridge (Main Street), the St. Elmo W. Acosta Bridge, the Fuller Warren Bridge (which carries I-95 traffic) and the Henry Holland Buckman Bridge (which carries I-295 North/South traffic). Also, next to the Acosta Bridge is a large jackknife railroad bridge built in the 1920s by Henry Flagler&#x27;s FEC Railroad.

Beginning in 1953, tolls were charged on the Hart, Mathews, Fuller Warren and Main Street bridges to pay for bridge construction, renovations and many other highway projects. As Jacksonville grew, toll plazas created bottlenecks and caused delays and accidents during rush hours. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate toll collection and replace the revenue with a ½ cent local sales tax increase. In 1989, the toll booths were removed.

Interstate 10 (I-10) and I-95 intersect in Jacksonville, forming the busiest freeway interchange in the region with 200,000 vehicles each day. I-10 ends at this intersection (the other end being in Santa Monica, California). Additionally, State Road 202 (J. Turner Butler Boulevard) provides freeway access to the Jacksonville beaches from I-95 on the Southside.

I-95 has a bypass route, I-295, which encircles the downtown area. The major freeway interchange at I-295 and SR 202 was finally completed on December 24, 2008. SR 9B was completed in late 2019, and connects I-295&#x27;s southeast corner to the Bayard Area. The SR 9B freeway will be called I-795 when it is completed. U.S. Highway 1 (US 1) and US 17 travel through the city from the south to the north, and US 23 enters the city running concurrently with US 1. In downtown, US 23 splits from US 1 and quickly runs to its southern terminus.
The eastern terminus of US 90 is in nearby Jacksonville Beach near the Atlantic Ocean.
US 23&#x27;s other end is in Mackinaw City, Michigan.

Several regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on Jacksonville freeways. A $152 million project to create a high-speed interchange at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 95 began in February 2005, after the conclusion of Super Bowl XXXIX. Construction was expected to take nearly six years with multiple lane flyovers and the requirement that the interchange remain open throughout the project. The previous configuration used single lane, low speed, curved ramps which created backups during rush hours and contributed to accidents.
Also, construction of SR 9B (future Interstate 795), is currently underway.

====Transit system====

The Jacksonville Skyway is an automated people mover connecting Florida State College at Jacksonville downtown campus, the Northbank central business district, Convention Center, and Southbank locations. The system includes 8 stops connected by two lines. The existing train is a UMIII monorail built by Bombardier. The guideway consists of concrete beams which rest atop an unusually large support structure not used in most monorail systems. Maximum speed for the train is .

A monorail was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a mobility plan hoping to attract interest from the Urban Mass Transit Administration&#x27;s Downtown Peoplemover Program. The initial study was undertaken by the Florida Department of Transportation and Jacksonville&#x27;s planning department, who took the Skyway project to the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in 1977. Following further development and a final 18-month feasibility study, the UMTA selected Jacksonville as one of seven cities to receive federal funding for an automated people mover. Two other related projects are Miami&#x27;s Metromover and Detroit&#x27;s People Mover. UMTA&#x27;s approved plan called for the construction of a Phase I system to be built in three segments.

====Modal characteristics====

In 2014, the Jacksonville was among the top large cities ranked by percentage of commuters who drove to work alone (80 percent). According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80 percent of city of Jacksonville residents commuted in single-occupancy vehicles, 8.6 percent carpooled, 2.6 percent used public transportation, and 2.7 percent walked. All other forms of transportation combined for 1.7 percent of the commuter modal share, while 4.5 percent worked out of the home.

Some patterns of car ownership are similar to national averages. In 2015, 8.3 percent of city of Jacksonville households lacked a car, which increased slightly to 8.7 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Jacksonville averaged 1.62 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

====Rail====

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides daily service from the Jacksonville Amtrak Station on Clifford Lane in the northwest section of the city. Two trains presently stop there, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; (temporarily replaced by the &quot;Floridian&quot;). Jacksonville was also served by the thrice-weekly &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and the daily &quot;Silver Palm&quot;. Service on the &quot;Silver Palm&quot; was cut back to Savannah, Georgia in 2002. The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; route was truncated at San Antonio, Texas as a result of the track damage in the Gulf Coast area caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 28, 2005. Service was restored as far east as New Orleans by late October 2005, but Amtrak has opted not to fully restore service into Florida.

Jacksonville is the headquarters of two significant freight railroads. CSX Transportation, owns a large building on the downtown riverbank that is a significant part of the skyline. Florida East Coast Railway also call Jacksonville home. The Jacksonville Port Terminal Railroad is also based in Jacksonville. Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Valdosta District also serves Jacksonville.

====Airports====

Jacksonville is served by Jacksonville International Airport , north of downtown, with 82 departures a day to 27 nonstop destination cities. Airports in Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA). Smaller aircraft use Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport in Arlington, Herlong Recreational Airport on the Westside, and Cecil Airport , at Cecil Commerce Center. The state of Florida has designated Cecil Airport a space port, allowing horizontal lift spacecraft to use the facility.

====Seaports====
Public seaports in Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville Port Authority, known as JAXPORT. Four modern deepwater () seaport facilities, including America&#x27;s newest cruise port, make Jacksonville a full-service international seaport. In FY2006, JAXPORT handled 8.7 million tons of cargo, including nearly 610,000 vehicles, which ranks Jacksonville second in the nation in automobile handling, behind only the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The 20 other maritime facilities not managed by the Port Authority move about 10 million tons of additional cargo in and out of the St. Johns River. In terms of total tonnage, the Port of Jacksonville ranks 40th nationally; within Florida, it is third behind Tampa and Port Everglades.

In 2003, the JAXPORT Cruise Terminal opened, providing cruise service for 1,500 passengers to Key West, Florida, the Bahamas, and Mexico via Carnival Cruise Lines ship &quot;Celebration&quot;, which was retired in April 2008. For almost five months, no cruises originated from Jacksonville until September 20, 2008, when the cruise ship &quot;Fascination&quot; departed with 2,079 passengers. In fiscal year 2006, there were 78 cruise ship sailings with 128,745 passengers. A JaxPort spokesperson said in 2008 that they expect 170,000 passengers to sail each year.

Jacksonville Fire and Rescue operates a fleet of three fireboats. Its vessels are called on to fight approximately 75 fires per year.

The Mayport Ferry connects the north and south ends of State Road A1A between Mayport and Fort George Island, and is the last active ferry in Florida. The state of Florida transferred responsibility for ferry operations to JAXPORT on October 1, 2007.

===Utilities===

Basic utilities in Jacksonville (water, sewer, electric) are provided by JEA (formerly the Jacksonville Electric Authority). According to Article 21 of the &quot;Jacksonville City Charter&quot;:

JEA is authorized to own, manage and operate a utilities system within and outside the City of Jacksonville. JEA is created for the express purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating, financing and otherwise have plenary authority with respect to electric, water, sewer, natural gas and such other utility systems as may be under its control now or in the future.

People&#x27;s Gas is Jacksonville&#x27;s natural gas provider. Comcast is Jacksonville&#x27;s local cable provider. AT&amp;T (formerly BellSouth) is Jacksonville&#x27;s local phone provider, and their U-Verse service offers TV, internet, and VoIP phone service to customers served by fiber-to-the-premises or fiber-to-the-node using a VRAD. The city has a successful recycling program with separate pickups for garbage, yard waste and recycling. Collection is provided by several private companies under contract to the City of Jacksonville.

===Health===
Major players in the Jacksonville health care industry include St. Vincent&#x27;s HealthCare, Baptist Health and UF Health Jacksonville for local residents. Additionally, Nemours Children&#x27;s Clinic and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville each draw patients regionally.

The TaxExemptWorld.com website, which compiles Internal Revenue Service data, reported that in 2007, there are 2,910 distinct, active, tax exempt/non-profit organizations in Jacksonville which, excluding Credit Unions, had a total income of $7.08 billion and assets of $9.54 billion.
There are 333 charitable organizations with assets of over $1 million. The largest share of assets was tied to Medical facilities, $4.5 billion. The problems of the homeless are addressed by several non-profits, most notably the Sulzbacher Center and the Clara White Mission.

<text>Dobro () is an American brand of resonator guitars owned by Gibson and manufactured by its subsidiary Epiphone. The term &quot;dobro&quot; is also used as a generic term for any wood-bodied, single-cone resonator guitar.

The Dobro was originally a guitar manufacturing company founded by the Dopyera brothers as the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their guitar design, with a single outward-facing resonator cone, was introduced to compete with the patented inward-facing tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.

==History==

The roots of the Dobro story can be traced to the 1920s when Slovak immigrant John Dopyera, instrument repairman and inventor, and musician George Beauchamp were searching for more volume for Beauchamp&#x27;s guitars. Dopyera built an ampliphonic (or &quot;resonator&quot;) for Beauchamp, which was patented in December 1929. In mid-1929, Dopyera left the National String Instrument Corporation to start the Dobro Manufacturing Company along with his brothers Rudy and Ed, and Vic Smith. National continued operating under Beauchamp, Barth et al. &quot;Dobro&quot; is both a contraction of &#x27;Dopyera brothers&#x27; and in their native Slovak, but also in many other Slavic languages. An early company motto was &quot;Dobro means good in any language.&quot; In 1930, the Dobro company name was changed to Dobro Corporation, Ltd., with additional capital provided by Louis and Robert Dopyera. Dobro was, during this period, a competitor of National.

The Dobro was the third resonator guitar design by Dopyera, but the second to enter production. Unlike his earlier tricone design, which had three ganged inward-facing resonator cones, the Dobro had a single outward-facing cone, with its concave surface facing up. The Dobro company described this as a bowl-shaped resonator.

The Dobro was louder than the tricone and cheaper to produce. In Dopyera&#x27;s opinion, the cost of manufacture had priced the resonator guitar beyond the reach of many players. His failure to convince his fellow directors at National String Instrument Corporation to produce a single-cone version was a motivating factor for leaving.

Since National had applied for a patent on an inward-facing single cone (US patent 1808756), Dopyera developed a design that reversed its direction: the guitar&#x27;s bridge rested on an eight-legged cast aluminum spider sitting on the perimeter of the cone (US patent 1896484), rather than on the apex of the cone as it did in the National design.
In the following years, both Dobro and National built a wide variety of metal- and wood-bodied single-cone guitars, while National also continued with the tricone for a time. Both companies sourced many components from National director Adolph Rickenbacher, and John Dopyera remained a major shareholder in National. By 1932, the Dopyera brothers had gained control of both National and Dobro, which they merged to form the National-Dobro Company. By the 1940s, National-Dobro had been purchased by Valco. Valco ceased production of Dobro-branded guitars after World War II; however, the Dopyera brothers continued to manufacture resonator guitars under various other brand names.

In 1964, the Dopyera brothers revived the Dobro brand name. They sold the name to Semie Moseley in 1966. In 1970, the Dopyeras&#x27; Original Musical Instrument Company (OMI) yet again reacquired the Dobro name. In 1993, the Gibson Guitar Corporation acquired OMI along with the Dobro name. The company became Gibson&#x27;s Original Acoustic Instruments division, and production was moved to Nashville in 2000. , Dobros were manufactured by Gibson subsidiary Epiphone. , Dobros were not listed on Epiphone&#x27;s website.

The Dobro was first introduced to country music by Bashful Brother Oswald, who played dobro with Roy Acuff starting in January 1939.

The first and second prototypes of the Dobro created by the brothers reside at the invention&#x27;s birthplace of Taft, California, in a museum about the town&#x27;s oil production history.

On June 19, 2019, a 1933 Dobro Resonator Guitar Model 27, owned by David Gilmour was sold at auction for a record $112,500.

<text>Sextus Varius Marcellus (c. 165 – c. 215) was a Roman aristocrat and politician from the province of Syria. He was father of the emperor Elagabalus.

==Family and career==
Little is known about the origins of Marcellus, other than he was born and raised in the city of Apamea in Syria. Marcellus was a Roman citizen from the Equestrian order.

Marcellus had a long and distinguished political career. He was present at the Secular Games in Rome in 204. From 200 to 205, like Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus, Marcellus did not serve in a significant Roman military or political position, probably due to Roman emperor Lucius Septimius Severus views about him being influenced by the Praetorian prefect Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. When Plautianus was killed in 205, Marcellus&#x27; career was able to move ahead.

From 205 to about 207, Marcellus was a Procurator for the Roman aqueducts in Rome, a position usually given to Romans of Senatorial rank, not from the Equestrian class. Marcellus was paid about 100,000 sesterces per year.

Marcellus proved his worth and capabilities in his position to Emperor Severus and his family. In 208 the emperor promoted him to Procurator of Roman Britain and in this position he was responsible for gathering taxes for Rome. He earned 200,000 sesterces in this role. Later he was promoted by the emperor to managing the finances of Roman Britain earning 300,000 sesterces.

In 211 after the death of Lucius Septimius Severus, his sons Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta succeeded their father on the Roman throne. Caracalla recalled Marcellus from Roman Britain to Rome and briefly placed him in the roles of Praefectus urbi and Praetorian prefect. He was later admitted into the Senate and, soon after, became &quot;praefectus&quot; of the military treasury. He later became governor of Numidia and held this post until his death.

==Marriage and children==
Marcellus married the Syrian Roman noblewoman Julia Soaemias Bassiana who was the first daughter of the powerful Syrian nobles Julia Maesa and Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus. The maternal aunt of Soaemias was the Roman empress Julia Domna; her maternal uncle-in-marriage was the Roman emperor Lucius Septimius Severus; her maternal cousins were the Roman emperors Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta and she was the maternal aunt of the Roman emperor Alexander Severus. Through marriage, Marcellus was related both to the Severan dynasty of the Roman Empire and the royal family of Emesa, Syria.

Their marriage may have taken place in 192 or 194, or even perhaps around 200. Marcellus and Soaemias&#x27; marriage may have been arranged to strengthen Lucius Septimius Severus&#x27; position in the Roman East.

Soaemias and Marcellus bore the following children who were born and raised in Rome:
* A child whose name is unknown, who was their first son and child. The first son was named after the father of Marcellus, whose name is likewise unknown
* Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus, who became the Severan Roman emperor Elagabalus from 218 until 222.

==Epigraphic evidence==
Inscriptional evidence has survived on Marcellus. After his death in c. 215, his wife Julia Soaemias Bassiana and their two sons, dedicated to him a tombstone which was found in Velletri, not far from Rome. The tombstone has two preserved bilingual inscriptions in Latin and Greek, which were first published at Rome in 1765. The inscriptions reveal his political career, his various titles, designations and distinctions he received. The tombstone of Marcellus is known to scholars as which can be found in the Octagonal Court in the Vatican Museums and reads:

:To Sextus Varius Marcellus
:procurator centenarius of the water supply, procurator ducenarius of Britain, procurator 
:trecenarius of the private purse, acting as praetorian prefect and praefectus urbi,
:senator, prefect of the military treasury, commander of the Third legion Augusta, 
:governor of Numidia,
:has Julia Soaemias Bassiana, daughter of Gaius, with her children, 
:[dedicated this] to her husband and dearest father.

Marcellus was known in dedicating an inscription to Bel in Vasio (Vaison) in Gaul. The bilingual inscription which is in Greek and Latin on an altar, dedicated by him is honoring Bel in remembrance of the oracles given to him in Apamea.

==Posthumous honour==
The Baths of Varius (&quot;Thermae Varianae&quot;) in Rome were named in honor of Marcellus and his second son by the Legio XIII Gemina.

The Circus Varianus was also named after his family.

<text>Lester Raymond Flatt (June 19, 1914 – May 11, 1979) was an American bluegrass guitarist and mandolinist, best known for his collaboration with banjo picker Earl Scruggs in the duo Flatt and Scruggs.

Flatt&#x27;s career spanned multiple decades, breaking out as a member of Bill Monroe&#x27;s band during the 1940s and including multiple solo and collaboration works exclusive of Scruggs. He first reached a mainstream audience through his performance on &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot;, the theme for the network television series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, in the early 1960s.

==Biography==

Flatt was born in Duncan&#x27;s Chapel, Overton County, Tennessee, United States, to Nannie Mae Haney and Isaac Columbus Flatt. In 1943, he played mandolin and sang tenor in The Kentucky Pardners, the band of Bill Monroe&#x27;s older brother Charlie. He first came to prominence as a member of Bill Monroe&#x27;s Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and played a thumb-and-index guitar style that was in part derived from the playing of Charlie Monroe and Clyde Moody. In 1948, he started a band with fellow Monroe alumnus Earl Scruggs, and for the next 20 years, Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys were one of the most successful bands in bluegrass. When they parted ways in 1969, Flatt formed a new group, the Nashville Grass, hiring many of the Foggy Mountain Boys. He continued to record and perform with that group until his death in 1979. His role as rhythm guitarist and vocalist in each of these seminal ensembles helped define the sound of traditional bluegrass music. His solid guitar playing and rich lead voice are unmistakable in hundreds of bluegrass standards. He is also remembered for his library of compositions.

==Death and legacy==
Flatt died of heart failure in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 64.

He was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1985 along with Scruggs. Flatt was also posthumously inducted as an inaugural member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1991.

Lester&#x27;s hometown of Sparta, Tennessee, held a bluegrass festival in his honor for a number of years, before being discontinued a few years prior to the death of the traditional host, resident Everette Paul England; Lester Flatt Memorial Bluegrass Day remains part of the annual Liberty Square Celebration held in Sparta.

Flatt and Scruggs were ranked No. 24 on CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003.

<text>Earl Eugene Scruggs (January 6, 1924 – March 28, 2012) was an American musician noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo picking style, now called &quot;Scruggs style&quot;, which is a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.

Scruggs&#x27;s career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe&#x27;s band, the Blue Grass Boys. &quot;Bluegrass&quot; eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, Scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo Flatt and Scruggs. Scruggs&#x27;s banjo instrumental &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; was recorded in December 1949 and released in March 1950. The song became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.

Flatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot;, the theme music for the television sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;—the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.
Scruggs received four Grammy awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts. He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named, as a duo, number 24 on CMT&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Men of Country Music&quot;. Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame. After Scruggs&#x27;s death in 2012 at age 88, the Earl Scruggs Center was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.

==Early life==
Earl Scruggs was born January 6, 1924, in the Flint Hill community of Cleveland County, North Carolina, a small community just outside of Boiling Springs, about 10 miles west of Shelby. His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Scruggs&#x27;s mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.

The family members all played music. The father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though as an adult Earl had no recollection of his father&#x27;s playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl&#x27;s siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalled a visit to his uncle&#x27;s home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger-picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. It made an impression on Scruggs, who said, &quot;He&#x27;d sit in the rocking chair, and he&#x27;d pick some and it was just amazing. I couldn&#x27;t imagine—he was the first, what I call a good banjo player.&quot; Scruggs then took up the instrument—he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie&#x27;s banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. After his father&#x27;s death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show. Because his father had died, Scruggs was deferred from military service in World War II so he could support his mother.

==Development==

Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called &quot;Scruggs style&quot; that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string. The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique. Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits &quot;(see photo)&quot;, each plucking individual strings—downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line. The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack, creating an exciting effect, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof&quot;. This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument—a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedian&#x27;s prop—and popularized the instrument in several genres of music.

Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he said the three-finger style was the most common way to play the five-string banjo in his hometown in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt &quot;Snuffy&quot; Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, &quot;Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it&quot;. At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called &quot;Reuben&quot; and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. &quot;That excited me to no end&quot;, he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling &quot;I&#x27;ve got it&quot;. From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs&#x27;s early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it &quot;a syncopated roll that was quite different.&quot; On the subject, John Hartford said, &quot;Here&#x27;s the way I feel about it. Everybody&#x27;s all worried about who invented the style and it&#x27;s obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time—maybe since 1840. But it&#x27;s my feeling that if it wasn&#x27;t for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn&#x27;t be worried about who invented it.&quot;

==With Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys==
At age 15, Scruggs played in a group called The Morris Brothers for a few months, but quit to work in a factory making sewing thread in the Lily Textile Mill near his home in North Carolina. He worked there about two years, earning 40 cents an hour, until the draft restriction for World War II was lifted in 1945, at which time he returned to music, performing with &quot;Lost John Miller and his Allied Kentuckians&quot; on WNOX in Knoxville. About this time an opening to play with Bill Monroe became available.

Bill Monroe, 13 years older than Scruggs, was prominent in country music at the time. His career started with the &quot;Monroe Brothers&quot;, a duo with his brother Charlie. Bill sang the high tenor harmony parts, a sound called &quot;high lonesome&quot;, for which he became noted. The brothers split up in 1938 and Bill, a native of &quot;the Bluegrass State&quot; of Kentucky, formed a new group called Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys. They first played on the Opry in 1939 and soon became a popular touring band featuring a vocalist named Lester Flatt. The name &quot;bluegrass&quot; stuck and eventually became the eponym for this entire genre of country music and Monroe became known as &quot;the father of bluegrass&quot;.

When Scruggs was 21, Monroe was looking for a banjo player for his group, because David &quot;Stringbean&quot; Akeman was quitting. At the time, banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians, and the instrument was often held as a prop—their clawhammer playing was almost inaudible. Monroe, along with band member Lester Flatt, auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman. When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville, Flatt said, &quot;I was thrilled. It was so different! I had never heard that kind of banjo picking.&quot; Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945, earning $50 a week. After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys, the roster consisted of Bill Monroe (vocals/mandolin), Lester Flatt (guitar/vocals), Earl Scruggs (banjo), Chubby Wise (fiddle), and Howard Watts (stage name Cedric Rainwater) on bass. This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would become.

With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs performed on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe&#x27;s band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn&#x27;t have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off&quot;. The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that &quot;Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there&quot;. Despite the group&#x27;s success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. Flatt had also made up his mind to leave, but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice, but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. Despite Monroe&#x27;s pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.

==Flatt and Scruggs==
In 1948, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs formed the duo Flatt and Scruggs and chose the name &quot;the Foggy Mountain Boys&quot; for their backing band. The name came from a song by the Carter Family called &quot;Foggy Mountain Top&quot; that the band used as a theme song at the time. Flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from Monroe&#x27;s group. In the spring of 1949, their second Mercury recording session yielded the classic &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;, released on 78 RPM phonograph records that were in use at the time. In the mid-1950s, they dropped the mandolin and added a Dobro, played by Buck &quot;Uncle Josh&quot; Graves. Previously, Scruggs had performed something similar, called &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; with Bill Monroe, but Monroe had denied him songwriting credit for it. Later, Scruggs changed the song, adding a minor chord, thus creating &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;. The song contains a musical oddity: Flatt plays an E major chord against Scruggs&#x27;s E minor. When asked about the dissonance years later, Scruggs said he had tried to get Flatt to consistently play a minor there to no avail; he said he eventually became used to the sound and even fond of it. The song won a Grammy and became an anthem for many banjo players to attempt to master. The band routinely tuned its instruments a half-step higher than standard tuning in those days to get more brightness or pop to the sound, returning to standard pitch in the 1960s.

The popularity of &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; resurged years later when it was featured in the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, which introduced the song to a younger generation of fans. Scruggs received a phone call from the show&#x27;s producer and star, Warren Beatty, first asking Scruggs to write a song for the movie. Soon Beatty called back saying that he wanted to use the existing vintage Mercury recording of &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;, and rejected the argument that it was recorded 18 years prior at a radio station with no modern enhancements. The film was a hit, called by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;a landmark film that helped usher in a new era in American filmmaking&quot;. In 2005, the song was selected for the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.

In October 1951, the band recorded &quot;Earl&#x27;s Breakdown&quot; which featured a technique where Scruggs would manually de-tune the second and third strings of the banjo during a song using a cam device he had made to attach to the instrument, giving the surprise effect of a downward string bend. He and his brother Horace had experimented with it when they were growing up. Scruggs had drilled some holes in the peghead of his banjo to install the device and chipped the pearl inlay. He covered the holes with a piece of metal, which can be seen on the album cover of &quot;Foggy Mountain Jamboree&quot;. The technique became popular and led to improvement of the design (without drilling holes) by Bill Keith who then manufactured Scruggs-Keith Tuners. The original tuners Scruggs made and used are now in a museum display at the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, North Carolina.

In 1953, Martha White Foods sponsored the band&#x27;s regular early morning radio shows on WSM in Nashville, where the duo sang the company&#x27;s catchy bluegrass jingle written by Pat Twitty. About this time, country music television shows, on which Flatt and Scruggs appeared regularly, went into syndication, vastly increasing the group&#x27;s exposure. Despite the group&#x27;s increasing popularity and fan mail, WSM did not allow Flatt and Scruggs to become members of the Grand Ole Opry at first. According to &quot;Tennessean&quot; writer Peter Cooper, Bill Monroe was in opposition and worked behind the scenes to keep Flatt and Scruggs off the Opry to the extent of having petitions made against their membership. In 1955 Martha White Foods&#x27; CEO Cohen E. Williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from WSM unless the band appeared on the Opry in the segment sponsored by his company. As years went by, the band became synonymous with Martha White to the extent that the advertising jingle became a hit, and the band rarely played a concert without it. Fans shouted requests for them to play it, even at Carnegie Hall.

On September 24, 1962, the duo recorded &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot; for the TV show &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Sung by Jerry Scoggins, the theme song became an immediate country music hit and was played at the beginning and end of each episode of the series. The song went to #1 on the Billboard country chart, a first for any bluegrass recording. The song spent 20 weeks on that chart; it also reached #44 on Billboard&#x27;s pop chart. The television show was also a huge hit, broadcast in 76 countries around the world. In Queens, New York a five-year-old boy named Béla Fleck heard the Jed Clampett theme on television. Fleck said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t breathe or think; I was completely mesmerized.&quot; He said it awakened a deeply embedded predisposition that &quot;was just in there&quot; to learn how to play the banjo. Flatt and Scruggs appeared in several episodes as family friends of the fictional Clampetts. In their first appearance (season 1, episode 20), they portray themselves in the show and perform both the theme song and &quot;Pearl, Pearl, Pearl&quot;. That song went to #8 on the country chart in 1963. Scruggs published an instruction book entitled &quot;Earl Scruggs and the Five String Banjo&quot; in 1968. It received a Gold Book Award by the publisher, Peer-Southern Corporation when it sold over a million copies. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records and featured over 20 different musicians as &quot;Foggy Mountain Boys&quot;—side men backing the duo.

By the end of the 1960s, Scruggs was getting bored with repetition of the classic bluegrass fare. By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, &quot;I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don&#x27;t, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed&quot;. Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan&#x27;s records. This new association produced &quot;Changin&#x27; Times&quot;, &quot;Nashville Airplane&quot;, and &quot;The Story of Bonnie and Clyde&quot; albums. Flatt was not happy with some of this material—he didn&#x27;t like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?&quot;. Even the success of the &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.

Neither Flatt nor Scruggs spoke to each other for the next ten years—until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to his bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt&#x27;s voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs answered yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better. Flatt said, &quot;It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good.&quot; However, Flatt never recovered and died May 11, 1979. Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said &quot;Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living.&quot; (He was referring to a 1957 Flatt and Scruggs recording of &quot;Give Me My Flowers While I&#x27;m Still Living&quot;.)

==Earl Scruggs Revue==
In early 1969, Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue, consisting of two of his sons, Randy (guitar) and Gary (bass) and later Vassar Clements (fiddle), Josh Graves (Dobro) and Scruggs&#x27;s youngest son, Steve (drums). On November 15, 1969, Scruggs performed live with the newly formed group on an open-air stage in Washington, D.C. at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Scruggs was one of the few bluegrass or country artists to give support to the anti-war movement. The Earl Scruggs Revue gained popularity on college campuses, live shows and festivals and appeared on the bill with acts like Steppenwolf, The Byrds and James Taylor. They recorded for Columbia Records and made frequent network television appearances though the 1970s. Their album &quot;I Saw the Light with a Little Help from my Friends&quot; featured Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, Tracy Nelson, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. This collaboration sparked enthusiasm by the latter to make the album &quot;Will the Circle be Unbroken&quot;. Earl and Louise Scruggs made phone calls to eminent country stars like Roy Acuff and &quot;Mother&quot; Maybelle Carter to get them to participate in this project to bring a unique combination of older players with young ones. Bill Monroe refused to participate saying he had to remain true to the style he pioneered, and this &quot;is not bluegrass&quot; The album became a classic, and was selected for the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.

Scruggs had to retire from the road in 1980 because of back problems, but the Earl Scruggs Revue did not part ways until 1982. Despite the group&#x27;s commercial success, they were never embraced by bluegrass or country music purists. Scruggs remained active musically and released &quot;The Storyteller and the Banjoman&quot; with Tom T. Hall in 1982, and a compilation album &quot;Top of the World&quot; in 1983. In 1994, Scruggs teamed up with Randy Scruggs and Doc Watson to contribute the song &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot;. In 2001, Scruggs broke a 17-year personal album hiatus with the album &quot;Earl Scruggs and Friends&quot;, featuring Elton John, Sting, Don Henley, Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakam, Billy Bob Thornton, and Steve Martin. It includes the song &quot;Passin&#x27; Thru&quot;, written by Johnny Cash and Randy Scruggs. He also released a live album &quot;The Three Pickers&quot; with Doc Watson and Ricky Skaggs, recorded in Winston-Salem in December 2002.

==Banjos==
In the late 1950s Scruggs met with Bill Nelson, one of the owners of the Vega Musical Instrument Company in Boston, to sign a contract to design and endorse a new banjo to be called &quot;The Earl Scruggs Model&quot;. The company had made banjos since before 1912 and already had a Pete Seeger model. There would be four Scruggs models in the top-of-the-line banjos they produced. It was the first time a prominent bluegrass banjo player had played any brand other than a Gibson. Scruggs participated in Vega&#x27;s marketing campaign that claimed that the banjo was constructed to Scruggs&#x27;s design specifications, which was true, but the finished product fell short of his expectations. According to Scruggs&#x27;s friend and fellow banjoist, Curtis McPeake, Scruggs never cared for it. McPeake stated, &quot;They were good banjos, they just wasn&#x27;t [&quot;sic&quot;] what Earl wanted to play.&quot; Scruggs continued to perform and record using his Gibson Granada. The Vega company was sold to the C.F. Martin company in 1970, and the contract was dissolved.

In 1984, Gibson produced what Scruggs had wanted—the Gibson &quot;Earl Scruggs Standard&quot;, a replica of his personal 1934 Gibson Granada RB Mastertone banjo, number 9584-3. This banjo had been changed over its long existence and the only remaining original parts were the rim, the tone ring and the resonator (the wooden back of the instrument). The banjo was originally gold-plated, but the gold had long-since worn off and had been replaced with nickel hardware. Gibson elected to make the replica model nickel-plated as well, to look like Scruggs&#x27;s own. Scruggs&#x27;s actual 1934 model was previously owned by a series of influential players beginning with Snuffy Jenkins, who bought it for $37.50 at a pawn shop in South Carolina. Jenkins sold it to Don Reno, who sold it to Scruggs. When Scruggs acquired it, the instrument was in poor condition and he sent it to the Gibson Company for refurbishing, including a new fingerboard, pearl inlays, and a more slender neck. During this time Scruggs used his Gibson RB-3 for some of the Mercury recording sessions. Banjo enthusiasts have located the shipping records from Gibson to determine the exact dates the Granada Mastertone was missing on certain recordings.

On May 22, 2023, Scruggs&#x27;s personal Gibson Granada Mastertone, heard on &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;, was donated by the family to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to become part of the permanent collection. A ceremony to celebrate the gift was attended by a host of bluegrass, Americana, and country music stars.

==Louise Scruggs==

On December 14, 1946, 19-year-old Anne Louise Certain attended the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She went backstage after the performance to meet some of the performers, including Scruggs, who had been with Bill Monroe&#x27;s band about a year at that time. Scruggs and Certain began dating and fell in love. They were married about a year and a half later in April 1948. When Flatt and Scruggs formed the new group, Scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band, but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to communicate with venues, often at odd hours, was difficult. Louise had a business aptitude and began helping by doing the phone work. She eventually became the booking agent and ultimately the group&#x27;s manager, Nashville&#x27;s first woman to become prominent in that role. Her acumen and skills in the job were prescient. She turned the band into TV personalities and helped propel them into what today would be called rock stars, touring with Joan Baez and performing at the prestigious Newport Folk Festival. She recruited noted artist Thomas B. Allen, who had done covers for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to create cover illustrations for 17 of the group&#x27;s albums. She helped market the group to younger audiences at college campuses and arranged a live album to be recorded at Carnegie Hall. Earl Scruggs said, &quot;What talent I had never would have peaked without her. She helped shape music up as a business, instead of just people out picking and grinning.&quot; Louise died from complications of respiratory disease on February 2, 2006, at age 78, six years before her husband. In 2007, The Country Music Hall of Fame created The Louise Scruggs Memorial Forum, an annual event to honor a music industry business leader.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Scruggs received word that his mother, Lula, had suffered a stroke and heart attack in North Carolina. The only flight available from Nashville involved such a series of connecting cities that it was not feasible to fly. Scruggs and his wife, with sons Gary and Randy, decided to drive all night from Nashville to see her when they were involved in an automobile accident just east of Knoxville about 3 a.m. October 2. Their car was hit by a drunk driver, a Fort Campbell soldier who had pulled out from a side road into their path, then fled the scene after the collision. The children were not hurt, but Earl suffered a fractured pelvis and dislocations of both hips, which would plague him for years, and Louise had been thrown into the windshield, receiving multiple lacerations. They were flown to a Nashville hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months. He received thousands of letters from well-wishers. He returned to music in January 1956, about four months after the injury, but after working a week or so, one of the hips collapsed, and he returned to the hospital for a metal hip to be implanted. Seven years later, the other hip required similar surgery. The first metal hip lasted for some 40 years, but eventually failed, requiring a total hip replacement in October 1996, when he was age 72. While still in the recovery room after this hip operation, Scruggs suffered a heart attack; he was returned to the operating room later the same day for quintuple coronary bypass surgery. Despite the dire circumstances, he recovered and returned to his musical career.

Scruggs was involved in a solo plane crash in October 1975. He was flying his 1974 Cessna Skyhawk II aircraft home to Nashville around midnight from a performance of the Earl Scruggs Revue in Murray, Kentucky. On his landing approach he was enveloped in dense fog and overshot the runway at Cornelia Fort Airpark in Nashville and the plane flipped over. The automatic crash alert system in the plane did not function, and Scruggs remained without help for five hours. He crawled about 150 feet from the wreckage with a broken ankle, broken nose, and facial lacerations, afraid that the plane might catch fire. His family was driving home from the same concert and was unaware of the crash, but his niece became worried when he did not arrive. She called police at about 4 a.m., and they went to the airport, where they heard Scruggs&#x27;s cries for help from a field near the runway. He recovered, but was in a wheelchair for a few weeks, including for the premiere of the Scruggs documentary &quot;Banjoman&quot; at the Kennedy Center.

Steve Scruggs, Earl&#x27;s youngest son, was the drummer for the Earl Scruggs Revue at one point. He died in September 1992 of a self-inflicted gun shot after killing his wife, according to prosecutor Dent Moriss. Middle son Randy Scruggs, guitarist and music producer, died after a short illness on April 17, 2018, at the age of 64. Eldest son Gary Scruggs, also a musician, songwriter and music producer, died December 1, 2021, at age 72.

Every January for many years, Scruggs&#x27;s birthday was celebrated by a party at his home on Franklin Road in Nashville. After a buffet dinner, guests would gather in the living room for an informal &quot;pickin&#x27; party&quot; where some of country music&#x27;s best known stars would sing and play with no one around but family and close friends. The attendees over the years included Tom T. Hall, Béla Fleck, Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Tim O&#x27;Brien, Emmylou Harris, Mac Wiseman, Marty Stuart, Porter Wagoner, Bill Anderson, Jerry Douglas, Josh Graves and many others. At Scruggs&#x27;s 80th birthday party in 2004, country singer Porter Wagoner said, &quot;Earl is to the five-string banjo what Babe Ruth was to baseball. He is the best there ever was and the best there ever will be.&quot;

At age 88, Earl Scruggs died from natural causes on the morning of March 28, 2012, in a Nashville hospital. His funeral was held on Sunday, April 1, 2012, at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and was open to the public. He was buried at Spring Hill Cemetery in a private service.

==The Earl Scruggs Center==

The Earl Scruggs Center opened January 11, 2014—a $5.5 million, 100,000 square foot facility located in the court square of Shelby, North Carolina, at the renovated county courthouse. It showcases the musical contributions of Scruggs, the most eminent ambassador of the music of that region, and features a museum and a life-sized statue of Scruggs at a young age. The center received a $1.5 million economic development grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce and also funds from corporate donors. It serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students. The opening was celebrated by a sold-out concert by Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, Sam Bush, and others.

On January 6, 2024, on what would have been Scruggs&#x27;s 100th birthday, a memorial concert was held at Nashville&#x27;s Ryman Auditorium to benefit the Scruggs Center. At the concert, three dozen noted bluegrass artists, including Jerry Douglas, Béla Fleck, Sam Bush, The Earls of Leicester, Del McCoury, Sierra Hull and Jeff Hanna performed until nearly midnight.

<text>Gniezno (; ) is a city in central-western Poland, about east of Poznań. Its population in 2021 was 66,769, making it the sixth-largest city in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The city is the administrative seat of Gniezno County (&quot;powiat&quot;).

One of the Piast dynasty&#x27;s chief cities, it was the first historical capital of Poland in the 10th century and early 11th century, and afterwards remained one of the main cities of the historic region of Greater Poland. Gniezno is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno, the country&#x27;s oldest archdiocese, founded in 1000, and its archbishop is the primate of Poland, making the city the country&#x27;s ecclesiastical capital. The Gniezno Cathedral is one of the historically most important churches in Poland, and as such is a designated Historic Monument of Poland. Other sights include the Old Town and the Museum of the Origins of the Polish State.

==Geography==
Gniezno is one of the historic centers of the Greater Poland region, the cradle of the Polish state. Like Rome, Gniezno was founded on seven hills, including the , which is the location of the Gniezno Cathedral, and the Panieńskie Hill, which is the location of the &quot;Rynek&quot; (Market Square). Five lakes are located within the city limits: Winiary, Jelonek, Świętokrzyskie, Koszyk, Zacisze.

==History==
There are archaeological traces of human settlement since the late Paleolithic. Early Slavonic settlements on Lech Hill and Maiden Hill are dated to the 8th century. At the beginning of the 10th century this was the site of several places sacred to the Slavic religion. The ducal stronghold was founded just before 940 on Lech Hill, and surrounded by some fortified suburbs and open settlements.

===Legend of Lech, Czech and Rus===

According to the Polish version of a legend, three brothers went hunting together but each of them followed a different prey and eventually they all traveled in different directions. Rus went to the east, Čech headed to the west to settle on the Říp Mountain rising up from the Bohemian hilly countryside, while Lech traveled north. There, while hunting, he followed his arrow and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a fierce, white eagle guarding its nest from intruders. Seeing the eagle against the red of the setting sun, Lech took this as a good omen and decided to settle there. He named his settlement Gniezno (from Polish &quot;gniazdo&quot; – &#x27;nest&#x27;) in commemoration and adopted the White Eagle as his coat-of-arms. The white eagle remains a symbol of Poland to this day, and the colors of the eagle and the setting sun are depicted in Poland&#x27;s coat of arms, as well as its flag, with a white stripe on top for the eagle, and a red stripe on the bottom for the sunset. According to &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot; (13th century), Slavs are descendants of Pan, a Pannonian prince. He had three sons – Lech (the youngest), Rus, and Čech (the oldest), who decided to settle west, north, and east.

===Cradle of the Polish state===
Around 940 Gniezno, being an important pagan cult center, became one of the main fortresses of the early Piast rulers, along with aforementioned fortresses at Giecz, Kruszwica, Poznań, Kalisz, Łęczyca, Ostrów Lednicki, Płock, Włocławek, and others. Archeological excavations on Lech Hill in 2010 discovered an 11th-century tomb by the foundations of St. George&#x27;s church, near the remains of a pagan burial mound discovered earlier on the hill. Discoveries indicate that Lech Hill could have been the burial place of rulers even before the baptism of Mieszko I of Poland. After the adoption of Christianity by Mieszko I, his son Bolesław I the Brave deposited the remains of Saint Adalbert in a church, newly built on the Hill, to underline Gniezno&#x27;s importance as the religious centre and capital of his kingdom.

===Congress of Gniezno===
It is here that the Congress of Gniezno took place in the year 1000, during which Bolesław I the Brave, Duke of Poland, received Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. The emperor and the Polish duke celebrated the foundation of the Polish ecclesiastical province (archbishopric) in Gniezno, along with newly established bishoprics in Kołobrzeg for Pomerania; Wrocław for Silesia; Kraków for Lesser Poland in addition to the bishopric in Poznań for western Greater Poland, which was established in 968.

===Royal coronation site===
The 10th-century Gniezno Cathedral witnessed the royal coronations of Bolesław I in 1024 and his son Mieszko II Lambert in 1025. The cities of Gniezno and nearby Poznań were captured, plundered and destroyed in 1038 by the Bohemian duke Bretislav I, which pushed the next Polish rulers to move the Polish capital to Kraków. The archepiscopal cathedral was reconstructed by the next ruler, Bolesław II the Generous, who was crowned king here in 1076.

In the next centuries Gniezno evolved as a regional seat of the eastern part of Greater Poland, and in 1238 municipal autonomy was granted by the duke Władysław Odonic. Gniezno was again the coronation site in 1295 and 1300.

===Regional site of Greater Poland===

After an administrative reform Gniezno, as a royal city, became a county seat within the Kalisz Voivodeship (since the early 14th century till 1768). It was destroyed again by the Teutonic Knights&#x27; invasion in 1331. The city was soon rebuilt during the reign of King Casimir III the Great, while during the reign of King Władysław II Jagiełło, in 1419, the status of &quot;the capital of Christianity in Poland&quot; was confirmed after the archbishops of Gniezno were given the title of Primate of Poland. Trade flourished in Gniezno, four large annual fairs took place, in which merchants from various Polish cities and European countries took part. Crafts also developed, and Gniezno remained one of the major cities of Poland until the mid-17th century, even despite fires of 1515 and 1613.
It was devastated during the Swedish invasion wars of the 17th–18th centuries and by a plague in 1708–1710. All this caused depopulation and economic decline, but the city was soon revived during the 18th century to become the capital of the Gniezno Voivodeship within the larger Greater Poland Province in 1768. Gniezno remained one of the main cultural centres of the Polish Kingdom. The 11th Polish Infantry Regiment and 1st Polish National Cavalry Brigade were stationed there in 1790 and 1792, respectively.

===Late modern period===

Gniezno was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1793 Second Partition of Poland and renamed &quot;Gnesen&quot;, becoming part of the province of South Prussia. During the Kościuszko Uprising, the Polish army under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski liberated the town on 22 August 1794 and defeated a Prussian Army north of Gnesen near Labischin (Łabiszyn) on 29 September 1794. But because of Kościuszko&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Maciejowice he gave up his plan to winter in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and moved through Thorn (Toruń) and retreated to central Poland. Thus, the Prussians retook it on 7 December 1794. During the Napoleonic Wars there was an uprising against Prussian rule. The French appeared in Gnesen in November 1806, and following General Jan Henryk Dabrowski&#x27;s order issued to all towns and cities and country property owners to provide recruits for the organizing Polish forces, Gnesen initially provided 60 recruits who participated in the battles of 1806–07. The 9th Polish Infantry Regiment was formed in Gniezno in 1806. Consequently, the town, once again as &quot;Gniezno&quot;, was included within the Duchy of Warsaw, but upon the defeat of Napoleon in Russia in 1812 it was occupied by the Russian army and was returned to Prussia in the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Gnesen was subsequently governed within Kreis Gnesen of the Grand Duchy of Posen and the later Province of Posen. It was an important centre of Polish resistance against Germanisation policies, various Polish organizations and publishing houses were located there. In 1857, Jews accounted for 27 percent of the population, which number decreased by emigration to more developed towns of Germany to 14.5 percent in 1871.

In 1903, amid school strikes elsewhere in Prussian Poland, Prussian authorities arrested 50 Polish children and teachers in Gnesen on charges of high treason. They were accused of studying Polish culture and of &quot;conspiring against the well-being of the Prussian State&quot;.

Following the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919) and the Treaty of Versailles the town became part of the Second Polish Republic and reverted to its original name of Gniezno. 31 Polish insurgents from the city died in the Greater Poland Uprising. Its citizen-soldiers joined the Polish army fighting the Bolsheviks during the Polish–Soviet War. The first Polish folk high school was established in the present-day district of Dalki in 1921.

===World War II===

During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Gniezno was captured by Germans troops on 11 September 1939. On 26 October 1939 it was annexed into Nazi Germany as part of Reichsgau Wartheland. During the German occupation, local Poles were subjected to arrests, expulsions and mass executions. The Germans murdered several hundred inhabitants, and more than 10,000 inhabitants of the city and county were expelled to the General Government in the more-eastern part of German-occupied Poland or imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. A transit camp for Poles expelled from the region was operated in the city. Kidnapped Polish 12-year-old children were enslaved as forced labour in the city&#x27;s vicinity. In late 1940 at the Dziekanka (&quot;Tiegenhof&quot; in German) psychiatric institute near Gniezno, 1172 patients were evacuated and then killed. Again in late 1940 hundreds of patients were gassed in gas van by the Lange Commando, a sub-unit of Einsatzkommando 2. Despite this, Gniezno remained a center of Polish resistance, including the &quot;Tajna Organizacja Narodowa&quot; (Secret National Organization), which was founded in the city itself. Its commander Maksymilian Sikorski was eventually imprisoned in concentration camps.

After the city was seized by the Red Army on January 21, 1945, the Soviets fought the Polish underground and deported its members deep into the Soviet Union. The city itself was not seriously damaged during the war, however, in 1940, the Germans demolished the monument of King Bolesław I the Brave, which was rebuilt after the war. The city was subsequently restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

===Post-war period===

In August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the Solidarity organization, which played a central role in the end of communist rule in Poland. In 1979 and 1997, Pope John Paul II visited Gniezno. During the second visit, celebrations took place on the millennial anniversary of the death of St. Adalbert with the participation of presidents of seven Central European countries and 280,000 pilgrims from Poland and the world. In 2000, the millennial anniversary of the Congress of Gniezno was celebrated and on this occasion the Sejm was held in Gniezno, the only one held outside of Warsaw in recent decades.

==Archbishops of Gniezno==

Gniezno&#x27;s Roman Catholic archbishop is traditionally the Primate of Poland (&quot;Prymas Polski&quot;). After the partitions of Poland the see was often combined with others, first with Poznań and then with Warsaw. In 1992 Pope John Paul II reorganized the Polish hierarchy and the city once again had a separate bishop. Cardinal Józef Glemp, who had been archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw and retained Warsaw, was designated to remain Primate until his retirement, but afterward the Archbishop of Gniezno, at present Wojciech Polak, would again be Primate of Poland.

<text>The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, is one of the world&#x27;s largest museums and research centers dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of American vernacular music. Chartered in 1964, the museum has amassed one of the world&#x27;s most extensive musical collections.

==History of the museum==
The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is the world&#x27;s largest repository of country music artifacts. Early in the 1960s, as the Country Music Association&#x27;s (CMA) campaign to publicize country music was accelerating, CMA leaders determined that a new organization was needed to operate a country music museum and related activities beyond CMA&#x27;s scope as simply a trade organization. Toward this end, the nonprofit Country Music Foundation (CMF) was chartered by the state of Tennessee in 1964 to collect, preserve, and publicize information and artifacts relating to the history of country music. Through CMF, industry leaders raised money with the effort of CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador to build the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, which opened on April 1, 1967. The original building was a barn-shaped structure located at the head of Music Row, erected on the site of a small Nashville city park. This hall of fame was modeled after the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. At this point, artifacts began to be displayed and a small library was begun in a loft above one of the museum&#x27;s galleries.

Early in the 1970s, the basement of the museum building was partially complete, and library expansion began, embracing not only recordings, but also books and periodicals, sheet music and songbooks, photographs, business documents, and other materials. At the outset, CMA staff had run the museum, but by 1972, the museum (already governed by its own independent board of directors) acquired its own small staff.

Building expansion took place in 1974, 1977, and 1984 to store and display the museum&#x27;s growing collection of costumes, films, historic cars, musical instruments, and other artifacts. An education department was created to conduct ongoing programs with Middle Tennessee schools; an oral history program was begun; and a publications department was launched to handle books, as well as the &quot;Journal of Country Music.&quot;

==Current museum==
To become more accessible, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum moved to a new, facility in the heart of downtown Nashville&#x27;s arts and entertainment district in May 2001. In 2014, the museum unveiled a $100 million expansion, doubling its size to 350,000 square feet of galleries, archival storage, education classrooms, retail stores, and special event space.

In the museum&#x27;s core exhibition, &quot;Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music,&quot; visitors are immersed in the history and sounds of country music. The story is revealed through artifacts, photographs, text panels, recorded sound, vintage video, and interactive touchscreens. &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; is enhanced by rotating limited-engagement exhibits. The ACM Gallery and the Dinah and Fred Gretsch Family Gallery features artifacts from today&#x27;s country stars and a series of technology-enhanced activities. The ACM Gallery houses the annual exhibition, &quot;American Currents: State of Music&quot;, which chronicles country music&#x27;s most recent past.

In addition to the galleries, the museum has the 776-seat CMA Theater, the Taylor Swift Education Center, and multi-purpose event rental spaces. Other historic properties of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum include one of the country&#x27;s oldest letterpress print shop Hatch Show Print (located inside the museum) and Historic RCA Studio B (located on Music Row), Nashville&#x27;s oldest surviving recording studio, where recordings by Country Music Hall of Fame members Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, and many others were made.

The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum has developed multiple platforms to make its collection accessible to a wider audience. From weekly instrument demonstrations to its flagship songwriting program for schools, Words &amp; Music, the museum offers an aggressive schedule of educational and family programs. The museum also operates CMF Records, a Grammy-winning re-issue label (&quot;The Complete Hank Williams&quot; and &quot;Night Train to Nashville: Music City Rhythm &amp; Blues, 1945–1970)&quot;; and CMF Press, a publishing imprint that has released books in cooperation with Vanderbilt University Press and other major trade publishing houses.

The Hall of Fame Rotunda features a mural, &quot;The Sources of Country Music&quot;, by Thomas Hart Benton. It was Benton&#x27;s final work; as he died in his studio while completing it.

==The Country Music Hall of Fame==

For a professional in the country music field, membership in the Country Music Hall of Fame, is the highest honor the genre can bestow. An invitation can be extended to performers, songwriters, broadcasters, musicians, and executives in recognition of their contributions to the development of country music. The hall of fame honor was created in 1961 by the Country Music Association (CMA); the first inductees were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, and Fred Rose. Roy Acuff, the first living artist to join the Hall of Fame, was elected in 1962. The most recent inductees (class of 2024) are John Anderson, James Burton, and Toby Keith.

Over the Hall of Fame&#x27;s history, the number of new members inducted each year has varied from one to twelve (no nominee was inducted in 1963, no candidate having received sufficient votes). Election to the Country Music Hall of Fame is solely the prerogative of the CMA. New members, elected annually by a panel of industry executives chosen by the CMA, are inducted formally during the Medallion Ceremony, part of the annual reunion of Country Music Hall of Fame members hosted by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. The Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization and does not participate in the election.

Bas-relief portraits (similar to that in the Baseball Hall of Fame in New York) cast in bronze honoring each Hall of Fame member were originally displayed at the Tennessee State Museum in downtown Nashville until the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum opened its own building in April 1967; in this barn-roofed facility at the head of Music Row, the bronze plaques formed a special exhibit. Through a licensing agreement with the CMA, the Museum exhibits the bronze plaques commemorating membership in a space and fashion befitting the honor.

== The Museum collection ==
The museum&#x27;s collections document country music from its folk roots through today. Artifacts and archival materials not on exhibit are housed in the museum&#x27;s 46,000 square foot secure, climate-controlled collections storage rooms and in the Frist Library and Archives, located on museum&#x27;s third floor. The collection includes: 
* The Bob Pinson Recorded Sound Collection comprising over 250,000 sound recordings, including an estimated 98% of all pre-World War II country recordings released commercially
* Approximately 500,000 photographic prints, negatives, transparencies and digital images
* More than 30,000 moving images on film, video and digital formats
* Over 900 musical instruments, including Mother Maybelle Carter&#x27;s Gibson L-5 guitar, Bob Wills&#x27;s fiddle, Chet Atkins&#x27;s 1950 D&#x27;Angelico archtop guitar and Bill Monroe&#x27;s mandolin
* Thousands of stage costumes and accessories, from rhinestone-encrusted &quot;Nudie suits&quot; to homemade cotton dresses, formal gowns, cowboy boots, hats, and jeans
* Oral histories, handwritten song manuscripts, scrapbooks, correspondence, fan club newsletters, sheet music, business documents, periodicals, and books
* Iconic Vehicles: Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1960 &quot;Solid Gold&quot; Cadillac limousine, Webb Pierce&#x27;s 1962 Pontiac Bonneville convertible, and Jerry Reed&#x27;s 1980 Pontiac Trans Am from &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;.

== Architecture and design ==

The downtown building was designed by Nashville&#x27;s Tuck-Hinton Architectural Firm with Seab Tuck as the project architect. When viewed from the air, the building forms a massive bass clef. The point on the sweeping arch of the building suggests the tailfin of a 1959 Cadillac sedan. The building&#x27;s front windows resemble piano keys. The tower on top of the Rotunda that extends down the Hall of Fame is a replica of the distinctive diamond-shaped WSM radio tower, which was originally built in 1932 just south of Nashville and is still in operation.

The Rotunda itself is replete with symbolic architectural elements. For example, the exterior of this cylindrical structure can be viewed variously as a drum kit, a rural water tower, or grain silo. The four disc tiers of the Rotunda&#x27;s roof evoke the evolution of recording technology—the 78, the vinyl LP, the 45, and the CD. Stone bars on the Rotunda&#x27;s outside wall symbolize the notes of the Carter Family&#x27;s classic song &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;, while the title of the song rings the interior of the structure. The Hall of Fame member&#x27;s plaques housed within the Rotunda are reminiscent of notes on a musical staff.

Solid, earthy materials native to the Mid-South—wood, concrete, steel, and stone—were used in the building&#x27;s construction as a reminder of the music&#x27;s strong roots in the lives of working Americans. Georgia yellow pine adorns the floors of the Conservatory and is also found in the Hall of Fame Rotunda the Ford Theater. Crab Orchard Stone from the East Tennessee mountains lend a homey, rustic touch to the Conservatory&#x27;s &quot;front porch&quot; atmosphere and is also found on the Rotunda&#x27;s walls. The large steel beams supporting the Conservatory&#x27;s glass ceiling and walls conjure up images of rural railroad bridges. In another transportation metaphor, the cascading water along the Grand Staircase calls to mind the mighty rivers that have inspired so much of our nation&#x27;s music and have physically connected musicians in various regions of the nations.

Musical symbolism continues within the museum galleries. Hardwood floors, curtain-like exhibit-case fronts, and low hanging lights suspended by cables create the backstage atmosphere of the Third Floor. Similarly, modular exhibit stations and vinyl floors evoke a recording studio environment on the Second Floor.

<doc id="60633" wikidata="Q9106" url="?curid=60633" title="Dmitri Mendeleev">
<text>Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev ( ; 2 February [O.S. 20 January] 1907) was a Russian chemist known for formulating the periodic law and creating a version of the periodic table of elements. He used the periodic law not only to correct the then-accepted properties of some known elements, such as the valence and atomic weight of uranium, but also to predict the properties of three elements that were yet to be discovered (germanium, gallium and scandium).

==Early life==

Mendeleev was born in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia, to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev (1783–1847) and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva (née Kornilieva) (1793–1850). Ivan worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy at the Tambov and Saratov gymnasiums. Ivan&#x27;s father, Pavel Maximovich Sokolov, was a Russian Orthodox priest from the Tver region. As per the tradition of priests of that time, Pavel&#x27;s children were given new family names while attending the theological seminary, with Ivan getting the family name Mendeleev after the name of a local landlord.

Maria Kornilieva came from a well-known family of Tobolsk merchants, founders of the first Siberian printing house who traced their ancestry to Yakov Korniliev, a 17th-century posad man turned a wealthy merchant. In 1889, a local librarian published an article in the Tobolsk newspaper where he claimed that Yakov was a baptized Teleut, an ethnic minority known as &quot;white Kalmyks&quot; at the time. Since no sources were provided and no documented facts of Yakov&#x27;s life were ever revealed, biographers generally dismiss it as a myth. In 1908, shortly after Mendeleev&#x27;s death, one of his nieces published &quot;Family Chronicles. Memories about D. I. Mendeleev&quot; where she voiced &quot;a family legend&quot; about Maria&#x27;s grandfather who married &quot;a Kyrgyz or Tatar beauty whom he loved so much that when she died, he also died from grief&quot;. This, however, contradicts the documented family chronicles, and neither of those legends is supported by Mendeleev&#x27;s autobiography, his daughter&#x27;s or his wife&#x27;s memoirs. Yet some Western scholars still refer to Mendeleev&#x27;s supposed &quot;Mongol&quot;, &quot;Tatar&quot;, &quot;Tartarian&quot; or simply &quot;Asian&quot; ancestry as a fact.

Mendeleev was raised as an Orthodox Christian, his mother encouraging him to &quot;patiently search divine and scientific truth&quot;. His son Ivan would later inform that Mendeleev had departed from the Church and embraced a form of &quot;romanticized deism&quot;.

Mendeleev was the youngest of 17 siblings, of whom &quot;only 14 stayed alive to be baptized&quot; according to Mendeleev&#x27;s brother Pavel, meaning the others died soon after their birth. The exact number of Mendeleev&#x27;s siblings differs among sources and is still a matter of some historical dispute. Unfortunately for the family&#x27;s financial well-being, his father became blind and lost his teaching position. His mother was forced to work and she restarted her family&#x27;s abandoned glass factory. At the age of 13, after the passing of his father and the destruction of his mother&#x27;s factory by fire, Mendeleev attended the Gymnasium in Tobolsk.

In 1849, his mother took Mendeleev across Russia from Siberia to Moscow with the aim of getting Mendeleev enrolled at the Moscow University. The university in Moscow did not accept him. The mother and son continued to Saint Petersburg to the father&#x27;s alma mater. The now poor Mendeleev family relocated to Saint Petersburg, where he entered the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1850. After graduation, he contracted tuberculosis, causing him to move to the Crimean Peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea in 1855. While there, he became a science master of the 1st Simferopol Gymnasium. In 1857, he returned to Saint Petersburg with fully restored health.

Between 1859 and 1861, he worked on the capillarity of liquids and the workings of the spectroscope in Heidelberg. Later in 1861, he published a textbook named &quot;Organic Chemistry&quot;. This won him the Demidov Prize of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

On 4 April 1862, he became engaged to Feozva Nikitichna Leshcheva, and they married on 27 April 1862 at Nikolaev Engineering Institute&#x27;s church in Saint Petersburg (where he taught).

Mendeleev became a professor at the Saint Petersburg Technological Institute and Saint Petersburg State University in 1864, and 1865, respectively. In 1865, he became a Doctor of Science for his dissertation &quot;On the Combinations of Water with Alcohol&quot;. He achieved tenure in 1867 at St. Petersburg University and started to teach inorganic chemistry while succeeding Voskresenskii to this post; by 1871, he had transformed Saint Petersburg into an internationally recognized center for chemistry research.

==Periodic table==

In 1863, there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately one per year. Other scientists had previously identified periodicity of elements. John Newlands described a Law of Octaves, noting their periodicity according to relative atomic weight in 1864, publishing it in 1865. His proposal identified the potential for new elements such as germanium. The concept was criticized, and his innovation was not recognized by the Society of Chemists until 1887. Another person to propose a periodic table was Lothar Meyer, who published a paper in 1864 describing 28 elements classified by their valence, but with no predictions of new elements.

After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev wrote &quot;Principles of Chemistry&quot; (), which became the definitive textbook of its time. It was published in two volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his course. This is when he made his most important discovery. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream:

Unaware of the earlier work on periodic tables going on in the 1860s, he made the following table:
By adding additional elements following this pattern, Mendeleev developed his extended version of the periodic table. On 6 March 1869, he made a formal presentation to the Russian Chemical Society, titled &quot;The Dependence between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements&quot;, which described elements according to both atomic weight (now called &quot;relative atomic mass&quot;) and valence. This presentation stated that
# The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weight, exhibit an apparent periodicity of properties.
# Elements which are similar regarding their chemical properties either have similar atomic weights (e.g., Pt, Ir, Os) or have their atomic weights increasing regularly (e.g., K, Rb, Cs).
# The arrangement of the elements in groups of elements in the order of their atomic weights corresponds to their so-called valencies, as well as, to some extent, to their distinctive chemical properties; as is apparent among other series in that of Li, Be, B, C, N, O, and F.
# The elements which are the most widely diffused have small atomic weights.
# The magnitude of the atomic weight determines the character of the element, just as the magnitude of the molecule determines the character of a compound body.
# We must expect the discovery of many yet unknown elements – for example, two elements, analogous to aluminium and silicon, whose atomic weights would be between 65 and 75.
# The atomic weight of an element may sometimes be amended by a knowledge of those of its contiguous elements. Thus the atomic weight of tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128. (Tellurium&#x27;s atomic weight is 127.6, and Mendeleev was incorrect in his assumption that atomic weight must increase with position within a period.)
# Certain characteristic properties of elements can be foretold from their atomic weights.

Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to complete the table in a Russian-language journal. Only a few months after, Meyer published a virtually identical table in a German-language journal. Mendeleev has the distinction of accurately predicting the properties of what he called ekasilicon, ekaaluminium and ekaboron (germanium, gallium and scandium, respectively).

Mendeleev also proposed changes in the properties of some known elements. Prior to his work, uranium was supposed to have valence 3 and atomic weight about 120. Mendeleev realized that these values did not fit in his periodic table, and doubled both to valence 6 and atomic weight 240 (close to the modern value of 238).

For his predicted three elements, he used the prefixes of eka, dvi, and tri (Sanskrit one, two, three) in their naming. Mendeleev questioned some of the currently accepted atomic weights (they could be measured only with a relatively low accuracy at that time), pointing out that they did not correspond to those suggested by his Periodic Law. He noted that tellurium has a higher atomic weight than iodine, but he placed them in the right order, incorrectly predicting that the accepted atomic weights at the time were at fault. He was puzzled about where to put the known lanthanides, and predicted the existence of another row to the table which were the actinides which were some of the heaviest in atomic weight. Some people dismissed Mendeleev for predicting that there would be more elements, but he was proven to be correct when Ga (gallium) and Ge (germanium) were found in 1875 and 1886 respectively, fitting perfectly into the two missing spaces.

By using Sanskrit prefixes to name &quot;missing&quot; elements, Mendeleev may have recorded his debt to the Sanskrit grammarians of ancient India, who had created theories of language based on their discovery of the two-dimensional patterns of speech sounds (exemplified by the Śivasūtras in Pāṇini&#x27;s Sanskrit grammar). Mendeleev was a friend and colleague of the Sanskritist Otto von Böhtlingk, who was preparing the second edition of his book on Pāṇini at about this time, and Mendeleev wished to honor Pāṇini with his nomenclature.

The original draft made by Mendeleev would be found years later and published under the name &quot;Tentative System of Elements.&quot;

Dmitri Mendeleev is often referred to as the Father of the Periodic Table. He called his table or matrix, &quot;the Periodic System&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1876, he became obsessed with Anna Ivanova Popova and began courting her; in 1881 he proposed to her and threatened suicide if she refused. His divorce from Leshcheva was finalized one month after he had married Popova (on 2 April) in early 1882. Even after the divorce, Mendeleev was technically a bigamist; the Russian Orthodox Church required at least seven years before lawful remarriage. His divorce and the surrounding controversy contributed to his failure to be admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences (despite his international fame by that time). His daughter from his second marriage, Lyubov, became the wife of the famous Russian poet Alexander Blok. His other children were son Vladimir (a sailor, he took part in the notable Eastern journey of Nicholas II) and daughter Olga, from his first marriage to Feozva, and son Ivan and twins from Anna.

Though Mendeleev was widely honored by scientific organizations all over Europe, including (in 1882) the Davy Medal from the Royal Society of London (which later also awarded him the Copley Medal in 1905), he resigned from Saint Petersburg University on 17 August 1890. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1892, and in 1893 he was appointed director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, a post which he occupied until his death.

Mendeleev also investigated the composition of petroleum, and helped to found the first oil refinery in Russia. He recognized the importance of petroleum as a feedstock for petrochemicals. He is credited with a remark that burning petroleum as a fuel &quot;would be akin to firing up a kitchen stove with bank notes&quot;.

Mendeleev was nominated for Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the last three years of his life, 1905, 1906 and 1907 in 9 nominations.
In 1905, Mendeleev was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and received three nominations. The following year he received four nominations and the Nobel Committee for Chemistry recommended to the Swedish Academy to award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1906 to Mendeleev for his discovery of the periodic system. He was also elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. The Chemistry Section of the Swedish Academy supported this recommendation. The academy was then supposed to approve the committee&#x27;s choice, as it has done in almost every case. Unexpectedly, at the full meeting of the academy, a dissenting member of the Nobel Committee, Peter Klason, proposed the candidacy of Henri Moissan whom he favored. Svante Arrhenius, although not a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, had a great deal of influence in the academy and also pressed for the rejection of Mendeleev, arguing that the periodic system was too old to acknowledge its discovery in 1906. According to the contemporaries, Arrhenius was motivated by the grudge he held against Mendeleev for his critique of Arrhenius&#x27;s dissociation theory. After heated arguments, the majority of the academy chose Moissan by a margin of one vote. The two nominations of Mendeleev in 1907 were again frustrated by the absolute opposition of Arrhenius.

In 1907, Mendeleev died at the age of 72 in Saint Petersburg from influenza, just 6 days short of his 73rd birthday. His last words were to his physician: &quot;Doctor, you have science, I have faith,&quot; which is possibly a Jules Verne quote.

==Other achievements==

Mendeleev made other important contributions to science. The Russian chemist and science historian Lev Chugaev characterized him as
&quot;a chemist of genius, first-class physicist, a fruitful researcher in the fields of hydrodynamics, meteorology, geology, certain branches of chemical technology (explosives, petroleum, and fuels, for example) and other disciplines adjacent to chemistry and physics, a thorough expert of chemical industry and industry in general, and an original thinker in the field of economy [...]&quot;

Mendeleev was one of the founders, in 1868, of the . He worked on the theory and practice of protectionist trade and on agriculture.

In an attempt at a chemical conception of the aether, he put forward a hypothesis that there existed two inert chemical elements of lesser atomic weight than hydrogen. Of these two proposed elements, he thought the lighter to be an all-penetrating, all-pervasive gas, and the slightly heavier one to be a proposed element, &quot;coronium&quot;.

Mendeleev devoted much study and made important contributions to the determination of the nature of such indefinite compounds as solutions.
In another department of physical chemistry, he investigated the expansion of liquids with heat, and devised a formula similar to Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law of the uniformity of the expansion of gases, while in 1861 he anticipated Thomas Andrews&#x27; conception of the critical temperature of gases by defining the absolute boiling-point of a substance as the temperature at which cohesion and heat of vaporization become equal to zero and the liquid changes to vapor, irrespective of the pressure and volume.

Mendeleev is given credit for the introduction of the metric system to the Russian Empire.

He invented &quot;pyrocollodion&quot;, a kind of smokeless powder based on nitrocellulose. This work had been commissioned by the Russian Navy, which however did not adopt its use. In 1892 Mendeleev organized its manufacture.

Mendeleev studied the origins of petroleum; he concluded that hydrocarbons are abiogenic and form deep within the earth – see Abiogenic petroleum origin.
He wrote: &quot;The capital fact to note is that petroleum was born in the depths of the earth, and it is only there that we must seek its origin.&quot;

==Activities beyond chemistry==
Beginning in the 1870s, he published widely beyond chemistry, looking at aspects of Russian industry, and technical issues in agricultural productivity. He explored demographic issues, sponsored studies of the Arctic Sea, tried to measure the efficacy of chemical fertilizers, and promoted the merchant navy. He was especially active in improving the Russian petroleum industry, making detailed comparisons with the more advanced industry in Pennsylvania. Although not well-grounded in economics, he had observed industry throughout his European travels, and in 1891 he helped convince the Ministry of Finance to impose temporary tariffs with the aim of fostering Russian infant industries.

In 1890 he resigned his professorship at St. Petersburg University following a dispute with officials at the Ministry of Education over the treatment of university students. In 1892 he was appointed director of Russia&#x27;s Central Bureau of Weights and Measures, and led the way to standardize fundamental prototypes and measurement procedures. He set up an inspection system, and introduced the metric system to Russia.

He debated against the scientific claims of spiritualism, arguing that metaphysical idealism was no more than ignorant superstition. He bemoaned the widespread acceptance of spiritualism in Russian culture, and its negative effects on the study of science.

===Vodka myth===
A very popular Russian story credits Mendeleev with setting the 40% standard strength of vodka. For example, Russian Standard vodka advertises: &quot;In 1894, Dmitri Mendeleev, the greatest scientist in all Russia, received the decree to set the Imperial quality standard for Russian vodka and the &#x27;Russian Standard&#x27; was born&quot; Others cite &quot;the highest quality of Russian vodka approved by the royal government commission headed by Mendeleev in 1894&quot;.

In fact, the 40% standard was already introduced by the Russian government in 1843, when Mendeleev was nine years old. It is true that Mendeleev in 1892 became head of the Archive of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg, and evolved it into a government bureau the following year, but that institution was charged with standardising Russian trade weights and measuring instruments, not setting any production quality standards. Also, Mendeleev&#x27;s 1865 doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;A Discourse on the combination of alcohol and water&quot;, but it only discussed medical-strength alcohol concentrations over 70%, and he never wrote anything about vodka.

==Commemoration==

A number of places and objects are associated with the name and achievements of the scientist.

In Saint Petersburg his name was given to D. I. Mendeleev Institute for Metrology, the National Metrology Institute, dealing with establishing and supporting national and worldwide standards for precise measurements. Next to it there is a monument to him that consists of his sitting statue and a depiction of his periodic table on the wall of the establishment.

In the Twelve Collegia building, now being the centre of Saint Petersburg State University and in Mendeleev&#x27;s time – Head Pedagogical Institute – there is Dmitry Mendeleev&#x27;s Memorial Museum Apartment with his archives. The street in front of these is named after him as Mendeleevskaya liniya (Mendeleev Line).

In Moscow, there is the D. Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology of Russia.

Mendelevium, which is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Md (formerly Mv) and the atomic number 101, was named after Mendeleev. It is a metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series, usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles.

The mineral mendeleevite-Ce, , was named in Mendeleev&#x27;s honor in 2010. The related species mendeleevite-Nd, , was described in 2015.

A large lunar impact crater Mendeleev, that is located on the far side of the Moon, also bears the name of the scientist.

The Russian Academy of Sciences has occasionally awarded a Mendeleev Golden Medal since 1965.

On 8 February 2016, Google celebrated Dmitri Mendeleev&#x27;s 182nd Birthday with a doodle.

<doc id="60635" wikidata="Q1501412" url="?curid=60635" title="Glucose tolerance test">
<text>The glucose tolerance test (GTT, not to be confused with GGT test) is a medical test in which glucose is given and blood samples taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood. The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired beta cell function, and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia and acromegaly, or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. In the most commonly performed version of the test, an &quot;oral glucose tolerance test&quot; (OGTT), a standard dose of glucose is ingested by mouth and blood levels are checked two hours later. Many variations of the GTT have been devised over the years for various purposes, with different standard doses of glucose, different routes of administration, different intervals and durations of sampling, and various substances measured in addition to blood glucose.

==History==
The glucose tolerance test was first described in 1923 by Jerome W. Conn.

The test was based on the previous work in 1913 by A. T. B. Jacobson in determining that carbohydrate ingestion results in blood glucose fluctuations, and the premise (named the Staub-Traugott Phenomenon after its first observers H. Staub in 1921 and K. Traugott in 1922) that a normal patient fed glucose will rapidly return to normal levels of blood glucose after an initial spike, and will see improved reaction to subsequent glucose feedings.

==Testing==
Since the 1970s, the World Health Organization and other organizations interested in diabetes agreed on a standard dose and duration.

===Preparation===
The patient is instructed not to restrict carbohydrate intake in the days or weeks before the test. The test should not be done during an illness, as results may not reflect the patient&#x27;s glucose metabolism when healthy. A full adult dose should not be given to a person weighing less than 42.6 kg (94 lb), or the excessive glucose may produce a false positive result. Usually the OGTT is performed in the morning as glucose tolerance can exhibit a diurnal rhythm with a significant decrease in the afternoon. The patient is instructed to fast (water is allowed) for 8–12 hours prior to the tests. Medication such as large doses of salicylates, diuretics, anticonvulsants, and oral contraceptives affect the glucose tolerance test.

===Procedure===
# A zero time (baseline) blood sample is drawn.
# The patient is then given a measured dose (below) of glucose solution to drink within a 5-minute time frame.
# Blood is drawn at intervals for measurement of glucose (blood sugar), and sometimes insulin levels. The intervals and number of samples vary according to the purpose of the test. For simple diabetes screening, the most important sample is the 2 hour sample and the 0 and 2 hour samples may be the only ones collected. A laboratory may continue to collect blood for up to 6 hours depending on the protocol requested by the physician.

===Dose of glucose and variations===
* 75 g of oral dose is the recommendation of the WHO to be used in all adults, and is the main dosage used in the United States. The dose is adjusted for weight only in children. The dose should be drunk within 5 minutes.
* A variant is often used in pregnancy to screen for gestational diabetes, with a screening test of 50 g over one hour. If elevated, this is followed with a test of 100 g over three hours.
* In UK general practice, the standard glucose load was provided by 394 ml of the energy drink Lucozade with original carbonated flavour, but this is being superseded by purpose-made drinks.

===Substances measured and variations===
If renal glycosuria (sugar excreted in the urine despite normal levels in the blood) is suspected, urine samples may also be collected for testing along with the fasting and 2 hour blood tests.

==Results==
* &quot;Fasting plasma glucose&quot; (measured before the OGTT begins) should be below 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Fasting levels between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L (100 and 125 mg/dL) indicate prediabetes (&quot;impaired fasting glucose&quot;), and fasting levels repeatedly at or above 7.0 mmol/L (&gt;126 mg/dL) are diagnostic of diabetes.
* For a &quot;2 hour GTT&quot; with 75 g intake, a glucose level below 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) is normal, whereas higher levels indicate hyperglycemia. Blood plasma glucose between 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) indicate &quot;impaired glucose tolerance&quot;, and levels at or above 11.1 mmol/L at 2 hours confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.

For gestational diabetes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a two-step procedure, wherein the first step is a 50 g glucose dose. If after 1 hour the blood glucose level is more than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), it is followed by a 100 g glucose dose. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is then defined by a blood glucose level meeting or exceeding the cutoff values on at least two intervals, with cutoffs as follows:
* Before glucose intake (fasting): 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL)
* 1 hour after drinking the glucose solution: 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)
* 2 hours: 8.6 mmol/L (155 mg/dL)
* 3 hours: 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)

==Sample method==
The diagnosis criteria stated above by the World Health Organization (WHO) are for venous samples only (a blood sample taken from a vein in the arm). An increasingly popular method for measuring blood glucose is to sample capillary or finger-prick blood, which is less invasive, more convenient for the patient and requires minimal training to conduct. Though fasting blood glucose levels have been shown to be similar in both capillary and venous samples, postprandial blood glucose levels (those measured after a meal) can vary. The diagnosis criteria issued by the WHO are only suitable for venous blood samples. Given the increasing popularity of capillary testing, the WHO has recommended that a conversion factor between the two sample types be calculated, but no conversion factor had been issued by the WHO, despite some medical professionals adopting their own. A 2020 study on pregnant women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) found that 0-hour venous and capillary levels were similar, but that 2-hour samples were different. The authors compared their study with others, and concluded that capillary samples could be used for diagnosis of GDM during pregnancy using corrected cutoffs with acceptable accuracy in an antenatal care setting.

==Variations==
A standard two-hour GTT (glucose tolerance test) is sufficient to diagnose or exclude all forms of diabetes mellitus at all but the earliest stages of development.

Longer tests have been used for a variety of other purposes, such as detecting reactive hypoglycemia or defining subsets of hypothalamic obesity. Insulin levels are sometimes measured to detect insulin resistance or deficiency.

The GTT (glucose tolerance test) is of limited value in the diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia, since normal levels do not preclude the diagnosis, abnormal levels do not prove that the patient&#x27;s other symptoms are related to a demonstrated atypical OGTT, and many people without symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia may have the late low glucose.

==Oral glucose challenge test==

The oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) is a short version of the OGTT, used to check pregnant women for signs of gestational diabetes. It can be done at any time of day, not on an empty stomach. The test involves 50 g of glucose, with a reading after one hour.

==Limitations of OGTT==
The OGTT does not distinguish between insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and reduced capacity of the pancreas beta-cells to produce insulin. The OGTT is less accurate than the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique (the &quot;gold standard&quot; for measuring insulin resistance), or the insulin tolerance test, but is technically less difficult. Neither of the two technically demanding tests can be easily applied in a clinical setting or used in epidemiological studies. HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment) is a convenient way of measuring insulin resistance in normal subjects, which can be used in epidemiological studies, but can give erroneous results for diabetic patients.

<doc id="60636" wikidata="Q755966" url="?curid=60636" title="Battle of Nineveh (627)">
<text>The Battle of Nineveh was the climactic battle of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628.

In mid-September 627, Heraclius invaded Sasanian Mesopotamia in a surprising, risky winter campaign. Khosrow II appointed Rhahzadh as the commander of an army to confront him. Heraclius&#x27; Göktürk allies quickly deserted, while Rhahzadh&#x27;s reinforcements did not arrive in time. In the ensuing battle, Rhahzadh was slain and the remaining Sasanian forces retreated.

The Byzantine victory later resulted in civil war in Persia, and for a period of time restored the (Eastern) Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries in the Middle East. The Sasanian civil war significantly weakened the Sasanian Empire, contributing to the Muslim conquest of Persia.

==Prelude==
When Emperor Maurice was murdered by the usurper Phocas, Khosrow II declared war under the pretext of avenging his benefactor&#x27;s death. While the Persians were successful over the course of earlier stages in the war, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, and even some of Anatolia, the resurgence of Heraclius eventually led to the Persians&#x27; downfall. Heraclius&#x27; campaigns tilted the balance towards the Romans, forcing the Persians on the defensive. Allied with the Avars, the Persians attempted to take Constantinople, but were defeated.

While the Siege of Constantinople was taking place, Heraclius allied with what Byzantine sources called the Khazars under Ziebel, who are identified with the Western Turkic Khaganate of the Göktürks led by Tong Yabghu, plying him with wondrous gifts and a promise of the reward of the porphyrogenita Eudoxia Epiphania. The Caucasus-based Turks responded by sending 40,000 of their men to invade the Caucasus in 626, inciting the Perso-Turkic war of 627–629. Joint Byzantine and Göktürk operations were focused on besieging Tiflis.

==Invasion of Mesopotamia==
In mid-September 627, leaving Ziebel to continue the Siege of Tbilisi, Heraclius invaded the Persian Empire, this time with between 25,000 and 50,000 troops and 40,000 Göktürks. The Göktürks, however, quickly deserted him because of the strange winter conditions. Heraclius was tailed by Rhahzadh&#x27;s army of 12,000, but managed to evade Rhahzadh and entered Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Heraclius acquired food and fodder from the countryside, so Rhahzadh, following through countryside already stripped, could not easily find provisions for his soldiers and animals.

On 1 December, Heraclius crossed the Great Zab River and camped near the ruins of the capital of the former Assyrian Empire of Nineveh in Persian ruled Assyria/Assuristan. This was a movement from south to north, contrary to the expectation of a southward advance. However, this can be seen as a way to avoid being trapped by the Persian army in case of a defeat. Rhahzadh approached Nineveh from a different position. News that 3,000 Persian reinforcements were approaching reached Heraclius, forcing him to counteract. He gave the appearance of retreating from Persia by crossing the Tigris.

==Field of battle==
Heraclius had found a plain west of the Great Zab some distance from the ruins of Nineveh. This allowed the Byzantines to take advantage of their strengths in lances and hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, fog reduced the Persian advantage in missile-shooting soldiers and allowed the Byzantines to charge without great losses from missile barrages. Walter Kaegi believes that this battle took place near Karamlays Creek.

==Battle==
On 12 December, Rhahzadh deployed his forces into three masses and attacked. Heraclius feigned retreat to lead the Persians to the plains before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians. After eight hours of fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills. 6,000 Persians fell.

Nikephoros&#x27; &quot;Brief History&quot; tells that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to single combat. Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought and also lost. The account of another Byzantine historian, Theophanes the Confessor, supports this. However, doubt has been cast on whether or not this actually occurred. In any case, Rhahzadh died at some point during the battle.

The 3,000 Persian reinforcements arrived too late for the battle.

==Aftermath==

The victory at Nineveh was not total as the Byzantines were unable to capture the Persian camp. However, the victory was effective in preventing further Persian resistance.

With no Persian army left to oppose him, Heraclius&#x27; victorious army plundered Dastagird, Khosrow&#x27;s palace, and gained tremendous riches while recovering 300 captured Byzantine/Roman standards accumulated over years of warfare. Khosrow had already fled to the mountains of Susiana to try to rally support for the defense of Ctesiphon. Heraclius could not attack Ctesiphon itself because the Nahrawan Canal was blocked by the collapse of a bridge.

The Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrow II, raising his son Kavad II, also known as Siroes, in his stead. Khosrow perished in a dungeon after suffering for five days on bare sustenance—he was shot to death slowly with arrows on the fifth day. Kavad immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, and of great spiritual significance, the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614. The battle was the last conflict of the Roman–Persian Wars.

<doc id="60637" wikidata="Q1762220" url="?curid=60637" title="Skene's gland">
<text>In female human anatomy, Skene&#x27;s glands or the Skene glands ( , also known as the lesser vestibular glands or paraurethral glands) are two glands located towards the lower end of the urethra. The glands are surrounded by tissue that swells with blood during sexual arousal, and secrete a fluid, carried by the Skene&#x27;s ducts to openings near the urethral meatus, particularly during orgasm.

==Structure and function==
The Skene&#x27;s glands&#x27; openings are located in the vestibule of the vulva, around the lower end of the urethra. The two Skene&#x27;s ducts lead from the Skene&#x27;s glands to the vulvar vestibule, to the left and right of the urethral opening, from which they are structurally capable of secreting fluid. Although there remains debate about the function of the Skene&#x27;s glands, one purpose is to secrete a fluid that helps lubricate the urethral opening.

Skene&#x27;s glands produce a milk-like ultrafiltrate of blood plasma. The glands may be the source of female ejaculation, but this has not been proven. Because they and the male prostate act similarly by secreting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is an ejaculate protein produced in males, and prostatic acid phosphatase, some authors refer to the Skene&#x27;s glands as the &quot;female prostate&quot;. They are homologous to the male prostate (developed from the same embryological tissues), but the homology is still a matter of research. Female ejaculate may result from sexual activity for some women, especially during orgasm. In addition to PSA and acid phosphatase, Skene&#x27;s gland fluid contains high concentrations of glucose and fructose.

In an amount of a few milliliters, fluid is secreted from these glands when stimulated from inside the vagina. Female ejaculation and squirting (secretion of large amounts of fluid) are believed by researchers to be two different processes. They may occur in combination during orgasm. Squirting alone is a sudden expulsion of liquid that at least partly comes from the bladder and contains urine, whereas ejaculation fluid includes a whitish transparent ejaculate that appears to come from the Skene&#x27;s gland.

==Clinical significance==

Disorders of the Skene&#x27;s glands may include:
* Infection (called skenitis, urethral syndrome, or female prostatitis)
* Skene&#x27;s duct cyst: lined by stratified squamous epithelium, the cyst is caused by obstruction of the Skene&#x27;s glands. It is located lateral to the urinary meatus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for diagnosis. The cyst is treated by surgical excision or marsupialization.
* Trichomoniasis: the Skene&#x27;s glands (along with other structures) act as a reservoir for &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, which explains why topical treatments are not as effective as oral medication for this condition.

==History==
While the glands were first described in 1672 by Regnier de Graaf and by the French surgeon Alphonse Guérin (1816–1895), they were named after the Scottish gynaecologist Alexander Skene, who wrote about it in Western medical literature in 1880. In 2002, the term &quot;female prostate&quot; as a second term after &quot;paraurethral gland&quot; was added in &quot;Terminologia Histologica&quot; by the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology. The 2008 edition notes that the term was introduced &quot;because of the morphological and immunological significance of the structure&quot;.

==Other animals==
Horses, dogs, sheep, and pigs are examples of other mammals that have these glands (minor vestibular glands).

<text>PureBasic is a commercially distributed procedural computer programming language and integrated development environment based on BASIC and developed by Fantaisie Software for Windows, Linux, macOS and Raspberry Pi. An Amiga version is available, although it has been discontinued and some parts of it are released as open-source. The first public release of PureBasic for Windows was on 17 December 2000. It has been continually updated ever since.

PureBasic has a &quot;lifetime license model&quot;. As cited on the website, the first PureBasic user (who registered in 1998) still has free access to new updates and this is not going to change.

PureBasic compiles directly to IA-32, x86-64, PowerPC or 680x0 instruction sets, generating small standalone executables and DLLs which need no runtime libraries beyond the standard system libraries. Programs developed without using the platform-specific application programming interfaces (APIs) can be built easily from the same source file with little or no modification.

PureBasic supports inline assembly, allowing the developer to include FASM assembler commands within PureBasic source code, while using the variables declared in PureBasic source code, enabling experienced programmers to improve the speed of speed-critical sections of code. PureBasic supports and has integrated the OGRE 3D Environment. Other 3D environments such as the Irrlicht Engine are unofficially supported.

Since version 6.00 (June 2022), in addition to compilation using ASM, PureBasic offers compilation with a C backend. This enables access to new platforms (e.g. Raspberry) and should make it easier to add new libraries in the future.

== Programming language ==

=== Characteristics ===
PureBasic is a native cross platform 32 bit and 64 bit BASIC compiler. Currently supported systems are Windows, Linux, macOS. The AmigaOS version is legacy and open-source. The compiler produces native executables and the syntax of PureBasic is simple and straightforward, comparable to plain C without the brackets and with native unicode string handling and a large library of built-in support functions. It can compile console applications, GUI applications, and DLL files.

=== Hello World example ===
The following single line of PureBasic code will create a standalone x86 executable (4.5 KiB (4,608 bytes) on Windows version) that displays a message box with the text &quot;Hello World&quot;.

 MessageRequester(&quot;Message Box&quot;, &quot;Hello World&quot;)

And the following variant of the same code, which instead uses an inline Windows API call with no need for declarations or other external references, will create an even smaller 2.0 KiB (2,048 bytes) standalone x86 executable for Windows.

 MessageBox_(0, &quot;Hello World&quot;, &quot;Message Box&quot;, 0)

The following is a console version of the Hello World example.

 OpenConsole() ; Open a console window. 
 Print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
 Delay(5000) ; Pause for 5 seconds

=== Procedural programming ===
PureBasic is a &quot;Second generation BASIC&quot; language, with structured conditionals and loops, and procedure-oriented programming supported. The user is not required to use procedures, so a programmer may opt for a coding style which includes , and .

Below is a sample procedure for sorting an array, although SortArray is now a built-in function of PureBasic.

 Procedure bubbleSort(Array a(1))
 Protected i, itemCount, hasChanged
 itemCount = ArraySize(a())
 Repeat
 hasChanged = #False
 itemCount - 1
 For i = 0 To itemCount
 If a(i) &gt; a(i + 1)
 Swap a(i), a(i + 1)
 hasChanged = #True
 EndIf 
 Next 
 Until hasChanged = #False
 EndProcedure

Below is a sample program that displays a sizeable text editor with two menu items.

;Create Window:
OpenWindow(0, #PB_Ignore, #PB_Ignore, 800, 600, &quot;Simple Text Editor&quot;, #PB_Window_SystemMenu | #PB_Window_MinimizeGadget | #PB_Window_MaximizeGadget | #PB_Window_SizeGadget)

;Add 2 menus:
CreateMenu(0, WindowID(0))
MenuItem(1, &quot;&amp;OK&quot;)
MenuItem(2, &quot;&amp;Cancel&quot;)

;Add Editor:
EditorGadget(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
SetGadgetFont(0, LoadFont(0, &quot;Courier New&quot;, 10))

;Process window messages until closed:
Repeat
 Select WaitWindowEvent()
 Case #PB_Event_Menu
 Select EventMenu()
 Case 1: MessageRequester(&quot;OK clicked directly or with &#x27;&amp;&#x27; mnemonic.&quot;, GetGadgetText(0))
 Case 2: Break
 EndSelect
 Case #PB_Event_SizeWindow: ResizeGadget(0, 0, 0, WindowWidth(0, #PB_Window_InnerCoordinate), WindowHeight(0, #PB_Window_InnerCoordinate))
 Case #PB_Event_CloseWindow: Break
 EndSelect
ForEver

PureBasic does not escape double quotes in strings so these must be concatenated with .

=== Object-oriented programming ===
Fred, the developer of PureBasic, has stated that PureBasic will never be object oriented. However, numerous users have created object oriented support systems.

=== Data types ===
Variable data type specified when you first use it (and optionally - in the future), and is separated from the name of the point. There is a set of basic types - (float and double numbers), (integers - from single-byte and 8-byte), - strings.
* used to count the length of a string will not exceed the first null character ().

In addition to basic types, the user can define the type of construction via

Structure type_name
 field_name.type ; Single field. Perhaps the structures attachment.
 field_name[count].type ; Static arrays.
 ; Optional construction StructureUnion .. EndStructureUnion allows you
 ; to combine multiple fields into one area of memory
 ; that is sometimes required for the conversion types.
 StructureUnion
 type_name.type
 EndStructureUnion 
EndStructure
Variables can be single (actually, standard variables), dynamic array (declared using the , a linked list (), an associative array (in new versions of language) ()

== Form Designer RAD ==

PureBasic has its own form designer to aid in the creation of forms for applications, but other third-party solutions are also available. The original non-integrated &quot;Visual Designer&quot; was replaced with a new integrated &quot;Form Designer&quot; on 14 Feb 2013.

== User community ==
PureBasic provides an online forum for users to ask questions and share knowledge. On 17 february 2025 the English language forum had 6,484 members and contained 70,174 threads comprising 578,646 posts since 17 May 2002.

Numerous code sharing sites show PureBasic is used to create tools and games in a fast and easy way, and share large amounts of open-source code.

<text>A peripheral device, or simply peripheral, is an auxiliary hardware device that a computer uses to transfer information externally. A peripheral is a hardware component that is accessible to and controlled by a computer but is not a core component of the computer.

A peripheral can be categorized based on the direction in which information flows relative to the computer:

* The computer receives data from an &quot;input device&quot;; examples: mouse, keyboard, scanner, game controller, microphone and webcam

* The computer sends data to an &quot;output device&quot;; examples: monitor, printer, headphones, and speakers

* The computer sends and receives data via an &quot;input/output device&quot;; examples: storage device (such as disk drive, solid-state drive, USB flash drive, memory card and tape drive), modem, router, gateway and network adapter

Many modern electronic devices, such as Internet-enabled digital watches, video game consoles, smartphones, and tablet computers, have interfaces for use as a peripheral.

<doc id="60646" wikidata="Q83125" url="?curid=60646" title="Tower Bridge">
<text>Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule, suspension, and, until 1960, cantilever bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the City Bridge Foundation, a charitable trust founded in 1282.

The bridge was constructed to connect the 39 per cent of London&#x27;s population that lived east of London Bridge, equivalent to the populations of &quot;Manchester on the one side, and Liverpool on the other&quot;, while allowing shipping to access the Pool of London between the Tower of London and London Bridge. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales, on 30 June 1894.

The bridge is in length including the abutments and consists of two bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge&#x27;s twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.

Tower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark. It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about upstream, which has led to a persistent urban legend about an American purchasing the wrong bridge.

== History ==

=== Inception ===

By the late 19th century, the population and commercial development in the East End of London was increasing, leading to demand for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London between London Bridge and the Tower of London.

A &quot;Special Bridge or Subway Committee&quot; chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman was formed in December 1875 to find a solution. On 7 December 1876, the Committee presented a report recommending a bridge or subway to the east of London Bridge should be constructed, funds permitting.

More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. None of the designs gained support and it was not until 24 July 1884 that the Bridge House Estates Committee brought forward a report that proposed &quot;a low level bridge, with mechanical opening or openings&quot; be built. Following a deputation from the Committee visiting Belgium, Holland, and Newcastle Bridge, a proposal was presented on 28 October 1884 to the Court of Common Council for a mechanical bridge built according to one of three models: Design A, a swing bridge; Design B, a variation of that swing bridge; and Design C a bascule bridge. Design C was recommended and a bill was prepared to present to Parliament.

=== Legislation ===
The act of Parliament authorising construction received royal assent on 14 August 1885 and is called the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. cxcv). The act was specific about the design of what it (and contemporary media) named &quot;The Tower Bridge&quot;, rather than just &quot;Tower Bridge&quot;. Key stipulations were:

# The central opening span to be 200 feet clear width with a height of 135 feet above Trinity high water when open, and a height of 29 feet when closed.
# The size of the piers to be 185 feet long and 70 feet wide.
# The length of each of the two side spans to be 270 feet.
# During construction a clear waterway of 160 feet wide had to be maintained for river traffic.
# The design of the bridge should be made to accord with the architecture of the Tower of London.
# The bridge was to be completed within 4 years from the passing of the act.
# The bridge was to be opened at any time for the passage of any vessels, regardless of any delays to land traffic.

Barry later noted that &quot;at one time it was intended that the new works should be made suitable for the mounting of guns and for military occupation.&quot; But that &quot;The latter idea was afterwards to a great extent discarded.&quot; However, the act provided for &quot;the senior officer commanding in the Tower [of London]...shall at all times have...the right to occupy the Tower Bridge.&quot;

The extent of the maritime trade conducted at this time between the site of Tower Bridge and London Bridge (a distance of approximately 0.5 miles) is demonstrated in Schedule B of the act which lists 11 active docks, quays and wharfs operating on the north side of the Thames, and 20 wharfs operating on the south side.

Two further acts of Parliament were required to extend the time allowed to complete the works. On 12 August 1889 the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1889 received royal assent to extend the time allowed for construction by a further four years to 1893 and make various adjustments to neighbouring streets that had proved necessary. The work was not yet complete after those four years, and on 29 June 1893 the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Extension of Time Act 1893 received royal assent extending the time by a further year.

=== Construction ===
Construction was funded by the City Bridge Foundation, a charity established in 1282 for maintenance of London Bridge that subsequently expanded to cover Tower Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.

Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer and Sir Horace Jones the architect (who, as the City Architect, was also one of the judges). Jones and Barry designed a bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge&#x27;s upper walkways.

Construction - overseen by Edward Cruttwell - started on 22 April 1886, with the foundation stone laid by the Prince of Wales on 21 June, and took eight years. The work was divided into eight contracts. Mr (later Sir) John Jackson won three of those contracts and was responsible for the northern approach to the bridge (which started in February 1887), the foundations of the piers and the abutments of the bridge (started February 1887), and the cast iron parapet for the northern approach (December 1887) at a total accepted tender cost of £189,732; Sir W. G. Armstrong, Mitchell, and Co. Ltd, was awarded the hydraulics contract for which they tendered £85,232 (December 1887); Mr William Webster was responsible for the southern approach at £38,383 (July 1888); Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. had the contract for the metalwork of the superstructure at £337,113 (May 1889), which amounted to about 12,100 tons; Messrs Perry &amp; Co won two contracts covering the masonry superstructure (May 1889), and paving and lighting (May 1892) for a total accepted tender of £179,455. The total accepted tender for the eight contracts was £830,005.

On average 432 people worked on the site, although at least 1,200 worked on its construction overall and received invitations to the entertainment provided for the workmen at its opening. Cruttwell was the resident engineer throughout the period of construction (and remained associated with the bridge until his death in 1933). He noted that there were &quot;only&quot; ten fatal accidents during the construction: four in sinking the foundations, one on the approaches, and the remaining five on the superstructure.

Two piers, containing over of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. The first caisson was started in September 1886 and it was not until January 1890 that both piers were complete. The reason for the long duration of the foundation works was the need to defer excavation of the second pier until the staging for the first pier had been removed to allow 160 feet of clear water-way for shipping.

More than of steel were used in the framework for the towers and walkways, which were then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone to protect the underlying steelwork, and achieve the stipulation that the bridge should fit architecturally with the Tower of London.

Jones died in 1887, and Barry took over as architect. Barry later summarised the contributions to the construction of Tower Bridge: &quot;Mr Fyson, who undertook much of the preparation of the detailed drawings; Mr Stevenson, who had been his assistant with the architectural work; and...most of all...Mr Cruttwell, the Resident Engineer, and Mr Homfray, who superintended the machinery.&quot; Stevenson replaced Jones&#x27;s original brick façade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which made the bridge a distinctive landmark and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was £1,184,000 (equivalent to £ in ).

=== Opening ===

Tower Bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The opening ceremony was attended by the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Carrington and the Home Secretary, H. H. Asquith. It was reported that &quot;few [pageants] have been more brilliant or will have a more abiding and historic interest&quot; than the opening of Tower Bridge in the history of the City of London, and it was a &quot;semi-State&quot; occasion.

In addition to the official opening, the City of London Corporation gave an &quot;entertainment&quot;, at a cost of £300, to 1,200 workmen and their wives. Edward Cruttwell, who had been in charge of the building of the bridge from the beginning, presided. After dinner, each workman was presented with a commemorative pipe and packet of tobacco, and each workman&#x27;s wife with a box of sweetmeats.

An Act of Parliament stipulated that a tug boat should be on station to assist vessels in danger when crossing the bridge, a requirement that remained in place until the 1960s.

The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Lane, on the south – now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively. Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway – to the west – was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world&#x27;s earliest underground (&quot;tube&quot;) railways, but it closed after just three months and was reopened as a tolled pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, as there was no toll to cross. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.

The high-level open-air walkways between the towers gained a reputation for prostitutes and pickpockets. Since they were only accessible by stairs, the walkways were seldom used by regular pedestrians and were closed in 1910. The walkway reopened in 1982 as part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.

=== 20th century ===


After its opening, the City of London provided some funding to the police to pay for the policing of Tower Bridge, under an informal &quot;compact&quot;. The Corporation of London (Blackfriars and other Bridges) Act 1906 (6 EdwVII c.clxxx) formally placed the bridge under the City of London&#x27;s policing jurisdiction.

During the Second World War, Tower Bridge was seen as a major transport link to the Port of London, and consequently was a target for enemy action. In 1940, the high-level span took a direct hit, severing the hydraulic mechanism and taking the bridge out of action. In April 1941, a parachute mine exploded close to the bridge, causing serious damage to the bascule, towers, and engine room. In 1942, a third engine was installed in case the existing ones were damaged by enemy action. It was a 150 hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a flywheel having a diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm. The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974 and was donated to the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum by the City of London Corporation.

The southern section of the bridge, in the London Borough of Southwark, was Grade I listed on 6 December 1949. The remainder of the bridge, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, was listed on 27 September 1973.

In 1960, the upper bridges of the two pedestrian walkways that connected the two main towers were converted from being cantilever bridges, projecting horizontally out into space, to suspension bridges when suspension cables were added. This was to reinforce the strength of the walkways.

In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by Geoffrey Beresford Hartwell, of BHA Cromwell House, with the original final pinions driven by modern hydraulic motors.

In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened, housed in the bridge&#x27;s twin towers, the long-closed high-level walkways, and the Victorian engine rooms. The latter still houses the original steam engines and some of the original hydraulic machinery.

===21st century===
The bridge closed for a month in 2000 to repair the bascules and perform other maintenance. A computer system was installed to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. However, the system proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.

In April 2008, authorities announced that the bridge would undergo a £4 million refurbishment that would take four years to complete. The work entailed stripping existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white. Before this, the bridge&#x27;s colour scheme dated from 1977, when it was painted red, white, and blue for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. Its colours were subsequently restored to blue and white. Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. The completed work should stand for 25 years. The renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. The renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of paint. A lighting system based on RGB LED luminaires was installed, concealed within the bridge superstructure, and attached without drilling holes, owing to the bridge&#x27;s Grade I listing.
On 8 July 2012, as part of the London Olympics, the west walkway was transformed into a Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound travelled backward and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of the bridge.

Following the Olympics, the rings were removed from Tower Bridge and replaced by the emblem of the Paralympic Games for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

In 2016, Tower Bridge was closed to all road traffic from 1 October to 30 December. This was to allow structural maintenance work to take place on the timber decking, lifting mechanism and waterproofing the brick arches on the bridge&#x27;s approaches. During this, the bridge was still open to waterborne traffic. It was open to pedestrians for all but three weekends when a free ferry service was in operation.

== Design ==
=== Structure ===
The structure was originally designed by Horace Jones but his design had an arch instead of the current high-level footways. Concerns about ships&#x27; masts and rigging hitting the arch meant that his design faced objections and Jones &quot;began to think that the arched form must be given up&quot;. It was at this point in 1885 that John Wolfe Barry partnered with Jones and developed the concept of the &quot;level soffit for the upper bridge&quot; which allowed the design to proceed as it stands today. Unusually, Tower Bridge was designed to include three types of bridge: the two spans from the shore to the piers are a suspension bridge; the central, opening span is a bascule bridge; and the high level walkways were cantilever bridges until converted to suspension bridges in 1960.

The main towers &quot;consist of a skeleton of steelwork, covered with a facing of granite and Portland stone, backed with brickwork on the inside faces.&quot; An octagonal steel column stands at each corner of each tower (119 feet 6 inches long). The smaller abutment towers were &quot;generally similar...though on a smaller scale.&quot;

&quot;The total length of the bridge, including the abutments, is 940 feet, and the length of the approaches are 1,260 feet on the north side, and 780 feet on the south side. The width of the bridge and approaches between the parapets is 60 feet, except across the opening span where it is 49 feet. The steepest gradients are 1 in 60 on the north side, and 1 in 40 on the south side.&quot;

The central span of between the towers is split into two equal bascules, or leaves, which project 100 feet out each and extend backwards 62 feet 6 inches within the face of each pier. The bascules, weighing about 1,070 tons each including ballast and paving, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes and have an arc of rotation of 82° with the centre of the arc, or pivot point, being 13 feet 3 inches inside the face of each pier and 5 feet 7 inches beneath the surface of the roadway.

The two side spans are suspension bridges, each long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge&#x27;s upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are above the river at high tide and accessed by lifts and staircases. These walkways were designed as cantilever bridges for a distance from each tower of 55 feet, with girders bridging the 120 feet between the ends of the cantilevers.

The structure was designed to withstand wind pressures of 56 lb per square foot (), a design constraint introduced following the Tay Bridge disaster which had occurred just 15 years before the opening of Tower Bridge.

There is a chimney on the bridge that is painted to look like a lamppost. It was connected to a fireplace in a guardroom located in one of the bridge piers.

=== Hydraulic system===

The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in six hydraulic accumulators. There were then two pairs of engines on each pier. Each pair consisted of a larger engine 8 ½ inches in diameter and a smaller one at 7 ½ inches. All eight engines had three cylinders. The reason for two pairs of engines on each pier was to build in redundancy. The machinery was &quot;equal to twice the requirements of the Board of Trade&quot;, already very rigorous standards established following the Tay Bridge Disaster.

The system was designed and installed by Hamilton Owen Rendel while working for Armstrong, Mitchell and Company of Newcastle upon Tyne. Water at a pressure of was pumped into the accumulators by a pair of stationary steam engines. Each drove a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a ram which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.

The entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg &amp; Co Ltd. The gas lighting was initially by open-flame burners within the lanterns, but was soon updated to the later incandescent system.

In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House. The only remaining parts of the old system are the final pinions, which fit into the racks on the bascules and were driven by hydraulic motors and gearing. Oil is now used in place of water as the new hydraulic fluid.

=== Signalling and control ===

Originally, river traffic passing beneath the bridge was required to follow several rules and signals. Daytime control was provided by red semaphore signals, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both of the bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both of the piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.

Vessels passing through the bridge were required to display signals. By day, a black ball at least in diameter was mounted high up where it could be seen. Night passage called for two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship&#x27;s steam whistle. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about downstream, at Cherry Garden Pier, where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.

Some of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and is housed in the Tower Bridge&#x27;s museum.

== Traffic ==

=== Road ===
During the first twelve months after the opening of the bridge, the average stoppage of road traffic at each bridge lift was six minutes. The average number of vehicles crossing the bridge daily was about 8,000.

Tower Bridge is still a busy crossing of the Thames, used by more than 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians) every day. The bridge is on the London Inner Ring Road, and is on the eastern boundary of the London congestion charge zone (drivers do not incur the charge by crossing the bridge).

To maintain the integrity of the structure, the City of London Corporation has imposed a speed restriction, and an weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, using a number plate recognition system to send fixed penalty charges to speeding drivers.

A second system monitors other vehicle parameters. Induction loops and piezoelectric sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle, with drivers of overweight vehicles also receiving fixed penalty notices.

===Pedestrian===
Pedestrians can walk across on the bascule bridge when it is down for auto and truck traffic. Ship traffic has priority, meaning traffic using the bascule bridge waits when the bridge opens for ships.

From the outset in 1894, the high-level connection was a pedestrian route and was intended to allow pedestrian movement to continue while the bascule bridge was open for ship traffic. During the first twelve months after opening, the average number of pedestrians using the bridge was about 60,000 daily. The pedestrian walkways in each direction were changed to have glass floors in 2014. Lifts bring pedestrians up to and down from the high level pedestrian bridge. The upper walkways are part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, which included a tour of how the bascule bridge works. Pedestrians can view the city from the bridge and through its upper walkway. There is a fee for the Tower Bridge Exhibition, tickets are needed.

=== River ===
During the first twelve months after the opening of the bridge, the bascules were raised for the passage of vessels 6,160 times, an average of seventeen times daily. Now, the bascules are raised about a thousand times a year. River traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours&#x27; notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge&#x27;s website; there is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.

=== Cycling ===
Transport for London have proposed Cycle Superhighway 4 to run across Tower Bridge.

== Touring the bridge ==

The Tower Bridge attraction is a display housed inside the Bridge&#x27;s Towers, the high-level Walkways, and the Victorian Engine Rooms. It uses films, photos, and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in Engine Rooms, underneath the south end of the bridge.

The attraction charges an admission fee. The entrance is from the Ticket Office on the west side of the North Tower, from where visitors can climb the stairs (or take a lift) to the high-level Walkways to cross to the South Tower. In the Towers and Walkways is interpretation about the history of the Bridge. The Walkways also provide views over the city, the Tower of London and the Pool of London, and include two Glass Floors, where you can look down to see the road and River Thames below. From the South Tower, visitors can visit exit and follow the Blue Line to the Victorian Engine Rooms, with the original steam engines, which are situated in a separate building underneath the southern approach to the Bridge.

Of 1,114 English visitor attractions tracked by Visit England, in 2019 Tower Bridge had 889,338 visitors and was the 34th most visited attraction in England, and the 17th most visited attraction that charged an admission fee. It is one of only three bridges in England tracked as a visitor attraction alongside Clifton Suspension Bridge and The Iron Bridge.

== Reaction ==
Although Tower Bridge is an undoubted landmark, with the City of London calling it &quot;London&#x27;s defining landmark&quot;, some professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. &quot;It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure&quot;, wrote Henry Heathcote Statham, while Frank Brangwyn stated that &quot;A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river&quot;.

Benjamin Crisler, the &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic, wrote in 1938: &quot;Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock.&quot; Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected Tower Bridge as one of his four choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Buildings&quot;. The bridge and its surrounding landscape was depicted in an official BBC trailer for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup (in reference to London being one of the host cities).
Tower Bridge has been mistaken for the next bridge upstream, London Bridge. A popular urban legend is that in 1968, Robert P. McCulloch, the purchaser of the old London Bridge that was later shipped to Lake Havasu City in Arizona, believed that he was buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.

A partial replica of Tower Bridge has been built in the city of Suzhou in China. The replica differs from the original in having no lifting mechanism and four separate towers. The Suzhou replica was renovated in 2019, giving it a new look that differs from the original London design.

Tower Bridge is the emblem of the Greater London Scout Region of The Scout Association and features on the badges of the six London Scout counties.

== Incidents ==

On 10 August 1912, the pioneering stunt pilot Francis McClean flew between the bascules and the high-level walkways in his Short Brothers S.33 floatplane. McClean became a celebrity overnight because of the stunt, and went on to fly underneath London Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge and Waterloo Bridge.

On 3 August 1922, a 13-year-old boy fell off a slipway next to the south side of Tower Bridge. A man jumped into the Thames to save him, but both were pulled under a barge by Butler&#x27;s Wharf and drowned.

In December 1952, the bridge opened while a number 78 double-decker bus was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the raising of the bridge. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunter made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a gap to drop onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries. Gunter was given £10 (equivalent to £ in ) by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.
On 5 April 1968, a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter FGA.9 jet fighter from No. 1 Squadron made an unauthorised flight through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff was not going to celebrate the RAF&#x27;s 50th birthday with a flypast, the pilot flew at low altitude down the Thames without authorisation, past the Houses of Parliament, and continued towards the bridge. He flew beneath the walkway, at an estimated . He was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a court martial.

On 31 July 1973, a single-engined Beagle Pup was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker&#x27;s clerk Peter Martin. Martin, who was on bail following accusations of stock market fraud, then &quot;buzzed&quot; buildings in the city before flying north towards the Lake District, where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.

In May 1997, the motorcade of United States President Bill Clinton was divided by the opening of the bridge. The Thames sailing barge &quot;Gladys&quot;, on her way to a gathering at St Katharine Docks, arrived on schedule and the bridge was opened for her. Returning from a Thames-side lunch at &quot;Le Pont de la Tour&quot; restaurant with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Clinton was less punctual and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff. A spokesman for Tower Bridge is quoted as saying: &quot;We tried to contact the American Embassy, but they wouldn&#x27;t answer the phone.&quot;

On 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a Freeman of the City of London, drove a flock of two sheep across the bridge. He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way their rights were being eroded.

Before dawn on 31 October 2003, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner climbed a tower crane near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as Spider-Man. Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and East London.

On 11 May 2009, six people were trapped and injured after a lift fell inside the north tower.

On 9 August 2021, the bridge remained open after a technical failure. The bridge had opened to let the Jubilee Trust Tall Ship through from 2 p.m. before getting stuck. The bridge was closed and reopened to traffic approximately 12 hours later.

<doc id="60647" wikidata="Q1571077" url="?curid=60647" title="Netwide Assembler">
<text>The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. It can be used to write 16-bit, 32-bit (IA-32) and 64-bit (x86-64) programs. It is considered one of the most popular assemblers for Linux and x86 chips.

It was originally written by Simon Tatham with assistance from Julian Hall. , it is maintained by a small team led by H. Peter Anvin. It is open-source software released under the terms of a simplified (2-clause) BSD license.

== Features ==
NASM can output several binary formats, including COFF, OMF, a.out, Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), Mach-O and binary file (.bin, binary disk image, used to compile operating systems), though position-independent code is supported only for ELF object files. It also has its own binary format called RDOFF.

The variety of output formats allows retargeting programs to virtually any x86 operating system (OS). It can also create flat binary files, usable to write boot loaders, read-only memory (ROM) images, and in various facets of OS development. It can run on non-x86 platforms as a cross assembler, such as PowerPC and SPARC, though it cannot generate programs usable by those machines.

NASM uses a variant of Intel assembly syntax instead of AT&amp;T syntax. It also avoids features such as automatic generation of segment overrides (and the related ASSUME directive) used by MASM and compatible assemblers.

== Development ==
NASM version 0.90 was released in October 1996.

Version 2.00 was released on 28 November 2007, adding support for x86-64 extensions. The development versions are not uploaded to SourceForge.net, but are checked into GitHub with binary snapshots available from the project web page.

In July 2009, as of version 2.07, NASM was released under the Simplified (2-clause) BSD license. Previously, because it was licensed under LGPL, it led to development of Yasm, a complete rewrite of under the New BSD License. Yasm offered support for x86-64 earlier than NASM. It also added support for GNU Assembler syntax.

=== RDOFF ===
Relocatable Dynamic Object File Format (RDOFF) is used by developers to test the integrity of NASM&#x27;s object file output abilities. It is based heavily on the internal structure of NASM, essentially consisting of a header containing a serialization of the output driver function calls followed by an array of sections containing executable code or data. Tools for using the format, including a linker and loader, are included in the NASM distribution.

Until version 0.90 was released in October 1996, NASM supported output of only flat-format executable files (e.g., DOS COM files). In version 0.90, Simon Tatham added support for an object-file output interface, and for DOS .OBJ files for 16-bit code only.

NASM thus lacked a 32-bit object format. To address this lack, and as an exercise to learn the object-file interface, developer Julian Hall put together the first version of RDOFF, which was released in NASM version 0.91.

Since this initial version, there has been one major update to the RDOFF format, which added a record-length indicator on each header record, allowing programs to skip over records whose format they do not recognise, and support for multiple segments; RDOFF1 only supported three segments: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;data&quot; and &quot;bss&quot; (containing uninitialized data).

The RDOFF format is strongly deprecated and has been disabled starting in NASM 2.15.04.

<doc id="60652" wikidata="Q11998326" url="?curid=60652" title="Lustre (mineralogy)">
<text>Lustre (British English) or luster (American English; see spelling differences) is the way light interacts with the surface of a crystal, rock, or mineral. The word traces its origins back to the Latin &quot;lux&quot;, meaning &quot;light&quot;, and generally implies radiance, gloss, or brilliance. 

A range of terms are used to describe lustre, such as &quot;earthy&quot;, &quot;metallic&quot;, &quot;greasy&quot;, and &quot;silky&quot;. Similarly, the term &quot;vitreous&quot; (derived from the Latin for glass, &quot;vitrum&quot;) refers to a glassy lustre. A list of these terms is given below.

Lustre varies over a wide continuum, and so there are no rigid boundaries between the different types of lustre. (For this reason, different sources can often describe the same mineral differently. This ambiguity is further complicated by lustre&#x27;s ability to vary widely within a particular mineral species). The terms are frequently combined to describe intermediate types of lustre (for example, a &quot;vitreous greasy&quot; lustre).

Some minerals exhibit unusual optical phenomena, such as asterism (the display of a star-shaped luminous area) or chatoyancy (the display of luminous bands, which appear to move as the specimen is rotated). A list of such phenomena is given below.

== Common terms ==

=== Adamantine lustre ===
Adamantine minerals possess a superlative lustre, which is most notably seen in diamond. Such minerals are transparent or translucent, and have a high refractive index (of 1.9 or more). Minerals with a true adamantine lustre are uncommon, with examples including cerussite, zircon, and cubic zirconia.

Minerals with a lesser (but still relatively high) degree of lustre are referred to as subadamantine, with some examples being garnet and corundum.
=== Dull lustre ===
Dull (or earthy) minerals exhibit little to no lustre, due to coarse granulations which scatter light in all directions, approximating a Lambertian reflector. An example is kaolinite. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dull minerals and earthy minerals, with the latter being coarser, and having even less lustre.
=== Greasy lustre ===
Greasy minerals resemble fat or grease. A greasy lustre often occurs in minerals containing a great abundance of microscopic inclusions, with examples including opal and cordierite, jadeite. Many minerals with a greasy lustre also feel greasy to the touch.
=== Metallic lustre ===
Metallic (or splendent) minerals have the lustre of polished metal, and with ideal surfaces will work as a reflective surface. Examples include galena, pyrite and magnetite.
=== Pearly lustre ===
Pearly minerals consist of thin transparent co-planar sheets. Light reflecting from these layers gives them a lustre reminiscent of pearls. Such minerals possess perfect cleavage, with examples including muscovite and stilbite.

=== Resinous lustre ===
Resinous minerals have the appearance of resin, chewing gum or (smooth-surfaced) plastic. A principal example is amber, which is a form of fossilized resin.
=== Silky lustre ===
Silky minerals have a parallel arrangement of extremely fine fibres, giving them a lustre reminiscent of silk. Examples include asbestos, ulexite and the satin spar variety of gypsum. A fibrous lustre is similar, but has a coarser texture.
=== Submetallic lustre ===
Submetallic minerals have similar lustre to metal, but are duller and less reflective. A submetallic lustre often occurs in near-opaque minerals with very high refractive indices, such as sphalerite, cinnabar, anthracite, and cuprite.
=== Vitreous lustre ===
Vitreous minerals have the lustre of glass. (The term is derived from the Latin for glass, &quot;vitrum&quot;.) This type of lustre is one of the most commonly seen, and occurs in transparent or translucent minerals with relatively low refractive indices. Common examples include calcite, quartz, topaz, beryl, tourmaline and fluorite, among others.
=== Waxy lustre ===
Waxy minerals have a lustre resembling wax. Examples include jade and chalcedony.
==Optical phenomena==

=== Asterism ===
Asterism is the display of a star-shaped luminous area. It is seen in some sapphires and rubies, where it is caused by impurities of rutile. It can also occur in garnet, diopside and spinel.
=== Aventurescence ===
Aventurescence (or aventurization) is a reflectance effect like that of glitter. It arises from minute, preferentially oriented mineral platelets within the material. These platelets are so numerous that they also influence the material&#x27;s body colour. In aventurine quartz, chrome-bearing fuchsite makes for a green stone and various iron oxides make for a red stone.
=== Chatoyancy ===
Chatoyant minerals display luminous bands, which appear to move as the specimen is rotated. Such minerals are composed of parallel fibers (or contain fibrous voids or inclusions), which reflect light into a direction perpendicular to their orientation, thus forming narrow bands of light. The most famous examples are tiger&#x27;s eye and cymophane, but the effect may also occur in other minerals such as aquamarine, moonstone and tourmaline.
=== Colour change ===
Colour change is most commonly found in alexandrite, a variety of chrysoberyl gemstones. Other gems also occur in colour-change varieties, including (but not limited to) sapphire, garnet, spinel. Alexandrite displays a colour change dependent upon light, along with strong pleochroism. The gem results from small-scale replacement of aluminium by chromium oxide, which is responsible for alexandrite&#x27;s characteristic green to red colour change. Alexandrite from the Ural Mountains in Russia is green by daylight and red by incandescent light. Other varieties of alexandrite may be yellowish or pink in daylight and a columbine or raspberry red by incandescent light. The optimum or &quot;ideal&quot; colour change would be fine emerald green to fine purplish red, but this is rare.
=== Iridescence ===
Iridescence is the &#x27;play&#x27; or &#x27;fire&#x27; of rainbow-coloured light caused by very thin regular structures or layers beneath the surface of a gemstone. Similar to a thin film of oil on water, these layers interfere with the rays of reflected light, reinforcing some colours and cancelling others. Iridescence is seen at its best in precious opal.
=== Schiller ===
Schiller (German, literally &quot;shimmer&quot;), is the metallic iridescence originating from below the surface of a stone that occurs when light is reflected between layers of minerals. It is seen in moonstone and labradorite and is very similar to adularescence and aventurescence.

<text>A collectable (collectible or collector&#x27;s item) is any object regarded as being of value or interest to a collector. Collectable items are not necessarily monetarily valuable or uncommon. There are numerous types of collectables and terms to denote those types. An antique is a collectable that is old. A curio is something deemed unique, uncommon, or weird, such as a decorative item. A manufactured collectable is an item made specifically for people to collect.

== The business of collectables ==

=== Created to be collected ===
A manufactured collectable (often referred to as a contemporary collectable) is an item made specifically for people to collect. Examples of items commonly sold as collectables include plates, figurines, bells, graphics, steins, dolls, and art. Some companies that produce manufactured collectables are members of The Gift and Collectibles Guild.

Special editions, limited editions and variants on these terms fall under the category of manufactured collectables and are used as a marketing incentive for various types of products. They were originally applied to products related to the arts—such as books, prints or recorded music and films—but are now used for cars, fine wine and many other collectables. A special edition typically includes extra material of some kind. A limited edition is restricted in the number of copies produced, although the number may be arbitrarily high.

=== Collectables in commerce ===
Manufacturers and retailers have used collectables in a number of ways to increase sales. One use is in the form of licensed collectables based on intellectual properties, such as images, characters and logos from literature, music, movies, radio, television, and video games. A large subsection of licensing includes advertising, brand name, and character collectibles. Another use of collectables in retail is in the form of prizes (items of nominal value packaged with or included in the price of a retail product at no additional cost) and premiums (items that can be &quot;purchased&quot; by redeeming coupons, boxtops, or proofs of purchase from the product along with a small fee to cover shipping and handling). Also, collectables have played an important role in tourism, in the form of souvenirs. Another important field of collecting that is also big business is memorabilia, which includes collectables related to a person, organization, event or media, including T-shirts, posters, and numerous other collectables marketed to fans; but also includes ephemera from historical, media, or entertainment events, items that were meant to be thrown away but were saved by fans and accumulated by collectors. Collectibles have become a huge market globally coupled with the rise in application of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) which are now used as a medium for digital collectibles sales. The collectables market size in 2020 was $360 billion with an estimated increase of 4% by 2028. Digital collectibles may become a reliable revenue stream for creators as NFTs evolve and spread.

=== Collectables as investments ===
Collectables can be items of limited supply that are sought for a variety of reasons, including a possible increase in value. In a financial sense, collectables can be viewed as a hedge against inflation. Over time, their value can also increase as they become rarer due to loss, damage or destruction. One drawback to investing in collectables is the potential lack of liquidity, particularly for very obscure items. There is also a risk for fraud.

=== Digital collecting ===

Digital collecting takes place in the blockchain, and it got popular at the end of 2020 with the NFT craze of 2020–2021. Collectors can buy, trade and exchange digital items (NFTs) usually associated with images or artworks. These items are usually bought using cryptocurrency, although many marketplaces have made it possible to purchase NFTs using standard credit cards as well. Just like in physical collecting, items can hold value due to different reasons, but they are not necessarily monetarily valuable, rare, uncommon or aesthetically pleasing. The Curio Cards, the Rare Pepe or the CryptoPunks are amongst the first cases of digital collectibles. Digital collecting also applies to digital artworks.

==History==
The urge to collect unusual and fascinating objects is primeval and not limited to humans (bowerbird, pack rat).

The Renaissance Cabinet of Curiosities was an antecedent both of modern museums and modern collecting.

The earliest manufactured collectables were included as incentives with other products, such as cigarette cards in packs of cigarettes. Popular items developed a secondary market and sometimes became the subject of &quot;collectable crazes&quot;. Eventually many collectable items came to be sold separately, instead of being used as marketing tools to increase the appeal of other products.

To encourage collecting, manufacturers often create an entire series of a given collectable, with each item differentiated in some fashion. Examples include sports cards depicting individual players, or different designs of Beanie Babies. Enthusiasts will often try to assemble a complete set of the available variations.

Collector editions are another way of supporting collectables. They typically are produced in limited amount and contain additional content that can be valuable for a collector. This practice is mostly popular in video games.

Early versions of a product, manufactured in smaller quantities before its popularity as a collectable developed, sometimes command exorbitant premiums on the secondary market. Dolls and other toys made during an adult collector&#x27;s childhood can command such premiums. Unless extremely rare or made as a one-of-a-kind in a mature market, collectables rarely prove to be a spectacular investment.

<doc id="60663" wikidata="Q6285" url="?curid=60663" title="Varese">
<text>Varese ( , ; ; ; ; archaic ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in north-western Lombardy, northern Italy, north-west of Milan. The population of Varese in 2018 was 80,559.

It is the capital of the Province of Varese. The hinterland or exurban part of the city is called &quot;Varesotto&quot;.

== Geography ==

The city of Varese lies at the foot of Sacro Monte di Varese, part of the Campo dei Fiori mountain range, that hosts an astronomical observatory, as well as the Prealpino Geophysical Centre. The village which is in the middle of the mountain is called Santa Maria del Monte because of the medieval sanctuary, which is reached through the avenue of the chapels of the Sacred Mountain. Varese is situated on seven hills: the San Pedrino Hill, the Giubiano Hill, the Campigli Hill, the Sant&#x27;Albino Hill, the Biumo Superiore Hill, Colle di Montalbano (Villa Mirabello) and the Hill of Miogni. The city also looks over Lake Varese.

== Climate ==
Varese&#x27;s winters are not significantly affected by the proximity of &quot;Lago Maggiore&quot; and the minor lakes surrounding it. In late autumn and winter, temperatures frequently fall below zero Celsius, even if just by a few degrees. This differentiates it from areas south of the city. As in other cities in the foothills of Lombardy, fog is an infrequent phenomenon. Varese is on average cooler than other cities of the Lombard Prealps, especially in winter. Varese is one of the rainiest cities in Italy, with an annual precipitation average of more than . Since the 1980s, snow has fallen less frequently, with the annual average going from 69 cm in 1967–1987 to 33 cm in 1988–2017.
== Demographics ==
Varese city, like the province, has a very high immigrant population owing to both its economy (many multinational companies and the EU&#x27;s Joint Research Centre in nearby Ispra) and its location (proximity to Milan makes it an ideal place for the latter city&#x27;s workers).

== Government ==
== History ==

This town has been known since the Early Middle Ages when it became officially a municipality. The population by 1848 was about 4000.

In 1859, Giuseppe Garibaldi confronted Austrian forces led by Field Marshal-Lieutenant Carl Baron Urban near Varese. Also, it was here where Alessandro Marchetti&#x27;s Savoia-Marchetti SM.93 made his first test flights.

In the 20th century, thanks to the increase in population and to the improvement of its economy, the dimensions of this urban centre rose. During the 20th century, its economy flourished quickly, mainly in manufacturing, in the mechanical and electromechanical industry and textile industry. Varese was well known for the footwear industry.

Symbols
The coat of arms of the City of Varese dates back to around 1347. On the wooden cover of the double copy of the Burgi et Castellatiae de Varisio Statutes, preserved in the municipal archive, the oldest example of a civic coat of arms is depicted: &quot;silver Samnite shield. with two corners of red, right and left on the head; all around closed by a black band&quot;. The effigy of San Vittore has no crown. It is probably in the sixteenth century - as the Varese historian Luigi Borri believes in his work Documenti Varesini of 1891 - that the shield was surmounted by the marquis crown and the effigy of St. Victor, patron saint of the city.

The coat of arms was recognized by decree of the head of the government of 17 June 1941 and the banner was granted with the royal decree of 28 April 1941.

== Transport ==
The road and rail infrastructure network that makes up the connection system of the city of Varese is powered by a lot of little streets and a double rail network and by 74,000 of high mobility. In particular, the major movements are incoming into Varese. In the average weekday over 113,000 vehicles enter Varese.

The most used form of transportation in Varese is the private vehicle, followed by the local public transport. The A8 motorway connects Varese with Milan. The city has also a Ring Road System: Varese&#x27;s Ring Road consists of three roads currently in operation and one more under construction (North Ring Road). The currently operating roads of Varese&#x27;s Ring Road System are the East Ring Road, a double lane road managed by ANAS; South Ring Road, a double lane highway managed by Autostrada Pedemontana Lombarda; North East Ring Road, a single lane road managed by ANAS.

Many important national and provincial roads pass through Varese.

The entire rail network serving the capital is electrified. The city is served by three railway stations:

- Varese FS, managed by Centostazioni and RFI SpA, Ferrovie Dello Stato Group: it is the first/last station of Suburban Line S5 of Milan Varese-Treviglio via Milan (operated by ATM-Trenord) and runs a high-frequency train to Milan and Porto Ceresio, toward Switzerland (operated by Trenord). In addition, Varese FS provides direct trains to Malpensa Airport, Como, Mendrisio and Lugano (Switzerland).
- Varese Nord (in the city centre) and Varese Casbeno (in the neighbourhood of Casbeno), managed by FerrovieNord on Milan Cadorna-Saronno-Varese-Laveno line: train service is operated by Trenord.

The city has both an extensive city bus network (12 lines + 3 lines in the urban area) operated by Autolinee Varesine, and suburban bus services. International bus services are operated by Swiss Post Bus of line 523 that link Varese to Lugano and Mendrisio.

In Varese there is also a funicular service on the Vellone-Sacro Monte funicular.

The nearest airfield is Varese-Venegono Airport (ICAO:LILN) located 10 km southeast of Varese.

== Main sights ==
The city is home to the Sacro Monte di Varese (&#x27;the Sacred Mount of Varese&#x27;), a place of pilgrimage and worship. It is one of the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy, included on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

=== Civic buildings ===

Varese is rich in castles, many once pertaining to the Borromeo family. The historic centre of the city includes the Praetorian Palace and Villa Cagna, a residential complex that also hosts the Civic Music School of Varese.

After the 19th century, it was enriched by villas and their surrounding gardens, many now open to visitors, including:
* Villa Recalcati in Casbeno was built in the early 18th century, enlarged during 1756–77, and was once a luxury hotel. It now houses the offices of the Province of Varese and the Prefecture. 
* Villa Mylius, near the town centre, was once owned by the Jesuit order, and in 1773 the house and park were sold to the notable Francesco Torelli, who transformed a modest building into a large villa, then sold in 1902 to the industrialist George Mylius. After his death, the property was divided among several heirs, who in 1946 jointly sold it to the &quot;Varesino&quot; Achille Cattaneo, and he donated to the town of Varese in 2007. 
* Villa Toeplitz, in the Sant&#x27;Ambrogio district stands, with a large public park. The complex is named after Giuseppe Toeplitz (1866–1938), a Polish-born banker who bought it in 1914. Already modest country residence of the German family Hannesen, was enlarged by Toeplitz after World War II when his wife Hedwig Mrozowska and his son Louis sold it to brothers Mocchetti of Legnano. The complex with the elegant Italian park passed to the Municipality of Varese in 1972.
*Ville Ponti was built between 1850 and 1870 by Milanese architect Giuseppe Balzaretto (1801–1874) for Andrea Ponti. In 1976, it was converted into a convention centre. The main building, surrounded by a public park, is decorated internally by Giuseppe Bertini (1825–1898). Part of the complex, &quot;Villa Fabio Ponti&quot; is a neoclassical-style villa housed in 1959 headquarters for Garibaldi.
* &quot;Villa Menafoglio Litta Panza&quot; in locations Biumo Superiore, opposite the entrance of Ville Ponti, was commissioned in the mid-18th century by the Marquis Paolo Antonio Menafoglio, and is an example of a vacation home in Varese. The villa with the garden was partly transformed during the Napoleonic period (neoclassical hall) when the garden was converted into an English-style garden. Recognized since 1996 as well protected by the FAI, the building currently hosts the contemporary art collection of the family Panza.
* Villa Augusta, in the Giubiano neighbourhood, was built in the second half of the 19th century. Already owned by Testoni, passed to the Hospital of Circolo di Varese and then, 30 September 1952, was ceded to the Roman Catholic order of the Sisters of Helpers of Holy Souls who pray for souls in Purgatory. Since 1968, the villa was purchased by the city and houses municipal offices. The park is open to the public from 5 April 1970.
* Villa Baragiola, in Masnago, has a well-visited park. On the north side, in the shadow of Mount Campo dei Fiori, in 1895 the lawyer Andrea Baragiola opened one of the first Italian racecourses, which extended to the area now occupied by the stadium &quot;Franco Ossola&quot; and its ample parking. The villa was renovated in the early thirties, and in the next decade refurbished as a religious seminary. Passed to the Municipality of Varese in 2001, today is a part of its offices, while the park is open to the public.
* Masnago Castle.

In the city centre, there is the Palazzo Estense with its gardens (built in the 17th century) and Villa Mirabello. Villa Mirabello, the seat of &quot;Museo Civico Archeologico&quot; (Civic Archaeological Museum), was built in the late 600s on the top of the hill which carries its name. This site is surrounded by a park which is set close to the park of Palazzo Estense. 
=== Natural areas ===
In addition to numerous public parks of the city, often appurtenances of historic villas, there is the Park Luigi Zanzi in Schiranna, established in the sixties through a partial filling of the coast of Lake Varese. It is a large botanical garden located on the banks of Lake Varese, rich in numerous species of trees and birdlife that is partially sheltered in the reeds along the banks. Bathing beach in the summer, the park also offers the possibility of peaceful walks and cycling on the bike path.

Close to the city of Varese is the Campo dei Fiori Regional Park, a natural reserve of over five thousand acres consisting of the massive mountain Campo dei Fiori and Mount Martica, separate from that valley Rasa which is the junction of Valcuvia and Olona valley. Once the peak of the Campo dei Fiori was characterized by extensive grassland, it became the historical destination of tourism of Varese and of Milan. Today is the spectacular blooms - which gave the name to the area - to be one of its main attractions. It is a very diverse place showing aspects of extreme interest, related both to the natural environment, both in history and culture, referring to a past full of events and traditions. There are small farming villages, monuments of rare beauty, cave systems and articulated a well-maintained network of trails: some passable, as well as on foot, on horseback and on bicycle. Inside the park are established six nature reserves enclosing environments most important and characteristic.

== Economy ==
The economy of Varese is mainly based on industry and, to a lesser extent, specialized agriculture; some famous Varese-based firms are:
* Aermacchi (military trainer aircraft)

<text>The 801 was an experimental central processing unit (CPU) design developed by IBM during the 1970s. It is considered to be the first modern RISC design, relying on processor registers for all computations and eliminating the many variant addressing modes found in CISC designs. Originally developed as the processor for a telephone switch, it was later used as the basis for a minicomputer and a number of products for their mainframe line. The initial design was a 24-bit processor; that was soon replaced by 32-bit implementations of the same concepts and the original 24-bit 801 was used only into the early 1980s.

The 801 was extremely influential in the computer market. Armed with huge amounts of performance data, IBM was able to demonstrate that the simple design was able to easily outperform even the most powerful classic CPU designs, while at the same time producing machine code that was only marginally larger than the heavily optimized CISC instructions. Applying these same techniques even to existing processors like the System/370 generally doubled the performance of those systems as well. This demonstrated the value of the RISC concept, and all of IBM&#x27;s future systems were based on the principles developed during the 801 project.

For his work on the 801, John Cocke was recognized with several awards and medals, including the Turing Award in 1987, National Medal of Technology in 1991, and the National Medal of Science in 1994.

==History==
===Original concept===
In 1974, IBM began examining the possibility of constructing a telephone switch to handle one million calls an hour, or about 300 calls per second. They calculated that each call would require 20,000 instructions to complete, and when timing overhead and other considerations were added, such a machine required performance of about 12 MIPS. This would require a significant advance in performance; their current top-of-the-line machine, the IBM System/370 Model 168 of late 1972, offered about 3 MIPS.

The group working on this project at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, including John Cocke, designed a processor for this purpose. To reach the required performance, they considered the sort of operations such a machine required and removed any that were not appropriate. This led to the removal of a floating-point unit for instance, which would not be needed in this application. More critically, they also removed many of the instructions that worked on data in main memory and left only those instructions that worked on the internal processor registers, as these were much faster to use and the simple code in a telephone switch could be written to use only these types of instructions. The result of this work was a conceptual design for a simplified processor with the required performance.

The telephone switch project was canceled in 1975, but the team had made considerable progress on the concept and in October IBM decided to continue it as a general-purpose design. With no obvious project to attach it to, the team decided to call it the &quot;801&quot; after the building they worked in. For the general-purpose role, the team began to consider real-world programs that would be run on a typical minicomputer. IBM had collected enormous amounts of statistical data on the performance of real-world workloads on their machines and this data demonstrated that over half the time in a typical program was spent performing only five instructions: load value from memory, store value to memory, adding fixed-point numbers, comparing fixed-point numbers, and branching based on the result of those comparisons. This suggested that the same simplified processor design would work just as well for a general-purpose minicomputer as a special-purpose switch.

===Rationale against use of microcode===
This conclusion flew in the face of contemporary processor design, which was based on the concept of using microcode. IBM had been among the first to make widespread use of this technique as part of their System/360 series. The 360s, and 370s, came in a variety of performance levels that all ran the same machine language code. On the high-end machines, many of these instructions were implemented directly in hardware, like a floating point unit, while low-end machines could instead simulate those instructions using a sequence of other instructions encoded in microcode. This allowed a single application binary interface to run across the entire lineup and allowed the customers to feel confident that if more performance was ever needed they could move up to a faster machine without any other changes.

Microcode allowed a simple processor to offer many instructions, which had been used by the designers to implement a wide variety of addressing modes. For instance, an instruction like codice_1 might have a dozen versions, one that adds two numbers in internal registers, one that adds a register to a value in memory, one that adds two values from memory, etc. This allowed the programmer to select the exact variation that they needed for any particular task. The processor would read that instruction and use microcode to break it into a series of internal instructions. For instance, adding two numbers in memory might be implemented by loading those two numbers into registers, adding them, and then storing the sum back to memory. The idea of offering all possible addressing modes for all instructions became a goal of processor designers, the concept becoming known as an orthogonal instruction set.

The 801 team noticed a side-effect of this concept; when faced with the plethora of possible versions of a given instruction, compiler authors would usually pick a single version. This was typically the one that was implemented in hardware on the low-end machines. That ensured that the machine code generated by the compiler would run as fast as possible on the entire lineup. While using other versions of instructions might run even faster on a machine that implemented them in hardware, the complexity of knowing which one to pick on an ever-changing list of machines made this extremely unattractive, and compiler authors largely ignored these possibilities.

As a result, the majority of the instructions available in the instruction set were never used in compiled programs. And it was here that the team made the key realization of the 801 project:

Imposing microcode between a computer and its users imposes an expensive overhead in performing the most frequently executed instructions.

Microcode takes a non-zero time to examine the instruction before it is performed. The same underlying processor with the microcode removed would eliminate this overhead and run those instructions faster. Since microcode essentially ran small subroutines dedicated to a particular hardware implementation, it was ultimately performing the same basic task that the compiler was, implementing higher-level instructions as a sequence of machine-specific instructions. Simply removing the microcode and implementing that in the compiler could result in a faster machine.

One concern was that programs written for such a machine would take up more memory; some tasks that could be accomplished with a single instruction on the 370 would have to be expressed as multiple instructions on the 801. For instance, adding two numbers from memory would require two load-to-register instructions, a register-to-register add, and then a store-to-memory. This could potentially slow the system overall if it had to spend more time reading instructions from memory than it formerly took to decode them. As they continued work on the design and improved their compilers, they found that overall program length continued to fall, eventually becoming roughly the same length as those written for the 370.

===First implementations===
The initially proposed architecture was a machine with sixteen 24-bit registers and without virtual memory. It used a two-operand format in the instruction, so that instructions were generally of the form codice_2, as opposed to the three-operand format, codice_3. The resulting CPU was operational by the summer of 1980 and was implemented using Motorola MECL-10K discrete component technology on large wire-wrapped custom boards. The CPU was clocked at 66 ns cycles (approximately 15.15 MHz) and could compute at the fast speed of approximately 15 MIPS.

The 801 architecture was used in a variety of IBM devices, including channel controllers for their S/370 mainframes (such as the IBM 3090), various networking devices, and as a vertical microcode execution unit in the 9373 and 9375 processors of the IBM 9370 mainframe family. The original version of the 801 architecture was the basis for the architecture of the IBM ROMP microprocessor used in the IBM RT PC workstation computer and several experimental computers from IBM Research. A derivative of the 801 architecture with 32-bit addressing named &quot;Iliad&quot; was intended to serve as the primary processor of the unsuccessful Fort Knox midrange system project.

==Later modifications==
Having been originally designed for a limited-function system, the 801 design lacked a number of features seen on larger machines. Notable among these was the lack of hardware support for virtual memory, which was not needed for the controller role and had been implemented in software on early 801 systems that needed it. For more widespread use, hardware support was a must-have feature. Additionally, by the 1980s the computer world as a whole was moving towards 32-bit systems, and there was a desire to do the same with the 801.

Moving to a 32-bit format had another significant advantage. In practice, it was found that the two-operand format was difficult to use in typical math code. Ideally, both input operands would remain in registers where they could be reused in subsequent operations. In the two-operand format, one of the two values was overwritten with the result, and it was often the case that one of the values had to be re-loaded from memory. By moving to a 32-bit format, the extra bits in the instruction words allowed an additional register to be specified, so that the output of such operations could be directed to a separate register. The larger instruction word also allowed the number of registers to be increased from sixteen to thirty-two, a change that had been obvious from the examination of 801 code. Despite the expansion of the instruction words from 24 to 32-bits, programs did not grow by the corresponding 33% due to avoided loads and saves due to these two changes.

Other desirable additions include instructions for working with string data that was encoded in &quot;packed&quot; format with several characters in a single memory word, and additions for working with binary-coded decimal, including an adder that could carry across four-bit decimal numbers.

When the new version of the 801 was run as a simulator on the 370, the team was surprised to find that code compiled to the 801 and run in the simulator would often run faster than the same source code compiled directly to 370 machine code using the 370&#x27;s PL/I compiler. When they ported their experimental &quot;PL.8&quot; language back to the 370 and compiled applications using it, those applications ran as much as three times as fast as the PL/I versions. This was due to the compiler making RISC-like decisions about how the generated code uses the processor registers, thereby optimizing out as many memory accesses as possible. These were just as expensive on the 370 as the 801, but this cost was normally hidden by the simplicity of a single line of CISC code. The PL.8 compiler was much more aggressive about avoiding loads and saves, thereby resulting in higher performance even on a CISC processor.

==The Cheetah, Panther, and America projects==
In the early 1980s, the lessons learned on the 801 were combined with those from the IBM Advanced Computer Systems project, resulting in an experimental processor called &quot;Cheetah&quot;. Cheetah was a 2-way superscalar processor, which evolved into a processor called &quot;Panther&quot; in 1985, and finally into a 4-way superscalar design called &quot;America&quot; in 1986. This was a three-chip processor set including an instruction processor that fetches and decodes instructions, a fixed-point processor that shares duty with the instruction processor, and a floating-point processor for those systems that require it. Designed by the 801 team, the final design was sent to IBM&#x27;s Austin office in 1986, where it was developed into the IBM RS/6000 system. The RS/6000 running at 25 MHz was one of the fastest machines of its era. It outperformed other RISC machines by two to three times on common tests, and easily outperformed older CISC systems.

After the RS/6000, the company turned its attention to a version of the 801 concepts that could be efficiently fabricated at various scales. The result was the IBM POWER instruction set architecture and the PowerPC offshoot.

==Recognition==
For his work on the 801, John Cocke was awarded several awards and medals:

* 1985: Eckert–Mauchly Award
* 1987: A.M. Turing Award
* 1989: Computer Pioneer Award
* 1991: National Medal of Technology
* 1994: IEEE John von Neumann Medal
* 1994: National Medal of Science
* 2000: Benjamin Franklin Medal (The Franklin Institute)

Michael J. Flynn views the 801 as the first RISC.

<doc id="60679" wikidata="Q1308" url="?curid=60679" title="Como">
<text>Como (, ; , or ; ) is a city and (municipality) in Lombardy, Italy. It is the administrative capital of the Province of Como.

Its proximity to Lake Como and to the Alps has made Como a tourist destination, and the city contains numerous works of art, churches, gardens, museums, theatres, parks, and palaces: the &quot;Duomo&quot;, seat of the Diocese of Como; the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Abbondio; the Villa Olmo; the public gardens with the Tempio Voltiano; the Teatro Sociale; the &quot;Broletto&quot; or the city&#x27;s medieval town hall; and the 20th-century Casa del Fascio.

Como was the birthplace of many historical figures, including the poet Caecilius mentioned by Catullus in the first century BCE, writers Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger, Pope Innocent XI, scientist Alessandro Volta, and Cosima Liszt, second wife of Richard Wagner and long-term director of the Bayreuth Festival, and Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia (1888–1916), a futurist architect and a pioneer of the modern movement.

==History==
=== Ancient history ===
The hills surrounding the current location of Como were inhabited, since at least the Iron Age, by a Celtic tribe known as the Orobii, who also, according to Pliny the Elder and modern scholars, had relations with the Ancient Ligurians, a people very similar to the Celts. Remains of settlements are still present on the wood-covered hills to the southwest of town, around the area of the modern town&#x27;s district of Rebbio. In the areas of the districts of Breccia, Prestino and the neighbouring towns of San Fermo della Battaglia and Cavallasca there were also settlements of the Golasecca Culture, built in the Iron Age. Later, a second Celtic migration brought the Gaulish peoples in the area of Como, especially the tribe of the Insubres.

Around the first century BC, the territory became subject to the Romans. The town centre was situated on the nearby hills, but it was then moved to its current location by order of Julius Caesar, who had the swamp near the southern tip of the lake drained and laid the plan of the walled city in the typical Roman grid of perpendicular streets. The newly founded town was named &quot;Novum Comum&quot; and had the status of &quot;municipium&quot;. In September 2018, Culture Minister Alberto Bonisoli announced the discovery of several hundred gold coins in the basement of the former Cressoni Theater (Teatro Cressoni) in a two-handled soapstone amphora, coins struck by emperors Honorius, Valentinian III, Leo I the Thracian, Antonio and Libius Severus dating to 474 AD.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the history of Como followed that of the rest of Lombardy, being occupied by the Goths, the Byzantines, and later the Langobards. The Langobards were a significant people in the region. Originating in Scandinavia, this Germanic group arrived in the Po Valley in 568, led by King Alboin. The Langobards established the Lombard Kingdom, which initially encompassed only modern-day Northern Italy, but later expanded to include Tuscany, Umbria, and portions of Southern Italy. Under Lombard rule, Como continued to flourish, particularly due to the reconstruction of Queen Theudelind&#x27;s road, which connected Germany and the Italian Peninsula, providing the town with strategic access to commerce.
In 774, Como surrendered to the invading Franks led by Charlemagne and subsequently became a center of commercial exchange.

=== Communal Era ===
The Commune of Como likely originated in the 11th century as an &quot;association of prestigious families on a treaty basis,&quot; bound by an oath of adhesion to the commune, which was renewed periodically in front of municipal authorities until the 1200s, and later in the presence of the mayor. Despite resistance from parts of the feudal nobility of the diocese, this pact quickly extended to the entire free male population of the town. This expansion aimed to strengthen the political independence of Como and its diocese, especially from neighboring Milan, and to affirm the sovereignty of the bishop of Como. The bishop soon became the de facto &quot;head of state&quot;, while an assembly of citizens convened in the &quot;Broletto&quot; (Town Hall), called &quot;Brolo&quot;. This assembly consisted of representatives of the local nobility, known as consuls, and later included representatives of the guilds. The Commune had a set of laws and conventions that regulated urban activities, commerce, agriculture, fishing, hunting, law enforcement, and taxation.

The first explicit written mention of the Commune of Como dates back to 1109. Initially, the deliberative assembly of the commune was likely the plenary assembly. In the early 12th century, the role of this assembly was assumed by the council (or &quot;Credenza&quot;), known after 1213 as the &quot;General council&quot; or &quot;Bell council&quot;. From the second half of the 13th century, this assembly was divided into a large and a small council. Starting in 1109, the communal organization included an executive body called the &quot;collegial magistracy of the consuls&quot;. Before 1172, this body was divided into two institutions: the consuls of justice and the consuls of the municipality. In the early 13th century, the latter were replaced by the podestà, who had broader special powers in criminal matters.

The territory of the Commune extended beyond the town of Como itself, encompassing the entire diocese, which included most of present-day Province of Como, modern-day Canton of Ticino, Valtellina, Valchiavenna, and Colico. Thanks to its strategic position on Lake Como and the important Road of Queen Theudelind, which linked the Italian Peninsula with Germany: the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, Como quickly became a wealthy and powerful town.

During this period of growth, Como and Milan quickly became rivals. The Commune of Milan experienced significant population growth but lacked strategic communication routes. Consequently, Milan planned to conquer neighboring territories to gain access to their strategic positions. Tensions first arose over the County of Seprio, as both communes sought control of the area. Meanwhile, Milan acted aggressively against other Lombard towns, leading to the outbreak of the war of Lodi when soldiers from Lodi, Pavia, and Cremona attacked Tortona, an ally of Milan. In this conflict, Milan, supported by Crema and Tortona, fought against the communes of Lodi, Pavia, and Cremona, ultimately achieving a significant victory that established Milan as the dominant power in Lombardy.

This left the Commune of Como as Milan&#x27;s only remaining rival. Tensions escalated when Emperor Henry IV appointed Landolfo da Carcano, who sympathized with Milan, as the bishop of Como. In response, the people of Como elected Guido Grimoldi as their bishop and exiled Landolfo. Despite his exile, Landolfo continued to interfere in Como&#x27;s affairs, prompting the town to besiege his castle under the leadership of consul Adamo del Pero. Landolfo was captured and imprisoned, igniting a crisis between Como and Milan, as Milanese soldiers had defended Landolfo&#x27;s castle.

This conflict led to the Decennial War between Como and Milan in 1118. The war is well-documented thanks to an anonymous poet who recorded the events in a poem titled &quot;Liber Cumanus, sive de bello Mediolanensium adversus Comenses&quot;. Initially, Como seemed to prevail due to smart tactics, but after the death of Guido Grimoldi, the tide turned, and Como lost the war in 1127. Milanese soldiers destroyed every building in Como, sparing only the churches.

After the war, the Commune was forced to pay tribute to Milan. However, this changed when Frederick Barbarossa came to power and restored Como&#x27;s independence from Milan. The Comaschi avenged their defeat when Milan was destroyed in 1162. Frederick promoted the construction of several defensive towers and small castles around the town&#x27;s limits, of which only the Baradello remains. He also assisted the town in rebuilding its defensive walls, most of which still survive today.

When the Guelph communes organized the Lombard League to oppose the Holy Roman Emperor, Como maintained its Ghibelline alignment. Frederick I Barbarossa formally recognized the Commune of Como with an imperial diploma in 1175 (Concession of Frederick I 1175), allowing the town to elect the mayors of the county. This was a reward for Como&#x27;s defection from the Lombard League and its shared anti-Milan policy. Subsequent agreements in 1191 and 1216 saw Emperors Henry VI and Frederick II extend additional concessions to Como, similar to those made in the Peace of Constance to the cities participating in the League.

In 1281, Como adopted its first written legislative code, the &quot;Statuta Consulum Iustitie et Negotiatorum&quot;, followed by a second code in 1296.

===The rise of Rusca/Rusconi family to power===
 In the second half of the 12th century, the Rusca family (also known as Rusconi) began to gain prominence in the town of Como. The Rusca were a noble family originating in Como in the 10th century. They led the Ghibelline faction in the town, with their principal rivals being the members of the Vitani family.

In 1182, Giovanni Rusca became a consul of the commune and was later appointed podestà of Milan in 1199, thanks to his abilities during a peace treaty with the rival city. Between 1194 and 1198, he was joined by two other relatives, Adamo and Loterio, who also became consuls of Como. The Rusca quickly became the most influential family in Como, with several members attempting to establish a lordship over the town with varying degrees of success.

Loterio Rusca was the first to attempt this goal. He was acclaimed &quot;Lord of the People&quot; in 1276 and, with the trust of the Comaschi, he began his rise to power. However, he faced resistance from the bishop of Como, Giovanni degli Avvocati, who was consequently exiled. Giovanni was hosted by the Visconti of Milan, providing Ottone Visconti with a pretext to start a new war against Como. Unexpectedly, Loterio prevailed and signed a favorable peace treaty with Milan in the town of Lomazzo. Milan was forced to recognize Loterio as the ruler of their rival town and return the town of Bellinzona to Como.

Thanks to this success, the family secured titles such as Lords of Como, Bellinzona, Chiavenna, and Valtellina, as well as Counts of Locarno, Lugano, and Luino. Following Loterio&#x27;s death, the next notable family member was Franchino I Rusca, who established a personal lordship over Como and its territories and became an imperial vicar.

In 1335, a new war between Como and Milan broke out due to the expiration of conditions established in Lomazzo. This time, under the leadership of Azzone Visconti, Milan won the war and Como was annexed to the Duchy of Milan. The people of Como sought to regain their administrative freedom, and an opportunity arose in 1402 when Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, died. Franchino II Rusca led a rebellion against the Milanese, which ended in 1412 when his son, Loterio IV Rusca, gained the title of Lord of Como and drove out the Milanese occupiers. However, this did not end the political unrest, and a period of conflicts and massacres ensued until Como once again fell under the control of Filippo Maria Visconti, becoming part of the Duchy of Milan in 1416.

At the Duke&#x27;s death, Como reclaimed its independence, and in 1447, the &quot;Republic of Saint Abundius&quot; was founded. In January 1449, Francesco Sforza, who claimed the title of Duke of Milan (though the city was under the control of the Ambrosian Republic), sent Giuseppe Ventimiglia to attack Como. He was repelled by the citizens led by Giovanni della Noce, forcing him to retreat to Cantù, in Brianza. Monzone assisted the Rusca against the Vitani, who were Guelphs allied with the Milanese, ultimately defeating them with Ghibelline forces. In April 1449, Ventimiglia attacked Como again, and in January 1450, he unsuccessfully attacked the Ambrosian garrisons in Monza, intended to reunite with the Venetians of Colleoni to support Milan against Sforza. These events, known as the Battles of Cantù and Asso, culminated in March 1450 when Como was defeated following the fall of the Ambrosian Republic, due to exhaustion and lack of resources. Como was definitively subjected to the reconstituted Duchy of Milan under Francesco Sforza, who in 1458 profoundly reformed the Statutes of Como.

=== Modern Era===
Subsequently, the history of Como followed that of the Duchy of Milan, through the French invasion and the Spanish domination, until 1714, when the territory was taken by the Austrians. Napoleon descended into Lombardy in 1796 and ruled it until 1815, when the Austrian rule was resumed after the Congress of Vienna. By 1848, the population had reached 16,000. In 1859, with the arrival of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the town became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy under the House of Savoy.

=== 20th century ===
The Rockefeller fountain that today stands in the Bronx Zoo in New York City was once in the main square (Piazza Cavour) by the lakeside. It was bought by William Rockefeller in 1902 for Lire3,500 (the estimated equivalent then of $637).

At the end of World War II, after passing through Como on his escape towards Switzerland, Benito Mussolini was taken prisoner and then shot by partisans in Giulino di Mezzegra, a small town on the north shores of Lake Como.

=== 21st century ===
In 2010, a motion by members of the nationalist Swiss People&#x27;s Party was submitted to the Swiss parliament requesting the admission of adjacent territories to the Swiss Confederation; Como (and its province) is one of these.

==Geography and Climate==
Situated at the southern tip of the south-west arm of Lake Como, the city is located north of Milan; the city proper borders Switzerland and the &quot;communes&quot; of Blevio, Brunate, Capiago Intimiano, Casnate con Bernate, Cernobbio, Grandate, Lipomo, Maslianico, Montano Lucino, San Fermo della Battaglia, Senna Comasco, Tavernerio, and Torno, and the Swiss towns of Chiasso and Vacallo. Nearby major cities are Varese, Lecco, and Lugano.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Como has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;); until the late 20th century winters used to be quite cold, with average daily temperatures well below freezing; recently, occasional periods of frost from the Siberian Anticyclone have been recorded; however, due to global warming average temperatures in winter have gradually risen since the turn of the 21st century, reaching a record high of 21 degrees Celsius (70 °F) on 27 January 2024; spring and autumn are well marked and pleasant, while summer can be quite hot and sultry. Wind is uncommon although sudden bursts of foehn have been registered in different occasions. Pollution levels rise significantly in winter when cold air clings to the soil. Rain is more frequent during spring; summer is subject to thunderstorms and occasionally violent hailstorms.

==Government==
The legislative body of the Italian comuni is the City Council (&quot;Consiglio Comunale&quot;); in Como, it comprises 32 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time of the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (&quot;Giunta Comunale&quot;), composed of 9 &quot;assessori&quot; each overseeing a specific ministry, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor (&quot;Sindaco&quot;). The mayor of Como since 27 June 2022, is Alessandro Rapinese, an independent leading an alliance bearing his name (Rapinese Sindaco), unaffiliated with any official political party.
===Administrative subdivisions===
Como is divided into these &quot;&quot; (roughly equivalent to the anglocentric ward):

# Albate – Muggiò – Acquanera
# Lora
# Prestino – Camerlata – Breccia – Rebbio
# Camnago Volta
# City Center – West Como
# Borghi
# North Como – East Como
# Monte Olimpino – Ponte Chiasso – Sagnino – Tavernola
# Garzola – Civiglio

==Main sights==
===Churches===
*Como Cathedral: Construction began in 1396 on the site of the previous Romanesque church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The façade was built in 1457, with the characteristic rose window and a portal flanked by two Renaissance statues of the famous &quot;comaschi&quot; Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger. The construction was finished in 1740. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with Gothic nave and two aisles divided by piers, while the transept wing and the relative apses are from the Renaissance age. It includes a carved 16th-century choir and tapestries on cartoons by Giuseppe Arcimboldi. The dome is a rococo structure by Filippo Juvarra. Other artworks include 16th–17th-century tapestries and 16th-century paintings by Bernardino Luini and Gaudenzio Ferrari.
*&quot;San Fedele&quot;, a Romanesque church erected around 1120 over a pre-existing central plan edifice. The original bell tower was rebuilt in modern times. The main feature is the famous Door of St. Fedele, carved with medieval decorations.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;, built by the Cistercians in the early 14th century, heavily renovated in the 20th. The interior and adjoining cloister have 15th–17th-century frescoes, but most of the decoration is Baroque.
*&quot;Basilica of Sant&#x27;Abbondio&quot;, a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1095 by Pope Urban II. The interior, with a nave and four aisles, contains paintings dating to the 11th century and frescoes from the 14th.
*&quot;San Carpoforo&quot; (11th century, apse and crypt from 12th century). According to tradition, it was founded re-using a former temple of the God Mercury to house the remains of Saint Carpophorus and other local martyrs.
===Secular buildings and monuments===
*The ancient town hall, known as the &quot;Broletto&quot;
*&quot;Casa del Fascio&quot;, possibly Giuseppe Terragni&#x27;s most famous work. It has been described as an early &quot;landmark of modern European architecture&quot;.
*&quot;Monumento ai caduti&quot; (war memorial) by Giuseppe Terragni

* the &quot;Life Electric&quot;, a modern sculpture made by Daniel Libeskind
* &quot;Castello Baradello&quot;, a small medieval castle overlooking the town and which is all that remains of the fortress constructed by Barbarossa 

==Economy==
The economy of Como, until the end of the 1980s, was traditionally based on industry; in particular, the city was world-famous for its silk manufacturers, and in 1972 its production exceeded that of China and Japan, but since the mid-1990s increasing competition from Asia has significantly reduced profit margins and many small and mid-sized firms have gone out of business. As a consequence, manufacturing is no longer the economic driver, and the city has been absorbed into Milan&#x27;s metropolitan area where it mainly provides workers to the service industry sector. A significant number of residents are employed in the nearby Swiss towns Lugano and Mendrisio, primarily in the industrial sector, health care services and in the hospitality industry; the commute is beneficial as wages in Switzerland are notably higher. For these reasons, tourism has become increasingly important for the city&#x27;s economy since the late 1990s, when local small businesses have gradually been replaced by bars, restaurants and hotels.
With about 400 thousand overnight guests in 2023, Como was one of the most visited cities in Lombardy.

The city and the lake have been chosen as the filming location for various recent popular feature films, and this, together with the increasing presence of celebrities such as Matt Bellamy who have bought lakeside properties, has heightened the city&#x27;s attractiveness and given a further boost to international tourism; since the early 2000s the city has become a popular &quot;must-see&quot; tourist destination in Italy.

==Demographics==
The city of Como has seen its population increase until it peaked at almost 100,000 inhabitants in the 1970s, when manufacturing, especially the silk industry, was in its boom years. As production began to decline, the population tally decreased by almost 20,000 until the beginning of the 21st century, when the city saw its population grow again by more than six thousand units, generally due to increasing immigration from Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa. As of January 2023, the population was 83,700 people of which 12,000 were resident aliens, that is, 14% of the total; the population distribution by origin was as follows:

In Como there are the following museums and exhibition centres:
*Museo Archeologico &quot;P. Giovio&quot; – archeological museum
*Garibaldi Museum (Como) – a museum dedicated to Giuseppe Garibaldi
*Tempio Voltiano – a museum devoted to Alessandro Volta&#x27;s work

*Pinacoteca Civica – paintings and artworks from the Carolingian to modern era housed in the 17th-century Palazzo Volpi

===Cuisine===

Polenta is a popular dish in Como, and was traditionally eaten for meals in wintertime. It is obtained by mixing and cooking corn flour and buckwheat. It is usually served with meat, game, cheese and sometimes fish; in fact, &quot;Polenta e Misultin&quot; (&quot;Alosa agone&quot;) is served in the restaurants in the Lake Como area.

A traditional dish is the &quot;Risotto con Filetti di Pesce Persico&quot; or simply &quot;Risotto al Pesce Persico&quot; (European perch filet risotto), a fish grown in Lake Como, prepared with white wine, onion, butter and wheat.

===Palio del Baradello===
In Como, a medieval festival called &quot;Palio del Baradello&quot; takes place annually.

The first edition took place in 1981. The event is organized every year to narrate to the citizens and tourists the events that happened in 1159 when the town hosted the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and aided him in his fight against the rebel communes in Lombardy. The Emperor restored Como&#x27;s former freedom, which was lost in a ten-year-long war against Milan. Together, the Ghibelline communes and the emperor defeated Milan.

These pivotal moments for the town are celebrated by the medieval festival, where actors portray the main characters: Frederick Barbarossa, Henry the Lion, Beatrice of Burgundy, and Bishop Ardizzone, while citizens dress up in medieval attire.

During the Palio del Baradello, the town is divided into its historical wards called &quot;Borghi&quot; (in Lombard: &quot;Burgh&quot;) Tavernola, Quarcino, Rebbio, Camerlata, Cernobbio, Cortesella and Sant&#x27;Agostino. The first day hosts the opening ceremony while in the following days the factions compete in different races to determine which district will win the year&#x27;s edition.

The final day of the festival consists of a grand parade where all the participants march across the town in medieval costumes, accompanied by animals, wagons, and replicas of siege engines, culminating in a ceremony where the emperor announces to the public which ward won the competition.


==Symbology==

===Heraldry===
The heraldic achievement of Como consists of a white cross on a red background. This symbol was used in the Middle Ages to represent the town&#x27;s political faction, the Ghibellines. The first recorded mention of this emblem dates back to the decennial war between Como and Milan (1118–1127). An anonymous poet from Como described the coat of arms in his poem about the war as &quot;rubra signa&quot; (Latin: &quot;red symbol&quot;) and &quot;cum cruce alba&quot; (Latin: &quot;with a white cross&quot;).

Later, the motto &#x27;LIBERTAS&#x27; (Latin: &#x27;Freedom&#x27;) was added to the town&#x27;s heraldic achievement. The oldest testament of this symbol comes from the year 1619 when the historian Francesco Ballarini wrote that the people of Como at the time were already using the motto in the town&#x27;s coat of arms. It is thought that this motto emerged when the town of Como was liberated from the Milanese occupation with the help of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. The motto was later censored when the town was conquered by the Visconti family in the 15th Century. It was restored when the town proclaimed its independence from the Lordship of Milan, but censored again as Milan regained control over Como. The motto was restored one last time after the unification of Italy, as otherwise the town&#x27;s coat of arms would have been too similar to the arms of the House of Savoy, which were included in the heraldic achievement of the newly born Kingdom of Italy.

Curiously, the coat of arms of Como is often represented with a curvature and surrounded by floral elements. The crown is another important element of the heraldic achievement. A crown appeared in the coats of arms of Como reported on some municipal posters in 1796. On 9 November 1819, Francis I of Austria, Emperor of the Austria, recognized Como as a &quot;Royal Town&quot;: that is when the crown (five-pointed and studded with gems) officially entered the coat of arms. In the version that came in 1859, the crown is topped with six gold fleurs-de-lis (only the front three visible).

===Flags===

Throughout history, Como has used the Cross of Saint John as its flag: a white cross over a red field. Around the 12th Century, the city started to fly a version of this banner that included the word &quot;LIBERTAS&quot; in the bottom right corner, as represented in the town&#x27;s heraldic achievement. This flag can be seen displayed at the town hall (Palazzo Cernezzi). 

==Transportation==

===Rail===
The Servizio Ferroviario Regionale (Regional Railway Service) connects Como by train to other major cities in Lombardy. Services are provided by Trenord through two main stations: Como San Giovanni and Como Nord Lago. There are five more urban stations (Albate-Camerlata, Albate-Trecallo, Como Borghi, Como Camerlata and Grandate-Breccia).

Como San Giovanni is also a stop on the main north–south line between Milan Centrale and Zürich HB and Basel SBB. Intercity and EuroCity trains stop at this station, which makes Como very accessible from the European Express train network.

The lakeside funicular connects the centre of Como with Brunate, a small village (1,800 inhabitants) on a mountain at above sea level.

===Buses and taxis===
The local public transport network comprises 11 urban (within city limits) lines and &#x27;extra-urban&#x27; (crossing city limits) (C) lines connecting Como with most of its province centres. They are provided by ASF Autolinee.

Ferrovie Nord Milano also provides other bus lines connecting Como to Varese in substitution of the original railway line that was dismissed in the 1960s.

Taxi service is provided by the Municipality of Como.

===Ship transport===
The boats and hydrofoils (&quot;aliscafi&quot;) of Navigazione Laghi connect the town with most of the villages sitting on the shores of the lake.

===Airports===
Nearby airports providing scheduled flights are Malpensa International Airport, Milano Linate and Orio al Serio International Airport; Lugano Airport, in Switzerland, mainly schedules regional flights within Switzerland, charter flights to nearby countries and caters to private aircraft operations.

====Aero Club====

Como is home to the oldest seaplane operation in the world, the Aero Club Como (ICAO code LILY), with a fleet consisting of four seaplanes, used for flight training and local tour flights and four classic seaplanes of historical interest, a 1961 Cessna O-1 Bird Dog, a 1946 Republic RC-3 Seabee a 1947 Macchi M.B.308 &quot;idro&quot; and a perfectly restored 1935 Caproni Ca.100. A hangar right next to the lake houses the club&#x27;s fleet and is also used for aircraft maintenance and servicing.
==Education and health==
Como is home to numerous high schools, the Conservatory of music &quot;Giuseppe Verdi&quot;, the Design school &quot;Aldo Galli&quot;, the University of Insubria and a branch campus of the Politecnico di Milano.

In Como there are three major hospitals: Ospedale Sant&#x27;Anna, Ospedale Valduce and Clinica Villa Aprica.

==Sports==
Notable sports clubs are the ASDG Comense 1872 basketball team, a two-time winner of the FIBA EuroLeague Women, and Como 1907, a football team. There are also numerous recreational activities available for tourists such as pedal boating, fishing, walking and seaplane rentals. Como also hosts a prestigious clay-court tennis tournament every year, the Città di Como Challenger, which attracts many of the world&#x27;s top players who are not involved in the concurrent US Open. Many players have testified that they much prefer playing in the relaxed and friendly Como environs than the hustle and bustle of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. 

The Unione Sportiva Tavernola is an amateur sports club based in the Tavernola neighborhood of Como, active since 1973.

<text>Mordecai Richler (January 27, 1931 – July 3, 2001) was a Canadian writer. His best known works are &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1959) and &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot; (1997). His 1970 novel &quot;St. Urbain&#x27;s Horseman&quot; and 1989 novel &quot;Solomon Gursky Was Here&quot; were nominated for the Booker Prize. He is also well known for the &quot;Jacob Two-Two&quot; fantasy series for children. In addition to his fiction, Richler wrote numerous essays about the Jewish community in Canada, and about Canadian and Quebec nationalism. Richler&#x27;s &quot;Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!&quot; (1992), a collection of essays about nationalism and anti-Semitism, generated considerable controversy.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
The son of Lily (née Rosenberg) and Moses Isaac Richler, a scrap metal dealer, Richler was born on January 27, 1931, in Montreal, Quebec, and raised on St. Urbain Street in that city&#x27;s Mile End area. He was fluent in English, French and Yiddish, and graduated from Baron Byng High School. Richler enrolled in Sir George Williams College (now Concordia University) to study but did not complete his degree. Years later, Richler&#x27;s mother published an autobiography, &quot;The Errand Runner: Memoirs of a Rabbi&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1981), which discusses Mordecai&#x27;s birth and upbringing, and the sometimes difficult relationship between them. (Mordecai Richler&#x27;s grandfather and Lily Richler&#x27;s father was Rabbi Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg, a celebrated rabbi in both Poland and Canada and a prolific author of many religious texts, as well as religious fiction and non-fiction works on science and history geared for religious communities.)

Richler moved to Paris at age nineteen, intent on following in the footsteps of a previous generation of literary exiles, the so-called Lost Generation of the 1920s, many of whom were from the United States.

===Career===
Richler returned to Montreal in 1952, working briefly at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, then moved to London in 1954. He published seven of his ten novels, as well as considerable journalism, while living in London.

Worrying &quot;about being so long away from the roots of my discontent&quot;, Richler returned to Montreal in 1972. He wrote repeatedly about the Anglophone community of Montreal and especially about his former neighbourhood, portraying it in multiple novels.

===Marriage and family===
In England, in 1954, Richler married Catherine Boudreau, nine years his senior. On the eve of their wedding, he met and was smitten by Florence Mann (née Wood), then married to Richler&#x27;s close friend, screenwriter Stanley Mann.

Some years later Richler and Mann both divorced their prior spouses and married each other, and Richler adopted her son Daniel. The couple had four other children together: Jacob, Noah, Martha and Emma. These events inspired his novel &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot;.

Richler died of cancer on July 3, 2001, in Montreal, aged 70.

He was also a second cousin of novelist Nancy Richler.

==Journalism career==
Throughout his career, Richler wrote journalistic commentary, and contributed to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, and other magazines. In his later years, Richler was a newspaper columnist for &quot;The National Post&quot; and Montreal&#x27;s &quot;The Gazette&quot;. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he authored a monthly book review for &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;.

Richler was often critical of Quebec but of Canadian federalism as well. Another favourite Richler target was the government-subsidized Canadian literary movement of the 1970s and 1980s. Journalism constituted an important part of his career, bringing him income between novels and films.

==&quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;==

Richler published his fourth novel, &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, in 1959. The book featured a frequent Richler theme: Jewish life in the 1930s and 40s in the neighbourhood of Montreal east of Mount Royal Park on and about St. Urbain Street and Saint Laurent Boulevard (known colloquially as &quot;The Main&quot;). Richler wrote of the neighbourhood and its people, chronicling the hardships and disabilities they faced as a Jewish minority.

Following the publication of &quot;Duddy Kravitz&quot;, according to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature&quot;, Richler became &quot;one of the foremost writers of his generation&quot;.

==Reception==

Many critics distinguished Richler the author from Richler the polemicist. Richler frequently said his goal was to be an honest witness to his time and place, and to write at least one book that would be read after his death. His work was championed by journalists Robert Fulford and Peter Gzowski, among others. Admirers praised Richler for daring to tell uncomfortable truths; Michael Posner&#x27;s oral biography of Richler is titled &quot;The Last Honest Man&quot; (2004).

Critics cited his repeated themes, including incorporating elements of his journalism into later novels. Richler&#x27;s ambivalent attitude toward Montreal&#x27;s Jewish community was captured in &quot;Mordecai and Me&quot; (2003), a book by Joel Yanofsky.

&quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; has been performed on film and in several live theatre productions in Canada and the United States.

==Controversy==

Richler&#x27;s most frequent conflicts were with members of the Quebec nationalist movement. In articles published between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s, Richler criticized Quebec&#x27;s restrictive language laws and the rise of sovereigntism. Critics took particular exception to Richler&#x27;s allegations of a long history of anti-Semitism in Quebec.

Soon after the first election of the Parti Québécois (PQ) in 1976, Richler published &quot;Oh Canada! Lament for a divided country&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; to considerable controversy. In it, he claimed the PQ had borrowed the Hitler Youth song &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; from &quot;Cabaret&quot; for their anthem &quot;À partir d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui, demain nous appartient&quot;, though he later acknowledged his error on the song, blaming himself for having &quot;cribbed&quot; the information from an article by Irwin Cotler and Ruth Wisse published in the American magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;. Cotler eventually issued a written apology to Lévesque of the PQ. Richler also apologized for the incident and called it an &quot;embarrassing gaffe&quot;.

In 1992 Richler published &quot;Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!: Requiem for a Divided Country&quot;, which parodied Quebec&#x27;s language laws. He commented approvingly on Esther Delisle&#x27;s &quot;The Traitor and the Jew: Anti-Semitism and the Delirium of Extremist Right-Wing Nationalism in French Canada from 1929–1939&quot; (1992), about French-Canadian anti-Semitism in the decade before the start of World War II. &quot;Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!&quot; was criticized by the Quebec sovereigntist movement and to a lesser degree by other anglophone Canadians. His detractors claimed that Richler had an outdated and stereotyped view of Quebec society, and fearmongered that he risked polarizing relations between francophone and anglophone Quebecers. Sovereigntist Pierrette Venne, later elected as a Bloc Québécois MP, called for the book to be banned. Daniel Latouche compared the book to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Nadia Khouri believes that there was a discriminatory undertone in the reaction to Richler, noting that some of his critics characterized him as &quot;not one of us&quot; or that he was not a &quot;real Quebecer&quot;. She found that some critics had misquoted his work; for instance, in reference to the mantra of the entwined church and state coaxing females to procreate as vastly as possible, a section in which he said that Quebec women were treated like &quot;sows&quot; was misinterpreted to suggest that Richler thought they were sows. Québécois writers who thought critics had overreacted included Jean-Hugues Roy, Étienne Gignac, Serge-Henri Vicière, and Dorval Brunelle. His defenders asserted that Mordecai Richler may have been wrong on certain specific points, but was certainly not racist nor anti-Québécois. Nadia Khouri acclaimed Richler for his courage and for attacking the orthodoxies of Quebec society. He has been described as &quot;the most prominent defender of the rights of Quebec&#x27;s anglophones&quot;.

Some commentators were alarmed about the strong controversy over Richler&#x27;s book, saying that it underlines and acknowledges the persistence of anti-Semitism among sections of the Quebec population. Richler received death threats; an anti-Semitic Francophone journalist yelled at one of his sons, &quot;[I]f your father was here, I&#x27;d make him relive the Holocaust right now!&quot; An editorial cartoon in &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot; compared him to Hitler. One critic controversially claimed that Richler had been paid by Jewish groups to write his critical essay on Quebec. His defenders believed this was evoking old stereotypes of Jews. When leaders of the Jewish community were asked to dissociate themselves from Richler, the journalist Frances Kraft said that indicated that they did not consider Richler as part of the Quebec &quot;tribe&quot; because he was Anglo-speaking and Jewish.

About the same time, Richler announced he had founded the &quot;Impure Wool Society,&quot; to grant the &quot;Prix Parizeau&quot; to a distinguished non-Francophone writer of Quebec. The group&#x27;s name plays on the expression &quot;Québécois pure laine&quot;, typically used to refer to Quebecker with extensive French-Canadian multi-generational ancestry (or &quot;pure wool&quot;). The prize (with an award of $3000) was granted twice: to Benet Davetian in 1996 for &quot;The Seventh Circle&quot;, and David Manicom in 1997 for &quot;Ice in Dark Water&quot;.

In 2010, Montreal city councillor Marvin Rotrand presented a 4,000-signature petition calling on the city to honour Richler on the 10th anniversary of his death with the renaming of a street, park or building in Richler&#x27;s old Mile End neighbourhood. The council initially denied an honour to Richler, saying it would sacrifice the heritage of their neighbourhood. In response to the controversy, the City of Montreal announced it was to renovate and rename a gazebo in his honour.

<text>Jane Urquhart, LL.D (born June 21, 1949) is a Canadian novelist and poet. She is the internationally acclaimed author of seven award-winning novels, three books of poetry and numerous short stories. As a novelist, Urquhart is well known for her evocative style which blends history with the present day. Her first novel, &quot;The Whirlpool&quot; (published 1986), gained her international recognition when she became the first Canadian to win France&#x27;s prestigious Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger (Best Foreign Book Award). Her subsequent novels were even more successful. &quot;Away&quot;, published in 1993, won the Trillium Award and was a national bestseller. In 1997, her fourth novel, &quot;The Underpainter&quot;, won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award.

==Early life==
Urquhart was born June 21, 1949, in Little Longlac, a small mining town in northern Ontario. She is the daughter of a mining engineer, Walter Andrew Carter, and Marian Quinn. Quinn grew up on a farm with a large family of six brothers and one sister. After their marriage, the couple moved to Little Longlac for Carter&#x27;s work. It was there that they had three children, Urquhart being the youngest and their only daughter.

The family&#x27;s heritage made a lasting impact on Urquhart&#x27;s writing. Her mother&#x27;s Irish ancestors were immigrants who arrived in Canada in the mid nineteenth century during the Great Famine. Both of Urquhart&#x27;s parents had witnessed the trials of World War I and World War II. With such a background, Urquhart&#x27;s childhood was filled with the stories of Ireland and settlement in Canada. &quot;The women are the people who pass the stories down through the generations in any family,&quot; Urquhart says. &quot;Occasionally, one of the men would tell a story. When they did, it was a very exciting event, and it was often war-related. But the women were constantly gossiping. I&#x27;ve always been a great believer that gossip is not an evil thing. I see it as an investigation of human nature.&quot;

==Education==
Urquhart attended John Ross Robertson Public School until the end of Grade Seven, moving to Havergal College, a private school for girls, for grades eight to twelve. After that, she attended a junior college in B.C. for one semester before enrolling at the University of Guelph. In an interview, Urquhart recalls that very little of her childhood education touched on Canadian history or Canadian literature. &quot;We were very much a colony when I was in...school, and so the past as I knew it survived in a physical sort of way. It existed in barns and rail fences and Ontario Gothic farmhouses, old woodstoves.&quot; As a result, Urquhart developed a fascination with landscape which would carry throughout her entire collection of works. Following her semester in junior college, Urquhart went to the University of Guelph and earned a BA in 1971 in English literature. In 1973, she returned, this time to study art history, completing her second BA in 1976.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Urquhart married Paul Keele who was then a student at the Ontario College of Art, and later at the Nova Scotia College of Art and design. Urquhart worked as an assistant to the information officer for the Royal Canadian Navy while Keele was still in school. Tragically, Keele died in a car accident in 1973 when Urquhart was only 24. Keele&#x27;s death spurred Urquhart to return to school: &quot;I wanted to study art history, partly to honour him and partly to be near a number of friends we had made while we lived in and around Guelph.&quot; The experience of loss at such a young age shaped Urquhart&#x27;s writing, particularly &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, whose protagonist was similarly a young widow. &quot;I think the fact that Paul died when he did, when we were both so young, allowed me to remember what it was like to experience such a devastating loss early in life, as my characters do in this book,&quot; she explains.

In 1976, Urquhart married the Canadian visual artist Tony Urquhart. At the time, Tony Urquhart had four children from a previous marriage, so the couple&#x27;s early years together were filled with children and family life. Jane Urquhart speaks of the time: &quot;It was great...we were all sort of the same age...I&#x27;d had no experience with children so I had no experience with disciplining children which meant that I didn&#x27;t know how to do it. I was the youngest in my family. And so my role in relation to them was never very clearly defined and, as a result, we were just able to develop kind of a friendship.&quot; The necessity of being at home, especially when her own daughter Emily was born in 1977, contributed to her writing, and she allowed herself to schedule writing time every day.

Urquhart also owned an Irish-style cottage in McGillicuddy Reeks from 1996 to 2013 which she used as a writing retreat and an occasional home. The cottage, on the verge of Lake Ontario, was the place she spent many summer vacations while growing up. Urquhart now resides in South-Eastern Ontario. Her husband Tony Urquhart died in 2022.

==Works==
Urquhart is the author of seven internationally acclaimed novels including: &quot;The Whirlpool&quot; (entitled &quot;Niagara&quot; in France), the first Canadian book to win France&#x27;s prestigious Prix du Meilleur livre etranger (Best Foreign Book Award); &quot;Changing Heaven&quot;; &quot;Away&quot;, winner of the Trillium Award and a finalist for the prestigious International Dublin Literary Award; &quot;The Underpainter&quot;, winner of the Governor General&#x27;s Award and a finalist for the Rogers Communications Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize; &quot;The Stone Carvers&quot;, which was a finalist for the Giller Prize, the Governor General&#x27;s Award, and long listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2001; &quot;A Map of Glass&quot;, a finalist for a regional Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for Best Book, and &quot;Sanctuary Line&quot;, a finalist for the Giller Prize.

She is also the author of a collection of short fiction, &quot;Storm Glass&quot;, and four books of poetry, &quot;I Am Walking in the Garden of His Imaginary Palace&quot;, &quot;False Shuffles&quot;, &quot;The Little Flowers of Madame de Montespan&quot;, and &quot;Some Other Garden&quot;. Her work, which is published in many countries, has been translated into numerous foreign languages. She also wrote the biography of Lucy Maud Montgomery for the Penguin Extraordinary Canadians series and is the editor of the most recent &quot;Penguin Book of Canadian Short Stories&quot;, and she edited and introduced a collection of Alice Munro&#x27;s love stories entitled &quot;No Love Lost&quot; for The New Canadian Library. Urquhart has received the Marian Engel Award and the Harbourfront Festival Prize, and is a Chevalier dans l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France and is an Officer of the Order of Canada. 
Urquhart has received numerous honorary doctorates from Canadian universities, including the University of Toronto (2000), the Royal Military College (2007), and Carleton University, Ottawa (2016). She also has been writer-in-residence at the University of Ottawa and at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and, during the winter and spring of 1997, she held the Presidential Writer-in-Residence Fellowship at the University of Toronto. She has also given readings and lectures in Canada, Britain, Europe, the US, and Australia, has twice been a keynote speaker at the annual Canadian Congress of the Humanities, and has served on the Board of PEN Canada and on the Advisory Board for the Restoration of the Vimy Memorial. She has served on several international prize juries including that of the International Dublin IMPAC Award, the Giller Prize, and the American International Neustadt Award.

Her books have been published in many countries, including Holland, France, Germany, Britain, Scandinavia, Australia, and The United States, and have been translated into several languages.

&quot;In Winter I Get Up at Night&quot; was longlisted for the 2024 Giller Prize.

<doc id="60690" wikidata="Q237684" url="?curid=60690" title="Nancy Huston">
<text>Nancy Louise Huston, OC (born September 16, 1953) is a Canadian novelist and essayist, a longtime resident of France, who writes primarily in French and translates her own works into English.

==Biography==
Huston was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the city in which she lived until age fifteen, at which time her family moved to Wilton, New Hampshire, where she attended High Mowing School. She studied at Sarah Lawrence College in New York City, where she was given the opportunity to spend a year of her studies in Paris. Arriving in Paris in 1973, Huston obtained a master&#x27;s degree from the École des hautes études en sciences sociales, writing a thesis on swear words under the supervision of Roland Barthes.

She was the second wife of Bulgarian-French historian and philosopher Tzvetan Todorov, with whom she had two children, daughter Léa and son Sacha; she and Todorov divorced in 2014. Huston now shares her life with Swiss painter Guy Oberson.

==Career==
Because French was a language acquired at school and university, Huston found that the combination of her eventual command of the language and her distance from it as a non-native speaker helped her to find her literary voice. 
Since 1980, Huston has published over 45 books of fiction and non-fiction, including theatre and children&#x27;s books. Some of her publications are self-translations of previously published works. Essentially she writes in French and subsequently self-translates into English but &quot;Plainsong&quot; (1993) was written first in English and then self-translated to French as &quot;Cantique des plaines&quot; (1993) – it was, however, the French version which first found a publisher.

While Huston&#x27;s often controversial works of non-fiction have been well-received, her fiction has earned her the most critical acclaim. Her first novel, &quot;Les variations Goldberg&quot; (1981), was awarded the Prix Contrepoint and was shortlisted for the Prix Femina. She translated this novel into English as &quot;The Goldberg Variations&quot; (1996).

Her next major award came in 1993 when she was received the Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction in French for &quot;Cantique des Plaines&quot; (1993). This was initially contested as it was a translation of &quot;Plainsong&quot; (1993), but Huston demonstrated that it was an adaptation and kept the prize. A subsequent novel, &quot;La virevolte&quot; (1994), won the Prix &quot;L&quot; and the Prix Louis-Hémon. It was published in English in 1996 as &quot;Slow Emergencies&quot;.

Huston&#x27;s novel, &quot;Instruments des ténèbres&quot;, has been her most successful novel yet, being shortlisted for the Prix Femina, and the Governor General&#x27;s Award. It was awarded the Prix Goncourt des Lycéens, as well as both the Prix des lectrices (Elle Québec) and the Prix du livre Inter in 1997.

In 1998, she was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award for her novel &quot;L&#x27;Empreinte de l&#x27;ange&quot;. The next year she was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award for translating the work into English as &quot;The Mark of the Angel&quot;.

In 1999, she appeared in the film &quot;Set Me Free (Emporte-moi)&quot;, also collaborating on the screenplay.

Her works have been translated into many languages from Chinese to Russian.

==Critical response==

Canadian poet and critic Frank Davey in &quot;Big, Bad and Little Known: The Anglophone-Canadian Nancy Huston&quot; (2004), is critical of Huston&#x27;s English writing style. In response to this, Joseph Pivato in &quot;Nancy Huston Meets le Nouveau Roman&quot; (2016), contends that Huston was influenced by the French writers of le Nouveau Roman and their theory of composition.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in abstract algebra, a prime element of a commutative ring is an object satisfying certain properties similar to the prime numbers in the integers and to irreducible polynomials. Care should be taken to distinguish prime elements from irreducible elements, a concept that is the same in UFDs but not the same in general.

==Definition==
An element of a commutative ring is said to be prime if it is not the zero element or a unit and whenever divides for some and in , then divides or divides . With this definition, Euclid&#x27;s lemma is the assertion that prime numbers are prime elements in the ring of integers. Equivalently, an element is prime if, and only if, the principal ideal generated by is a nonzero prime ideal. (Note that in an integral domain, the ideal is a prime ideal, but is an exception in the definition of &#x27;prime element&#x27;.)

Interest in prime elements comes from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which asserts that each nonzero integer can be written in essentially only one way as 1 or −1 multiplied by a product of positive prime numbers. This led to the study of unique factorization domains, which generalize what was just illustrated in the integers.

Being prime is relative to which ring an element is considered to be in; for example, 2 is a prime element in but it is not in , the ring of Gaussian integers, since and 2 does not divide any factor on the right.

==Connection with prime ideals==

An ideal in the ring (with unity) is prime if the factor ring is an integral domain. Equivalently, is prime if whenever formula_1 then either formula_2 or formula_3. 

In an integral domain, a nonzero principal ideal is prime if and only if it is generated by a prime element.

==Irreducible elements==

Prime elements should not be confused with irreducible elements. In an integral domain, every prime is irreducible but the converse is not true in general. However, in unique factorization domains, or more generally in GCD domains, primes and irreducibles are the same.

==Examples==
The following are examples of prime elements in rings:
* The integers , , , , , ... in the ring of integers 
* the complex numbers , , and in the ring of Gaussian integers 
* the polynomials and in , the ring of polynomials over .
* 2 in the quotient ring 
* is prime but not irreducible in the ring 
* In the ring of pairs of integers, is prime but not irreducible (one has ).
* In the ring of algebraic integers formula_4 the element is irreducible but not prime (as 3 divides formula_5 and 3 does not divide any factor on the right).

<text>In algebra, an irreducible element of an integral domain is a non-zero element that is not invertible (that is, is not a unit), and is not the product of two non-invertible elements.

The irreducible elements are the terminal elements of a factorization process; that is, they are the factors that cannot be further factorized. If the irreducible factors of every non-zero non-unit element are uniquely defined, up to the multiplication by a unit, then the integral domain is called a unique factorization domain, but this does not need to happen in general for every integral domain. It was discovered in the 19th century that the rings of integers of some number fields are not unique factorization domains, and, therefore, that some irreducible elements can appear in some factorization of an element and not in other factorizations of the same element. The ignorance of this fact is the main error in many of the wrong proofs of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem that were given during the three centuries between Fermat&#x27;s statement and Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

If formula_1 is an integral domain, then formula_2 is an irreducible element of formula_1 if and only if, for all formula_4, the equation formula_5 implies that the ideal generated by formula_2 is equal to the ideal generated by formula_7 or equal to the ideal generated by formula_8. This equivalence does not hold for general commutative rings, which is why the assumption of the ring having no nonzero zero divisors is commonly made in the definition of irreducible elements. It results also that there are several ways to extend the definition of an irreducible element to an arbitrary commutative ring.

== Relationship with prime elements ==
Irreducible elements should not be confused with prime elements. (A non-zero non-unit element formula_2 in a commutative ring formula_1 is called prime if, whenever formula_11 for some formula_7 and formula_8 in formula_14 then formula_15 or formula_16) In an integral domain, every prime element is irreducible, but the converse is not true in general. The converse is true for unique factorization domains (or, more generally, GCD domains).

Moreover, while an ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, it is not true in general that an ideal generated by an irreducible element is an irreducible ideal. However, if formula_17 is a GCD domain and formula_18 is an irreducible element of formula_17, then as noted above formula_18 is prime, and so the ideal generated by formula_18 is a prime (hence irreducible) ideal of formula_17.

== Example ==
In the quadratic integer ring formula_23 it can be shown using norm arguments that the number 3 is irreducible. However, it is not a prime element in this ring since, for example, 
: formula_24

but 3 does not divide either of the two factors.

<text>In archaeology, excavationis the exposure, processing and recording of archaeological remains. An excavation site or &quot;dig&quot; is the area being studied. These locations range from one to several areas at a time during a project and can be conducted over a few weeks to several years.

Excavation involves the recovery of several types of data from a site. This data includes artifacts (portable objects made or modified by humans), features (non-portable modifications to the site itself such as post molds, burials, and hearths), ecofacts (evidence of human activity through organic remains such as animal bones, pollen, or charcoal), and archaeological context (relationships among the other types of data).

Before excavating, the presence or absence of archaeological remains can often be suggested by, non-intrusive remote sensing, such as ground-penetrating radar. Basic information about the development of the site may be drawn from this work, but to understand finer details of a site, excavation via augering can be used.

During excavation, archaeologists often use stratigraphic excavation to remove phases of the site one layer at a time. This keeps the timeline of the material remains consistent with one another. This is done usually though mechanical means where artifacts can be spot dated and the soil processed through methods such as mechanical sieving or water flotation. Afterwards, digital methods are then used record the excavation process and its results. Ideally, data from the excavation should suffice to reconstruct the site completely in three-dimensional space.

==History ==
One of the first known instances of archaeological excavation took place in the sixth century BC when Nabonidus, the king of Babylon, excavated a temple floor that was thousands of years old. During early Roman periods, Julius Caesar&#x27;s men looted bronze artifacts, and by the medieval period, Europeans had begun digging up pots that had partially emerged from erosion, and weapons that had turned up on farmlands. Antiquarians excavated burial mounds in North America and North-West Europe, which sometimes involved destroying artifacts and their context, losing information about subjects from the past. Meticulous and methodical archaeological excavation took over from antiquarian barrow-digging around the early to mid-nineteenth century and is still being perfected today.

The most dramatic change that occurred over time is the amount of recording and care taken to ensure preservation of artifacts and features. In the past, archaeological excavation involved random digging to unearth artifacts. Exact locations of artifacts were not recorded, and measurements were not taken. Modern archaeological excavation has evolved to include removal of thin layers of sediment sequentially and recording of measurements about artifacts&#x27; locations in a site.

==Motivation==
There are two basic types of modern archaeological excavation:

# Research excavation – when time and resources are available to excavate the site fully and at a leisurely pace. These are now almost exclusively the preserve of academics or private societies who can muster enough volunteer labour and funds. The size of the excavation can also be decided by the director as it goes on.
# Development-led excavation – undertaken by professional archaeologists when the site is threatened by building development. This is normally funded by the developer, meaning that time pressure is present, as well as its being focused only on areas to be affected by building. The workforce involved is generally more skilled, however, and pre-development excavations also provide a comprehensive record of the areas investigated. Rescue archaeology is sometimes thought of as a separate type of excavation but in practice tends to be a similar form of development-led practice. Various new forms of excavation terminology have appeared in recent years such as Strip map and sample some of which have been criticized within the profession as jargon created to cover up for falling standards of practice.

=== Development-led archaeology ===
There are two main types of trial excavation in professional archaeology both commonly associated with development-led excavation: the test pit or trench and the watching brief. The purpose of trial excavations is to determine the extent and characteristics of archaeological potential in a given area before extensive excavation work is undertaken. This is usually conducted in development-led excavations as part of Project management planning. The main difference between Trial trenching and watching briefs is that trial trenches are actively dug for the purpose of revealing archaeological potential whereas watching briefs are cursory examination of trenches where the primary function of the trench is something other than archaeology, for example a trench cut for a gas pipe in a road. In the US, a method of evaluation called a Shovel test pit is used which is a specified half meter square line of trial trenches dug by hand.

==Concepts==

===Site formation===
Archaeological material tends to accumulate in events. A gardener swept a pile of soil into a corner, laid a gravel path or planted a bush in a hole. A builder built a wall and back-filled the trench. Years later, someone built a pigsty onto it and drained the pigsty into the nettle patch. Later still, the original wall blew over and so on. Each event, which may have taken a short or long time to accomplish, leaves a context. This layer cake of events is often referred to as the archaeological sequence or record. It is by analysis of this sequence or record that excavation is intended to permit interpretation, which should lead to discussion and understanding.

The prominent processual archaeologist Lewis Binford highlighted the fact that the archaeological evidence left at a site may not be entirely indicative of the historical events that actually took place there. Using an ethnoarchaeological comparison, he looked at how hunters amongst the Nunamiut Iñupiat of north central Alaska spent a great deal of time in a certain area simply waiting for prey to arrive there, and that during this period, they undertook other tasks to pass the time, such as the carving of various objects, including a wooden mould for a mask, a horn spoon and an ivory needle, as well as repairing a skin pouch and a pair of caribou skin socks. Binford notes that all of these activities would have left evidence in the archaeological record, but that none of them would provide evidence for the primary reason that the hunters were in the area; to wait for prey. As he remarked, waiting for animals to hunt &quot;represented 24% of the total man-hours of activity recorded; yet there is no recognisable archaeological consequences of this behaviour. No tools left on the site were used, and there were no immediate material &quot;byproducts&quot; of the &quot;primary&quot; activity. All of the other activities conducted at the site were essentially boredom reducers.&quot;

=== Stratification ===

In archaeology, especially in excavating, stratigraphy involves the study of how deposits occurs layer by layer. It is largely based on the Law of Superposition. The Law of Superposition indicates that layers of sediment further down will contain older artifacts than layers above. When archaeological finds are below the surface of the ground (as is most commonly the case), the identification of the context of each find is vital to enable the archaeologist to draw conclusions about the site and the nature and date of its occupation. It is the archaeologist&#x27;s role to attempt to discover what contexts exist and how they came to be created. Archaeological stratification or sequence is the dynamic superimposition of single units of stratigraphy or contexts. The context (physical location) of a discovery can be of major significance. Archaeological context refers to where an artifact or feature was found as well as what the artifact or feature was located near. Context is important for determining how long ago the artifact or feature was in use as well as what its function may have been. The cutting of a pit or ditch in the past is a context, whilst the material filling it will be another. Multiple fills seen in section would mean multiple contexts. Structural features, natural deposits and inhumations are also contexts.

By separating a site into these basic, discrete units, archaeologists are able to create a chronology for activity on a site and describe and interpret it. Stratigraphic relationships are the relationships created between contexts in time representing the chronological order they were created. An example would be a ditch and the back-fill of said ditch. The relationship of &quot;the fill&quot; context to the ditch &quot;cut&quot; context is &quot;the fill&quot; occurred later in the sequence, i.e., you have to dig a ditch first before you can back-fill it. A relationship that is later in the sequence is sometimes referred to as &quot;higher&quot; in the sequence and a relationship that is earlier &quot;lower&quot; though the term &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; does not itself imply a context needs to be physically higher or lower. It is more useful to think of this &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; term as it relates to the contexts position in a Harris matrix, which is a two-dimensional representation of a site&#x27;s formation in space and time.

Understanding a site in modern archaeology is a process of grouping single contexts together in ever larger groups by virtue of their relationships. The terminology of these larger clusters varies depending on practitioner, but the terms interface, sub-group, group and land use are common. An example of a sub-group could be the three contexts that make up a burial: the grave cut, the body and the back-filled earth on top of the body. In turn sub-groups can be clustered together with other sub-groups by virtue of their stratigraphic relationship to form groups which in turn form &quot;phases&quot;. A sub-group burial could cluster with other sub-group burials to form a cemetery or burial group which in turn could be clustered with a building such as church to produce a &quot;phase.&quot; A less rigorously defined combination of one or more contexts is sometimes called a feature.

===Phasing===
Phase is the most easily understood grouping for the layman as it implies a near contemporaneous Archaeological horizon representing &quot;what you would see if you went back to a specific point in time&quot;. Often but not always a phase implies the identification of an occupation surface &quot;old ground level&quot; that existed at some earlier time.
The production of phase interpretations is one of the first goals of stratigraphic interpretation and excavation. Digging &quot;in phase&quot; is not quite the same as phasing a site. Phasing a site represents reducing the site either in excavation or post-excavation to contemporaneous horizons whereas &quot;digging in phase&quot; is the process of stratigraphic removal of archaeological remains so as not to remove contexts that are earlier in time &quot;lower in the sequence&quot; before other contexts that have a latter physical stratigraphic relationship to them as defined by the law of superposition. The process of interpretation in practice will have a bearing on excavation strategies on site so &quot;phasing&quot; a site is actively pursued during excavation where at all possible and is considered good practice.

An &quot;intrusion&quot; or &quot;intrusive object&quot; is something that arrived later to the phase in the strata, for example modern pipework or the 16th-century bottles left by treasure-hunters at Sutton Hoo.

==Methods==
Excavation initially involves the removal of any topsoil. A strategy for sampling the contexts and features is formulated which may involve total excavation of each feature or only portions. 

===Stratigraphic excavation===

In stratigraphic excavation, the goal is to remove some or, preferably, all archaeological deposits and features in the reverse order they were created and construct a Harris matrix as a chronological record or &quot;sequence&quot; of the site. This Harris matrix is used for interpretation and combining contexts into ever larger units of understanding. This stratigraphic removal of the site is crucial for understanding the chronology of events on site.

Stratigraphic excavation involves a process of cleaning or &quot;troweling back&quot; the surface of the site and isolating contexts and edges which are definable as either:
# Discrete, discernible &quot;edges&quot; that are formed by being completely separated from the surrounding surface and therefore stratigraphically later than its surroundings 
# Discrete, discernible &quot;edges&quot; (as in 1.) and have boundaries dictated by the limit of excavation
Following this preliminary process of defining the context, it is then recorded and removed.
Often, owing to practical considerations or error, the process of defining the edges of contexts is not followed and contexts are removed out of sequence and un-stratigraphically. This is called &quot;digging out of phase&quot;. It is not good practice.
After removing a context or if practical a set of contexts such as the case would be for features, the &quot;isolate and dig&quot; procedure is repeated until no man made remains are left on site and the site is reduced to natural.

===Strip, map and sample===
&quot;Strip, map and sample&quot; is a method of excavation applied in the United Kingdom to preserve archaeological remains by record in the face of development threats. It involves machine stripping an area, plotting observed features onto a site plan, and then partially excavating those features (sampling). The approach is undertaken when a site is to be destroyed by development and no satisfactory method of preserving archaeological remains &quot;in situ&quot; can be devised or adequate funding and time have not been factored into development project planning to allow for a full archaeological investigation.

==Tools and techniques==
===Mechanical excavation===

This describes the use in excavations of various types and sizes of machines from small backhoes to heavy duty earth-moving machinery. Machines are often used in what is called salvage or rescue archaeology in developer-led excavation when there are financial or time pressures. Using a mechanical excavator is the quickest method to remove soil and debris and to prepare the surface for excavation by hand, taking care to avoid damaging archaeological deposits by accident or to make it difficult to identify later precisely where finds were located. The use of such machinery is often routine (as it is for instance with the British archaeological television series &quot;Time Team&quot;) but can also be controversial as it can result in less discrimination in how the archaeological sequence on a site is recorded. One of the earliest uses of earth-moving machinery was at Durrington Walls in 1967. An old road through the henge was to be straightened and improved and was going to cause considerable damage to the archaeology. Rosemary Hill describes how Geoffrey Wainwright &quot;oversaw large, high-speed excavations, taking bulldozers to the site in a manner that shocked some of his colleagues but yielded valuable if tantalising information about what Durrington had looked like and how it might have been used.&quot; Machines are used primarily to remove modern overburden and for the control of spoil. In British archaeology mechanical diggers are sometimes nicknamed &quot;big yellow trowels&quot;.

==Recording==
Archaeological excavation is an unrepeatable process, since the same area of the ground cannot be excavated twice.
Thus, archaeology is often known as a destructive science, where you must destroy the original evidence in order to make observations. To mitigate this, highly accurate and precise digital methods can be used to record the excavation process and its results.

===Single context recording system===

Single context recording was developed in the 1970s by the museum of London (as well as earlier in Winchester and York) and has become the de facto recording system in many parts of the world and is especially suited to the complexities of deep urban archaeology and the process of Stratification.
Each excavated context is given a unique &quot;context number&quot; and is recorded by type on a context sheet and perhaps being drawn on a plan and/or a section. Depending on time constraints and importance contexts may also be photographed, but in this case a grouping of contexts and their associations are the purpose of the photography. Finds from each context are bagged and labeled with their context number and site code for later cross-reference work carried out post-excavation. The height above sea level of pertinent points on a context, such as the top and bottom of a wall are taken and added to plans sections and context sheets. Heights are recorded with a dumpy level or total station by relation to the site temporary benchmark (abbr. T.B.M). Samples of deposits from contexts are sometimes also taken, for later environmental analysis or for scientific dating.

===Digital recording===
Digital tools used by field archaeologists during excavation include GPS, tablet computers, relational databases, digital cameras, 3d laser scanners, and unmanned aerial vehicles. After high quality digital data have been recorded, these data can then be shared over the internet for open access and use by the public and archaeological researchers.
Digital imaging or digital image acquisition is digital photography, such as of a physical scene or of the interior structure of an object. The term is often used to include the processing, compression, storage, printing, and display of the images.

==Finds processing==
Finds and artifacts that survive in the archaeological record are retrieved in the main by hand and observation as the context they survive in is excavated. Several other techniques are available depending on suitability and time constraints. Sieving (screening) and flotation are used to maximize the recovery of small items such as small shards of pottery or flint flakes, or bones and seeds.

=== Flotation ===
Flotation is a process of retrieval that works by passing spoil onto the surface of water and separating finds that float from the spoil which sinks. This is especially suited to the recovery of environmental data stored in organic material such as seeds and small bones. Not all finds retrieval is done during excavation and some, especially flotation, may take place post-excavation from samples taken during excavation.

=== Sieving ===

The use of sieving (screening) is more common on research-based excavations where more time is available. Some success has been achieved with the use of cement mixers and bulk sieving. This method allows the quick removal of context by shovel and mattock yet allows for a high retrieval rate. Spoil is shoveled into cement mixers and water added to form a slurry which is then poured through a large screen mesh. The speed of this technique is offset by the damage it does to more fragile artifacts. 

=== Spot Dating ===
One important role of finds retrieval during excavation is the role of specialists to provide spot dating information on the contexts being removed from the archaeological record. This can provide advance warning of potential discoveries to come by virtue of residual finds redeposited in contexts higher in the sequence (which should be coming offsite earlier than contexts from early eras and phases). Spot dating also forms part of a confirmation process, of assessing the validity of the working hypothesis on the phasing of site during excavation. For example, the presence of an anomalous medieval pottery sherd in what was thought to be an Iron Age ditch feature could radically alter onsite thinking on the correct strategy for digging a site and save a lot of information being lost due to incorrect assumptions about the nature of the deposits which will be destroyed by the excavation process and in turn, limit the site&#x27;s potential for revealing information for post-excavation specialists. Or anomalous information could show up errors in excavation such as &quot;undercutting&quot;. Dating methodology in part relies on accurate excavation and in this sense the two activities become interdependent.

<text>Year 396 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Saccus, Capitolinus, Esquilinus, Augurinus, Capitolinus and Priscus (or, less frequently, year 358 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 396 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Dionysius&#x27; first war with Carthage ends with a notable victory for Dionysius, who confines his enemy&#x27;s power to an area of northwest Sicily. On his return home, the Carthaginian general, Himilco, commits suicide.

==== Greece ====
* Agesilaus II, the King of Sparta, campaigns successfully in Asia Minor against the Persian satraps Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes and inflicts a major defeat on Tissaphernes at Sardis. Agesilaus agrees to a three months&#x27; truce with the Persians under Tissaphernes, the satrap of Lydia and Caria. Negotiations conducted during that time prove fruitless, and on its termination, Agesilaus raids Phrygia, where he easily captures an immense amount of booty, since Tissaphernes has concentrated his troops in Caria.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Marcus Furius Camillus is made dictator by the Romans. Camillus finally destroys the Etruscan city of Veii in southern Etruria as the town falls to Roman forces after what is said to be a 10 year siege. The capture of Veii and its surrounding territories marks the first major expansion of Rome which doubles its territory after this victory.

=== By topic ===
==== Literature ====
* Plato publishes his &quot;Apologia&quot;, which is a defence of his mentor Socrates. (Approximate date.)

==== Sports ====
* Kyniska becomes the first woman to win an event at the Olympic Games when the horse-drawn chariot she sponsors crosses the finish line first, even though the prohibition on women competing forces her to hire a man to drive it.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Xenocrates, Greek philosopher and scholarch (or rector) of the Academy (d. 314 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Himilco, Carthaginian general.

<text>Year 184 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Pulcher and Licinus (or, less frequently, year 570 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 184 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Cato the Elder, along with his colleague, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, are elected censors in Rome. Already the champion of the ancient, austere Roman way of life, Cato inaugurates a puritanical campaign. He aims at preserving the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (&quot;ancestral custom&quot;) and combating all Greek influences, which he believes are undermining the older Roman standards of morality. He passes measures taxing luxury and strictly revises the list of persons eligible for the Senate. Abuses by tax gatherers are brought under control, and public building is promoted as a worthy cause.
* With concerns rising in Rome over whether Philip V of Macedon is preparing for a new war with the Romans, Appius Claudius Pulcher is sent at the head of an embassy into Macedonia and Greece to observe Philip&#x27;s activities.
* The town of Pisaurum is established by the Romans as a colony in the territory of the Piceni, a tribe living in the Marche on the Adriatic.
* The oldest known basilica, the Basilica Porcia, is completed in Rome by Cato the Elder during the time he is censor. The building is used by the Romans for transacting business and disposing of legal matters.

==== China ====
* Empress Lü has Emperor Qianshao of Han deposed and executed. Qianshao had vowed to kill his enemies after learning that his mother was a concubine and that she had been put to death by Empress Lü. Emperor Houshao of Han, a half-brother of Qianshao, ascends to the throne.
* Around this time, Empress Lü outlaws the trade of iron and horses with the vassal state of Nanyue in present-day Vietnam and southern China, being concerned by its military strength. In response, Nanyue&#x27;s king Zhao Tuo ends his vassal status, declares himself emperor and attacks the neighbouring vassal kingdom of Changsha, seizing a few border towns. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Liu Wu, Chinese prince of the Han dynasty (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Liu Gong, Chinese emperor of the Han dynasty (b. 193 BC)
* Titus Macchius Plautus, Roman comic dramatist, whose works, loosely adapted from Greek plays, established a truly Roman drama in the Latin language (b. c. 254 BC)

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman general Scipio Africanus and his brother Lucius are accused by Cato the Elder and his supporters of having received bribes from the late Seleucid king Antiochus III. Scipio defies his accusers, reminds the Romans of their debt to him, and retires to his country house at Liternum in Campania. However, Cato is successful in breaking the political influence of Lucius Scipio and Scipio Africanus.

==== Egypt ====
* The civil war between the northern and southern areas of Egypt ends with the arrest of Ankmachis by the Ptolemaic general Conanus.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Illyria ====
* After being stopped twice by the Romans in his attempts to invade Illyria by sea, and constrained by the Roman commander Marcus Valerius Laevinus&#x27; fleet in the Adriatic, Philip V of Macedon keeps his activities in Illyria land based. Keeping clear of the coast, he takes Dassaretis, Atintani and Parthini, and the town of Dimale.

==== Thrace ====
* Tylis is destroyed by the Thracians.

==== Carthage ====
* Syphax, king of the western Numidian tribe, the Masaesyli, concludes an alliance with the Romans and they send military advisers to help Syphax train his soldiers. He then attacks the eastern Numidians (the Massylii) ruled by Gala, who is an ally of the Carthaginians. The Carthaginian general Hasdrubal travels to northern Africa from Spain to stamp out the uprising by the Numidians.

==== Spain ====
* The Roman generals Publius Cornelius Scipio and his elder brother, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, capture Saguntum (modern Sagunto) from the Carthaginians.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Antiochus III leaves for a campaign in Asia, where he will reach as far as India and mostly manage to recover the areas conquered earlier by Alexander the Great.
* Having recovered the central part of Anatolia from the usurper Achaeus, Antiochus III turns his forces to recover the outlying provinces to the north and east of the Seleucid kingdom.
* Antiochus III gives his sister Antiochia in marriage to King Xerxes of Armenia, who acknowledges Antiochus III&#x27;s suzerainty and pays him tribute.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Publius Licinius Crassus Dives is elected &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; over more distinguished candidates, despite never having held any major offices. He will hold this position until his death.
* The Roman soldiers billeted in Tarentum so alienate the citizens of the city that conspirators admit the Carthaginian general Hannibal to the city. The conspirators then defeat the Roman contingent in it. Hannibal keeps control of his troops so that looting is limited to Roman houses. The citadel in Tarentum remains under Roman control, which denies Hannibal the use of the harbour.
* The Roman consuls, Appius Claudius Pulcher and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, besiege Capua with eight legions. Hanno moves to Beneventum to try to help the inhabitants of Capua, but he is defeated by the Romans.
* The Capuans then send an appeal for help to Hannibal. In response, Hannibal sends 2,000 Numidian cavalry as reinforcements to Capua. The combined Carthaginian forces defeat the Roman force led by Flaccus and Pulcher, the latter of whom will soon die of wounds he has sustained.
* The Battle of the Silarus is fought between Hannibal&#x27;s army and a Roman force led by praetor Marcus Centenius Penula. The Carthaginians are victorious, effectively destroying Centenius Penula&#x27;s army.
* The Battle of Herdonia is fought between Hannibal&#x27;s Carthaginian army and Roman forces who are laying siege to Herdonia led by praetor Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, brother of the consul, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus. The Roman army is destroyed, leaving Apulia free of Romans for the year.
* After a two year siege, Roman general, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, gradually forces his way into Syracuse and takes it in the face of strong Carthaginian reinforcements and despite the use of engines of war designed by the Greek mathematician and scientist Archimedes (such as the Claw of Archimedes).
* Although Marcellus wishes to spare the lives of the Syracusans, he is unable to prevent the sack of the city by his soldiers, which includes the killing of Archimedes. Marcellus carries off the art treasures of Syracuse to Rome, the first recorded instance of a practice which is to become common.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== China ====
*Construction begins on the Epang Palace.

== Deaths ==
* Archimedes of Syracuse, Greek mathematician and scientist, who has calculated formulae for the areas and volumes of spheres, cylinders, parabolas and other plane and solid figures. He has also founded the science of hydrostatics, including the principle of the upthrust on a floating body which has led to his cry, &quot;Eureka&quot;. Thirdly, he has invented siege-engines for use against the Romans and the Archimedean screw to raise water (b. c. 287 BC)
* Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, Roman consul from 215 to 213 BC
* Xerxes of Armenia (assassinated by his wife Antiochia)

<text>The fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small fox native to the deserts of North Africa, ranging from Western Sahara and Mauritania to the Sinai Peninsula. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate heat and listen for underground prey. The fennec is the smallest fox species. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to the desert environment with high temperatures and little water.

The fennec fox mainly eats insects, small mammals and birds. It has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Pups are preyed upon by the Pharaoh eagle-owl; both adults and pups may possibly fall prey to jackals and striped hyenas. Fennec families dig out burrows in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as and adjoin the burrows of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the fennec fox is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The fennec fox is commonly trapped for exhibition or sale in North Africa, and it is considered an exotic pet in some parts of the world.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

The fennec fox was scientifically described as &quot;Canis zerda&quot; by Eberhardt Zimmermann in 1780. In 1788, Johann Friedrich Gmelin gave the species the synonym of &quot;Canis cerdo&quot; with the type locality being the Sahara Desert. A few years later, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer assigned the name &quot;Viverra aurita&quot; to the species in 1793; the type locality was Algeria. Subsequent synonyms include &quot;Fennecus arabicus&quot; by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1804; &quot;Megalotis cerda&quot; by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1811 which was based on earlier descriptions by Gmelin, and another synonym by Desmarest (&quot;Fennecus brucei&quot;) in 1820; the type locality was Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Sudan. In 1827, the species was given another synonym (&quot;Canis fennecus&quot;) by René Lesson whose work was largely based on the species scientific description in 1780. In the 1840s, the species received synonyms by Pierre Boitard in 1842 (&quot;Vulpes denhamii&quot;) and John Edward Gray in 1843 (&quot;Vulpes zuarensis&quot;). The type localities of these were &quot;interior of Africa&quot; and Egypt, respectively. In 1978 Gordon Barclay Corbet renamed the species to &quot;Vulpes zerda&quot;, its current scientific name. It was originally assigned to the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, but following molecular analysis it was moved to &quot;Vulpes&quot; despite having some distinct morphological and behavioral traits.

According to DNA evidence, the closest living relative to the fennec fox is the Blanford&#x27;s fox. They are two of eight &quot;desert fox&quot; species, which is a group of &quot;Vulpes&quot; that share comparable ecologies. The other members include the corsac fox, pale fox, kit fox, Tibetan fox, Rüppell&#x27;s fox and Cape fox. All eight species evolved to survive in desert environments, developing several traits such as sandy colored coats, large ears, pigmented eyes, and specialized kidneys. The word &quot;fennec&quot; is derived from the Arabic word &quot;fanak&quot; which likely has Persian origins.

The fennec fox is one of 13 extant &quot;Vulpes&quot; species and a member of the family Canidae.

== Description ==

The fennec fox has sand-colored fur which reflects sunlight during the day and helps keep it warm at night. Its nose is black and its tapering tail has a black tip. Its long ears have longitudinal reddish stripes on the back and are so densely haired inside that the external auditory meatus is not visible. The edges of the ears are whitish, but darker on the back. The ear to body ratio is the greatest in the canid family and likely helps in dissipating heat and locating prey. It has large, dense kidneys with somewhat compact medulla, which help store water in times of scarcity. It has dark streaks running from the inner eye to either side of the slender muzzle. Its large eyes are dark. The dental formula is with small and narrow canines. The pads of its paws are covered with dense fur, which facilitates walking on hot, sandy soil.

The fennec fox is the smallest canid species. Females range in head-to-body size from with a long tail and long ears, and weigh . Males are slightly larger, ranging in head-to-body size from with a long tail and long ears, weighing at least .

== Distribution and habitat ==
The fennec fox is distributed throughout the Sahara, from Morocco and Mauritania to northern Sudan, through Egypt and its Sinai Peninsula. It inhabits small sand dunes and vast treeless sand areas with sparse vegetation such as grasses, sedges and small shrubs. In the northern part of its range annual rainfalls have been recorded at &lt;100 mm compared to 300 mm in its southern range. The fennec fox&#x27;s range likely overlaps with that of other canines such as the golden jackal and Rüppell&#x27;s fox. Compared to these canids, the fennec fox seems to inhabit areas with more extreme climate and has been known to build burrows in grainier surfaces; this adaptation gives it an edge over competitors.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Behaviour ===

Fennec foxes are primarily nocturnal, displaying heightened activity during the cooler nighttime hours. This behaviour helps them escape the extreme Saharan heat and reduces water loss through panting. A fennec fox digs its den in sand, either in open areas or places sheltered by plants with stable sand dunes. In compacted soils, dens are up to large, with up to 15 different entrances. In some cases, different families interconnect their dens, or locate them close together. In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber.

Captive individuals reside in family groups. Fennec foxes exhibit playful behavior, especially among younger individuals.

=== Hunting and diet ===
The fennec fox is omnivorous, feeding on small rodents, lizards (geckos and skinks), small birds and their eggs, insects, fruits, leaves, roots and also some tubers. It relies on the moisture content of prey, but drinks water when available.
It hunts alone and digs in the sand for small vertebrates and insects. Some individuals were observed to bury prey for later consumption and searching for food in the vicinity of human settlements.

In the Algerian Sahara, 114 scat samples were collected that contained more than 400 insects, plant fragments and date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;) fruits, remains of birds, mammals, squamata and insects.

=== Reproduction ===
Fennec foxes mate for life. Captive animals reach sexual maturity at around nine months and mate between January and April. Female fennec foxes are in estrus for an average of 24 hours and usually breed once per year; the copulation tie lasts up to two hours and 45 minutes. Gestation usually lasts between 50 and 52 days, though sometimes up to 63 days. After mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protects the female, and provides her with food during pregnancy and lactation. Females give birth between March and June to a litter of one to four pups that open their eyes after 8 to 11 days. Both female and male care for the pups. They communicate by barking, purring, yapping and squeaking. Pups remain in the family even after a new litter is born. The pups are weaned at the age of 61 to 70 days. Adults rear pups until they are around 16 to 17 weeks old. The average lifespan in the wild is 10 years. The oldest captive male fennec fox was 14 years old, and the oldest female 13 years.

=== Predators, parasites and diseases ===
African horned owl species such as the Pharaoh eagle-owl prey on fennec fox pups. Anecdotal reports exist about jackals and striped hyenas also preying on the fennec fox. But according to nomads, the fennec fox is fast and changes directions so well that even their Salukis are hardly ever able to capture it.

Captive fennec foxes are susceptible to canine distemper virus, displaying fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, diarrhea, severe emaciation, seizures, generalized ataxia, severe dehydration, brain congestion, gastric ulcers and death. Stress because of capture and long-distance transportation are thought to be the causes. In 2012, a study reported a case of &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot;, a fungus species, in a 2-year-old male. It died not too long after contracting the pathogen from anorexia and icterus. A 2019 review of the deaths of fennec foxes due to medical conditions or pathogens at the Bronx and Prospect Park Zoos since 1980 found that the majority of such deaths were attributed to neoplasia and infection. Most foxes developed infections or medical conditions from atopic dermatitis and other dermatologic dliseases, as well as trauma. Parasites known to infect the fennec fox include roundworms such as &quot;Capillaria&quot; and &quot;Angiostrongylus vasorum&quot;, as well as the alveolate &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;.

== Threats ==
In North Africa, the fennec fox is commonly trapped for exhibition or sale to tourists. Expansion of permanent human settlements in southern Morocco caused its disappearance in these areas and restricted it to marginal areas. Other factors such as roadwork, seismic surveys, mining, oil fields, commercial expansion and the increased number of human communities in their range are cited as potential threats.

=== Conservation ===
As of 2015, the fennec fox is classified as Least concern on the IUCN Red List. It is listed in CITES Appendix II and is protected in Morocco and Western Sahara, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt, where it has been documented in several protected areas. Another measure taken to conserve the species is the placement of individuals in captive environments such as zoos. Educational programs are also promoted to further this initiative.

== Interactions with humans ==

=== In culture ===

The fennec fox is the national animal of Algeria. It also serves as the nickname for the Algeria national football team &quot;Les Fennecs&quot;. The species is depicted in &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, a 1943 novella by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry which follows the story of a pilot who is forced to make an emergency plane landing in the remote Sahara Desert. In 2000, the fennec fox was portrayed on the cover of a &quot;Ranger Rick&quot; magazine. In Roman art and literature, there is dearth of depictions of fox species in general. However, according to Martial&#x27;s &quot;Epigrams&quot; which describes the &quot;long-eared fox&quot; as a popular pet, it is likely that the fennec fox was kept as an exotic pet in the Roman empire. Additionally, the species has made appearances as &quot;Fenneko&quot; in the animed TV series &quot;Aggretsuko.&quot;

=== In captivity ===

The fennec fox is bred commercially as an exotic pet. Commercial breeders remove the pups from their mother to hand-raise them, as tame foxes are more valuable. A breeders&#x27; registry has been set up in the United States to avoid any problems associated with inbreeding. As of 2020, 15 US states authorized the ownership of foxes without the need for a document, although one is also allowed. Due to poor diet, captive foxes have been known to grow to abnormally large sizes.

Captive foxes have often been recorded exhibiting stereotyped behaviors; this may due to the insufficient environments they are placed in. When noises from zookeepers and visitors alike are produced, foxes often respond by pacing repeatedly. Similarly, in one case, two male individuals in the National Zoological Park spend the majority of their time pacing around their enclosures. It is suggested that larger, outdoor, enclosures may help reduce stereotyped behaviors, as they provide more space for foxes to flee from perceived danger and hide in a provided safe spot.

<text>Maggotron (born James McCauley, and also known as DXJ, Maggozulu Too, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Kahn) is one of the pioneers of miami bass music. He uses samples from many sources, and is influenced by Parliament, Funkadelic and Earth Wind and Fire among others. In 2000, he collaborated with his former engineer Bass Mekanik on the album &quot;Bass Alien – Tales from the Lo-Zone&quot;. In 2001, he mixed and compiled a CD featuring miami bass classics for Empirewerks Music: &quot;Super Bass – Original Old School Booty Shakers&quot;. The same year, his compilation &quot;Electro Jamz from the Vaults of Jamron Records&quot; encompassed miami bass and electro tracks from his early days as a producer and performer. Due to pressure from Pandisc Records, the humour in his later work for Pandisc became less notable.

DXJ&#x27;s earlier work was characterised by its humorous approach, which can also be seen in his use of pseudonyms.
Musically, DXJ&#x27;s music is characterised by its use of electro/bass beats and rock guitars, as well as vocal samples from all kinds of sources. Cultural and ethnic diversity are also part of the fabric of Maggotron&#x27;s sound. Men and women of various nationalities have helped work to achieve the sound that Maggotron is noted for.

Internationally known, DXJ&#x27;S contributions to miami bass, electro or street music has influenced break beat, crunk, ghettotech and other genres of music. Miami Bass/electro itself is a hybrid branch of the hip hop and electro music.
