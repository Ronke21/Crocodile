<text>Kevin Patrick Smith (born August 2, 1970) is an American film director, producer, writer, and actor. He came to prominence with the low-budget comedy buddy film &quot;Clerks&quot; (1994), which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and acted in as the character Silent Bob of stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob. These character also appeared in Smith&#x27;s later films &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995), &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), &quot;Clerks II&quot; (2006), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; (2019), and &quot;Clerks III&quot; (2022) which are set primarily in his home state of New Jersey. While not strictly sequential, the films have crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared canon known as the &quot;View Askewniverse&quot;, named after Smith&#x27;s production company View Askew Productions, which he co-founded with Scott Mosier.

Between 2011 and 2018, Smith mostly made horror films, including &quot;Red State&quot; (2011) and the comedy horror films &quot;Tusk&quot; (2014) and &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot; (2016). He has served as a director-for-hire for material he did not write, including the buddy cop action comedy &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010) and various television series episodes, creating &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot; in 2021.

Smith owns Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s Secret Stash in Red Bank, New Jersey, a comic book store which became the setting for the reality television show &quot;Comic Book Men&quot; (2012–2018). He hosted the film review TV show &quot;Spoilers&quot;. As a podcaster, Smith cohosts several shows on his SModcast Podcast Network, including &quot;SModcast&quot;, &quot;Fatman Beyond&quot;, and the live show &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot;. He is known for participating in long, humorous Q&amp;A sessions that are often filmed for DVD release, beginning with &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot;.

==Early life==
Kevin Patrick Smith was born on August 2, 1970, in Red Bank, New Jersey, the son of Grace (née Schultz), a homemaker, and Donald E. Smith (1936–2003), a postal worker. He has two siblings: an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Jr. He was raised in a Catholic household in the nearby clamming town of Highlands.

Smith&#x27;s childhood was scheduled around his father&#x27;s late shifts at the post office. His father grew to despise his job, which greatly influenced Smith, who remembers his father finding it difficult on some days to get up and go to work. Smith vowed never to work at something that he did not enjoy.

Smith attended Henry Hudson Regional High School, where he was a B and C student, videotaped basketball games, and produced &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;-style sketch comedy. An overweight teen, he developed into a comedic observer of life to socialize with friends and girls. After high school, Smith attended The New School in New York City, but did not graduate. Smith met Jason Mewes while working at a youth center; they became friends after discovering a mutual interest in comic books.

==Career==
===As a filmmaker===
On his 21st birthday, Smith saw Richard Linklater&#x27;s comedy &quot;Slacker&quot;. Impressed that Linklater set and shot the film in his hometown of Austin, Texas, rather than on a soundstage in a major city, Smith was inspired to become a filmmaker, and to set films where he lived. He has said: &quot;It was the movie that got me off my ass; it was the movie that lit a fire under me, the movie that made me think, &#x27;Hey, I could be a filmmaker.&#x27; And I had never seen a movie like that before ever in my life.&quot; He assembled a library of independent filmmakers like Linklater, Jim Jarmusch, Spike Lee and Hal Hartley to draw from.

Smith attended Vancouver Film School for four months, where he met longtime collaborators Scott Mosier and Dave Klein. Unlike them, Smith left halfway through the course, figuring he knew enough to proceed and wanting to save money for his first film.

Smith moved back to New Jersey and got his old job back at a convenience store in Leonardo. He decided to set his film, &quot;Clerks&quot;, at the store, borrowing the a-day-in-the-life structure from the Spike Lee film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;. Smith maxed out more than a dozen credit cards, and sold his much-treasured comic book collection, to raise $27,575 to make the film, while saving money by casting friends and acquaintances in most roles. &quot;Clerks&quot; was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994, where it won the Filmmaker&#x27;s Trophy. At a restaurant following the screening, Miramax Films executive Harvey Weinstein invited Smith to join him at his table, where he offered to buy the film. In May 1994, it went to the Cannes International Film Festival, where it won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the International Critics&#x27; Week Prize. Released in October 1994 in two cities, the film went on to play in 50 markets, never playing on more than 50 screens at any given time. Despite the limited release, it was a critical and financial success, earning $3.1 million. Initially, the film received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA for sexually graphic language. Miramax hired Alan Dershowitz to sue the MPAA. At an appeals screening, a jury of members of the National Association of Theatre Owners reversed the MPAA&#x27;s decision, and the film was given an R rating. The movie had a profound effect on the independent film community. According to producer and author John Pierson, it is considered one of the two most influential film debuts in the 1990s, along with &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s second film, &quot;Mallrats&quot;, Jason Lee&#x27;s debut as a leading man, did not fare as well as expected. It received a critical drubbing and earned only $2.2 million at the box office despite playing on more than 500 screens. &quot;Mallrats&quot; was more successful in the home video market.

Widely hailed as Smith&#x27;s best film, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; marked what Quentin Tarantino called &quot;a quantum leap forward&quot; for Smith. Starring &quot;Mallrats&quot; alumni Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck, the $250,000 film earned $12 million at the box office, wound up on a number of critics&#x27; year-end best lists, and won two Independent Spirit Awards (for Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Lee). The film received some criticism from members of the lesbian community, who felt that it reinforced the perception that lesbians merely need to find the right man. Smith, whose brother Donald is gay, found this accusation frustrating, as he has endeavored to be a pro-LGBT filmmaker, believing that sexuality is more fluid, with social taboos, not sexual desire, preventing more people from expressing bisexuality.

Smith&#x27;s fourth film, &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), featured an all-star cast and was mired in controversy. A religious-themed comedy that starred a post-&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, as well as Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, and Lee and Mewes, it was criticized by the Catholic League. The film debuted at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, out of competition. Released on 800 screens in November 1999, the $10 million film earned $30 million.
Smith then focused the spotlight on the two characters who had appeared in supporting roles in his previous four films. &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; featured an all-star cast, with many familiar faces returning from those four films. Affleck and Damon appear as themselves filming a mock sequel to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. The $20 million film earned $30 million at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.

&quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, with Affleck, Liv Tyler, George Carlin, and Raquel Castro, Smith&#x27;s first film outside the View Askewniverse, marked a new direction in Smith&#x27;s career. The film took a critical beating as it was seen as, in Smith&#x27;s own words, &quot;Gigli 2&quot;, because it co-starred Affleck and his then girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez. Smith heavily reedited the film to reduce Lopez&#x27;s role to just a few scenes, but the film did poorly at the box office. Budgeted at $35 million, it earned $36 million.

In the 2006 sequel &quot;Clerks II&quot;, Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film. Roundly criticized before its release, the film won favorable reviews as well as two awards (the Audience Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival and the Orbit Dirtiest Mouth Award at the MTV Movie Awards). It marked Smith&#x27;s third trip to the Cannes International Film Festival, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation. The $5 million film, starring Jeff Anderson, Brian O&#x27;Halloran, Rosario Dawson, Mewes, Jennifer Schwalbach and Smith reprising his role as Silent Bob, earned $25 million.

&quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; was originally announced in March 2006 as Smith&#x27;s second non-Askewniverse film. The film began shooting on January 18, 2008, in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, and wrapped on March 15, 2008. It stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as the title characters who decide to make a low-budget pornographic film to solve their money problems. It was released on October 31, 2008, and ran into many conflicts getting an &quot;R&quot; rating. Rogen said:
 Smith took the film through the MPAA&#x27;s appeals process and received an R rating without having to make any edits. &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; was considered a box-office &quot;flop&quot;. It was hurt by &quot;tepid media advertising for a movie with the title PORNO&quot;. In the aftermath of the film&#x27;s performance, Smith&#x27;s and Weinstein&#x27;s business relationship became &quot;frayed&quot;. &quot;Zack and Miri&quot; opened #2 behind &quot;High School Musical 3: Senior Year&quot; with $10,682,000 from 2,735 theaters, an average of $3,906. The &quot;bankable&quot; Rogen experienced his &quot;worst box-office opening ever&quot;. In an interview with Katla McGlynn of the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, Smith said:

It was announced in 2009 that Smith had signed on to direct &quot;A Couple of Dicks&quot;, a buddy-cop comedy written by the Cullen Brothers and starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan. Due to controversy surrounding the original title, it was changed to &quot;A Couple of Cops&quot;, then reverted to its original title due to negative reaction, before finally settling on the title &quot;Cop Out&quot;. The film, shot from June to August 2009, involves a pair of veteran cops tracking down a stolen vintage baseball card, and was released on February 26, 2010, to poor reviews; it was the first film Smith directed but did not write. &quot;Cop Out&quot; opened at number two at the box office and was mired in controversy, mostly over reported conflicts on the set between Smith and Willis. It was the last time Smith worked with a major studio, leading him to return to his independent film roots.

In September 2010, Smith started work on &quot;Red State&quot;, an independently financed horror film loosely inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and its pastor, Fred Phelps. Weinstein and his brother Bob, who had been involved in the distribution of Smith&#x27;s films except &quot;Mallrats&quot; and &quot;Cop Out&quot;, declined to support &quot;Red State&quot;. The film stars Michael Parks, John Goodman and Melissa Leo. Smith had said he would auction off rights to the $4 million film at a controversial event following its debut screening at Sundance but instead kept the rights to the film himself and self-distributed it under the SModcast Pictures banner. The January 2011 premiere drew protests from a half-dozen members of the church, along with many more who counter-protested Westboro members. Smith explained his decision as a way to return to an era when marketing a film did not cost four times as much as the film itself, a situation he called &quot;decadent and deadening&quot;.&quot;Red State&quot; was a box office bomb, earning just $1,104,682, and opened to poor reviews; the critical consensus (according to Rotten Tomatoes) was &quot;&quot;Red State&quot; is an audacious and brash affair that ultimately fails to provide competent scares or thrills.&quot; In April 2011, Smith said that &quot;Red State&quot; had made its budget back by making $1 million on the first leg of the tour, $1.5 million from a handful of foreign sales and $3 million from a domestic distribution deal for VOD.

Smith had said before &quot;Red State&quot; that he would soon retire from directing, and announced that his last movie would be &quot;Clerks III&quot;. In December 2013, he said he would continue to make films, but only ones that were uniquely his, as opposed to generic ones &quot;anybody could make&quot;.

In 2013, Smith directed &quot;Tusk&quot;, a horror film inspired by a story Smith and Mosier read about a Gumtree ad for a man who rents out a room in his house for free on the condition that the respondent dresses as a walrus for two hours per day. The project began pre-production in September 2013, and was shot in November of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Released September 19, 2014, it received mixed reviews.

Before &quot;Tusk&quot; release, Smith wrote the script for a spin-off of the film, which he titled &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot;. The film began filming in August 2014, and was released in 2016. It stars Smith&#x27;s daughter, Harley Quinn Smith, and Lily-Rose Depp, reprising their two minor characters from &quot;Tusk&quot;, with Johnny Depp playing his inspector character from the earlier film.

Smith revealed at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con that he had written the script for a film called &quot;Moose Jaws&quot;, which he described as &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; with a moose&quot;, and which is planned to be the third film in his &quot;True North&quot; trilogy.

Smith wrote and directed one segment, &quot;Halloween&quot;, of the 2016 horror anthology film &quot;Holidays&quot;, in which each segment takes place during a different holiday.

In June 2017, Smith started shooting &quot;KillRoy Was Here&quot;, a horror film based on the graffiti phenomenon. Directed by Smith, the script was co-written with Andrew McElfresh, marking the first time he shared writing credit. It represents a retooling of their &quot;Anti-Claus&quot; film, which was initially canceled after the release of &quot;Krampus&quot;, due to the two stories&#x27; similarity. The film crew was mostly made up of students of the Ringling College of Art and Design, with shooting continuing over every semester break.

In 2017, due to obstacles getting &quot;Clerks 3&quot; or &quot;Mallrats 2&quot; produced, Smith decided to write and direct a &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; sequel instead, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;. It was scheduled to be filmed in September 2017, but shooting was postponed to February and March 2019. The first trailer for the film was released on July 18, 2019. Smith announced a tour to accompany the film.

On October 1, 2019, Smith announced on Instagram that &quot;Clerks III&quot; was happening and that Jeff Anderson, who had retired, had agreed to reprise his role as Randal. The film released on September 13, 2022.

In 2024, Smith released &quot;The 4:30 Movie&quot;, focusing on a group of teenagers in the 1980s who spent a day &quot;theatre-hopping&quot;, in Monmouth County, New Jersey.

====Relationship with Harvey Weinstein====
With the exception of &quot;Mallrats&quot;, all of Smith&#x27;s films until 2008 were financed and/or distributed by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob, via their companies Miramax, Dimension Films, and The Weinstein Company. In 2008 Smith&#x27;s relationship with Harvey Weinstein soured due to the financial failure of &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;, which Smith blamed on a lack of marketing. Nonetheless, they continued to discuss potential funding for other Smith projects, and The Weinstein Company co-produced Smith&#x27;s 2016 talk show &quot;Geeking Out&quot;. Smith named the independent production company he created for the 2011 film &quot;Red State&quot; &quot;The Harvey Boys&quot; in Weinstein&#x27;s honor. Smith is considered one of the writer-directors whose career Weinstein nurtured, a group that also includes Quentin Tarantino and David O. Russell.

Smith severed professional ties with Weinstein when he was informed of his assault on Rose McGowan. Soon after allegations of rape and sexual assault by Weinstein publicly surfaced in October 2017, Smith said on Twitter that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; of his relationship with Weinstein. On his &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot; podcast, he said: &quot;My entire career is tied up with the man&quot;, adding: &quot;No fucking movie is worth all this.&quot; He lamented that in addition to working with Weinstein, &quot;I sat out there talking about this man like he was a hero, like he was my friend, like he was my father.&quot; He pledged to donate all his future residuals from his Weinstein-produced films to the nonprofit organization Women in Film, which advocates for the inclusion of more women in film production. Smith later announced that, due to the declining appeal of his earlier films, the residuals from Weinstein-funded films may be lower than expected; he decided that he would instead donate $2,000 a month to Women in Film.

====Frequent collaborators====

Smith regularly casts the same actors in his film projects. Jason Mewes has been in nine of his films, his wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith in eight and Ben Affleck in seven.

===Writer===
In 1997, New Line Cinema hired Smith to rewrite &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot;, which was expected to be a blockbuster teen film. Smith&#x27;s then-girlfriend Joey Lauren Adams almost took the role of Ivy in the movie, instead of the female lead in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;. Eventually, she lost out to Reese Witherspoon, and &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot; was quietly released directly to video in April 1998. Smith was not credited for his contributions. He has said that the only scene that really used his dialogue was the opening scene, which includes a reference to longtime Smith friend Bryan Johnson.

Smith was an uncredited screenwriter on the 2000 comedy-drama film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;.

===Comics and magazines===
Smith has been a regular contributor to &quot;Arena&quot; magazine. In 2005, Miramax Books released Smith&#x27;s first book, &quot;Silent Bob Speaks&quot;, a collection of previously published essays (most from &quot;Arena&quot;) dissecting pop culture, the film business, and Smith&#x27;s personal life. His second book, &quot;My Boring-Ass Life: The Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin Smith&quot;, published by Titan Books, was another collection of previously published essays (this time blogs from Smith&#x27;s website silentbobspeaks.com) and reached No. 32 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Sellers List. Titan released Smith&#x27;s third book, &quot;Shootin&#x27; the Sh*t with Kevin Smith: The Best of the SModcast&quot;, on September 29, 2009.
A lifelong comic book fan, Smith&#x27;s early forays into comic books dealt with previously established View Askew characters, and were published by Oni Press. He wrote a short Jay and Silent Bob story about Walt Flanagan&#x27;s dog in &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; No. 1, and followed it with a Bluntman and Chronic story in &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; #12. He followed these with a series of &quot;Clerks&quot; comics. The first was &quot;Clerks: The Comic Book&quot;, which told of Randal&#x27;s attempts to corner the market on &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys. The second was &quot;Clerks: Holiday Special&quot;, where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third was &quot;Clerks: The Lost Scene&quot;, showing what happened inside Poston&#x27;s Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th Anniversary &quot;Clerks&quot; DVD.

Smith wrote the miniseries &quot;Chasing Dogma&quot;, which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the films &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;. He has written the trade paperback &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;, published by Image, which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;). It includes a color reprinting of the story from &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; No. 12, purported to be an early appearance by McNeil and Edwards. These stories have been collected in &quot;Tales From the Clerks&quot; (Graphitti Designs, ), which includes a new &quot;Clerks&quot; story tying into the &quot;Clerks 2&quot; material, and the story from &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; #1. They were previously collected by Image Comics in three separate volumes, one each for &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Chasing Dogma&quot; and &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;. In 1999, Smith won a Harvey Award, for Best New Talent in comic books.

In 1999, Smith wrote &quot;&quot;, an eight-issue story arc of &quot;Daredevil&quot; for Marvel Comics illustrated by Joe Quesada. He produced a 15-issue tenure on &quot;Green Arrow&quot; for DC Comics that saw the return of Oliver Queen from the dead and the introduction of Mia Dearden, a teenage girl who would become Speedy after Smith&#x27;s run had ended.

Smith returned to Marvel for two miniseries, &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; and &quot;Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target&quot;, both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but problems arose when the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date. As a result, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an &quot;in case you missed it&quot; reprinting of the first three issues as one book before the remaining issues were released. The delay in part was due to Smith&#x27;s work on &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; and &quot;Clerks II&quot;, causing him to shelve completion of the miniseries until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoing &quot;Black Cat&quot; series and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in 2002, but because of the delays on &quot;Evil That Men Do&quot; and &quot;The Target&quot;, the plan was changed so that Smith would start a third Spider-Man title, launched in 2004 by Mark Millar instead. &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat&quot; was completed in 2005, but &quot;Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target&quot; remains unfinished, with one issue published.

Smith wrote the limited series &quot;&quot;, with art by friend Walt Flanagan, which ran from November 2008 to January 2009. The series featured the villains Onomatopoeia (a character created by Smith during his run at Green Arrow), The Joker, Maxie Zeus, and Victor Zsasz. The trade paperback of &quot;Batman: Cacophony&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller in their Hardcover Graphic Books section.

In 2010, Smith wrote a six-issue Batman miniseries, &quot;&quot;, for DC, drawn by Walt Flanagan. The series was initially planned as 12 issues, with a long break planned between issues six and seven. After issue six was published, Smith and Flanagan&#x27;s work on their reality show, &quot;Comic Book Men&quot;, extended this planned break longer than expected. It was decided in the interim to release the remaining issues as a separate series, &quot;&quot;, scheduled for 2016, but it remains unreleased.

Also in 2010, Smith published a Green Hornet story for Dynamite Entertainment based on an unused script he wrote for a &quot;Green Hornet&quot; film that never came to fruition.

In August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment debuted Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Bionic Man&quot;, which was based on a 1998 script he wrote that Universal rejected for being &quot;more like a comic book than a movie.&quot;

In 2014, Smith and Ralph Garman released a six-issue &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; crossover featuring Batman and Green Hornet, &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Meets the Green Hornet&quot;.

On March 7, 2022, it was announced that Dark Horse and Smith would be teaming up to publish the books of Secret Stash Press, a new publishing line by Smith. The first two books of the line include &quot;Maskerade&quot;, written by Smith and Andy Mcelfresh and &quot;Quick Stops&quot;, written by Smith and set within the View Askewniverse.

===Television===

In 1998, Smith shot two TV commercials for Coca-Cola in New Jersey.

In 2000, Smith and Mosier teamed up with television writer David Mandel to develop an animated television show based on &quot;Clerks&quot; called &quot;&quot;. Only the first two episodes aired, on ABC in May 2000, before the series was canceled due to poor ratings. The six produced episodes were released on DVD in 2001.

During the mid-1990s, Smith directed and starred in a series of commercials for MTV, alongside Jason Mewes, in which they reprised their roles as Jay and Silent Bob. In 1998, he directed Mewes as &quot;Gary Lamb – Ground Activist&quot; in a series of Nike commercials. That same year, he shot commercials for Diet Coke. Two years later, he directed &quot;Star Wars&quot; toy commercials for Hasbro. He has directed and starred in commercials for Panasonic. In 2004, he shot a public service announcement for the Declare Yourself organization, which promotes youth voter registration. These advertisements brought Jay and Silent Bob out of their &quot;semi-retirement.&quot;

On February 27, 2002, Smith released a short film for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;The Flying Car&quot;.

Smith directed the pilot for The CW supernatural comedy series &quot;Reaper&quot;. He described it as &quot;less &quot;Brimstone&quot; or &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; and more like &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; than anything else&quot;. He added that he took the job because he had always wanted to direct something he did not write, but never had an interest in doing it on the big screen.

Smith produced and appeared in the AMC reality television series &quot;Comic Book Men&quot;, which is set inside Smith&#x27;s comic book shop, Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s Secret Stash, in Red Bank, New Jersey. The show ran for seven seasons, from 2012 to 2018.

A second series of &quot;Spoilers&quot; aired on The Comedy Network in Canada.

Smith has directed three episodes of &quot;The Flash&quot; (&quot;The Runaway Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;Killer Frost&quot;, and &quot;Null and Annoyed&quot;), four episodes of &quot;Supergirl&quot; (&quot;Supergirl Lives&quot;, &quot;Distant Sun&quot;, &quot;Damage&quot; and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;) and three episodes of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (&quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot;, &quot;Graduation Day&quot; and &quot;Our Perfect Strangers&quot;).

In February 2017, Smith was announced to write, direct, and executive produce a TV series based on the Image Comics title &quot;Sam and Twitch&quot; for BBC America.

In February 2019, Smith was announced to cowrite, with Dave Willis, an animated web series based on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; for Hulu. In January 2020, it was announced that the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; series was scrapped.

In 2022, Smith guest starred as himself on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Warped!&quot;, in the episode &quot;Plagiarized!&quot;; in the episode, Smith announces to the lead characters what his new film would be, and the two leads believe Smith stole their similar idea and try to stop him.

===Abandoned and stalled TV and film projects===

In 1996, Smith worked on a script for a planned Superman film tentatively titled &quot;Superman Lives&quot;. He wrote several drafts but was dropped from the project when Tim Burton was hired to direct and brought his own team to write the script; Burton&#x27;s attempt was later abandoned as well. Smith publicly discussed his experience working on the script at a Q&amp;A session at Clark University shown on the 2002 DVD &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot;. In the Q&amp;A, he said the experience was positive overall, since he loves Superman and was paid well. But he listed a number of unusual demands that producer Jon Peters made, including that Superman not be shown flying or wearing tights, and that he should battle a giant spider at the end of the film. Smith noted that he went to see the 1999 film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, which Peters produced, and was surprised to see a giant mechanical spider at the end of the film, presumably Peters&#x27;s handiwork. Smith&#x27;s description of his experience gained a life of its own, with film critic A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;extraordinary&quot;. In the 2007 direct-to-DVD animated film &quot;&quot;, Smith has a cameo as an onlooker in a crowd that alludes to this anecdote: after Superman defeats The Toyman&#x27;s giant mechanical robot, Smith scoffs, &quot;Yeah, like we really needed him to defeat that giant spider. Heh. &quot;Lame!&quot;&quot;

In the early &#x27;00s, Smith was said to be writing &quot;Fletch Won&quot;, a prequel to the Chevy Chase film &quot;Fletch&quot;, and was set to direct with Jason Lee in the lead role, but the plans ultimately came to nothing. Smith cited Miramax not seeing Lee&#x27;s box-office appeal (in an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article covering the delays, Smith claimed Harvey Weinstein continually refused it personally or suggested he focus more on the disguises of the character in a matter similar to &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, Smith admitting incredulity that Harvey refused even after Lee was frequently seen in billboards and posters in the city at the time, to promote his new show &quot;My Name is Earl&quot;, but admitting that Harvey&#x27;s vision for the film clearly did not include Lee) as a reason for its abandonment. For a time, Ben Affleck was considered for the role, with Chase framing the action as the narrator, looking back on his early adventures.

In 2004, Smith wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, and announced that he intended to direct it. The project died after the poor box office of &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;; the screenplay was later turned into a &quot;Green Hornet&quot; comic book miniseries. (A live-action film adaptation, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, was released in 2011, with no involvement from Smith.)

At the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Smith would write and direct an episode of the &quot;Heroes&quot; spin-off &quot;Heroes: Origins&quot;, but the project was canceled because of the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike.

Smith planned to direct a hockey drama-comedy based on Warren Zevon&#x27;s song &quot;Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)&quot;. The song, about a hockey player famous for fighting in the rink, was co-written by Mitch Albom, who worked with Smith on the project. Smith announced at the 2011 Sundance premiere of &quot;Red State&quot; that &quot;Hit Somebody&quot; would be the last film he directed, but that he would continue to tell stories in other media. In August 2011, &quot;Hit Somebody&quot; was announced as a two-part film titled &quot;Hit Somebody: Home&quot; and &quot;Hit Somebody: Away&quot;, with part one rated PG-13 and part two rated R, but later it became one film again. In December 2012, Smith announced that, due to difficulties finding funding, &quot;Hit Somebody&quot; would be a six-part miniseries on an as-yet unknown network. Smith announced in March 2015 that &quot;Hit Somebody&quot; would film from September to Christmas 2015, but this did not happen.

On March 12, 2015, Smith said he would film &quot;Clerks III&quot; in May 2015, followed in early 2016 by &quot;Moose Jaws&quot; and &quot;Anti-Claus&quot; (a story inspired by the Krampus tradition), which he confirmed the next day.

On April 8, 2015, Smith said that &quot;Mallrats 2&quot; would instead be his next film. Most of the original film&#x27;s cast (16 of the 18) signed on to appear in the sequel. In June 2016, Smith revealed that because Universal owns the rights to the &quot;Mallrats&quot; title a sequel would not be made; instead, it would be turned into a ten-episode TV series produced by Universal Television. He also confirmed that the film&#x27;s entire cast would reprise their roles in the series. Toward the end of the month, Smith announced that he had closed a deal with Universal Television to pitch the series to networks and streaming services in August.

In January 2016, Smith wrapped production on a pilot episode for a planned half-hour comedy series, &quot;Hollyweed&quot;. He wrote and directed the pilot, which starred Smith and Donnell Rawlings, along with Kristin Bauer van Straten, Frankie Shaw, Jason Mewes, Ralph Garman, Adam Brody, Hina Abdullah, Pete Pietrangeliand and Harley Quinn Smith. The pilot was not picked up. In July 2018, it was released as the inaugural pilot on the new TV crowdsourcing site Rivit TV, in hopes of getting funded as a web series.

In May 2016, Smith announced that he was adapting the 1984 film &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; for television through MGM and said he and the company were shopping it around to networks. In July 2016, it was revealed that Amazon Studios was close to closing a deal to produce the series, but in November 2016, during a Facebook Live Stream, Smith said he would walk away from the series after MGM filed a lawsuit against the original creators, but would be willing to come back on board if they wanted him.

===Acting roles===
As an actor, Smith is best known for his role as Silent Bob in &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Mallrats&quot;, &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot;, &quot;Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, and &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

An avid fan of the original &quot;Degrassi&quot; series &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, Smith references them in some of his early films. In the episodes, portraying a fictionalized version of himself, he visited the school to work on the fictional film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!&quot; All three episodes were collected on the DVD &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi&quot;. Smith and Mewes reappeared in two episodes the following season, in which they returned to Degrassi for the Toronto premiere of the movie. Smith also appeared in the 2009 made-for-TV movie &quot;Degrassi Goes Hollywood&quot;.

In 2007, Smith appeared in a number of films, co-starring as Sam in &quot;Catch and Release&quot;, starring Jennifer Garner, and appearing as The Warlock, a hacker, in the fourth installment of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; franchise, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;. At year&#x27;s end, he appeared briefly in friend and fellow writer-director Richard Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Southland Tales&quot;, in which he played the legless conspiracy theorist General Simon Theory. The same year, Smith did voicework for the CGI film &quot;TMNT&quot; as a diner chef and was seen as Rusty (a friend of lead Jason Mewes) in &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; with co-star Paris Hilton.

Smith cameoed in the second-season premiere of the sitcom &quot;Joey&quot;, playing himself, on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (2000, episode &quot;Black, White and Blue&quot;), &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (2003 as Hal Jordan, voice only) and &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; (2004, as himself and as Silent Bob behind the end credits). He appeared in the second episode of season two of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, playing a store clerk. Before it aired, Smith watched the show&#x27;s first season and raved about it in his &quot;online diary&quot;, calling it one of the best shows in the history of television.

Smith does a voice cameo in &quot;&quot; as a bystander. He had a cameo appearance as &quot;Bob the Security Guard&quot; alongside Jason Mewes as &quot;Jay the Security Guard&quot; on &quot;The Flash&quot; episode, &quot;Null and Annoyed&quot;, which he also directed.

Smith played himself in the video game &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot; as a playable character.

Smith appears as himself in &quot;Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare&quot;, as a cameo and a playable character in the map Rave in the Redwoods.

In 2017, he appeared as himself in the animated film &quot;Teen Titans: The Judas Contract&quot; from the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series.

Smith had a voice cameo in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, and an on-screen cameo in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

===Q&amp;A documentaries and other specials===
Smith has appeared in five Q&amp;A documentaries: &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot; (2002), &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder&quot; (2006), &quot;Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith&quot; (2007), &quot;Kevin Smith: Too Fat for 40&quot; (2010) and &quot;Kevin Smith: Burn in Hell&quot; (2012). All five have been released on DVD, and the last two were broadcast on the cable channel Epix.

The first is a collection of filmed appearances at American colleges, while the sequel was shot at two Q&amp;A shows held in Toronto and London. The third and fourth were filmed in Red Bank, New Jersey at the Count Basie Theater on Smith&#x27;s 37th and 40th birthdays, respectively. The fifth was filmed in Austin, Texas at the Paramount Theater. The first two DVD sets were released by Sony Home Video, while the third was put out by the Weinstein Company.

A stand-up special, entitled &quot;Kevin Smith: Silent But Deadly&quot;, filmed a mere hour before Smith&#x27;s heart attack, premiered in 2018 on the cable channel Showtime and was later released to DVD.

Smith appears with Marvel Comics&#x27; Stan Lee in &quot;Marvel Then &amp; Now: An Evening With Stan Lee and Joe Quesada, hosted by Kevin Smith&quot;. The film is similar in tone to the &quot;Evening with Kevin Smith&quot; series. Proceeds from the film benefit The Hero Initiative, a charitable organization that aids ill or aging comic book creators.

===Other film and television appearances===
After an August 2001 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to promote &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, Smith returned to the show for monthly segments as a correspondent. The &quot;Roadside Attractions&quot; segments featured him traveling to places around the country, including Howe Caverns in upstate New York and the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle. At least 12 of these segments were aired, and Smith regularly appeared on the program to introduce the pre-taped pieces. Five of the segments were also included on the &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; DVD.

Smith appeared in the 2006 mtvU show &quot;Sucks Less with Kevin Smith&quot;. The show gives college students ideas for things to do on the weekends.

In 2006, Smith guest reviewed on &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, in place of Roger Ebert, who was recovering from thyroid cancer treatment. These spots were notable for the arguments between Smith and Richard Roeper over certain films, with Smith often citing Roeper&#x27;s negative review of &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; to discredit his review of the film at hand. On one appearance, Smith compared Craig Brewer&#x27;s &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; to the works of William Faulkner.

Smith was featured as one of the interview subjects in &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;, a 2006 documentary about the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s process of rating films. Smith discussed how &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; receiving an R rating, on the basis of a conversation two characters in that film have about masturbation, which MPAA head Joan Graves told Smith she would not feel comfortable having her 16-year-old daughter watching. Smith&#x27;s response was to question whether Graves&#x27; daughter had not already masturbated or learned about masturbation, arguing that his film was not teaching 16-year-olds anything they did not already know.

Smith teamed with AMC and The Weinstein Company to co-host a late night talk show with Greg Grunberg, &quot;Geeking Out&quot;, which premiered in July 2016, covering San Diego Comic-Con with 8 subsequent episodes running weekly.

In February 2019, he made his second appearance on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; in season 12 episode 16, &quot;The D&amp;D Vortex&quot;, alongside other guests stars, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, William Shatner, and Joe Manganiello in a storyline where they get together at the home of recurring star Wil Wheaton, to play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. His first appearance was in season 8 episode 20, &quot;The Fortification Implementation&quot;, when he joins Wil Wheaton on a podcast, voice only.

On November 16, 2019, Amazon Prime published &quot;Bonus: Kevin Smith Explains &quot;The Expanse&quot;&quot; as a forerunner to series 4 of &quot;The Expanse&quot;, in which Smith helps explain the action that unfolded during the first three seasons. Two days later, it was published on YouTube.

===Public appearances===

Smith&#x27;s longest Q&amp;A session took place April 2, 2005, at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey. The sold-out event was over seven hours long, took place from 8 pm through 3 am (which due to daylight saving time, was actually 4 am). Following the Q&amp;A, he opened Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s Secret Stash for a meet-and-greet with the numerous remaining audience members, which ended around 6:30 am. Smith then hopped on a plane and did another Q&amp;A at the Raue Center for the Arts in Crystal Lake, Illinois, that night. Planned for two hours, it lasted just over five hours, ending a little after 1 am Central time.

Smith made sold-out appearances at Carnegie Hall in 2009 and the Sydney Opera House in 2010.

===On the Internet===
Smith has a website, The View Askewniverse, which went online in late 1995. He has an online blog, &quot;My Boring-Ass Life&quot;, the contents of which were published in a book by the same name. &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; fictional website MoviePoopShoot.com became real in 2002. It became Quick Stop Entertainment and was the home of SModcast until it was sold and SModcast moved to a dedicated website SModcast.com, which carries the other SModcast network podcasts in early 2010.

On February 5, 2007, Smith and Scott Mosier began SModcast, a regular comedy podcast. SModcast has since spawned into a podcast network called the SModcast podcast network which began in 2010, its own digital radio station called SModcast Internet Radio (S.I.R) in 2011 and an internet television channel SModCo Internet Television (S.I.T.) in 2012.

On June 4, 2012, Smith premiered his Hulu weekly series &quot;Spoilers&quot;, described as an &quot;anti-movie review&quot; series, where Smith takes a group of people to a new film and has them comment on what they have seen. Other segments on the show include interviews with celebrities, and the &quot;Criterion Lounge&quot;, where Smith discusses a Criterion Collection film available on DVD and the Hulu Plus service.

On December 14, 2015, Smith began posting his &quot;Fatman on Batman&quot; series on YouTube.

In late 2015, Smith and Jason Mewes began the web series &quot;What&#x27;s in the Box?&quot; on the &quot;Screen Junkies&quot; website, through the site&#x27;s streaming service.

==Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s Secret Stash==

Smith owns and operates Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s Secret Stash in Red Bank, New Jersey, a comic book store largely dedicated to merchandise related to his films and comics. He purchased the original store in January 1997 for $30,000, using the money he earned from &quot;Clerks&quot;. The current location is its second. The store was moved to a defunct ice cream parlor on Broad St. after Smith sold the Monmouth St. property. The New Jersey location was managed by Smith&#x27;s long-time friend Walt Flanagan, who appears frequently in Smith&#x27;s films. A second Secret Stash in the Westwood section of Los Angeles was opened in September 2004 and was managed by long-time friend and associate Bryan Johnson, who has appeared in Smith&#x27;s films as Steve-Dave. Smith had announced that he would close after his lease expired and Johnson wanted to resign, but eventually relocated to Laser Blazer, a now-defunct laserdisc and DVD store in Los Angeles. In January 2009, the Los Angeles store closed, leaving the Red Bank store as Smith&#x27;s only operating store.

==Personal life==
After the success of his first films, Smith moved to Los Angeles, though he felt homesick due to being away from Red Bank, New Jersey. He dated actress Joey Lauren Adams, and declared his desire to marry her in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Smith and Adams&#x27; relationship was tested by their working together on &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, and the two had a heated argument while on the film&#x27;s set. They broke up in June 1997.

Smith is married to Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, whom he met while she was interviewing him for &quot;USA Today&quot;. They got married at Skywalker Ranch on April 25, 1999. He photographed her for a nude pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot;. Their daughter, Harley Quinn Smith, was born June 26, 1999, and was named after the character from &quot;&quot;. They live in the Hollywood Hills in a house Smith purchased from his longtime friend Ben Affleck in 2003.

Smith is an avid hockey fan and supports the New Jersey Devils. He is also a fan of the Edmonton Oilers.

===Health===

Smith never smoked until his debut film, &quot;Clerks&quot;, in which he used the cigarettes as a prop, but did not inhale. He quit smoking cigarettes in 2008, when he took up smoking cannabis after working with Seth Rogen on &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;.

Smith has had a history of yo-yo dieting. He lost upon meeting his wife. During production of &quot;Clerks II&quot; in 2005, he went from to . After watching &quot;Fed Up&quot;, he eliminated sugar from his diet and took up juice fasts in 2014, lowering his weight from to .

On February 25, 2018, after performing a stand-up comedy show at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, California, Smith suffered a severe heart attack caused by a total blockage of the left anterior descending artery. An ambulance rushed him to the nearby Glendale Adventist Medical Center for emergency surgery, from which he recovered. Following the episode, his doctor told him he needed to lose another . He adopted a vegan diet, also joining Weight Watchers and becoming a paid spokesperson for the brand.

On the fifth anniversary of his heart attack, Smith confirmed that he had quit using marijuana in early 2023 and had experienced a mental health crisis earlier in the year that led him to reassess his livelihood and identify as a co-dependent.

===Religious beliefs===
Though raised Catholic, Smith began to become disillusioned about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to see Catholic Mass as &quot;dry and lip-servicey&quot;. Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith researched Christianity thoroughly, explored other religions, read the Biblical apocrypha, and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film &quot;Dogma&quot;, the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998, he stated on &quot;Back to the Well&quot;, a feature on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; documentary, that he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres. In September 2014, Smith said that he believes in God, stating: &quot;Proof of God is that I have a career.&quot;

Conversely, in a 2015 interview, he said that he had left both Catholicism and a belief in God behind, stating that the death of his dog was what caused him to do so. He said that upon the dog&#x27;s death, he realized that dogs do not have religious beliefs. This in turn made him decide that religion was something meant to comfort children who were afraid of death. As an adult, Smith decided he no longer needed religion if his dog did not. When asked about his religious beliefs in 2017, Smith said that he &quot;believes in people&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Smith co-founded &quot;The Wayne Foundation&quot;, a charity supporting women affected by human trafficking and exploitation in 2010; as of 2025 it had its tax exempt status revoked by the IRS due to failure to file for 3 consecutive years. In February 2019, he donated some of his previously worn jerseys to be auctioned off for the charity.

In 2018, Vancouver Film School announced three &quot;Kevin Smith Scholarships&quot; in Acting, Writing and Film Production covering full-tuition. Thirteen partial scholarships were awarded, funded by Smith. He personally selected the recipients from over nine hundred applications.

==Filmography==

Smith has directed sixteen feature films since 1994; he was the screenwriter for all but one of them, &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010).

He has created and executive produced the TV series &quot;&quot; (2000–2001), &quot;Sucks Less with Kevin Smith&quot; (2006), &quot;Comic Book Men&quot; (2012–2018) and &quot;Geeking Out&quot; (2016). Since 2016, he has regularly directed episodes for a number of television shows.

Smith has had many small acting roles in films and television, often playing himself or otherwise making a cameo appearance.

==Recognition==
In 2019, &quot;Clerks&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>The Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), also known as Steller&#x27;s sea lion or the northern sea lion, is a large, near-threatened species of sea lion, predominantly found in the coastal marine habitats of the northeast Pacific Ocean and the Pacific Northwest regions of North America, from north-central California to Oregon, Washington and British Columbia to Alaska. Its range continues across the Northern Pacific and the Aleutian Islands, all the way to Kamchatka, Magadan Oblast, and the Sea of Okhotsk, south to Honshu&#x27;s northern coastline. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias, and the largest of the so-called eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, only the walrus and the two species of elephant seal are bigger. The species is named for the naturalist and explorer Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. Steller sea lions have attracted considerable attention in recent decades, both from scientists and the general public, due to significant (and largely unexplained) declines in their numbers over an extensive portion of their northern range, notably in Alaska.

== Description ==

Adult animals are lighter in color than most sea lions, ranging from pale yellow to tawny and occasionally reddish. Steller sea lion pups are born almost black, weighing around , and remain dark in coloration for several months. Females reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age, while males have a wider window, reaching maturity between three and eight years of age. Females and males both grow rapidly until the fifth year, after which female growth slows considerably. Adult females measure in length, on average being , and weigh , with an average of . Males continue to grow until their secondary sexual traits appear in their fifth to eighth year. Males are slightly longer than the females, growing to about long and averaging in length. Males have much wider chests, necks, and general forebody structure. Males can weigh between , weighing on average . Males are further distinguished from females by broader and higher foreheads, flatter snouts, and a thick mane of coarse hair around their large necks. Their Latin name translates roughly as &quot;maned one with the broad forehead&quot;.

== Range ==
The range of the Steller sea lion extends from the north shore of Honshu in Japan to the Gulf of Alaska in the north, down to Año Nuevo Island off the coast of central California to the south. They formerly bred as far south as the Channel Islands, but have not been observed there since the 1980s. Based on genetic anаlyses and local migration patterns, the global Steller sea lion population has traditionally been divided into an eastern and western stock at 144°W longitude, roughly through the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. Recent evidence suggests the sea lions in Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands comprise a third Asian stock, while the sea lions on the eastern seaboard of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands belong to the western stock.

In the summer, Steller sea lions tend to shift their range somewhat southward. Therefore, though there are no reproductive rookeries in Japan, several consistent haul-out sites are found around Hokkaidō in the winter and spring. Vagrants have been spotted in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf and along the coast of the Korean Peninsula and China. The oldest fossil known of the species was found near Kanazawa, Japan and dates to the late Early Pleistocene, approximately 800,000 years ago.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat ===
Steller sea lions tend to live in the coastal waters of the subarctic because of the cooler temperate climate of the area. Like all otariids, Steller sea lions are amphibious and spend some time in water and some on land. Typically, Steller sea lions spend their time in the water feeding but haul-out onto land to reproduce, raise their pups, molt, and rest. Steller sea lions usually congregate on isolated islands because they are the ideal terrestrial habitat. These isolated islands are preferred by Steller sea lions because they can avoid predation from terrestrial predators, easily thermoregulate (by means of cooling winds), and access offshore prey more easily. Some haul-out sites, known as rookeries, are commonly used for reproduction while other haul-out sites are used for other purposes like molting. However, both biotic and abiotic factors can influence the amount of time that Steller sea lions spend on land. Haul-out sites and haul-out abundance of the Steller sea lion can be determined by prey availability, predator abundance, tide levels, weather, etc.

=== Foraging ===
Steller sea lions are skilled and opportunistic marine predators, feeding on a wide range of fish and cephalopod species. Important diet components include walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, capelin, flatfish Pacific cod, rockfish, sculpins, salmon, sand lance, and cephalopods such as various squid and octopus. They seem to prefer schooling fish and forage primarily between intertidal zones and continental shelves. They usually aggregate in groups of up to twelve in areas of prey abundance. They are known to aggregate near fishing vessels, preying on bycatch discards. Most of the data on their foraging comes from data collected off the coast of Alaska; little is known of their foraging behavior elsewhere.

The composition of the diet of Steller sea lions varies seasonally and geographically; as opportunistic predators, they concentrate on the locally most abundant prey species. In addition to their primary marine environment, they sometimes enter estuaries and feed on brackish-water fish such as sturgeon. Very occasionally, they have been known to prey on northern fur seals, harbor seals, and sea otter pups. Records suggest that the range of their prey species has broadened over time.

=== Predation ===
Steller sea lions are top-tier carnivores, but are susceptible to predation, primarily by killer whales. Shark species are also possible predators: sleepers and great whites may prey on juvenile sea lions.

== Behavior and life history ==

=== Reproduction ===
Reproductively mature male sea lions gather together mid-spring on traditional, well-defined reproductive rookeries, usually on beaches on isolated islands. The larger, older males establish and defend distinct territories on the rookery. A week or so later, adult females arrive, accompanied occasionally by sexually immature offspring, and form fluid aggregations throughout the rookery. Like all other otariids, Steller sea lions are polygynous. However, unlike some other species, they do not coerce individual females into harems, but control spatial territories among which females freely move. Steller sea lions have used aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial territories. Males with semiaquatic territories have the most success in defending them. The boundaries are defined by natural features, such as rocks, faults, or ridges in rocks, and territories can remain stable for 60 days. Though Steller sea lion males are generally tolerant of pups, one male filmed on Medny Island in Russia was documented killing and eating several pups in a first-ever recorded incident of cannibalism. Though researchers are uncertain as to the motives or reasons behind said attacks, it is suggested that the bull involved may have an abnormal personality akin to being psychotic.

Pregnant females give birth soon after arriving on a rookery, and copulation generally occurs one to two weeks after giving birth, but the fertilized egg does not become implanted in the uterus until the fall. A fertilized egg may remain in embryonic diapause for up to three months before implanting and beginning to divide. Twins are rare. After a week or so of nursing without leaving the rookery, females begin to take progressively longer and more frequent foraging trips leaving their pups behind until at some point in late summer, when both the mother and pup leave the rookery together. This maternal attendance pattern is common in otariids. As pups get older the amount of time spent by females foraging out at sea increases. This continues until pups obtain the ideal body weight and energy reserves to eat on their own. A study conducted by the University of California, Santa Cruz found that on average male pups consume more milk than females. This may be due to the sexual dimorphism common to otariids. Reproductive males fast throughout the reproductive season, often without entering the water once from mid-May until August, when the structure of the reproductive rookeries begins to fall apart and most animals leave for the open seas and disperse throughout their range.

The age at weaning is highly variable; pups may remain with their mothers for as long as four years. Incidents of mothers feeding daughters that are simultaneously feeding their own newborn pups have been documented, which is an extremely rare occurrence among mammals. A study done at Año Nuevo in 1983 found that female attendance and time spent with their pup was shaped by increasing nutritional demands of the pup and the pups suckling efficiency. Females averaged 21 hours ashore and 36 hours at sea. As the pups aged, females began to spend more time at sea again. As the pups matured, specifically at the sixth week past birth, the mother&#x27;s sea time declined by 30 percent. There was no relationship between the pups&#x27; activity or physical excursion and their suckling time, age, or sex. Their suckling time, and age, and sex are unrelated to their use of energy. Labeled water studies showed that the pups&#x27; milk intake had a direct relationship to their size. Pups that consumed more milk were heavier than those that did not. These findings show that the amount of time females spend onshore with their pups is based on their pup&#x27;s suckling efficiency and nutritional demands.

In the past, the low pup production has been tied to an increase in nutritional stress found in females. This was believed to have contributed to the decline in Steller sea lions common to Alaska.

=== Locomotion ===
The largest of the eared seals, Steller sea lions are quick swimmers, about as fast as the smaller California sea lions. Glide velocity of individual Steller sea lions has been measured as 2.9–3.4 meters or 1.2–1.5 body lengths per second, which is close to the optimal swim velocity of 1.4 body lengths per second based on the minimum cost of transport for California sea lions.

A 2007 study of Steller sea lions found that a majority of thrust was produced during the drive phase of the fore flipper stroke cycle. Although previous findings on eared seals suggested that thrust was generated by the initial outward movement of the foreflippers or the terminal drag-based paddling phase, the 2007 study found that little or no thrust was generated during those phases. Swimming performance in sea lions is modulated by changes in the duration and intensity of movements without changing their sequence. Using criteria based on velocity and the minimum radius of turns, Steller sea lions&#x27; maneuverability is similar to that of other eared seals, superior to that of cetaceans, and inferior to that of many fish.

=== Diving ===
To be able to dive for a long period of time, Steller sea lions exhibit apnea, bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction. This allows them to maximize their oxygen stores and efficiently forage during their dives. In addition to those adaptations, their thick blubber layer and outer fur layer keep their body insulated during dives.

Trained Steller sea lions from Vancouver Aquarium were placed in the open ocean at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Open Water Research Station to study their diving metabolism and behavior. Steller sea lions&#x27; dives are more energetically costly if they perform dive bouts. The aerobic diving limit of Steller sea lions was observed to be affected by their nutritional state and feeding.

=== Communication ===
Like most otariids, Steller sea lions are vocal in air. Mature male sea lions have a range of vocalizations as part of their territorial behaviors, including belches, growls, snorts, and hisses that serve as warnings to others. Both males and females also produce underwater noises similar to their above water sounds, described as clicks, barks, and belches. The primary function of their vocalizations is for social behavior. Sonogram readings reported that Steller Sea Lions make discrete, low frequency pulses underwater that resemble the male &quot;belching&quot; territorial noise made in air. These underwater vocalizations have an average of 20–30 pulses per second.

Vocalizations are critical to mother-pup pairs, as the mothers must find their pups in a crowded breeding area when they return from foraging. The mother and pup both use distinctive calls, like names, to help differentiate themselves among the crowd of other sea lions. Their aerial vocalizations have been described as similar to the bleats of sheep, and bellows.

Because Steller sea lions are sexually dimorphic in size, their hearing differs in sensitivity, possibly due to differences in size of the hearing structures. Females have a higher sensitivity than males, perhaps to hear the higher frequency calls of their pups. The Steller sea lion&#x27;s hearing range also suggests that they are capable of hearing the underwater calls of one of their main predators, the killer whale.

== Interactions with humans ==
Steller sea lion were hunted for meat and other commodities by prehistoric communities everywhere their range intersected with human communities. Aside from food and clothing, their skin was used to cover baidarkas and kayaks. A subsistence harvest on the order of 300 animals or less continues to this day in some native communities in Alaska.

Historically, the sea lion has had only very slight commercial value. For example, in the 19th century their whiskers sold for a penny apiece for use as tobacco-pipe cleaners.

Steller sea lions are sometimes killed intentionally by fishermen, as they are seen as competitors and a threat to fish stocks. Killing sea lions is strictly prohibited in the US and Russia; however, in Japan, a fixed number are still harvested annually, ostensibly to protect their fisheries. In Canada, commercial hunting is prohibited, but limited hunting permits are occasionally granted for First Nations communities, or if local culling is deemed necessary, for example, nuisance animals destroying fish farms.

In recent years, Steller sea lions have been known to enter the Columbia River estuary and feed on white sturgeon, several salmon species, and rainbow trout, some of which are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. They are found in the Columbia River nearly year round, with the exception of early summer, going as far upstream as Bonneville Dam. Though not as abundant as the California sea lion, there is still concern amongst agencies tasked with managing and monitoring the fish populations; as the Steller sea lions are, themselves, protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, managers are implored to use non-harmful, non-lethal deterrence methods (such as rubber bullets, bullhorns and other noisemakers). Interference or deterrence by the general public is unlawful, unregulated, and considered to be stressful (even disruptive) to the animals and their habits. Additionally, the massive size of the Steller sea lion—and potential for aggression—poses a real threat for humans; thus, the interfering with, molestation or frightening of marine mammals is strictly forbidden. Offenders are subject to varying fines, court appearances and even jail time.

=== Recent decline and subsequent recovery ===
While the populations of the eastern and Asian stocks appear stable, the population of the western stock, particularly along the Aleutian Islands, was estimated to have fallen by 70–80% since the 1970s. As a consequence, in 1997 the western stock of Steller sea lions was listed as endangered and the eastern stock was listed as threatened under the United States Endangered Species Act. They have since been the object of intense study and the focus of much political and scientific debate in Alaska.

One suspected cause of their precipitous decline was the overfishing of Alaska pollock, herring, and other fish stocks in the Gulf of Alaska. This stems largely from the &quot;junk-food hypothesis&quot; representing a shift in their diet from fatty herring and capelin to leaner fare such as pollock and flounder, thereby limiting their ability to consume and store fat. Other hypotheses include increased predation by orcas and sharks, indirect effects of prey species composition shifts due to changes in climate, effects of disease or contaminants, shooting by fishermen, and others. The decline is certainly due to a complex of interrelated factors which have yet to be defined by the research effort.

Another possible reason for decline in this species has been tied to the nutritional stress hypothesis. The lack of prey corresponds to the decrease in population. In females specifically, obtaining an insufficient amount of nutrients has resulted in the failure to complete their pregnancies to full term.

In October 2013, the eastern Steller sea lion was taken off the U.S. Endangered Species List after a major population comeback over the past several years.

<doc id="60300" wikidata="Q725767" url="?curid=60300" title="So Far, So Good... So What!">
<text>So Far, So Good... So What! is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on January 19, 1988, by Capitol Records. It was the band&#x27;s only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, both of whom were fired from the band in early 1989, several months after the completion of the album&#x27;s world tour. &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; features music performed at fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.

&quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; was well received by critics upon its release, although retrospective analysis has been less favorable. It managed to enter the top-thirty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (although it received no commercial radio play), and charted in several other countries as well. The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA, and indicated Megadeth&#x27;s forthcoming emergence from the underground music scene.

==Background and production==
Guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson had been both fired from the band following the conclusion of the &quot;Peace Sells&quot; tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland&#x27;s habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler (although Slayer&#x27;s Dave Lombardo considered joining). However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds&#x27;s firing. Other guitarists considered included Slash from Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Work on the album started while Reynolds was in the band, but continued after the induction of Young. To mix the album, the label turned to Paul Lani, who had remixed the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?.&quot; Mustaine was initially skeptical, but later became very irate with Lani&#x27;s &quot;eccentricities&quot; and his way of handling things. To mix the album, Lani relocated himself and Mustaine to Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock, New York, ostensibly for the purpose of inspiration. Mustaine decided that he had his limits when he, having just awakened and made coffee, noticed Lani outside in his underwear feeding an apple to a deer. Mustaine flew back to Los Angeles later that day and fired Lani, who was replaced by Michael Wagener. Mustaine has since criticized Wagener&#x27;s &quot;pedestrian&quot; mixing efforts, citing the album&#x27;s &quot;muddy feel&quot;, in particular. Mustaine was able to recruit Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones to perform guitar parts on &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
According to music critic J. D. Considine of &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; displays music performed at &quot;volumes approaching the threshold of pain&quot;. This was the first album where another band member other than Mustaine contributed to writing, with bassist David Ellefson contributing to either lyrics or music on half of the album&#x27;s songs. The album features fast guitar solos, multiple tempo changes and technical dexterity. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic observed that the album offers the classic &quot;take no prisoners&quot; style which is commonly associated with Megadeth; however, he noted that the sound does not differ much from the other underground metal bands from that period. Jim Farber of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Mustaine&#x27;s vocals &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; and praised the musicianship for keeping rhythmic pace even at the &quot;most anarchic moments&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Dennis Hunt noted that the music was filled with extensive and &quot;torrid&quot; instrumentals and described Mustaine&#x27;s singing as a combination of extreme shrieking and screaming. Despite the positive overview, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; received some negative criticism, partially because it was perceived to lack the rebelliousness of the original version.

The lyrical themes on the album explore a variety of subjects, from nuclear holocaust (&quot;Set the World Afire&quot;) to revisionism and censorship (&quot;Hook in Mouth&quot;). Still, the majority of the songs are accompanied by the same sentiment of disillusion and nihilism as their previous two albums. Unlike traditional topics related to heavy metal music, the song &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; contains emotional lyrics which deal with loneliness and isolation. Dave Mustaine revealed that he tried to write about subject matters that were in touch with reality, including social issues and taboo topics. The lyrics on Megadeth&#x27;s cover of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; were slightly mistaken because Mustaine claimed he had heard them incorrectly.

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Into the Lungs of Hell&quot;, is an instrumental composition which features synthesized horns, winds and percussion. &quot;Set the World Afire&quot; is the first song Dave Mustaine wrote for Megadeth after being fired from Metallica. He was a member of Metallica from 1981 to 1983, and was dismissed just before Metallica recorded its debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. He later said that he wrote the lyrics during his journey home from the departure. Inspiration for the song came from a pamphlet he read while on the bus back to California. The initial lyrics were reportedly written with a borrowed pencil on a cupcake wrapper, leading some fans to refer to &quot;Set the World Afire&quot; as &quot;the cupcake song&quot;, though Mustaine indicated in a 2019 interview with NME that the lyrics were written on the backing of a Sno Balls cake. The beginning of the song contains a sample of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot;, a 1941 song by The Ink Spots.

&quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; is a Sex Pistols cover, which quickly became a staple of the band&#x27;s live set. Over the years, the song was dropped from the set list because of its [perceived] anti-Christian viewpoint. &quot;Mary Jane&quot; tells a story about a young witch buried alive by her father near the Loon Lake cemetery in Minnesota. According to the legend, anyone who dared to disturb her grave was doomed to a prompt death. The song features descending guitar lines and begins with Mustaine summoning her spirit during the introduction.

&quot;502&quot; is about breaking laws and driving fast cars. The title is a reference to the police code in California for drunk driving; Mustaine himself would be arrested for drunk driving in March the following year when he crashed into a police car. &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; was written by Mustaine shortly after the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never contacted him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. &quot;Liar&quot; is a diss song directed at past member Chris Poland, who Mustaine claimed was stealing guitars and selling them for heroin money. &quot;Hook in Mouth&quot; criticizes censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were &quot;fucking around with our constitutional rights and trying to take away our freedom of speech&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
The album received positive feedback from music critics at the time of its release. In a contemporary review, Holger Stratmann from &quot;Rock Hard&quot; hailed the album as &quot;the new masterpiece of Megadeth&quot; and asserted that the band had created a great follow-up to their highly acclaimed &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; Jim Farber of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave the album a favorable review, saying it propelled the group &quot;right at the top of the thrash-rock heap&quot;. He concluded his review by saying, &quot;amid today&#x27;s narcoleptic pop scene, albums like &quot;So Far, So Good ... So What!&quot; offer a disruptive noise that&#x27;s welcome indeed&quot;. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, J. D. Considine felt that the record showed a &quot;genuine maturity&quot; for the band. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau reacted toward the album with tepid positivity, and wrote that Megadeth garnered &quot;its modest portions of profit and respect&quot; with their latest studio release. He praised &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, commenting that Mustaine covers the Sex Pistols &quot;like a champ&quot;.

Retrospective reviews, however, tend to be more critical of the album. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey criticized the album for lacking &quot;the conceptual unity and musical bite&quot; of its predecessor. According to him, the album &quot;wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile&quot;, citing the cover track as an example.
Conversely, Adrien Begrand from &quot;MSN Music&quot; opined that the record was &quot;somehow ignored&quot; in the band&#x27;s discography.

== Touring ==
The tour that followed the album&#x27;s release was the first to feature new band members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young. Bassist David Ellefson said that previous members Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland were tired of constantly being on the road and their departure was inevitable. He further revealed that drummer Behler was appointed shortly before because the band feared that Samuelson would not be able to continue touring. However, some problems occurred during the Australian leg of the tour. The band was forced to cancel some of these shows because of drug issues. Mustaine claimed that the group returned home because guitarist Young &quot;ran out of heroin&quot;, which Young denied, stating that it was Mustaine who wanted to go back to Los Angeles and seek rehabilitation. Both Young and Behler were eventually fired from the band in 1989.

Megadeth started performing the album&#x27;s songs live before the record was released. During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill at a number of European venues. The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Dio and Savatage for some shows in North America. They also headlined a European tour, with support from Testament and Sanctuary. Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival, but were dropped from the line-up after one show; Megadeth was replaced by Testament. Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure: &quot;We do a lot of shows and sell records by word-of-mouth&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; sold 400,000 copies one month after its release, becoming Megadeth&#x27;s fastest selling album at that point. The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth&#x27;s forthcoming emergence from the underground scene.

<doc id="60301" wikidata="Q14669" url="?curid=60301" title="Rust in Peace">
<text>Rust in Peace is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on September 24, 1990, by Capitol Records. It was the first Megadeth album to feature guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. The songs &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; were released as singles. A remixed and remastered version of the album featuring four bonus tracks was released in 2004.

Since its release, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; has often been named as one of the best thrash metal records of all time, by publications such as &quot;Decibel&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and listed in the reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. At the 1991 Foundations Forum, the album received a Concrete Foundations Award for &quot;Top Radio Album&quot; and the single &quot;Hangar 18&quot; won &quot;Top Radio Cut&quot; award.

==Background and production==
In 1988, Megadeth appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park in the UK, alongside Iron Maiden, Kiss, Helloween, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and David Lee Roth. The band performed to an audience of more than 100,000 people and was soon added to the &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; European tour, but dropped out after the first show due to bassist David Ellefson&#x27;s drug problems. Further issues within the band caused frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine to fire drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, and cancel their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. Nick Menza, previously Behler&#x27;s drum tech, was hired as the band&#x27;s new drummer. The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was initially offered the job before declining, as he requested that his Pantera brother, drummer Vinnie Paul, also be hired. Jeff Waters of Annihilator was also considered. Mustaine had asked original Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland to rejoin the band, with Poland tracking lead guitar parts on demo versions of all the songs that ended up on the studio album. According to Poland, he was &quot;99 percent going to join&quot; the band but was talked out of it by his manager. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band&#x27;s first stable line-up and, as recognized by fans, the &#x27;classic&#x27; Megadeth lineup.

The album title &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was inspired by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw on the back of a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: &quot;May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace&quot;. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth&#x27;s upcoming album. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was recorded at Rumbo Recorders with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; and UFO&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. The producer&#x27;s work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman&#x27;s guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they &quot;really didn&#x27;t make the record with [Clink]&quot; as at the time he was focused on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; – which were also being recorded at Rumbo – and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.

The album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; in 1986. It references &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. In addition to creating the album&#x27;s cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album&#x27;s two singles. The object Rattlehead is holding was confirmed by Mustaine to be a material resembling Kryptonite.

The men featured on the cover are, from left to right: an unidentified British representative, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, German President Richard von Weizsäcker, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and United States President George H. W. Bush.

==Composition==
The album features multiple lyrical themes: religion, politics and warfare, as well as Mustaine&#x27;s personal issues, such as his fight against drug and alcohol addiction, UFO conspiracy theories and even the Marvel Comics character Punisher.

The opening song, &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for &quot;The Cause&quot;, explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how &quot;The Cause&quot; sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were escorted in a bulletproof bus back to their hotel in Dublin after the show. This incident, along with Marvel&#x27;s Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song.

&quot;Rust in Peace... Polaris&quot;, addresses the topic of nuclear warfare, with &quot;Polaris&quot; referring to the Cold War-era Lockheed UGM-27 Polaris intercontinental ballistic missile. Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled &quot;Child Saint&quot;, was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1981–83). Menza proposed the concept for &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51. Musically, the song features twin guitar solos after the verse.

In 2017, more than 25 years after the album was released, Dave Mustaine revealed the majority of &quot;Holy Wars&quot; tabs on the web did not transcribe the main riff correctly, and posted the correct transcription himself.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was released on September 24, 1990, by Capitol Records. In 1994, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, along with the rest of Megadeth&#x27;s Capitol-released studio albums, was remixed and remastered in 2004.

Upon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it Megadeth&#x27;s most accomplished album, praising its &quot;instrumental virtuosity, thoughtful lyricism and punkish rage&quot;.

Robert Palmer of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album is demonstration of how far the &quot;nasty speed thrash&quot; concept can go without being &quot;formulaic and boring&quot;. Reviewing the album for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jim Farber described the music as &quot;sheer velocity, combined with dexterity&quot; and Mustaine&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;nihilistic whimsy&quot;. Mike Stagno from Sputnikmusic agreed that the songwriting was &quot;top notch&quot; on the album, as well as the fast and technical musicianship. He also spoke highly of Friedman&#x27;s and Mustaine&#x27;s guitar performance, calling them &quot;one of the most potent duos in the scene&quot;.

&quot;Spin&quot; reviewer Tom Nordlie praised the album, deeming it a &quot;mature, complex, surprisingly consonant and sparely produced album&quot;, and concluded that Rust in Peace &quot;never sleeps&quot;. Music journalist Kim Cooper also noted the album&#x27;s maturity and wrote that &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; &quot;transcended the hard rock genre and raised the bar to a whole new level&quot;. Another positive reaction came from &quot;Rock Hard&quot;, whose writer Holger Stratmann stated that the record was &quot;pure Megadeth&quot;, filled with &quot;razor sharp guitars&quot; and &quot;snotty vocals&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
In retrospective analysis, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; has been cited as having a large impact on its genre. Heavy metal magazine &quot;Decibel&quot; labeled the album as a &quot;genre-defining work&quot;, while &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that the record &quot;set a new standard for heavy metal in the 90s&quot;. IGN named &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; the fourth most influential heavy metal album of all time, commenting that the album &quot;displays Dave Mustaine&#x27;s finest writing ever&quot;. Additionally, Martin Popoff ranked it eleventh among the best heavy metal albums of all time. In a reader poll organized by MusicRadar in 2010, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was voted as the sixth best metal album ever. The MusicRadar staff explained that the record saw Megadeth moving &quot;into the big league&quot;, while staying true to their intricate sound and lyricism. In a list compiled by Chad Bowar of About.com, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was placed as the best heavy metal album of the 1990s and named a &quot;thrash masterpiece&quot;. The album was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.
The tracks &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; and &quot;Hangar 18&quot; have become staples of Megadeth&#x27;s live set, and are fan favorites. The guitar solo on &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; is considered to be one of the greatest solos in heavy metal music. In 2010, the band announced a 22-show North American tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;. The band performed the entire album at every show. Dates in South and Central America were later added to the tour, due to positive response from fans. In 2010, Shout! Factory released a live recording filmed on the Hollywood Palladium stop of the tour, entitled &quot;Rust in Peace Live&quot;. It was released on September 7, 2010, in Blu-ray, CD and DVD formats, and debuted at number 161 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the Billboard DVD charts.

&quot;Rust in Peace&quot; in its entirety was released as purchasable downloadable content in the rhythm game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, a part of their &quot;&quot;Rust in Peace&quot; Download Package&quot;. It was released a little more than a year after the release of &quot;Peace Sells...But Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; on the game&#x27;s download store. A cover version of &quot;Holy Wars&quot; by Steve Ouimette was featured in &quot;Rock Revolution&quot;. &quot;Holy Wars&quot; was also featured in &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;, while &quot;Hangar 18&quot; was featured in &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; and as downloadable content for &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;. Both songs have been described as amongst the most difficult songs in the series&#x27; history. &quot;Holy Wars&quot;, &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; were also released as downloadable content for &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot;

A sequel to &quot;Hangar 18&quot; titled &quot;Return to Hangar&quot; later featured on Megadeth&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;.

In 2015, satire website The Onion published an article titled &quot;Humanity Still Producing New Art As Though Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; Doesn&#x27;t Already Exist&quot;.

<text>Countdown to Extinction is the fifth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on July 14, 1992, through Capitol Records. It was the group&#x27;s second studio release to feature the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Ellefson and Nick Menza, with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album. The album features some of the band&#x27;s best known songs such as &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, and &quot;Skin o&#x27; My Teeth&quot;, which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact.

&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two, the band&#x27;s highest position ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album&#x27;s title track won the Humane Society&#x27;s Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.

In 2012, in recognition of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Megadeth kicked off a 20th anniversary tour in South America, playing the album in its entirety. In addition, a 20th anniversary special edition of the album was released in November 2012, and a live album featuring a performance of the full album was released in September 2013.

&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; marked the first absence of Megadeth&#x27;s mascot Vic Rattlehead in its album cover.

==Production and musical style==
&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; is Megadeth&#x27;s fifth studio album, and the second to feature the line-up of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Ellefson and Nick Menza. In an interview for &quot;Billboard&quot; at the time, Mustaine admitted that he fired past members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young because they resisted his pleas to seek rehabilitative counseling. He added that it was a &quot;major accomplishment&quot; that all four members of Megadeth contributed material to the album, unlike their earlier releases which were &quot;nearly all Mustaine&quot;. Mustaine also revealed that producer Max Norman had significant input to the album by making &quot;a lot of suggestions and a lot of great artistic ideas&quot;. However, Norman later accused Mustaine of attempting to steal some credit from him. Guitarist Marty Friedman said that unlike &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, the creation of this record was &quot;completely different&quot;. He further stated that the band had changed the songs &quot;a million times&quot; before recording them on demo and entering the studio.

The music for &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was written in two different sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, in the fall of 1991. The album was recorded in the first half of 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o&#x27;clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: &quot;There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing.&quot; The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; &quot;was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it&quot;. He also said that it didn&#x27;t take the band a long time to record the album because &quot;records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn&#x27;t quite as hard&quot;.

Following Metallica&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough in 1991 with the success of their eponymous album which saw them strip down their sound, Mustaine decided to follow suit, though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases. Drummer Nick Menza explained: &quot;Metallica has definitely opened the doors for other bands to step through. We&#x27;re obviously the next band to step through that doorway.&quot; Musically, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid-tempos into its traditional sound. Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band&#x27;s goal was to &quot;create music that had more of a groove to it,&quot; capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed by Friedman, and further assisted by the input of producer Norman. Author Thomas Harrison wrote that with this album, Megadeth&#x27;s music became &quot;more virtuosic than noisy and took the next step toward widespread acceptance&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Like its predecessor, many of the songs on the album have political and military undertones. However, the opening track &quot;Skin o&#x27; My Teeth&quot; was speculated being about suicide, a theme which differs from the rest of the album.
&quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, with lyrics written by Dave Mustaine inspired in part by the movie The Manchurian Candidate, details a story about a regular citizen as the head of a puppet regime, as the country is run by a phantom government. The song was noted by critics for its great social and philosophical impact. &quot;Architecture of Aggression&quot; explores the nature of global conflict; Mustaine revealed that the song was about former Iraq president Saddam Hussein, who was engaged in the Gulf War at the time. &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot; deals with economic concerns and social inequality. According to music critic Eduardo Rivaldivia, &quot;perhaps no other Megadeth song in history deals as directly and soberly&quot; with these issues. The song sampled then-U.S. president George H. W. Bush&#x27;s infamous &quot;Read my lips&quot; speech, making a statement about taxation endangering the &quot;American Dream&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the track, along with &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, for being &quot;socially conscious&quot; and described them as &quot;powerful statements for hard rockers&quot;.

The fifth track, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, shows Mustaine&#x27;s battle with his inner selves, which is presented throughout a conversational singing style. &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; was written during the second recording session and was released as the album&#x27;s third single. Its lyrical theme deals with paranoia. David Ellefson commented that the song&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;psychotically perfect&quot; and sounded like &quot;the inside of a crazed lunatic&#x27;s mind&quot;. The title track was inspired by environmental concerns about the future of the planet, as well as criticisms of trophy hunting and the negative impact that it has. The name was suggested by Nick Menza, who had read a story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine entitled &quot;The Countdown to Extinction&quot;. &quot;High Speed Dirt&quot; focuses on skydiving. &quot;Captive Honour&quot; is a song about prison and abuse that happens there, such as rape on new inmates, while &quot;Psychotron&quot; was written about the Marvel Comics character Deathlok. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Ashes in Your Mouth&quot;, concentrates on the negative aftermath of war. The longest song on the record, it is performed at intense tempo and features shredding guitar leads.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; received generally positive reaction from critics. &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that the album &quot;may just be the finest thrash metal album ever made, although purists may find it a bit too polished and easy to swallow&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that &quot;Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;&quot;. However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth&#x27;s sound on the album in response to Metallica&#x27;s commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine&#x27;s vocals as well as a number of the album&#x27;s tracks. Despite calling this effort &quot;Megadeth&#x27;s first step into the world of mainstream music&quot;, he also noted that &quot;the band still maintains its identity&quot;. Reflex described the sound as &quot;impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, brimming with killing riffs&quot;. They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record, saying &quot;Mustaine&#x27;s never sounded more confident, verbally and vocally&quot;.

Popmatters writer Craig Hayes opined that &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was &quot;either an exemplary illustration of nimble-fingered thrash metal that introduced Megadeth to a legion of new fans&quot; or &quot;an unimaginative, artistically cynical stab at arena-baiting commercial success&quot;. According to Greg Sandow from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;music has lost its former hurricane verve but keeps its crunch, and feels more rooted, even more melodic&quot;. Chad Bowar from About.com raved the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary edition, describing the songs as &quot;more straightforward&quot; and the lyrics predominantly being &quot;politically charged&quot;. Jon Hadusek, writing in Consequence of Sound, labeled &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; as Mustaine&#x27;s &quot;political record&quot; and said that the record &quot;saw Megadeth moving away from thrash metal and closer to generic hard rock, a sonic shift they would embrace on subsequent albums&quot;. In an unfavorable review, Karen Csengeri of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;while &quot;Countdown&quot; echoes the band&#x27;s earlier work thematically, it&#x27;s stylistically disappointing&quot;. However, the magazine would later rank the album 33rd on their 2017 &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; list. By contrast, Holger Stratmann of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; concluded that the disc is &quot;a compact album with a few strokes of genius&quot;. Reviewing the album&#x27;s deluxe edition for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, journalist Joel McIver eulogized it as a &quot;masterpiece of technical, melodic thrash&quot; and a showcase of Megadeth &quot;at their best and most coherent&quot;.

==Sales and impact==
&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was released on July 14, 1992, through Capitol Records and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 128,000 copies. It was prevented from entering the chart at number one because of Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27; long chart-topping reign with &quot;Some Gave All&quot;. The album was acknowledged as the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, and according to authors Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist, Megadeth &quot;reached the heights of popularity and critical acclaim&quot; with this particular record. Two years after its original release, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was certified double platinum and became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album&#x27;s title track won the Humane Society&#x27;s Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.

The record enjoyed similar chart success outside of the United States. It managed to peak within the top 5 on the charts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and charted for eight weeks on both of them. It also entered the top 10 on the Japanese and Norwegian albums chart, while it charted slightly lower in several other countries as well. It was eventually certified three times platinum from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 300,000 copies and received a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry for having a shipment of 300,000 copies. The album was also eventually certified Gold in Japan and sold 100,000 copies.

Asked how does he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: &quot;I think it&#x27;s timely and timeless at the same time, and I think that&#x27;s one of the most difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it&#x27;s heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic.&quot; In the liner notes of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that &quot;thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play.&quot; Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a &quot;seminal&quot; release and commented that it &quot;changed the game by preserving the band&#x27;s thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen&quot;. In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;&#x27;s &quot;status as a gateway metal album is indisputable&quot; and its &quot;popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon&quot;.

==Touring==
The group started the &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; tour in 1992 with Pantera, Suicidal Tendencies and White Zombie as the opening acts. They headlined the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 27 the same year, and continued with dates in Europe during the summer. The tour carried on throughout 1993, with the band making appearances on a number of large festivals. In January they performed in the United States with Stone Temple Pilots as the supporting act. Although these two bands had scheduled tour dates in Japan during the month of May, the dates were subsequently canceled. In June 1993, Megadeth played at the Milton Keynes National Bowl with Diamond Head and later opened for Iron Maiden and Metallica on their European tour. After finishing their major European tour, the band began a US tour which eventually ended on December 8, 1993.

Megadeth honored the 20-year jubilee of the album&#x27;s release with a headlining tour on which they played the record in its entirety. The tour began in September 2012 with live performances in South America, and continued the following two months with shows in North America. During this tour, three songs from the record (&quot;Architecture of Aggression&quot;, &quot;Psychotron&quot; and &quot;Captive Honour&quot;) had their live premiere, and a couple of others (&quot;This Was My Life&quot; and &quot;High Speed Dirt&quot;) have been performed for the first time in many years. David Ellefson shared his impressions from playing the set live with newer members Shawn Drover and Chris Broderick by saying that they &quot;executed [the songs] to 100% perfection&quot;. A live album which features a performance of the full album was released on September 24, 2013.

==Reissues==
In July 2004, Capitol Records released a remixed and remastered version of the album with four bonus tracks. The remixed edition was a part of the band&#x27;s reissued catalog during their tenure at Capitol. Dave Mustaine himself was in charge during the remixing process. In June 2006, two audiophile remasters of the album were released; an Ultradisc II Gold CD version by the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and a 180 gram vinyl 2LP version, both mixed by Mustaine. A 20th anniversary edition was released on November 6, 2012. This release features the original album on disc one, omitting the bonus tracks from the 2004 re-release. Disc two features a recording of the band&#x27;s performance at San Francisco&#x27;s Cow Palace in 1992, a show never before released in its entirety. Additionally, a 24&quot; x 36&quot; poster and four collectible postcards are included in the package. The liner notes have also been written by music journalist Kory Grow, and the reissue includes a poster and four postcards featuring head shots of each member from the album&#x27;s lineup.

<doc id="60303" wikidata="Q600584" url="?curid=60303" title="Youthanasia">
<text>Youthanasia is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on November 1, 1994, through Capitol Records. It is stylistically similar to their previous album, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992). The title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothes line, a direct reference to a line in the title track.

&quot;Youthanasia&quot; received positive reviews upon its release. It was commercially successful, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and in 1995 was certified platinum for shipping one million copies in the United States. A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27, 2004.

==Background and recording==
Megadeth&#x27;s previous studio release, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold-out arenas across North America, in addition to developing a strong following overseas. With &quot;Youthanasia&quot;, the band moved to a more mainstream sound.

It was a time of problems and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every two weeks or so, according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were &quot;outrageous emotional interventions&quot; in order to make the group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine&#x27;s creative control over a &quot;successful formula&quot;, so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona.

The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios (Tempe) in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May. This studio is often the location for scenes in the &quot;Evolver&quot; video. Producer Max Norman suggested that they build a new self-dedicated studio, in cooperation with the band, Capitol and Norman&#x27;s funding a modular studio was built in a warehouse in South Phoenix. Talking about the recording process, Mustaine said that &quot;Youthanasia&quot; was written solely in the studio. &quot;We weren&#x27;t playing any old, cataloged material. None of the past really influenced the new record.&quot; He mentioned that he gave &quot;more freedom&quot; to the other members and called the album &quot;very much a total band effort&quot;.

Of interest is that this was hoped to be the first album recorded solely on hard drives, rather than magnetic tape. Both Norman and Mustaine were believers in being on the cutting edge of technology, Norman had long been using computers to sample, tune and comp tracks. Digidesign was working on expanding Pro Tools from a single track to multitracking and it was hoped that as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Macintosh Quadra and with a great effort by all, it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used.

==Artwork and title==

The cover art by Hugh Syme features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, &quot;We&#x27;ve been hung out to dry&quot;. He explained that the title track &quot;was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about the young people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It&#x27;s like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose &#x27;Youthanasia&#x27;.&quot; The title is a combination of the words &quot;youth&quot; and &quot;euthanasia&quot;. Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting. The live version of the artwork is also seen in &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; music video.

Like its previous album &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is the second album to not feature the band&#x27;s mascot Vic Rattlehead on the front cover but on the back instead.

==Musical style==
&quot;Youthanasia&quot; was not a large stylistic departure from the band&#x27;s earlier recordings. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, from the drumbeat opening of &quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot; to the precise instrumentation of &quot;Train of Consequences&quot;, Megadeth delivered &quot;trademark aggressive rage &#x27;n&#x27; roll to powerful effect&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that even the slower songs such as &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; were tending toward &quot;lusty explosion&quot;. Authors Pete Prown and HP Newquist opined that lyrically, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; contained more thematic variations from Megadeth. They wrote that the record was musically diverse, from the &quot;slow-tempo acoustic lines&quot; of &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; to the &quot;breakneck riffing&quot; of &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; and &quot;Family Tree&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; found that Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;trademark crunchy riffs, thundering drums and bitter vocals&quot; were still present on the album, with the lyrics being more introspective.

Mike Stagno said that &quot;Youthanasia&quot; features &quot;a more traditional type of metal&quot;. He explained that even though the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is &quot;very scarce&quot; on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, progressive elements in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; felt that with &quot;Youthanasia&quot;, the band &quot;eroded their brilliant thrash to mid-paced chug&quot;. According to the band&#x27;s official website, &quot;&quot;Youthanasia&quot; marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album.&quot; Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then-guitarist Marty Friedman stated: &quot;We pretty much stick to our guns. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend. We don&#x27;t really change with the times.&quot; On the album&#x27;s genre, Mustaine said: &quot;It&#x27;s been called a thrash album, it&#x27;s been called a rock album, and it&#x27;s even been called an alternative album. To me it can only be called a Megadeth album. That should be enough.&quot;

==Release and reception==
The album was released on 1 November 1994 through Capitol Records. Promotion included the first official website for a band, &quot;Megadeth, Arizona&quot;, described by its conceiver, Robin Sloan Bechtel, as “a virtual cybertown in cyberspace&quot; where fans gathered in an online community that among other things offered news regarding Megadeth&#x27;s new album. A special promotional copy of the album was issued with an essay by suspense novelist Dean Koontz entitled &quot;Godzilla vs. Megadeth&quot;. A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27, 2004.

Three singles were released from &quot;Youthanasia&quot;: &quot;Reckoning Day&quot;, &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; and &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot;. The latter would later be re-recorded with Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia under the title &quot;À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)&quot;. This version was also released as a single, and included on &quot;United Abominations&quot; (2007).

===Critical reception===
The album received positive reviews upon its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for AllMusic, commented that, compared to &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; the album lacks focus. However, Erlewine suggested that the album&#x27;s production quality made up for that. He also commented favorably on &quot;Train of Consequences&quot;, calling out its &quot;jackhammer riffs&quot;. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic reviewed the album positively. Though noting that the album, like its predecessor, was a distinct move away from the sound heard on 1990s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, Stagno suggested that the lack of a fast-tempo is made up for by the catchiness of the tracks.

In a contemporary review, &quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Youthanasia&quot; has &quot;greater depth and breadth than its predecessors&quot;. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a brief review of the album saying that &quot;Youthanasia&quot; would &quot;impress, but not impact&quot;. Neil Arnold of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; named the record &quot;the last true Megadeth opus before the mid-to-late 90s slump&quot;. He further said that the album &quot;pales&quot; in comparison to the previous records, but still keeps the band in their element. Paul Corio, in a retrospective review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote that the album features &quot;metal-machine music&quot; that is &quot;calibrated to kill&quot;. He highlighted &quot;Elysian Fields&quot; and &quot;Victory&quot; as examples of Mustaine in his prime. Despite the outcry of some fans, Pete Prown called &quot;Youthanasia&quot; &quot;more than worthy follow-up&quot; to &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Youthanasia&quot; at number 29 on their list of &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;Youthanasia&quot; was commercially successful, debuting and peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 143,000 units sold in its first week. This marked the band&#x27;s second top five album, slightly below the number two peak of &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; in 1992, and the band would only reach such a landmark again in 2016 with &quot;Dystopia&quot;. Several weeks after its release, the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. The album also managed to enter into the top 10 in the United Kingdom and some other European countries as well. It eventually received a platinum certification from Music Canada and a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 100,000 and 60,000 copies, respectively. The singles &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; and &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; both charted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

==Touring and aftermath==
Megadeth toured heavily in support of &quot;Youthanasia&quot;. They started the tour in November 1994, with live performances in South America. The tour continued in 1995, with a number of opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: &quot;So far, the audiences have been really good and it seems to me that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been&quot;. The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.

In the middle of 1995, the band underwent changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band&#x27;s new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager would go on to be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there was a possibility of Megadeth performing the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record&#x27;s release.

<doc id="60305" wikidata="Q122282" url="?curid=60305" title="Hidden Treasures (EP)">
<text>Hidden Treasures is a compilation EP by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on July 18, 1995, via Capitol Records. The album features songs that originally appeared on film soundtracks and tribute albums. Four of the tracks were released as singles, and three have received Grammy Award nominations for Best Metal Performance. Despite having garnered mediocre or negative reviews, the material on the EP has been credited with helping expand the group&#x27;s MTV audience in the early 1990s.

==Background and songs==
&quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; is a rarities compilation that features songs that Megadeth had recorded for a number of projects, but had not released on one of the band&#x27;s studio albums. Most of these were contributions to film soundtracks. In 1989, Megadeth recorded a version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; for the soundtrack to the Wes Craven-directed horror film &quot;Shocker&quot;. It marks drummer Nick Menza&#x27;s recording debut with the band. The recording was released as a single and peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1990. &quot;Go to Hell&quot; appeared on the &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; soundtrack in 1991. The song features the same prayer, &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot;, used in &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; by Metallica, and can be heard at the beginning of the track.

The band contributed three songs to soundtracks in 1993. &quot;Angry Again&quot;, recorded during the sessions for &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and received a nomination for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at the 1993 Grammy Awards. The song has appeared on several of the band&#x27;s compilations. &quot;Breakpoint&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film. &quot;99 Ways to Die&quot; was recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;The Beavis and Butt-head Experience&quot; and released as a single and a music video. It was nominated in the &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; category at the 1995 Grammy Awards.

&quot;Diadems&quot; was released on the &quot;Demon Knight&quot; soundtrack in 1995. In addition to soundtrack contributions, the band submitted a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black&quot; in 1994. It was nominated for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at the 1996 Grammy Awards. &quot;Problems&quot; is a Sex Pistols cover and was previously unreleased.

==Release and reception==
While initially released in Europe as a bonus disc for a special edition of &quot;Youthanasia&quot;, &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; was released as a stand-alone EP in Japan and the US on July 18, 1995. It debuted at number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold 13,000 copies in its first week. By December 2005, &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; sold 286,000 copies in the United States. It also appeared on album chart in the UK, but did not achieve notable success. The album has gone out of print in the US, but was reissued in 2007 for the Japanese and European markets.

The EP has received generally mediocre reaction from critics. &quot;AllMusic&quot;&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the EP does not have many &quot;first-rate songs&quot; and that only &quot;99 Ways to Die&quot; made an impression. The &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; was dismissive of the EP; the staff reviewer commented that the album is worth hearing only for &quot;99 Ways to Die&quot;. Dean Golemis of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the album is &quot;typical Megadeth&quot; featuring &quot;fast-forward riffing&quot; and &quot;snooty snarling&quot; vocals. Carlos Ramirez from &quot;Noisecreep&quot; felt that the album contains many underrated songs that &quot;also deserve their time in the spotlight&quot; and highlighted the dueling guitar leads by Mustaine and Friedman featured in &quot;Go to Hell&quot;. Despite the negative reviews, material featured on the EP has been credited with helping expand the group&#x27;s MTV audience in the early 1990s.

<doc id="60306" wikidata="Q520040" url="?curid=60306" title="Cryptic Writings">
<text>Cryptic Writings is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. Released on June 17, 1997, through Capitol Records, it was the band&#x27;s last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His departure would mark the end of the band&#x27;s longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer Max Norman. The album features twelve tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in order to make the music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.

The album debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in October 1997 for shipping 500,000 copies in the United States. The first 500,000 copies of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; in the U.S. were released with silver background album cover. A remixed and remastered version, featuring four bonus tracks, was released in 2004. Seven years after its original release, the album sold 850,000 copies in the United States and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. The song &quot;Trust&quot; was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards and became the band&#x27;s highest charting song on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks.

== Background and recording ==
In 1992, Megadeth released &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, which contained songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted in strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994&#x27;s &quot;Youthanasia&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; followed a similar route, with the latter spawning four top 20 hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, said: &quot;I think a lot of our success now has to do with the fact that we&#x27;re willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don&#x27;t get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy. Fortunately, for us, our management educated us on how to study what&#x27;s current without losing our integrity and to keep on edge while staying at the forefront of what&#x27;s important right now.&quot;

According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it took the band a year to prepare the record &quot;from note one to mixing&quot;. A lot of the material was written during the tour and some of it afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn&#x27;t rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: &quot;Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to do things like that and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs.&quot;

Before the start of the recording sessions, bassist David Ellefson stated that the band doesn&#x27;t want their seventh studio album to sound like anything they have already recorded. Instrumentally, the band introduced a more melodic mix than the previous albums, filled with crunchy riffs and speedy guitar solos. In addition, Mustaine re-evaluated the band&#x27;s songwriting techniques, recasting some lyrics to better reflect the sales and radio airplay environment of then&#x27;s rock arena. According to him, many of the song&#x27;s lyrics were altered in order to make the music &quot;a little more inclusive of people who aren&#x27;t into dying and evil&quot;. Ellefson commented that this album was a natural progression in Megadeth&#x27;s sound. He further stated that they were not trying to leave behind their thrash metal and heavy metal roots, but to broaden their musical horizons.

==Artwork and release==
The symbol depicted on the cover is a veve, a voodoo sign. According to Ellefson, the original concept for the album&#x27;s cover was very different, however, it was changed at the last minute. According to Menza, &quot;The original album title was going to be &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;. The cover was supposed to be a girl holding a Kewpie with a bunch of pins in it... she&#x27;s stabbing the doll with a syringe in the chest. That didn&#x27;t fly.&quot; The title derives from the song &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; by The Searchers, used as incidental music in &quot;Use the Man&quot;. Aside from being a lyric, Ellefson stated that there was not really any correlation between the title and the music on the album. The first 500,000 copies of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; in the United States were released with an album cover featuring a silver background. These releases also included a Vic Rattlehead collectible card which promoted &quot;The Cryptic Writings Of Megadeth&quot;, an issue run by Chaos Comics. Later US pressings features the same artwork with a black background instead. The black background album cover is also featured in the remasters.

The album sold 75,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at number 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Four months after its release, the record was certificated gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping half million copies in the US, of which 383,000 were sold according to Nielsen Soundscan. Two years after its original release, the album sold 850,000 copies in the United States and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. However, &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; did not enjoy particular chart success on international level. It only managed to peak at number two on the Finnish Albums Chart, where it charted for eleven weeks. Elsewhere, it didn&#x27;t enter into the top 10. It eventually received a gold certification from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 50,000 copies.

A remixed and remastered version, featuring four bonus tracks, was released in 2004 through Capitol Records as part of the group&#x27;s reissued back catalogue. According to the liner notes of the remastered version of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, Dave Mustaine had to alter many lyrics at the request of their new manager, Bud Prager. The liner notes suggest that Mustaine was not a fan of the changes, but other interviews indicate the band actively sought and eventually accepted Prager&#x27;s advice for the album. &quot;I figured maybe this guy (Prager) could help me get that intangible number one record I wanted so badly&quot;, Mustaine wrote in the liner notes.

It is the first Megadeth album not to feature the band&#x27;s classic logo on the front cover, but it appears on the album&#x27;s remastered version.

== Composition ==
Mustaine pointed out that four of the album&#x27;s 12 tracks are &quot;fast, hard and crunchy&quot;. Referring to the musical direction of the album, MTV&#x27;s writer P.R. Flack noted that &quot;The Disintegrators&quot; and &quot;FFF&quot; were rooted in the thrash metal genre, and ranked them among the fastest tracks on the record. Neil Arnold of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; highlighted the tune &quot;Vortex&quot;, which according to him, features some of the album&#x27;s best guitar work. However, a number of songs, particularly &quot;I&#x27;ll Get Even&quot; and &quot;Use the Man&quot;, carried a more rock-oriented sound, which contributed to the album&#x27;s diverse style. Lyrically, the album does not have a distinct subject matter, but focuses on numerous themes instead. &quot;She-Wolf&quot; tells of a &quot;wicked temptress with mystic lips and lusting eyes.&quot; Mustaine has also stated that the song is about &quot;An ex-wife and an ex-friend.&quot; &quot;Mastermind&quot; has been stated by Mustaine as being about &quot;the computerization of the world.&quot;

&quot;Trust&quot; was released as the record&#x27;s lead single. The song was developed from &quot;Absolution&quot;, an instrumental track recorded on a demo during the studio sessions of their previous album. &quot;Trust&quot; peaked at number five on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, thus becoming the band&#x27;s highest charting song on that chart. It was nominated for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at the 1998 Grammy Awards. &quot;Almost Honest&quot; was the second single of the album, and like its predecessor, entered the top ten on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock chart, peaking at number eight. Mustaine stated that the song is about how people treat one another, which contains a message that &quot;it&#x27;s difficult for people to be honest&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Chuck Taylor commented that the song contains catchy hooks and the band&#x27;s &quot;signature guitar howl&quot; and classified it &quot;somewhere between Def Leppard and Bon Jovi&quot;. &quot;Use the Man&quot; and &quot;A Secret Place&quot; were released as the third and fourth single, respectively. &quot;Use the Man&quot; (which started with a snippet of The Searchers&#x27; &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;, which was removed in the 2004 remaster) is about drug addiction, while &quot;A Secret Place&quot; describes losing touch with reality. &quot;Have Cool, Will Travel&quot; is about school shootings; in the remastered version, a snippet of the schoolyard song &quot;The Wheels on the Bus&quot; was added to its introduction.

Three extended plays were released in support of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;. Two of these featured live recordings from the ensuing tour while the other was a studio EP which featured instrumental versions of several album tracks. The live releases were entitled &quot;Live Trax&quot; and &quot;Live Trax II&quot;, the first being released on June 30, 1998.

==Critical reception==
Music critics were divided on the record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for AllMusic, reacted unenthusiastically toward it. He criticized Mustaine&#x27;s ability to write more &quot;ambitious&quot; material and opined that the band &quot;sounds better playing thrash.&quot; However, Erlewine did admire the band&#x27;s desire to experiment with their sound. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more generous toward &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;. Reviewer Jon Wiederhorn commented that the album &quot;should thrill Metallica fans who felt screwed by that band&#x27;s thrashless 1996 album, &quot;Load&quot;.&quot; Dean Golemis of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; panned the album for being &quot;predictable and annoying&quot; and assumed that Megadeth were &quot;destined to follow Metallica&#x27;s leap into mainstream sounds&quot;. Author Thomas Harrison also noted the album for not making as much impact as their previous studio releases.

Consumable Online&#x27;s Simon Speichert wrote positively about the record, qualifying it as &quot;pure, solid heavy metal&quot;. He noted that the album contains various kinds of tunes and named it &quot;one of the best metal records of 1997&quot;. Neil Arnold from &quot;Metal Forces&quot; observed that &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; is not &quot;a bad record&quot;, though it comes &quot;pale&quot; in comparison to their 1994 opus &quot;Youthanasia&quot;. Arnold went on to comment that the album confirms Megadeth are &quot;no longer a thrash band&quot;. Wolfgang Schäfer, from the German metal magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot;, stated that &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; followed the musical direction of its predecessors. He described the album as a &quot;balanced mix of typical Megadeth rockers and some experimental songs&quot;. Shane Mehling of &quot;Decibel&quot; reflected that the &quot;nearly thrashless&quot; &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, alongside Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; (1997), left the &quot;metal community [...] trying to pick up the pieces&quot;.

==Touring==
Megadeth supported the album with a world tour that started in the summer of 1997. The Misfits were the opening act of these live shows, one of which was the band&#x27;s first all-acoustic performance that took place in Argentina. The following summer, the group participated in Ozzfest &#x27;98 for the dates in the United States. These live shows were the last for drummer Nick Menza, who was fired subsequently. Menza began to suffer knee problems and escalating pain during the tour. He was diagnosed with a tumor and underwent surgery which waylaid him briefly. However, the tumor was benign and Menza was eager to rejoin his bandmates, who had continued the tour with Jimmy DeGrasso. Although DeGrasso was hired as a temporary replacement, he stayed with the band for the recording of their next two studio albums. Menza stated that Mustaine had dismissed him from the band two days after his knee surgery via phone call telling him that his services &quot;were no longer needed&quot;. On the other hand, Dave Mustaine believed that Menza had lied about his injury.

==Track listing==
All songs written and composed by Dave Mustaine except where noted.

NOTE: – &quot;Reckoning Day&quot; &amp; &quot;Peace Sells&quot; were joined together as one track with the running length of 8:19.

<doc id="60307" wikidata="Q830813" url="?curid=60307" title="Risk (Megadeth album)">
<text>Risk is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on August 31, 1999, by Capitol Records, the band&#x27;s last album to be released by the label. The first Megadeth album since 1990 to feature a lineup change, &quot;Risk&quot; marks the studio debut of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso with the band, as well as the final appearance of longtime guitarist Marty Friedman, who announced his departure a year later. Meant to be a breakthrough on alternative rock radio, &quot;Risk&quot; received a mixed response because of the great deviation from the band&#x27;s traditional sound. The backlash ultimately resulted in the band returning to a heavier sound on their next album, &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;.

Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has blamed the record&#x27;s lack of success on the fact that it was released under the &quot;Megadeth&quot; moniker: &quot;if anybody else&#x27;s name was on &#x27;Risk&#x27;, it would have sold&quot;. The album debuted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. As with the rest of Megadeth&#x27;s studio records released by Capitol, the album was remixed and remastered in 2004, with several bonus tracks added. This reissue also featured a different cover.

==Background and release==
&quot;Risk&quot; followed the band&#x27;s 1997 release &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, which according to Nielsen Soundscan, had sold 850,000 copies and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. Referring to the upcoming record, Rob Gordon, a VP of marketing at Capitol Records, stated that &quot;before the last record, we&#x27;d maybe had one track at rock radio, and it would be over. With this record, like the last one, I think we&#x27;ll have four-plus again.&quot;

The title stems from a comment by Dave Mustaine&#x27;s former Metallica bandmate Lars Ulrich, who suggested to Mustaine that he should take more &quot;risks&quot; with his music. According to Mustaine, he was also encouraged to experiment by Marty Friedman&#x27;s desire to indulge in his pop sensibilities. On the other hand, newcomer Jimmy DeGrasso wanted to do a &quot;heavy record&quot;, unlike the rest of the band who wanted to try out something different. As bassist David Ellefson recalls, the band&#x27;s manager Bud Prager had told them that they needed &quot;to do something that will make all of their contemporaries knock themselves on the head and say, &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t we think of that&#x27;?&quot;. This decision resulted in mixed reviews for both the band and the album; a good portion did not favor the new sound and image, while others were more receptive to the band&#x27;s attempts at experimenting with their sound and trying something different.

Megadeth chose to produce the album once again with Dann Huff in Nashville, satisfied with the success of their previous record. The band started writing the songs right after finishing the tour in support of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;. It took them five to six weeks to write the songs, and they went to Nashville in January 1999 to record the album. The recording process lasted four months, and according to Ellefson, it was a &quot;long haul&quot;. Mixing on the album began April 23 and finished May 21 at Masterfonics in Nashville, Tennessee. The original American pressing of the album was released as an enhanced CD, and featured a brief documentary about the making of the album as bonus content. Several European editions of the album contained a &quot;No Risk Disk&quot; as a bonus item, featuring one song from each of Megadeth&#x27;s previous six major label albums. Lastly, the Japanese version of the album includes a bonus track, an instrumental cover version of the theme of the video game &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. In 2004, a remixed and remastered version of the album was released, featuring three bonus tracks, all different mixes of songs on the album. The cover for the remaster was noticeably different from the original, featuring a scene from the music video for &quot;Insomnia&quot;. Vic Rattlehead&#x27;s face can be seen on the mousetrap of this cover, while he did not appear on the original. In addition, a couple of tracks have slightly different song durations—some shorter, some longer—with the most noticeable one being &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There,&quot; which features an additional 53 seconds.

Like the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, it is the second Megadeth album not to feature the band&#x27;s classic logo on the front cover, but it appears on the album&#x27;s remastered version.

== Songs ==
Three singles were released in support of the album: &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot;, &quot;Breadline&quot;, and &quot;Insomnia&quot;. All three received music videos. Additionally, &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot; was featured in Jean-Claude Van Damme&#x27;s 1999 movie &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot;. Mustaine originally wrote the song hoping that it would be adopted at arenas nationwide as a new sports anthem. After its release as a single, the song has been broadcast during NHL games and pro wrestling events.

Jeff Treppel spoke positively about the album&#x27;s opener &quot;Insomnia&quot;, naming it &quot;one of the best Megadeth songs of the past 15 years&quot;. The song features swirling Middle Eastern strings, crunching guitar line and, according to Treppel, some of Mustaine&#x27;s most demented lyrics. Treppel further described &quot;Ecstasy&quot; as &quot;grunge ballad&quot; and noted that it sounds like a &quot;reject from &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;&quot;. He had mixed feelings about &quot;Seven&quot;, and observed &quot;The Doctor Is Calling&quot; like a tune that &quot;aims for creepy, but hits instead&quot;. By contrast, DeGrasso felt that &quot;The Doctor Is Calling&quot; along with &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; were &quot;definitely heavy songs&quot; with &quot;really dark lyrics on them&quot;. Ellefson described the tracks &quot;Breadline&quot; and &quot;Wanderlust&quot; as &quot;melodic&quot; with &quot;very modern-sounding&quot; grooves. Neil Arnold from &quot;Metal Forces&quot; opined that &quot;Breadline&quot; is &quot;as melodic and commercial as Megadeth gets&quot;, while noting that &quot;Wanderlust&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; are &quot;probably two of the band&#x27;s most underrated songs&quot;.

All of the released singles charted on the Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Chart, with &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Breadline&quot; breaking into the Top 10. Aside from just being released as a conventional single, &quot;Breadline&quot; was also released as its own EP in Japan featuring several versions of the song, and remixes of other songs from &quot;Risk&quot; and Megadeth&#x27;s back catalog. After leaving Megadeth, Friedman would later cover this song on his solo album &quot;Future Addict&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
The album received a mixed response from music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s reviewer Steve Huey gave a sympathetic, if not exactly favorable, review of the remixed and remastered 2004 pressing of &quot;Risk&quot;. Huey stated that the album had &quot;aged gracefully,&quot; compared to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot; (1996) and &quot;ReLoad&quot; (1997). However, he did note that the band had lost their edge on the album. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Laura Morgan compared &quot;Insomnia&quot; to &quot;Broken&quot;-era Nine Inch Nails and gave the album a B−, though she criticized Mustaine&#x27;s vocal performance on the album. &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the album three stars out of five and noted that the album &quot;had its moments&quot;. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, taking into account that the album has a different appeal, was somewhat positive in his review. Stagno cited the first few tracks as the album&#x27;s &quot;harder edge&quot;. However, he noted that some of the following softer tracks were &quot;standout tracks&quot; as well. Stagno did note, however, that some of the emotion on the album was &quot;cheesy&quot;. Amy Sciarretto of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; noted that &quot;Risk&quot; marked another significant change in Megadeth&#x27;s sound and called it a &quot;logical stylistic progression&quot; from their previous album. According to her, Mustaine&#x27;s &quot;biting lyrics&quot; and &quot;power riffs&quot; were toned down, finding Megadeth &quot;traveling out of thrash metal territory&quot;. Steven Wells of &quot;NME&quot; panned the album, giving it a 0/10 score and saying that the album was the American equivalent of the retro stylings of Travis and Kula Shaker, as well as calling the album &quot;corporate mock rock&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Jeff Treppel from &quot;Decibel&quot; wrote that &quot;Risk&quot; was &quot;definitely Megadeth&#x27;s most adventurous record&quot; and characterized it as a &quot;decent hard rock album that should have never been put out under the Megadeth name&quot;. Dave Mustaine has since expressed that, although he believes that &quot;Risk&quot; is a great record, it &quot;should not have had the name Megadeth on it, because if anybody else&#x27;s name was on &#x27;Risk,&#x27; it would have sold&quot;. However, Mustaine has also stated that &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot; was &quot;probably the dumbest&quot; song that the band has ever recorded and said that he was &quot;not too fond of&quot; it.

When speaking to Eddie Trunk on his &quot;Trunk Nation LA Invasion: Live from the Rainbow Bar and Grill&quot; podcast in late November 2018, Mustaine said that the reason for &quot;Risk&quot; was him &quot;capitulating to Marty&#x27;s desires to be more of an alternative band, and we kept slowing down and slowing down and slowing down.&quot; He would again mention that if the album was released under a different name, it would&#x27;ve sold well, but that &quot;People wanted a Megadeth record. They didn&#x27;t wanna see Dave bending over backwards to keep Marty Friedman happy, &#x27;cause Marty wanted us to sound like fucking Dishwalla.&quot; Mustaine says he doesn&#x27;t regret making &quot;Risk&quot; or the song &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot;, and that he wanted Friedman and Nick Menza to be happy and remain in the band, &quot;And after a while, I just figured, &#x27;I don&#x27;t need this shit.&#x27; And Marty went this way, Nick went that way, and we just all kind of broke up.&quot; Additionally, Mustaine would later state that he believed &quot;Wanderlust&quot; to be one of the best songs he had ever written, noting the song&#x27;s country rock influenced style.

Friedman says that he has no regrets about &quot;Risk&quot;, and that &quot;anything that needed to be said from me about that was probably said at the time. I haven&#x27;t even thought about that since then, so I couldn&#x27;t give you an intelligent answer. I&#x27;m barely thinking about what I did yesterday, much less back then.&quot; He would also say that everybody involved in the album &quot;was doing the best that they possibly could&quot; and assured that &quot;anything was done with the best of intentions and the hardest work.&quot;

<doc id="60309" wikidata="Q283557" url="?curid=60309" title="The World Needs a Hero">
<text>The World Needs a Hero is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on May 15, 2001, by Sanctuary Records. After the critical and commercial failure of the previous album &quot;Risk&quot; (1999), &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; represented a change back to a heavier musical direction. Subsequently, the album charted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upon release.

After parting with former label Capitol Records, the album was the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be released by Sanctuary. It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, the last to feature bassist David Ellefson until &quot;Thirteen&quot; (2011), the only one to feature guitarist Al Pitrelli, and the last one before Megadeth&#x27;s brief disbandment in 2002. It is also the first album to feature the band&#x27;s mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover since &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990), and the first to utilize Megadeth&#x27;s classic logo since &quot;Youthanasia&quot; (1994).

At 57 minutes and 49 seconds, &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; was Megadeth&#x27;s longest album until &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot; (2022). It also contains Megadeth&#x27;s longest song, &quot;When&quot;, clocking in at 9 minutes and 14 seconds.

== Background and production ==
In 1999, Megadeth released their eighth studio album, &quot;Risk&quot;. The album was noteworthy for being a drastic musical departure for the band, and the culmination of the band&#x27;s increasing attempts for mainstream success throughout the 1990s, a trend starting with &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992). &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; marks a stylistic transition towards the band&#x27;s thrash metal roots. Furthermore, the album had been touted by the band as an &quot;antidote&quot; to &quot;Risk&quot; in a press release. However, the album has been noted by several music critics as still retaining some commercial feel from previous albums.

According to frontman Dave Mustaine, the album title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When asked about the matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that &quot;People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos and I think people wanna be able to go &#x27;they may not be popular, but they&#x27;re MY band.&#x27;&quot; Mustaine went on to say that many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.

In another interview, Mustaine offered a more straightforward interpretation of the album title. Commenting on negative stories in the news, such as wars and natural disasters, Mustaine inferred that the world at that time was in need of a hero to solve various problems around the planet.

The album cover by Hugh Syme shows Megadeth&#x27;s mascot Vic Rattlehead bursting out of Mustaine&#x27;s chest, reminiscent of the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;.

== Songs ==
The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;Moto Psycho&quot;, and a video was also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, spending a lot of time on the road. &quot;Dread and the Fugitive Mind&quot; was released on the &quot;Capitol Punishment&quot; compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth&#x27;s former label, Capitol Records. The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Disconnect&quot;, is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and &quot;the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am.&quot; &quot;Coming Home&quot; was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the &quot;Warchest&quot; box set and the 2019 reissue of the album. Mustaine has stated that concept for &quot;Promises&quot; is &quot;prejudiced relationships,&quot; such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, &quot;it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can&#x27;t be together in this life, maybe we&#x27;ll make it in the next.&quot;

When asked if &quot;Recipe for Hate... Warhorse&quot; was written about any particular person, Mustaine said that there were &quot;a whole bunch of people that&#x27;d probably deserve that song,&quot; but didn&#x27;t single out anyone in particular. &quot;Silent Scorn&quot; is an instrumental song which is often played over the sound system at concerts; this can be heard on the band&#x27;s live album &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; (2002) right after the final song in the set, &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot;. &quot;Return to Hangar&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Hangar 18&quot; from &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;; the captive aliens from the first song escape and kill their captors. On the live albums &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; and &quot;That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires&quot; (2007) it is played back-to-back with &quot;Hangar 18&quot;. The main riff and structure of &quot;When&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing number, is reminiscent of &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; by Diamond Head, which Mustaine said was intentional. &quot;When&quot; is also Megadeth&#x27;s longest song to date, clocking in at 9 minutes and 14 seconds.

== Release and promotion ==
The album was released on May 15, 2001, in the United States and sold 61,000 copies in its first week of release, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 16. The album sold another 25,000 copies in its second week, falling to number 59. The album also charted in Poland (#17), Germany (#36), Sweden (#38), and Switzerland (#55) as well. By December 2005, &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; had sold about 219,000 copies in the United States. Megadeth commenced a tour to promote the album on June 8, 2001, at Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, where they were featured alongside acts such as AC/DC, The Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age. After Mustaine suffered an arm injury that prevented him from playing guitar, Megadeth temporarily disbanded in 2002. Six of the album&#x27;s songs appeared on &quot;Still Alive... and Well?&quot;, a 2002 compilation combining studio tracks from &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;, with six live tracks.

A remastered version of this album, along with &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;, was re-issued on CD, vinyl and digital download on February 15, 2019. The remastered edition includes an additional bonus track &quot;Coming Home&quot; and revised album artwork.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; received mixed to positive reviews and was regarded as a &quot;return to roots&quot; by critics. Writing for AllMusic, reviewer Steve Huey opined that Mustaine &quot;tries to conjure memories&quot; of &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, but while comparing &quot;Dread and the Fugitive Mind&quot; to &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; (from &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;) said that much of the material &quot;feels like rehashed Megadeth&quot;. Huey critiqued the production as still being &quot;radio-friendly&quot; and said because of that, the group &quot;never quite kicks up the fury or flash of past glories&quot;. Neil Arnold of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; wrote that even though the album was &quot;lacking the menace of the band’s earlier work&quot;, it was still a more accomplished effort than the previous record. He concluded that Megadeth were &quot;clearly opting for melody over aggression&quot;, albeit rarely breaking into &quot;thrash mode&quot;.

Meanwhile, reviewer Greg Pratt of &quot;Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles&quot; was more sympathetic towards the album. Pratt, after briefly critiquing the lack of a thrashy sound, positively compared the record to &quot;Youthanasia&quot; (1994) and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992). Additionally, he commented that even in the absence of longtime members Nick Menza and Marty Friedman, that the band still sounded good. Pratt reacted positively to a number of the album&#x27;s songs, but cited &quot;Recipe for Hate... Warhorse&quot; as being the album&#x27;s &quot;most intense moment&quot;. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic had mixed feelings about the music on the record. While Stagno noted that the album was advertised as a return towards the band&#x27;s roots, he explained that those who were hoping for an album in the style of the band&#x27;s first four records would be disappointed. Stagno ultimately defined the album as &quot;more of an all-out metal record&quot;.

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; described the album as &quot;sluggish&quot; and &quot;retrograde&quot; and called it a &quot;step back for the band&quot;. &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot;″s John Engels felt that the void left by former guitarist Marty Friedman was successfully filled by Al Pitrelli. However, he noted that the album occasionally sounds repetitive, and criticized a number of songs for their &quot;childish&quot; lyrics. Friedman stated he was &quot;a little disappoint[ed]&quot; by the album. Friedman specifically singled out the album&#x27;s cover for criticism, though he also commented that he thought that the music was &quot;very well done&quot;.

<text>Whit, or, Isis amongst the unsaved is a novel by the Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1995. Isis Whit, a young but important member of a small, quirky cult in Scotland, narrates. The community suspects that Isis&#x27; cousin Morag is in danger, and sends Isis out to help.

==Plot summary==

Isis, otherwise The Blessed Very Reverend Gaia-Marie Isis Saraswati Minerva Mirza Whit of Luskentyre, Beloved Elect of God III, is the 19-year-old granddaughter and designated spiritual heir of Salvador Whit, patriarch of the Luskentyrians. They are a religious cult who live in a commune in Stirlingshire and reject most technology. They run their lives according to a collection of beliefs and rituals &quot;revealed&quot; to Salvador after he washed ashore on Harris in the Western Isles and &quot;married&quot; two young Asian ladies (Aasni and Zhobelia Asis). (Haggis pakora becomes a staple of the cult&#x27;s cuisine.)

The novel opens shortly before the Luskentyrian Festival of Love, held every four years, about nine months before every leap year day (29 February). The Luskentyrians believe that those born on that day have special power. This includes Isis herself, Elect of God, and expected to take over leadership of the cult.

The bulk of the novel tells of Isis&#x27; voyages in the world of &quot;the Unsaved&quot; (also known as &quot;the Obtuse&quot;, &quot;the Wretched&quot;, &quot;the Bland&quot; and &quot;the Asleep&quot;), through Scotland and southern England in search of Morag, who is feared to have rejected the cult.

While searching for her cousin, Isis meets Rastas, policemen, white power skinheads, and other characters of a sort she has never encountered before, and tells the story of the cult and the rationale behind its rules. Isis&#x27; maternal grandmother, Yolanda, a feisty Texan woman, appears and lends her support to Isis&#x27; quest. Isis&#x27; friend Sophi, although not part of the cult, is very close to her. Isis meets her whenever she goes to her house to use the Luskentyrian method of free (if laborious) telephone communication, using coded rings.

Returning with enhanced maturity and a lot more information, Isis must decide what to tell the other members of the cult.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Like many of Banks&#x27; characters, from Frank Cauldhame in &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; to Prentice McHoan in &quot;The Crow Road&quot;, Isis engages in a half-unconscious search for knowledge which will inevitably turn her world upside down. The novel thus becomes a type of &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;.

Banks portrays the cult largely sympathetically, especially given its publication shortly after the Waco Siege in 1993 (which Yolanda discusses within the novel). Banks ensures that the Luskentyrian theology (in which Isis fervently believes at the start of the book) has coherence and consistency, even as events cause her to start to doubt.

Banks has called it:

a book about religion and culture written by a dedicated evangelical atheist — I thought I was very kind to them... Essentially, Isis makes the recognition that the value of the Luskentyrian cult is in their community values rather than their religious ones. She recognises that efficiency isn&#x27;t everything, that people not profit are what matters.

<doc id="60311" wikidata="Q917655" url="?curid=60311" title="Rude Awakening (Megadeth album)">
<text>Rude Awakening is the first live album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. The album was released by Sanctuary Records in 2002, and is the last release before the band broke up in 2002. It was released in both CD and DVD formats.

The album was originally going to be recorded live at a concert in Argentina, but due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the band decided to record it live in the United States.

Tracks on the album are taken from two live concerts, performed two nights in a row in November 2001. The first night was at the Rialto Theater in Tucson, Arizona, followed the next day by an almost identical performance (to ensure clean audio and video footage, and for a variety of editing options), at the Web Theater in Phoenix, Arizona. Dave Mustaine dedicated the performance of &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; to the victims of the September 11th attacks and mentions this before performing it. Two previously unreleased tracks from the concert, &quot;The Conjuring&quot; and &quot;Time: The Beginning&quot;/&quot;Use the Man&quot; were released on &quot;Still Alive... and Well?&quot; (which also features &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot;, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; and &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot;). &quot;Silent Scorn&quot; can be heard as a tape outro for the band during &quot;Holy Wars&quot;.

The tracks on the DVD are all from the second show at the Web Theater in Phoenix, Arizona on November 17, 2001. For the bonus features of the DVD they used recordings from the show in Tucson, Arizona,

This is the only Megadeth album which does not include the band logo or title on the immediate cover. It is located on the side bar of the album instead. The album&#x27;s cover was designed by graphic designer Storm Thorgerson (noted for his work with Pink Floyd) and Peter Curzon.

This was the end of this line-up of the band. Al Pitrelli and Jimmy DeGrasso played their final show. Dave Ellefson left the band because he wasn&#x27;t satisfied with his share of the band&#x27;s earnings. In 2010 he returned to the band. The DVD was certified gold in the US and Canada.

==Reception==
Brian O&#x27;Neill of AllMusic rated Rude Awakening a 3 out of 5, opining that, while he believes the album is &quot;fraught with&quot; limitations, it is &quot;a far better encapsulation of the band&#x27;s career to date than the spotty &quot;Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years&quot; compilation.&quot;

The album won a 2002 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Compilation/Live Album of the Year. Since it was generally believed to be Megadeth&#x27;s swan song at the time (until their reformation in 2004), the magazine stated, &quot;Megadeth&#x27;s farewell gets the recognition it deserves.&quot;

<doc id="60315" wikidata="Q217495" url="?curid=60315" title="Iris Murdoch">
<text>Dame Jean Iris Murdoch ( ; 15 July 1919 – 8 February 1999) was an Irish and British novelist and philosopher. Murdoch is best known for her novels about good and evil, sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her first published novel, &quot;Under the Net&quot; (1954), was selected in 1998 as one of Modern Library&#x27;s 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Her 1978 novel &quot;The Sea, The Sea&quot; won the Booker Prize. In 1987, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to literature. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Murdoch twelfth on a list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

Her other books include &quot;The Bell&quot; (1958), &quot;A Severed Head&quot; (1961), &quot;An Unofficial Rose&quot; (1962), &quot;The Red and the Green&quot; (1965), &quot;The Nice and the Good&quot; (1968), &quot;The Black Prince&quot; (1973), &quot;Henry and Cato&quot; (1976), &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Pupil&quot; (1983), &quot;The Good Apprentice&quot; (1985), &quot;The Book and the Brotherhood&quot; (1987), &quot;The Message to the Planet&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Green Knight&quot; (1993).

As a philosopher, Murdoch&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;The Sovereignty of Good&quot; (1970). She was married for 43 years, until her death, to the literary critic and author John Bayley.

==Life==
Murdoch was born in Phibsborough, Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice (née Richardson, 1899–1985) and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a civil servant, came from a mainly Presbyterian sheep farming family from Hillhall, County Down. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in King Edward&#x27;s Horse and served in France during the First World War before being commissioned as a Second lieutenant. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle-class Church of Ireland family in Dublin. Iris Murdoch&#x27;s parents first met in Dublin when her father was on leave and were married in 1918. Iris was the couple&#x27;s only child. When she was a few weeks old the family moved to London, where her father had joined the Ministry of Health as a second-class clerk. She was a second cousin of the Irish mathematician Brian Murdoch.

Murdoch was brought up in Chiswick and educated privately, entering the Froebel Demonstration School in 1925 and attending Badminton School in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938, she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, with the intention of studying English, but switched to &quot;Greats&quot;, a course of study combining classics, ancient history, and philosophy. At Oxford she studied philosophy with Donald M. MacKinnon and attended Eduard Fraenkel&#x27;s seminars on &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. She was awarded a first-class honours degree in 1942. After leaving Oxford she went to work in London for HM Treasury. In June 1944, she left the Treasury and went to work for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). At first, she was stationed in London at the agency&#x27;s European Regional Office. In 1945, she was transferred first to Brussels, then to Innsbruck, and finally to Graz, Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.

From 1947 to 1948, Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at Newnham College, Cambridge. She met Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his Trinity College professorship before she arrived. In 1948 she became a fellow of St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she taught philosophy until 1963. From 1963 to 1967, she taught one day a week in the General Studies department at the Royal College of Art.

In 1956, Murdoch married John Bayley, a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at the University of Oxford, whom she had met in Oxford in 1954. The unusual romantic partnership lasted more than forty years until Murdoch&#x27;s death. Bayley thought that sex was &quot;inescapably ridiculous&quot;. Murdoch in contrast had &quot;multiple affairs with both men and women which, on discomposing occasions, [Bayley] witnessed for himself&quot;. Notably she had a long and turbulent love relationship with writer Brigid Brophy.

Iris Murdoch&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Under the Net&quot;, was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first monograph about Jean-Paul Sartre published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She was awarded honorary degrees by Durham University (DLitt, 1977), the University of Bath (DLitt, 1983), University of Cambridge (1993) and Kingston University (1994), among others. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982.

The house at 30 Charlbury Road where she lived with her husband from 1989 to her death has an Oxfordshire blue plaque. Her last novel, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, was published in 1995. Iris Murdoch was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1997 and died in 1999 in Oxford. There is a bench dedicated to her on the grounds of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she used to enjoy walking. Dublin City Council and the Irish postal service marked the centenary of Murdoch&#x27;s birth in 2019 by unveiling a commemorative plaque and postage stamp at her birthplace.

==Work==

===Philosophy===
For some time, Murdoch&#x27;s influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. Martha Nussbaum has argued for Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;transformative impact on the discipline&quot; of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory &quot;thinginess&quot; of life shapes moral sensibility). Because as Calley A. Hornbuckle puts, “For Murdoch, the most essential kind of knowledge is the knowledge that other people exist”.

Although first a student, and later a lecturer and scholar, of 20th century British analytic moral philosophy, Murdoch rejected most of what was characteristic of that tradition. With the rise of anti-metaphysical empiricism in general, and logical positivism in particular, emotivists like A. J. Ayer and prescriptivists like R. M. Hare settled the good independently of active cognitive practices and therefore not something to be attained by them. In The Sovereignty of Good, Murdoch argues that such a criterion of reality follows from the adoption of an &quot;uncriticized conception of science&quot;. Such detachment from personal immersion in the reality of moral life was incompatible with her metaphysical commitments. Lawrence Blum concludes from such considerations that &quot;[s]he is thus a &#x27;moral realist&#x27;, &#x27;moral objectivist&#x27; and &#x27;moral cognitivist&#x27;[...].&quot;

In a recent survey of Murdoch&#x27;s philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch&#x27;s moral philosophy, including a &quot;moral realism or &#x27;naturalism&#x27;, allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti‐scientism; a rejection of Humean moral psychology; a sort of &#x27;particularism&#x27;; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or &#x27;seeing&#x27; moral facts.&quot; The reasons for this are unclear, but the Scottish literary critic, G. S. Fraser notes that, in the late 1940s, the philosophers who were then occupying Murdoch&#x27;s attention were late Victorian British idealists, such as T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. Broackes also notes that Murdoch&#x27;s influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams. She sent copies of her earlier novels to Anscombe, but there is nothing in Anscombe&#x27;s writing which reflects any of these.

Her philosophical work was influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of &#x27;attention&#x27;), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. From this perspective, Murdoch&#x27;s work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein (&#x27;early&#x27; and &#x27;late&#x27;). Her most central parable, which appears in &quot;The Sovereignty of Good&quot;, asks us (in Nussbaum&#x27;s succinct account), &quot;to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realises, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say &#x27;coarse,&#x27; she will say, and see, &#x27;spontaneous.&#x27; Where she is inclined to say &#x27;common,&#x27; she will say, and see, &#x27;fresh and naive.&#x27; As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D.&quot; This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D &quot;justly or lovingly&quot;. The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the &quot;inner&quot; life to moral action. Seeing another correctly can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.

===Fiction===
Her novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, George Eliot, and Proust, besides showing an abiding love of Shakespeare. There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of &quot;The Black Prince&quot; (1973) is very different from the early comic works &quot;Under the Net&quot; (1954) or &quot;The Unicorn&quot; (1963). &quot;The Unicorn&quot; can be read as a sophisticated Gothic romance, or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. &quot;The Black Prince&quot;, for which Murdoch won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, is a study of erotic obsession, and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious &quot;editor&quot; of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur. Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously &quot;knowing&quot; children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male &quot;enchanter&quot; who imposes his will on the other characters—a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the Nobel laureate Elias Canetti.

Murdoch was awarded the Booker Prize in 1978 for &quot;The Sea, the Sea&quot;, a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart. It was dedicated to archaeologist Rosemary Cramp, who had been a student at St Anne’s. An authorised collection of her poetic writings, &quot;Poems by Iris Murdoch&quot;, appeared in 1997, edited by Paul Hullah and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels &quot;An Unofficial Rose&quot; and &quot;The Bell&quot;. J. B. Priestley&#x27;s dramatisation of her 1961 novel &quot;A Severed Head&quot; starred Ian Holm and Richard Attenborough.

In 1988 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Murdoch its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of her life&#x27;s work. In 1997, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for &quot;a Lifetime&#x27;s Distinguished Service to Literature&quot;.

Harold Bloom wrote in his 1986 review of &quot;The Good Apprentice&quot; that &quot;no other contemporary British novelist&quot; seemed of her &quot;eminence&quot;. A. S. Byatt called her &quot;a great philosophical novelist&quot;. James Wood wrote in &quot;How Fiction Works&quot;: &quot;In her literary and philosophical criticism, she again and again stresses that the creation of free and independent characters is the mark of a great novelist; yet her own characters never have this freedom.&quot; He stressed that some authors, &quot;like Tolstoy, Trollope, Balzac and Dickens&quot;, wrote about people different from themselves by choice, whereas others, such as &quot;James, Flaubert, Lawrence, Woolf&quot;, have more interest in the self. Wood called Murdoch &quot;poignant&quot;, because she spent her whole life writing in the latter category, while she struggled to fit herself into the former.

==Political views==
Murdoch won a scholarship to study at Vassar College in the US in 1946, but was refused a visa because she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years. In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the McCarran Act, which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country. In a 1990 &quot;Paris Review&quot; interview, she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see &quot;how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form&quot;.

Aside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the sensitive aspect of Murdoch&#x27;s political life that has attracted interest. Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch did not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin. Biographer Peter Conradi wrote: &quot;No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. Iris&#x27;s Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish ... [But] Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American&quot;. Conradi notes record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in &quot;The Red and the Green&quot;, and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel, while broad of sympathy, is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Murdoch stated &quot;[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I&#x27;m afraid.&quot; In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt &quot;unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred&quot; and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that &quot;the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick. They just couldn&#x27;t help sympathising with the IRA, like Americans do. A mad bad world&quot;.

==Biographies and memoirs==
Peter J. Conradi&#x27;s 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers. It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her Gifford Lectures to her death. The book was well received. John Updike commented: &quot;There would be no need to complain of literary biographies [...] if they were all as good&quot;. The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was and what her politics were. Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi&#x27;s interest in Murdoch&#x27;s achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism, &quot;The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch&#x27;s Works&quot; (Macmillan, 1986; HarperCollins, 2001). He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in &quot;Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me&quot; (Short Books, 2005). Conradi&#x27;s archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch&#x27;s Oxford library, is held at Kingston University.

An account of Murdoch&#x27;s life with a different ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book &quot;Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her&quot;. The work was described by Galen Strawson in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;mischievously revelatory&quot; and labelled by Wilson himself as an &quot;anti-biography&quot;. 

David Morgan met Iris Murdoch in 1964, when he was a student at the Royal College of Art. His 2010 memoir &quot;With Love and Rage: A Friendship with Iris Murdoch&quot;, describes their lifelong friendship.

John Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. &quot;Iris: A Memoir&quot; was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called &quot;Elegy for Iris&quot;. A sequel entitled &quot;Iris and Her Friends&quot; was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in Richard Eyre&#x27;s film &quot;Iris&quot; (2001), based on Bayley&#x27;s memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In her centenary year, 2019, a collection of unpublished memoirs was published by Sabrestorm Press, entitled &quot;Iris Murdoch: A Centenary Celebration&quot;, edited by Miles Leeson, who directs the Iris Murdoch Research Centre at the University of Chichester, UK.

<doc id="60328" wikidata="Q130742" url="?curid=60328" title="Alanis Morissette">
<text>Alanis Nadine Morissette ( ; born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian and American singer. Known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting, she became a cultural phenomenon during the mid 1990s and early 2000s. Morissette has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making her one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including a Brit Award, seven Grammy Awards, fourteen Juno Awards, and nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and a Tony Award.

Morissette began her music career in Canada in the early 1990s with two dance-pop albums: &quot;Alanis&quot; (1991) and &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (1992). After relocating to Los Angeles, she released the alternative rock album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995), which became one of the best-selling albums of all time and has appeared on several all-time lists. She continued this success with her next album &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; (1998), which saw her adapt an experimental sound and was highly anticipated. She served as the sole producer of her fifth album &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; (2002), and took on further creative control and production duties. She has continued her career with the subsequent albums &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; (2004), &quot;Flavors of Entanglement&quot; (2008), &quot;Havoc and Bright Lights&quot; (2012), &quot;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; (2022).

Morissette holds the record for the most number ones on the weekly &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart among female soloists, group leaders, or duo members. Her first three internationally released studio albums topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, and her next four albums peaked within the top 20. Her singles &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;, &quot;Uninvited&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot;, and &quot;Hands Clean&quot;, reached top 40 in major charts around the world. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deemed her the &quot;queen of alt-rock angst&quot;, and VH1 ranked her the 53rd-greatest woman in rock and roll. In 2005, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Alanis Nadine Morissette was born on June 1, 1974, at Riverside Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Georgia Mary Ann ( Feuerstein) and Alan Richard Morissette. Her older brother, Chad (born 1971), is an entrepreneur, and her twin brother, Wade (12 minutes older), is a musician. Their father is of French and Irish descent, while their mother, who fled Hungary in 1956 due to the failed anti-Soviet uprising, has Jewish ancestry; on a 2024 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Morissette stated that her parents had never told the siblings about their Jewish ancestry, which she did not discover until her late 20s.

In 1977, the family moved to Lahr in what was then West Germany, where Morissette&#x27;s parents started working as teachers at the local CAF base. They returned to Ottawa in 1980, and Morissette began taking dance lessons the next year. Morissette had a Catholic upbringing. She attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school and Immaculata High School for seventh and eighth grades; she appeared on the children&#x27;s television sketch comedy &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; for five episodes while attending the former. Morissette then attended and graduated from Glebe Collegiate Institute.

== Career ==
=== 1986–1993: &quot;Alanis&quot; and &quot;Now Is The Time&quot; ===
Morissette is known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting. She recorded her first demo called &quot;Fate Stay with Me&quot;, produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, and engineered by Rich Dodson of Canadian classic rock band The Stampeders. A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to Geffen Records, but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label&#x27;s headquarters in October 1989.

In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Alanis&quot;, in Canada only. Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum, and its first single, &quot;Too Hot&quot;, reached the top 20 on the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart. Subsequent singles &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Feel Your Love&quot; reached the top 40. Morissette&#x27;s popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada; comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice. Morissette was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won), Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for &quot;Too Hot&quot;).

In 1992, she released her second album, &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than &quot;Alanis&quot; and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album&#x27;s producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She said of the album, &quot;People could go, &#x27;Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl&#x27;s like another Tiffany or whatever.&#x27; But the way I look at it... people will like your next album if it&#x27;s a kick-ass one.&quot; As with &quot;Alanis&quot;, &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—&quot;An Emotion Away&quot;, the minor adult contemporary hit &quot;No Apologies&quot; as well as &quot;(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time&quot;. The industry considered it a commercial failure since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.

=== 1994–1999: &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; and &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; ===
In 1993, Morissette&#x27;s publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch. Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her &quot;spectacular voice&quot;, her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living at home with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people. After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto. Her publisher funded part of her development and she spent her time there composing and rehearsing with a number of other musicians, looking to find good chemistry with a potential songwriting partner for her next album. Although a number of songs came out of these sessions, none would make an album cut and no lasting partnerships were formed. In a subsequent move to Los Angeles, however, she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio; their partnership was a stellar songwriting match, with Ballard supporting Alanis&#x27; sound rather than trying to shape or mold it to his own tastes. In her newfound freeness of creative spirit, the duo wrote and recorded Morissette&#x27;s first internationally released album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records. In the same year she learned how to play guitar. According to manager Welch, every label they approached, apart from Maverick, declined to sign Morissette.
Maverick Records released &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; internationally in June 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, featuring Flea and Dave Navarro from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics, and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic. In a 2008 interview, Dave Coulier said he was the ex-boyfriend who inspired &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;; in the 2021 documentary &quot;Jagged&quot;, Morissette denied the song is about Coulier. In a 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Alanis Morissette mentioned that multiple people have taken credit for being the inspiration behind her song &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;. She stated, &quot;I just think: If you&#x27;re going to take credit for a song where I&#x27;m singing about someone being a douche or an asshole, you might not want to say, &#x27;Hey! That&#x27;s me!&#x27;&quot; Morissette described the song as being written out of &quot;devastation&quot;, reflecting a range of emotions that women often feel but are told to suppress, such as anger and sadness.

After the success of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, the album&#x27;s other hits helped send &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; to the top of the charts. &quot;All I Really Want&quot; and &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; followed, and the fourth U.S. single, &quot;Ironic&quot;, became Morissette&#x27;s biggest hit. &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head over Feet&quot;, the fifth and sixth singles, kept &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) in the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for more than a year. &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; sold more than 16 million copies in the U.S.; it sold 33 million worldwide, making it the second biggest-selling album by a female artist (behind Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;Come On Over&quot;).

Morissette&#x27;s popularity grew significantly in Canada, where the album was certified twelve times platinum and produced four &quot;RPM&quot; chart-toppers: &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, and &quot;Head over Feet&quot;. The album was also a bestseller in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Morissette&#x27;s success with &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) was credited with opening doors for female singers such as Meredith Brooks, Tracy Bonham and Patti Rothberg, and later Avril Lavigne and Pink. She was criticized for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Ballard, and her previous disco-pop albums also proved a hindrance for her respectability. Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year (&quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album. At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996, she won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.

&quot;Ironic&quot; got the instant success, though the lyrics were heavily criticized for their malapropism, and the music video received 6 nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, where it won Best New Artist in a Video, Best Female Video and Best Editing in a Video (won by Scott Gray, Editor), and was also nominated for Viewer&#x27;s Choice, Best Direction in a Video and Video of the Year. Rather than perform that song at the ceremony, she performed &quot;Your House&quot; instead, which is homage to Joni Mitchell. The song was also nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form—and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where Morissette also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award.

Morissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour&#x27;s drummer. Radiohead joined as the opening act in mid-1996. The video &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot;, which was co-directed by Morissette and is about the bulk of her tour won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.

Following the tour, Morissette began practicing Iyengar Yoga for balance. After the last December 1996 show, she went to India for six weeks, accompanied by her mother, two aunts and two friends. The trip left her with an indelible impression and set the cornerstone for the concept of her next album.

Morissette was featured as a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr&#x27;s cover of &quot;Drift Away&quot; on his 1998 album, &quot;Vertical Man&quot;, and on the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; and &quot;Spoon&quot; on the Dave Matthews Band album &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;. She recorded the song &quot;Uninvited&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1998 film &quot;City of Angels&quot;. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

In November 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;, which she wrote and produced with Glen Ballard. The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release; instead, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies—a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist. The wordy, personal lyrics on &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx. It received positive reviews, including a four-star review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum. &quot;Thank U&quot;, the album&#x27;s only major international hit single, was released in October 1998 and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy. Morissette herself directed the videos for &quot;Unsent&quot; and &quot;So Pure&quot;, which won, respectively, the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Director and the Juno Award for Video of the Year.

Morissette contributed vocals to four tracks on Jonathan Elias&#x27;s project &quot;The Prayer Cycle&quot;, which was released in 1999, where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian on &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;, and in French on &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Innocence&quot;. The same year, she released the live acoustic album &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;, which was recorded during her appearance on the television show &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including &quot;King of Pain&quot; (a cover of The Police song) and &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; track &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;, released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song &quot;Are You Still Mad&quot; on the charity album &quot;Live in the X Lounge II&quot;. For her live rendition of &quot;So Pure&quot; at Woodstock &#x27;99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards. During the summer of 1999, Morissette toured with singer-songwriter Tori Amos on the &quot;5 and a Half Weeks Tour&quot; in support of Amos&#x27; album &quot;To Venus and Back&quot; (1999).

=== 2000–2007: &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; and &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; ===
In 2001, Morissette was featured with Stephanie McKay on the Tricky song &quot;Excess&quot;, which is on his album &quot;Blowback&quot;. Morissette released her fifth studio album, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot;, in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from Eric Avery, Dean DeLeo, Flea, and Meshell Ndegeocello.

&quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S. It produced the hit single &quot;Hands Clean&quot;, which topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received substantial radio play; for her work on &quot;Hands Clean&quot; and &quot;So Unsexy&quot;, Morissette won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year. A second single, &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;, was released, but it did not garner significant success outside Canada or U.S. hot AC radio.

Later in 2002, Morissette released the combination package &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot;, which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; recording sessions. Preceded by the single &quot;Simple Together&quot;, it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year.

Morissette hosted the Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast-flash incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Morissette released her sixth studio album, &quot;So-Called Chaos&quot;, in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette&#x27;s lowest seller in the U.S. and was her first album not to top the chart. The lead single, &quot;Everything&quot;, achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word &quot;asshole&quot;, American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word &quot;nightmare&quot; instead. Unhappy that U.S. radio networks had required her to change a word in the song, Canadian radio played the unaltered version, with Morissette stating at the 2004 Juno Awards in Canada: &quot;Well, I am overjoyed to be back in my homeland, the true North, strong and censor-free.&quot; Two other singles, &quot;Out Is Through&quot; and &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot;, fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; was a U.S. club hit. Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies, working with the non-profit environmental organization Reverb.

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995), Morissette released a studio acoustic version, &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot;, in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV North America, who retaliated by removing Morissette&#x27;s other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks&#x27;s exclusive six-week sale. , &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot; had sold 372,000 copies in the U.S., and a video for &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; received rotation on VH1 in America. The accompanying tour ran for two months in mid-2005, with Morissette playing small theatre venues. During the same period, Morissette was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. The singer opened for The Rolling Stones for a few dates of their A Bigger Bang Tour in the autumn of 2005.

Morissette released the greatest hits album &quot;Alanis Morissette: The Collection&quot; in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of Seal&#x27;s &quot;Crazy&quot;, was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of &quot;The Collection&quot; features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette&#x27;s 1996 Can&#x27;t Not Tour: &quot;King of Intimidation&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot;. (A reworked version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot; had also appeared on &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;.) The DVD also includes a ninety-second clip of the unreleased video for the single &quot;Joining You&quot;. , &quot;The Collection&quot; had sold 373,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. That same year, Morissette contributed the song &quot;Wunderkind&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

2006 marked the first year in Morissette&#x27;s musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in January when she performed &quot;Wunderkind&quot;.

On April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas&#x27;s selection &quot;My Humps&quot;, which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who act as if attempting to touch her breasts, had received 16,465,653 views as of February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools&#x27; Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her following album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like &quot;My Humps&quot; and the joke just took a life of its own.

Morissette performed at a gig for The Nightwatchman, a.k.a. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles in April 2007. The following June, she performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;O Canada&quot;, the American and Canadian national anthems, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Ottawa Senators and the Anaheim Ducks in Ottawa, Ontario. (The NHL requires arenas to perform both the American and Canadian national anthems at games involving teams from both countries.)

=== 2008–2019: &quot;Flavors of Entanglement&quot; and &quot;Havoc and Bright Lights&quot; ===
In early 2008, Morissette participated in a tour with Matchbox Twenty and Mutemath as a special guest. Her seventh studio album, &quot;Flavors of Entanglement&quot;, which was produced by Guy Sigsworth, was released in mid-2008. She has said that the album was created out of her grief after her breakup with Ryan Reynolds, saying &quot;it was cathartic.&quot; She stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Underneath&quot;, a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth. On October 3, 2008, Morissette released the video for her latest single, &quot;Not as We&quot;. Morissette said the album was created out of her grief after splitting up with Ryan Reynolds, and the song &quot;Torch&quot; was written about him.
Morissette has also recorded a cover of the 1984 Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias hit, &quot;To All the Girls I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;, re-written as &quot;To All the Boys I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;. Nelson played rhythm guitar on the recording. In April 2010, Morissette released the song &quot;I Remain&quot;, which she wrote for the &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; soundtrack. On May 26, 2010, the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, Morissette performed a duet of her song &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; with Runner Up Crystal Bowersox. Morissette left Maverick Records after all promotion for &quot;Flavors&quot; was completed.
On November 20, 2011, Morissette appeared at the American Music Awards. When asked about the new album during a short interview, she said she had recorded 31 songs, and that the album would &quot;likely be out next year, probably [in] summertime&quot;. On December 21, 2011, Morissette performed a duet of &quot;Uninvited&quot; with finalist Josh Krajcik during the performance finale of the X-Factor.

Morissette embarked on a European tour for the summer of 2012, according to Alanis.com. In early May 2012, a new song called &quot;Magical Child&quot; appeared on a Starbucks compilation called Every Mother Counts.

On May 2, 2012, Morissette revealed through her Facebook account that her eighth studio album, entitled &quot;Havoc and Bright Lights&quot;, would be released in August 2012, on new label Collective Sounds, distributed by Sony&#x27;s RED Distribution. On the same day, &quot;Billboard&quot; specified the date as August 28 and revealed the album would contain twelve tracks. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Guardian&quot;, was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012, and hit the radio airwaves four days prior to this. The single had minor success in North America, charting the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in the US and almost reaching the top 40 in Canada. It was a hit in several European countries.

On August 21, 2012, Morissette was inducted into the Guitar Center RockWalk in Hollywood. Morissette received the UCLA Spring Sing&#x27;s George and Ira Gershwin Award on May 16, 2014, at Pauley Pavilion. On her website starting in the summer of 2014, in celebration of her fortieth birthday, the LP record for her song &quot;Big Sur&quot; was offered for sale, which was previously available on the Target edition of her 2012 album, &quot;Havoc and Bright Lights&quot;. July 25, 2014, was the start of the ten-show Intimate and Acoustic tour. In 2015, she was named to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the release of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, a new four-disc collector&#x27;s edition was released on October 30, 2015. The four-disc edition includes remastered audio of the original album as well as an entire disc of 10 unreleased demos from the era, handpicked by Morissette from her archives, offering a deeper and more personal look at the classic album. Also included is a previously unreleased concert from 1995 as well as 2005&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot;.

While on tour in August 2017, Morissette teased a song which would become known as &quot;I Miss The Band&quot;. On October 27, 2017, she premiered a new song entitled &quot;Rest&quot;, which was released officially in May 2021, and performed &quot;Castle of Glass&quot; with members of the band No Doubt and Mike Shinoda at the Linkin Park and Friends – Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington memorial concert. In November 2017, she tweeted that she was writing 22 songs with Michael Farrell.

On March 16, 2018, Morissette performed a new song called &quot;Ablaze&quot; during her 2018 tour. In October 2018, she revealed on social media that she had written 23 new songs, and hinted at a new album with hashtag &quot;#alanismorissettenewrecord2019&quot;, after a six-year hiatus. Song titles from the writing session include &quot;Reckoning&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis&quot;, &quot;Her&quot; and &quot;Legacy&quot;. On May 5, 2018, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, a jukebox musical featuring Morissette&#x27;s songs, premiered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the American Repertory Theater. Morissette contributed two new songs to the musical, &quot;Smiling&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot;. The musical transferred to Broadway in fall of 2019, starting previews on November 3 and opening on December 5 at the Broadhurst Theatre. The production received fifteen Tony Award nominations, the most of any production that season. The show also won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, including Morissette being the principal lyricist and co-composer.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&quot; and &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; ===
In June 2019, Morissette went into the studio in Los Angeles. According to an interview, she had written all the songs, and &quot;Smiling&quot; would be included on the new album, likely to be released early 2020. On August 8, 2019, she revealed that the new album was produced by Alex Hope and Catherine Marks. On December 1, 2019, Morissette announced her first studio album in eight years, &quot;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&quot;, set for release on May 1, 2020. The first single off the record, &quot;Reasons I Drink&quot;, was released on December 2, 2019. Morissette was featured on Halsey&#x27;s song &quot;Alanis&#x27; Interlude&quot;, released on January 17, 2020. On February 5, 2020, she revealed that her upcoming album was mixed by Chris Dugan. The second single from the album, &quot;Smiling&quot;, was released on February 20, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Morissette announced that the album&#x27;s release would be postponed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on July 31, 2020.

Morissette was originally scheduled to embark on a world tour for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; in June 2020 with Garbage and Liz Phair, both of whom already opened for Morissette in 1999 during Junkie Tour. The latter cancelled her shows in North America and was replaced by Cat Power instead. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed to summer 2021. The tour then sprawled for the next two years, including some dates in the Philippines for the first time after 27 years. Beth Orton joined to UK and Europe leg of the summer tour 2022. Aimee Mann and Feist were confirmed as special guests in summer 2023 in the North American dates. On May 18, 2022, Morissette premiered the new track &quot;Safety—Empath in Paradise&quot;. The new album of meditation music titled &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; was released on June 17, 2022. The record was co-written with and produced by Dave Harrington, known for his work in the electronic music duo Darkside. On April 14, 2023, Morissette released a new song &quot;No Return&quot;, which is cover version of the theme song for &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; TV series.

In an interview to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, Morissette revealed that she will start working on recording a new album in 2024. In November 2023, Morissette also announced The Triple Moon Tour with 33 live dates in the United States for the summer 2024 with the Joan Jett and the Blackhearts as support act, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; album. On January 30, 2024, Morissette was awarded with the Luminary of the Year prize for the outstanding contribution to the music, at the 1st annual Resonator Awards, organized by We Are Moving the Needle, a non-profit organization that aims to empower women producers and engineers.

== Other ventures ==

=== Acting ===
In 1986, Morissette had her first stint as an actress in five episodes of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;. She appeared on stage with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society in 1985 and 1988. In 1999, Morissette delved into acting again, for the first time since 1993, appearing as God in the Kevin Smith comedy &quot;Dogma&quot; and contributing the song &quot;Still&quot; to its soundtrack. Morissette reprised her role as God for a post-credits scene in Smith&#x27;s next film, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, to literally close the book on the View Askewniverse. She also appeared in the hit HBO comedies &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, appeared in the play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, and had brief cameos playing herself in the Brazilian hit soap operas &quot;Celebridade&quot; and &quot;Malhação&quot;.

In late 2003, Morissette appeared in the Off-Broadway play &quot;The Exonerated&quot; as Sunny Jacobs, a death row inmate freed after proof surfaced that she was innocent. In April 2006, MTV News reported that Morissette would reprise her role in &quot;The Exonerated&quot; in London from May 23 until May 28. She expanded her acting credentials with the July 2004 release of the Cole Porter biographical film &quot;De-Lovely&quot;, in which she performed the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It (Let&#x27;s Fall in Love)&quot; and had a brief role as an anonymous stage performer. In February 2005, she made a guest appearance on the Canadian television show &quot;&quot; with &quot;Dogma&quot; co-star Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith. Also in 2005, Morissette, then engaged to Ryan Reynolds, made a cameo appearance as &quot;herself&quot; as a former client of Reynolds&#x27; character in the film &quot;Just Friends&quot;. This scene was deleted from the theatrical release, and is only available on the DVD.

In 2006, she guest-starred in an episode of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Lovespring International&quot; as a homeless woman named Lucinda, three episodes of FX&#x27;s &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, playing a lesbian named Poppy, and the mockumentary-documentary &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; as herself. Morissette appeared in eight episodes of &quot;Weeds&quot;, playing Dr. Audra Kitson, a &quot;no-nonsense obstetrician&quot; who treats pregnant main character Nancy Botwin. Her first episode aired in July 2009. In early 2010, Morissette returned to the stage, performing a one-night engagement in &quot;An Oak Tree&quot;, an experimental play in Los Angeles. The performance was a sell-out. In April 2010, Morissette was confirmed to be in the cast of season six of &quot;Weeds&quot; again portraying Dr. Audra Kitson.

Morissette also starred in a film adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;. Morissette plays Sylvia, an ordinary woman in unexpected remission from lymphoma. Morissette stated that she is &quot;...a big fan of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s poetic and expansively imaginative books&quot; and that she &quot;feel[s] blessed to portray Sylvia, and to be part of this story being told in film&quot;. She appeared as Amanda, a former bandmate of main character Ava Alexander (played by Maya Rudolph), in one episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Up All Night&quot; on February 16, 2012. Rudolph officiated as minister for Morissette&#x27;s wedding with both performing the explicit version of their hit hip hop song &quot;Back It Up (Beep Beep)&quot;. In 2014, Morissette played the role of Marisa Damia, the lover of architect and designer Eileen Gray, in the film &quot;The Price of Desire&quot;, directed by Mary McGuckian. In 2021, Morissette was featured as a recurring character on adult-animation show &quot;The Great North&quot;.

=== Advocacy and philanthropy ===
Morissette is an advocate and educator in the areas of spiritual, psychological, and physical wholeness, with a focus on addiction recovery, trauma healing, women&#x27;s empowerment, and holistic education for children. Her work spans a range of activities, including performances, written works, interviews, and public speaking engagements, as well as leading workshops and teachings. Throughout her career, she has collaborated with influential figures such as Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington, Neale Donald Walsch, Richard Schwartz, Gabor Maté, Peter Levine, Dan Siegel, and Marianne Williamson. Morissette has also facilitated workshops at notable institutions such as UCLA, the Omega Institute, Esalen, and 1440 Multiversity, both in-person and online.

In 2008 Morissette contributed a recording of &quot;Versions of Violence&quot; for the album Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace to promote peace. Morissette contributed to &quot;1 Giant Leap&quot;, performing &quot;Arrival&quot; with Zap Mama and she has released an acoustic version of her song &quot;Still&quot; as part of a compilation from Music for Relief in support of the 2010 Haiti earthquake crisis.

=== &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; adaptations ===
In May 2018, the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge, Massachusetts) premiered &quot;Jagged Little Pill,&quot; a musical with music by Morissette and Glen Ballard, lyrics by Morissette, book by Diablo Cody, and directed by Diane Paulus. &quot;Jagged&quot;, a documentary film about Morissette and &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; by filmmaker Alison Klayman, premiered at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival before airing on HBO as part of the &quot;Music Box&quot; series of documentary films about music history.

=== Journalism and podcasts ===
In October 2015, &quot;Conversation with Alanis Morissette&quot; features conversations with different individuals from different schools and walks of life discussing everything from psychology to art to spirituality to design to health and well-being, to relationships (whether they be romantic or colleagueship or parent with children relationships). The monthly podcast is currently available to download on iTunes and free to listen to on YouTube. In January 2016, she began a short-lived advice column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

== Personal life ==
Morissette was raised in a devout Catholic family in Canada. She became a US citizen in 2005, while retaining her Canadian citizenship. Morissette has been a practising Buddhist for many years.

Throughout her teen years and 20s, Morissette had depression and various eating disorders. She recovered from them and started to eat a healthier diet. In 2009, she ran a marathon promoting awareness for the National Eating Disorders Association. In a 2024 interview, she told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that she works out with 15-to-20 pound kettle weights while on tour.

In the 2021 documentary &quot;Jagged&quot;, Morissette said men committed statutory rape offences against her when she was 15 years old.

Over seven years, Morissette&#x27;s business manager Jonathan Schwartz stole over $5 million from her. He confessed to doing so in April 2017 and was sentenced to six years in prison.

On October 22, 2019, Morissette shared her nearly decade-long experience with postpartum depression on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;.

In 1996, Morissette bought a home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. She also had an apartment in Ottawa and a home in Malibu, the latter of which was partially destroyed in the Woolsey Fire. In 2019, she and her family moved to Olympic Valley, California; she said in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she was &quot;finally done with living in Los Angeles&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Morissette dated actor and comedian Dave Coulier for a short time in the early 1990s.

Morissette met Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds at Drew Barrymore&#x27;s birthday party in 2002, and they began dating soon afterwards. They announced their engagement in June 2004. In February 2007, representatives for Morissette and Reynolds announced they had decided to end their engagement.

On May 22, 2010, Morissette married rapper Mario &quot;Souleye&quot; Treadway in a private ceremony at their Los Angeles home. The couple have three children; their son Ever was born on December 25, 2010, their daughter Onyx on June 23, 2016, and their son Winter on August 8, 2019.

<doc id="60330" wikidata="Q3236990" url="?curid=60330" title="Self">
<text>In philosophy, the self is an individual&#x27;s own being, knowledge, and values, and the relationship between these attributes. 

The first-person perspective distinguishes selfhood from personal identity. Whereas &quot;identity&quot; is (literally) sameness and may involve categorization and labeling,
selfhood implies a first-person perspective and suggests potential uniqueness. Conversely, &quot;person&quot; is used as a third-person reference. Personal identity can be impaired in late-stage Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the self is distinguishable from &quot;others&quot;. Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience.

Although subjective experience is central to selfhood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the philosophy of self and scientific study of consciousness.

==Psychology==

The psychology of self is the study of either the cognitive and affective representation of one&#x27;s identity or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology forms the distinction between two elements I and me. The self as &quot;I&quot;, is the subjective knower. While, the self as &quot;Me&quot;, is the subject that is known. Current views of the self in psychology positions the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity. Self, following the ideas of John Locke, has been seen as a product of episodic memory but research on people with amnesia reveals that they have a coherent sense of self based on preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge. Hence, it is possible to correlate cognitive and affective experiences of self with neural processes. A goal of this ongoing research is to provide grounding insight into the elements of which the complex multiple situated selves of human identity are composed.

What the Freudian tradition has subjectively called, &quot;sense of self&quot; is for Jungian analytic psychology, where one&#x27;s identity is lodged in the persona or ego and is subject to change in maturation. Carl Jung distinguished, &quot;The self is not only the center but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the center of this totality...&quot;. The Self in Jungian psychology is &quot;the archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche ... a transpersonal power that transcends the ego.&quot; As a Jungian archetype, it cannot be seen directly, but by ongoing individuating maturation and analytic observation, can be experienced objectively by its cohesive wholeness-making factor.

Meanwhile, self psychology is a set of psychotherapeutic principles and techniques established by the Austrian-born American psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut upon the foundation of the psychoanalytic method developed by Freud, and is specifically focused on the subjectivity of experience, which, according to self psychology, is mediated by a psychological structure called the self. Examples of psychiatric conditions where such &quot;sameness&quot; may become broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occurs in schizophrenia, where the self appears different from the subject.

==Psychiatry==

The &#x27;Disorders of the Self&#x27; have also been extensively studied by psychiatrists.

For example, facial and pattern recognition take large amounts of brain processing capacity but pareidolia cannot explain many constructs of self for cases of disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
One&#x27;s sense of self can also be changed upon becoming part of a stigmatized group. According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), if an individual has prejudice against a certain group, like the elderly and then later becomes part of this group. This prejudice can be turned inward causing depression.

The philosophy of a disordered self, such as in schizophrenia, is described in terms of what the psychiatrist understands are actual events in terms of neuron excitation but are delusions nonetheless, and the schizo-affective or a schizophrenic person also believes are actual events in terms of essential being. PET scans have shown that auditory stimulation is processed in certain areas of the brain, and imagined similar events are processed in adjacent areas, but hallucinations are processed in the same areas as actual stimulation. In such cases, external influences may be the source of consciousness and the person may or may not be responsible for &quot;sharing&quot; in the mind&#x27;s process, or the events which occur, such as visions and auditory stimuli, may persist and be repeated often over hours, days, months or years—and the afflicted person may believe themselves to be in a state of rapture or possession.

==Neuroscience==

Two areas of the brain that are important in retrieving self-knowledge are the medial prefrontal cortex and the medial posterior parietal cortex.
The posterior cingulate cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex are thought to combine to provide humans with the ability to self-reflect. The insular cortex is also thought to be involved in the process of self-reference.

==Sociology==
Culture consists of explicit and implicit patterns of historically derived and selected ideas and their embodiment in institutions, cognitive and social practices, and artifacts. Cultural systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, and on the other, as conditioning elements of further action. The way individuals construct themselves may be different due to their culture.

Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama&#x27;s theory of the interdependent self hypothesizes that representations of the self in human cultures fall on a continuum from &quot;independent&quot; to &quot;interdependent&quot;. The independent self is supposed to be egoistic, unique, separated from the various contexts, critical in judgment, and prone to self-expression. The interdependent self is supposed to be altruistic, similar with the others, flexible according to contexts, conformist, and unlikely to express opinions that would disturb the harmony of his or her group of belonging. However, this theory has been criticized by other sociologists, including David Matsumoto for being based on popular stereotypes and myths about different cultures rather than on rigorous scientific research. A 2016 study of 10,203 participants from 55 cultural groups also failed to find a correlation between the postulating series of causal links between culture and self-construals, finding instead that correlations between traits varied both across cultures did not correlate with Markus &amp; Kitayama&#x27;s identifications of &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;interdependent&quot; self.

==Philosophy==

The philosophy of self seeks to describe essential qualities that constitute a person&#x27;s uniqueness or a person&#x27;s essential being. There have been various approaches to defining these qualities. The self can be considered as the source of consciousness, the agent responsible for an individual&#x27;s thoughts and actions, or the substantial nature of a person which endures and unifies consciousness over time.

The self has a particular prominence in the thought of René Descartes (1596-1650).
In addition to the writings of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) on &quot;otherness&quot;, the distinction between &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot; has been further elaborated in Martin Buber&#x27;s 1923 philosophical work &quot;Ich und Du&quot;.

In philosophy, the problem of personal identity is concerned with how one is able to identify a single person over a time interval, dealing with such questions as, &quot;What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?&quot; or &quot;What kinds of things are we persons?&quot;

A question related to the problem of personal identity is Benj Hellie&#x27;s vertiginous question. The vertiginous question asks why, of all the subjects of experience out there, &quot;this&quot; one—the one corresponding to the human being referred to as Benj Hellie—is the one whose experiences are &quot;live&quot;? (The reader is supposed to substitute their own case for Hellie&#x27;s.) Hellie&#x27;s argument is closely related to Caspar Hare&#x27;s theories of egocentric presentism and perspectival realism, of which several other philosophers have written reviews.
Similar questions are also asked repeatedly by J. J. Valberg in justifying his horizonal view of the self, and by Thomas Nagel in &quot;The View from Nowhere&quot;. Tim S. Roberts refers to the question of why a particular organism out of all the organisms that happen to exist happens to be you as the &quot;Even Harder Problem of Consciousness&quot;.

Open individualism is a view in the philosophy of self, according to which there exists only one numerically identical subject, who is everyone at all times, in the past, present and future. It is a theoretical solution to the question of personal identity, being contrasted with &quot;Empty individualism&quot;, the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time, and &quot;Closed individualism&quot;, the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive over time.

Open individualism is related to the concept of anattā in Buddhist philosophy. In Buddhism, the term anattā () or anātman () is the doctrine of &quot;non-self&quot; – that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon. While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self, &quot;anatman&quot; is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non-attachment by recognizing everything as impermanent, while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence. In contrast, dominant schools of Hinduism assert the existence of Ātman as pure awareness or witness-consciousness, &quot;reify[ing] consciousness as an eternal self.&quot;

One thought experiment in the philosophy of personal identity is the teletransportation paradox. It deals with whether the concept of one&#x27;s future self is a coherent concept. The thought experiment was formulated by Derek Parfit in his 1984 book &quot;Reasons and Persons.&quot; Derek Parfit and others consider a hypothetical &quot;teletransporter&quot;, a machine that puts you to sleep, records your molecular composition, breaking you down into atoms, and relaying its recording to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is actually a method of travel, or if it simply kills and makes an exact replica of the user. Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place. Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply &quot;Relation R&quot;, psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.

==Religion==

Religious views on the Self vary widely. The Self is a complex and core subject in many forms of spirituality. Two types of Self are commonly considered—the Self that is the ego, also called the learned, superficial Self of mind and body, egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the &quot;True Self&quot;, the &quot;Observing Self&quot;, or the &quot;Witness&quot;. In Hinduism, the Ātman (Self), despite being experienced as an individual, is actually a representation of the unified transcendent reality, Brahman. Our experience of reality doesn&#x27;t match the nature of Brahman due to māyā.

One description of spirituality is the Self&#x27;s search for &quot;ultimate meaning&quot; through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Another definition of spiritual identity is: &quot;A persistent sense of Self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual value of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual Self because it is determined by one&#x27;s life and experiences.&quot;

Human beings have a Self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance. Traditions such as in Buddhism see the attachment to Self is an illusion that serves as the main cause of suffering and unhappiness.

<text>The Bloc Québécois (, , BQ) is a federal political party in Canada devoted to Quebecois nationalism and the promotion of Quebecois sovereignty. The Bloc was formed by Members of Parliament (MPs) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord. Founder Lucien Bouchard had been a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.

The Bloc seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns exclusively within the province during federal elections. The party has been described as social democratic and separatist (or &quot;sovereigntist&quot;). The Bloc supports the Kyoto Protocol, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, legalization of assisted suicide, abolition of the Canadian Senate, abolition of the monarchy, the Quebec Secularism law, and supports exempting Quebec from the requirements of the &quot;Multiculturalism Act.&quot;

From the 1993 federal election until 2011, the Bloc was the largest party in Quebec and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons through seven straight federal elections. The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party. By 2014, the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions. In the 2015 election, the Bloc won 10 seats, even though the party&#x27;s leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat. In the 2019 election, the party won 32 seats, regaining official party status as a result. In the 2021 election, their seat count remained the same as the 2019 election. Due to the 2019 and 2021 elections resulting in a Liberal minority government, the Bloc shares the balance of power with the New Democratic Party.

The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Québécois (PQ, whose members are known as &#x27;), a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence, but the two are not linked organizationally. As with its provincial counterpart, the Bloc Québécois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec, from sections of [[labour movement|organized labour]] to more [[Conservatism in Canada|conservative]] rural voters. Members and supporters are known in French as&#x27; ().

==Positions and ideologies==
An incomplete list of Bloc Québécois political positions. Among other things the Bloc Québécois has advocated:

* Quebec sovereignty, up to independence, specifically repeal of the Clarity Act and opposition to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project.
* Supporting the Kyoto Protocol.
* Abortion rights.
* LGBTQ+ rights.
* Legalization of assisted suicide.
* Abolition of the Canadian Senate.
*Abolition of the monarchy.
*Lowering the voting age to 16.
* Support for the Quebec Secularism law, in which government bans individual civil servants from wearing religious attires, largely affecting Muslim women and Sikh men.
*Exemption of Quebec from the requirements of the &quot;Multiculturalism Act.&quot;

During the 2015 Canadian federal election, the Bloc Québécois supported banning the face covering during the citizenship ceremony and voting, aimed at Muslim women who wear the niqab.

==History==

===Origins===
The Bloc Québécois was formed in 1990 as an informal coalition of Progressive Conservative and Liberal Members of Parliament from Quebec, who left their original parties around the time of the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord. The party was intended to be temporary and was given the goal of the promotion of sovereignty at the federal level. The party aimed to disband following a successful referendum on secession from Canada. As with most parties, it has gained and lost prominent supporters over the years.

The initial coalition that led to the Bloc was headed by Lucien Bouchard, who had been federal Minister of the Environment in the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. Bouchard abandoned the government in May 1990 in response to the report of a commission headed by Jean Charest that suggested changes to the Meech Lake Accord. Bouchard felt the recommendations for change undermined the objectives and spirit of the accord. According to &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot; he was fired by Prime Minister Mulroney. Bouchard was joined by five of his fellow Tories (Nic Leblanc, Louis Plamondon, Benoît Tremblay, Gilbert Chartrand, and François Gérin), along with two Liberals (Gilles Rocheleau and Jean Lapierre). The first Bloquiste candidate to be elected was Gilles Duceppe, then a union organizer, in a by-election for the Montreal riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie on 13 August 1990. He ran as an independent, since the Bloc had not been registered as a federal party.

===First election and Official Opposition===

In the 1993 federal election, the Bloc won 54 seats (out of 75) in Quebec, sweeping nearly all of the francophone ridings. Because the opposition vote in the rest of Canada was split between the Reform Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, and the New Democratic Party, the Bloc narrowly won the second largest number of seats in the House of Commons, and therefore became the official opposition. While Reform finished second in the national popular vote, the Bloc&#x27;s heavy concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger than Reform&#x27;s concentration in the West.

Soon after the 35th Parliament convened, Bouchard announced that Bloquiste MPs would only speak French on the floor of the House of Commons, a policy that remains in force to this day. This was out of necessity; although Bouchard and most of the Bloc&#x27;s founding members were fluently bilingual in French and English, Bouchard had discovered that most of his large caucus could not speak English well enough to use it in debate.

The election of such a relatively large number of Bloquistes was the first of The Three Periods, a plan intended to lay out the way to sovereignty created by PQ leader Jacques Parizeau. Parizeau became Premier of Quebec in the Quebec election of 1994 (the second of the &quot;Three Periods&quot;).

Because the Bloc was the official opposition, it had considerable privileges over the other parties although all of its MPs had been elected in one province. For instance, Question Periods during the 35th Parliament were dominated by issues of national unity. However, the governing Liberals regarded Reform as their main opposition on non-Quebec matters. Also, in 1995, when Bouchard garnered an invitation to meet visiting US President Bill Clinton by virtue of being Opposition Leader, Reform leader Preston Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard&#x27;s separatist leverage.

===1995 Quebec referendum and aftermath===
In 1995, the PQ government called the second referendum on independence in Quebec history. The Bloc entered the campaign for the &quot;Oui&quot; (Yes) side (in favour of sovereignty). The &quot;Oui&quot; side&#x27;s campaign had a difficult beginning, so the leadership of the campaign was shifted from PQ leader Jacques Parizeau to Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard. Bouchard was seen as more charismatic and more moderate, and therefore more likely to attract voters.

A &quot;tripartite agreement&quot; mapping out the plan for accession to independence was written and signed by the leaders of the Parti Québécois, the Bloc Québécois and the Action démocratique du Québec on 12 June 1995. It revived René Lévesque&#x27;s notion that the referendum should be followed by the negotiating of an association agreement between an independent Quebec and the rest of Canada. This provision was inspired by Bouchard. Parizeau had previously wanted a vote simply on independence. The difference became moot when 50.6% of voters taking part in the referendum rejected the sovereignty plan. An overwhelming &quot;Non&quot; vote in Montreal tipped the balance.

The day after the referendum, Parizeau announced his pending resignation as PQ leader and Premier of Quebec. Bouchard left federal politics and succeeded Parizeau in both posts on 26 January 1996. 

Following Bouchard&#x27;s departure from Ottawa, Michel Gauthier became leader of the Bloc. In the wake of the referendum defeat, Gauthier proved unable to hold the fractious caucus together and resigned as leader just one year later. Gilles Duceppe, who had served as interim leader between Bouchard and Gauthier, became leader of the Bloc in 1997.

===Party under Gilles Duceppe===
In the 1997 federal election, the Bloc Québécois dropped to 44 seats, losing official opposition status to the Reform Party. The 1997–2000 term was marked by the Bloc&#x27;s fight against the passage of the Clarity Act, the attempt by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien (himself a Quebecer who represented a strongly nationalist riding) and Stéphane Dion, a Quebec minister in Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet, to codify the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 1998 decision that Quebec could not secede unilaterally.

In the 2000 election, the Bloc dropped further to 38 seats, despite polling a larger percentage of the vote than at the previous election. One factor was the forced merger of several major Quebec cities, such as Montreal, Quebec City and Hull/Gatineau. The merger was very unpopular in those areas, resulting in Liberal wins in several of the merged areas. This was still more than the number of seats the Liberals had won in Quebec. However, the Liberals won several subsequent by-elections during the life of the 37th Parliament, until the Liberals had held the majority of Quebec&#x27;s seats in the Commons for the first time since the 1984 federal election. From then to the subsequent election, the Bloc continued to denounce the federal government&#x27;s interventions in what the Bloc saw as exclusively provincial jurisdictions. The Bloc credits its actions for the uncovering of what has since become the sponsorship scandal.

The Bloc continued to slide in most of the 2003 opinion polls following the 2003 Quebec election which was won by the federalist Quebec Liberal Party led by Jean Charest. However, things changed during the winter of 2003. The federalist Charest government lost popularity. Then, in February 2004, the Auditor General of Canada uncovered the sponsorship scandal, suggesting illegality in the spending of federal monies in Quebec in support of Canadian unity. As well, the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien passed party financing legislation that resulted in the Bloc receiving millions of dollars in subsidies that helped to stabilize its organization.

For the 2004 election, the Bloc adopted the slogan &quot;Un parti propre au Québec&quot;, a play on words that can be translated either as &quot;A party of Quebec&#x27;s own&quot; (&quot;a party proper to Quebec&quot;) or as &quot;A clean party in Quebec&quot;. The Bloc won 54 seats in the House of Commons, tying its previous record from the 1993 campaign. For the 2006 election, the Bloc used the slogan &quot;Heureusement, ici, c&#x27;est le Bloc!&quot; (&quot;Fortunately, the Bloc is here!&quot;). The Bloc were expected to easily win more than 60 seats at the start of the campaign, and they did in fact take six seats from the Liberals. However, the unexpected surge of the new Conservative Party of Canada in parts of Quebec, particularly in and around Quebec City, led to the Bloc losing eight seats to the Tories. Coupled with an additional loss to André Arthur, an independent candidate, the Bloc recorded a net loss of three seats.

The Conservative Party won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, thus forming a minority government. There was persistent speculation as to the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties to wrest the government away from the Conservatives. Duceppe, whose leadership was confirmed after the election, maintained that the Bloc would continue to co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when this advantaged Quebec, but would not participate in a federal government.

Gilles Duceppe announced on 11 May 2007 that he would run for the leadership of the Parti Québécois to replace André Boisclair, who resigned on 8 May 2007, after the poor performance in the March 2007 Quebec provincial election and internal dissent forced him to step down. Duceppe announced the next day that he was withdrawing from the race, and that he would support Pauline Marois who had also announced her intention to run.

The Bloc made slight gains following the 2008 federal elections as they won 49 seats, one more than the number they had before the previous parliament was dissolved. In that election, they used the slogan &quot;&quot; (&quot;Present for Quebec&quot;). Although they made small gains in relation to the number of seats at dissolution, they fell by 2 seats to 49 in comparison to the 51 they received in 2006. Also, the proportion of popular votes in the province was down 4 points to 38.1%, the Bloc&#x27;s lowest score since 1997.

In a speech in front of his supporters following the election, BQ leader Gilles Duceppe claimed to have achieved his objectives, adding: &quot;without the Bloc Québécois tonight, Mr. Harper would have formed a majority government&quot;.

At the end of November 2008, the Bloc indicated that it would support a possible motion of no confidence against the governing Conservatives by the two other opposition parties, and would support the resulting Liberal-NDP coalition government at least until June 2010, without actually being part of the government.

====Coalition attempt====
On 26 March 2011, Bloc Québécois leader Duceppe stated that Conservative leader Stephen Harper had in 2004 tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper&#x27;s allegations that the Liberals intended to form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP. Two months after the 2004 federal election, Stephen Harper privately met with BQ leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel. On 9 September 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, stating,
On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said: &quot;It is the Parliament that&#x27;s supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That&#x27;s a criticism I&#x27;ve had and that we&#x27;ve had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that.&quot; However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government, despite the letter written to the governor general. Harper said, &quot;This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort.&quot;

One month later, on 4 October 2004, journalist Mike Duffy, (later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper in December 2008), said &quot;It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election&quot;, and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton&#x27;s accusations.

===Loss of official party status===
In the 2011 federal election, in the wake of a surge of support for the New Democratic Party, the Bloc received less than a quarter of the popular vote in Quebec (and less than 6% of the national vote). It lost 44 of the 47 seats it held at parliament&#x27;s dissolution, and only added one seat, which had been vacated by a Bloc Québécois member six months prior to the election. The seats lost included that of Duceppe, who resigned as party president and leader. It also lost all but one of its seats in Montreal.

By winning only four seats, the Bloc failed to reach the minimum of 12 seats required for official party status in the House of Commons. MPs without official party status are treated as independents and must sit in the back row of the opposition benches. They are permitted just a few questions each week in question period and cannot sit as voting members on parliamentary committees.

Elected to Parliament in this election were incumbents Louis Plamondon, André Bellavance, Maria Mourani and rookie MP Jean-François Fortin. When the 41st Parliament convened on 2 June 2011, Plamondon became the Bloc&#x27;s interim parliamentary leader. Vivian Barbot served as interim leader and party president following Duceppe&#x27;s resignation until the party&#x27;s 2011 leadership election.

The Bloc Québécois leadership election campaign to choose a permanent successor to Duceppe began on 17 September 2011 and concluded on 11 December with the election of former MP for Hochelaga Daniel Paillé as party leader. Plamondon, the longest-serving member of the Commons, served as parliamentary leader during Paillé&#x27;s tenure as he did not have a seat.

On 28 February 2013, Claude Patry defected from the New Democratic Party and joined the Bloc, citing his disagreement with the New Democratic Party on the subject of Quebec sovereignty, bringing the party&#x27;s total seats in Parliament up to five.

The caucus fell back to four MPs on 12 September 2013 when Mourani, the party&#x27;s only remaining member from Montreal, was expelled for her comments criticizing the Parti Québécois government&#x27;s proposed Charter of Quebec Values.

Paillé stepped down as leader on 16 December 2013 because of health reasons. A leadership election was held the following June.

Hardliner Mario Beaulieu, a former president of the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste who had never been either a Member of Parliament or a member of Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly, was elected party leader after running on a platform of prioritizing Quebec independence above all else. He defeated BQ Member of Parliament André Bellavance, who had campaigned on a platform of broadening the Bloc beyond being a coalition of sovereigntists and had been endorsed by the rest of the party&#x27;s caucus.

On 12 August 2014, the caucus was reduced to three MPs when the Bloc&#x27;s interim parliamentary leader, Jean-François Fortin, quit the party to sit as an independent saying that the Bloc Québécois he had joined no longer exists and that Beaulieu had destroyed its credibility. On 25 August 2014, former interim parliamentary leader and failed leadership contender André Bellavance also resigned, reducing the Bloc to two MPs – one of whom, Claude Patry, had announced that he would not run for re-election. On 31 December 2014, the party&#x27;s vice president, Annie Lessard, resigned after a personality conflict with leader Mario Beaulieu.

====Return and departure of Duceppe====
With two seats left in parliament, and with the party languishing in the polls a few months before an expected election campaign, it was announced 10 June 2015 that Gilles Duceppe would be returning to lead the party into the campaign; Beaulieu would relinquish the leadership but remain party president. The party executive agreed on 9 June 2015, to split the positions of president and party leader in order to facilitate Duceppe&#x27;s return. The changes were approved by the party&#x27;s general council on 1 July.
During the 2015 federal election, the Bloc Québécois had hoped to pick up seats from the collapsing NDP vote; however, most Quebecers instead switched their allegiance to the Liberals and Conservatives rather than back to the Bloc. While the Bloc managed to win 10 seats, more than twice that of the previous election, it was not enough to gain official party status. The party&#x27;s share of the popular vote in Quebec fell to 19%, its lowest point up until that time. As in 2011, Duceppe failed to win his own seat, and resigned again as party leader.

===Party under Martine Ouellet (2017-2018)===
The party was led on an interim basis by Rhéal Fortin until the Bloc Québécois leadership election in March 2017 acclaimed Martine Ouellet, a member of the provincial National Assembly of Quebec, as party leader. Ouellet is not a Member of Parliament and intended to see out her term in the provincial legislature until the next provincial election in October 2018.

On 28 February 2018, seven of the Bloc&#x27;s ten MPs quit the party&#x27;s caucus to form the Groupe parlementaire québécois (later called &quot;Québec debout&quot;) citing conflicts with Ouellet&#x27;s leadership style and her insistence that the Bloc should emphasize promoting Quebec independence over &quot;defending Quebec&#x27;s interests&quot;. Three MPs remained in the Bloc&#x27;s caucus: Mario Beaulieu (La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île), Xavier Barsalou-Duval (Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères), and Marilène Gill (Manicouagan).

More than 20 ex-Bloc MPs, including Gilles Duceppe, issued an open letter supporting the seven current MPs who had resigned from caucus and demanding Ouellet&#x27;s resignation. Nevertheless, after a lengthy meeting, the party&#x27;s executive issued a statement supporting Ouellet&#x27;s leadership but also stating that the seven rebels could keep their Bloc Québécois memberships and would not be expelled from the party for quitting the caucus, inviting them to return to the caucus in the future. A Léger Marketing poll conducted shortly after put the Bloc Quebecois at 12% among Quebec voters, its lowest rating ever. Following an election this would likely translate into zero seats, putting the survival of the party into question for the 2019 federal election.

A leadership review referendum was held on Ouellet&#x27;s leadership on 1 and 2 June 2018 resulting in the party membership rejecting her leadership by 67%, while a proposal that the party prioritize Quebec independence on a daily basis above all other issues also passed with 65% support. Ouellet subsequently announced her resignation as party leader effective 11 June 2018.

Following the announcement of Ouellet&#x27;s resignation, MPs Michel Boudrias and Simon Marcil announced they would rejoin the party, while party president and MP Mario Beaulieu was named Ouelett&#x27;s successor on an interim basis until her successor could be chosen. On 22 August 2018, as part of an agreement to reunite the party, Beaulieu ceded the party presidency to Yves Perron; on 17 September 2018, the remaining MPs who had defected from the Bloc rejoined the party and dissolved their breakaway group, &quot;Québec debout&quot;.

===Party under Yves-François Blanchet (2019-present)===
As the only candidate to have entered the race by 15 January 2019 deadline, former Parti Québécois cabinet minister Yves-François Blanchet was named leader on 17 January 2019. Since Blanchet became leader the BQ has seen their support increasing in Quebec during the 2019 federal election which some considered to have exceeded expectations. The BQ increased its number of seats from 10 in 2015, to 32 seats in 2019, both overtaking the NDP to become the third largest party in Canada and regaining official party status.

In the 2021 Canadian federal election, the BQ led by Blanchet won 32 seats, unchanged from the prior election.

The Bloc Québécois held a leadership confidence vote in May 2023. Blanchet won 97% of the vote.

In September 2024, the BQ won a competitive by-election in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun in Montreal.

==Relationship with the Parti Québécois==
The Parti Québécois has close ties to the Bloc and shares its principal objective of independence for Quebec. The two parties have backed each other during election campaigns, and prominent members of each party often attend and speak at the other&#x27;s public events. In addition, the majority of each party&#x27;s membership holds membership in both parties. However, on an organizational level the parties are separate entities – the Bloc is not the federal wing of the Parti Québécois, nor the PQ the provincial wing of the Bloc.

Lucien Bouchard has been the leader of both parties. Michel Gauthier, once Bloc&#x27;s leader, was a PQ member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1981 until 1988. Former party leader Daniel Paillé was also a PQ member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1994 to 1996, and a BQ member of Parliament from 2009 to 2011.

In June 2014, Mario Beaulieu, a former PQ riding president and Bloc candidate, was elected leader of the Bloc Québécois. Notwithstanding his previous ties to both parties, Beaulieu has been critical of what he sees as a too timid approach to sovereignty by both the Bloc and PQ. Beaulieu&#x27;s election as Bloc leader was more warmly received by the PQ&#x27;s rival party, Option nationale, than by the PQ.

Martine Ouellet was a PQ MNA from 2010 until 2017 and ran twice for the PQ leadership. She continued to sit in the Quebec National Assembly, as an Independent MNA, after she was elected Bloc leader.

In the 2015 election, Parti Québécois leader Pierre Karl Péladeau officially endorsed the Bloc, despite earlier calling the party useless.
Several incumbent PQ MNAs including Bernard Drainville, Stéphane Bergeron, Maka Kotto, Dave Turcotte and Agnès Maltais also endorsed the Bloc and campaigned for local candidates.

<text>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area in California. BART serves 50 stations along six routes and of track, including eBART, a spur line running to Antioch, and Oakland Airport Connector, a automated guideway transit line serving Oakland International Airport. With an average of weekday passenger trips as of and annual passenger trips in , BART is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States.

BART is operated by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District which formed in 1957. The initial system opened in stages from 1972 to 1974. The system has been extended several times, most recently in 2020, when Milpitas and Berryessa/North San José stations opened as part of the under construction Silicon Valley BART extension in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).

== Services ==
BART serves large portions of its three member counties – San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa – as well as smaller portions of San Mateo County and Santa Clara counties. The system has 50 stations: 22 in Alameda County, 12 in Contra Costa County, 8 in San Francisco, 6 in San Mateo County, and 2 in Santa Clara County. BART operates five named heavy rail services plus one separate automated guideway line. All of the heavy rail services run through Oakland, and all but the Orange Line cross the bay through the Transbay Tube to San Francisco. All five services run every day until 9 pm; only three services operate evenings after 9 pm. All stations are served during all service hours. The eastern segment of the (between Antioch and the transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point) uses different rolling stock and is separated from the rest of the line.
=== Hours and frequencies ===
BART has elements of both traditional rapid transit (high-frequency urban service with close station spacing) and commuter rail/regional rail (lower-frequency suburban service with wider station spacing). Trains on each primary service run every 20 minutes, except the busy Yellow Line, which operates every 10 minutes on weekdays. Segments served by multiple lines have higher frequencies, the busiest of which is the section between Daly City and West Oakland, which has around 15 trains per hour (one train about every four minutes), per direction at peak hours. The Oakland Airport Connector runs &quot;on demand&quot;, typically on headways of 10 minutes or less.

Timed cross-platform transfers are available between the Orange Line, which operates only in the East Bay, and the Yellow Line, which operates through the Transbay Tube to the San Francisco Peninsula. This service complements the Red Line during daytime hours and replaces that line when it stops operating after 9pm.

The first inbound trains leave outer terminals around 5:00 am on weekdays, 6:00 am on Saturdays, and 8:00 am on Sundays and most holidays. The last trains of the service day leave their terminals around midnight; the final Yellow and Orange Line trains in both directions meet at MacArthur station, and the final Orange and Blue Line trains in the southbound direction meet at Bay Fair station, for guaranteed transfers.

=== Late night bus services ===
Two different bus networks operated by regional transit agencies run during the overnight hours when BART is not operating.

The All Nighter network provides basic overnight service to much of the Bay Area. Most BART stations are served (directly or within several blocks) by the All Nighter system except for the Antioch–Rockridge and Bay Fair–Dublin/Pleasanton segments plus Warm Springs/South Fremont station.

The Early Bird Express network provides service to major BART stations between 3:50 am and 5:30 am. Two San Francisco/Peninsula routes and seven Transbay routes run between a limited number of major BART stations, with the San Francisco/Peninsula and Transbay routes meeting at the Salesforce Transit Center. The original Early Bird Express network introduced in February 2019 had fifteen routes, but some were eliminated later that year due to low ridership.

=== Connecting services ===

Intermodal connections to local, regional, and intercity transit – including bus, light rail, commuter rail, and intercity rail – are available across the BART system. Three Amtrak intercity rail services – the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;, and &quot;San Joaquins&quot; – stop at Richmond station; the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; also stops at Oakland Coliseum station. Transfer between BART and the Caltrain commuter rail service is available at Millbrae station.

BART and most lines of San Francisco&#x27;s Muni Metro light rail system share four stations (Embarcadero, Montgomery Street, Powell Street, and Civic Center/UN Plaza) in the Market Street subway; connections are also available to three lines at Balboa Park station and one line at Glen Park station. A tunnel at the Powell Street station connects to the Union Square/Market Street station on the Muni Metro T Third Street line. In the South Bay, Milpitas station provides a connection to the Orange Line of VTA light rail.

BART is served by bus connections from regional and local transit agencies at all stations, most of which have dedicated off-street bus transfer areas. Many connecting routes (particularly in suburban areas) serve primarily as feeder routes to BART. Larger bus systems connecting to BART include Muni in San Francisco, AC Transit in the East Bay, SamTrans in San Mateo County, County Connection and Tri Delta Transit in eastern Contra Costa County, WestCAT in western Contra Costa County, WHEELS in the Tri-Valley, VTA in the Santa Clara Valley, and Golden Gate Transit. Smaller systems include Emery Go-Round in Emeryville, Commute.org on the Peninsula, San Leandro LINKS, Dumbarton Express, and Union City Transit. The Salesforce Transit Center regional bus hub is located one block from Embarcadero and Montgomery stations.

Several transit agencies offer limited commuter-oriented bus service from more distant cities to outlying BART stations; these include VINE from Napa County, Solano Express from Solano County, Rio Vista Delta Breeze, Stanislaus Regional Transit Authority from Stanislaus County, and San Joaquin RTD from Stockton. Many BART stations are also served by privately run employer and hospital shuttles, and privately run intercity buses stop at several stations.

=== Airport connections ===

BART also runs directly to two of the three major Bay Area airports (San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport) with service to San Jose International Airport provided by a VTA bus route available at Milpitas station.

== History ==
=== Origins, planning, and geographical coverage ===
Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system&#x27;s current coverage area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower deck of the Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s, with its last transbay crossing in 1958, and was superseded by highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area&#x27;s traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs. Marvin E. Lewis, a San Francisco trial attorney and member of the city&#x27;s board of supervisors spearheaded a grassroots movement to advance the idea of an alternative bay crossing and the possibility of regional transit network.

Formal planning for BART began with the setting up in 1957 of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, all of which were projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Although invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART due to their dissatisfaction that the peninsula line only stopped at Palo Alto initially, and that it interfered with suburban development in San Jose, preferring instead to concentrate on constructing freeways and expressways. Though the system expanded into Santa Clara County in 2020, as of June 2024 it is still not a district member.

In 1962, San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents (presumably along I-280, SR 92, and SR 85). The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo&#x27;s departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART&#x27;s projected cost. Another important factor in Marin&#x27;s withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.

Construction of the system began in 1964, and included a number of major engineering challenges, including excavating subway tunnels in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley; constructing aerial structures throughout the Bay Area, particularly in Alameda and Contra Costa counties; tunneling through the Berkeley Hills on the Concord line; and lowering the system&#x27;s centerpiece, the Transbay Tube connecting Oakland and San Francisco, into a trench dredged onto the floor of San Francisco Bay. Like other transit systems of the same era, BART endeavored to connect outlying suburbs with job centers in Oakland and San Francisco by building lines that paralleled established commuting routes of the region&#x27;s freeway system. BART envisioned frequent local service, with headways as short as two minutes between trains through the Transbay Tube and six minutes on each individual line.

=== Early years and train control problems ===
Passenger service began on September 11, 1972, initially just between MacArthur and Fremont. The rest of the system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service through the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as a major step forward in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.

Some of the early safety concerns appeared to be well founded when the system experienced a number of train-control failures in its first few years of operation. As early as 1969, before revenue service began, several BART engineers identified safety problems with the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The BART Board of Directors was dismissive of their concerns and retaliated by firing them. Less than a month after the system&#x27;s opening, on October 2, 1972, an ATC failure caused a train to run off the end of the elevated track at the terminal Fremont station and crash to the ground, injuring four people. The &quot;Fremont Flyer&quot; led to a comprehensive redesign of the train controls and also resulted in multiple investigations being opened by the California State Senate, California Public Utilities Commission, and National Transportation Safety Board. Hearings by the state legislature in 1974 into financial mismanagement at BART forced the General Manager to resign in May 1974, and the entire Board of Directors was replaced the same year when the legislature passed legislation leading to the election of a new Board and the end of appointed members.

=== Extensions ===

Even before the BART system opened, planners projected several possible extensions. Although Marin County was left out of the original system, the 1970 Golden Gate Transportation Facilities Plan considered a tunnel under the Golden Gate or second deck on the bridge, but neither of these plans was pursued. Over twenty years would pass before the first extensions to the BART system were completed to Colma and Pittsburg/Bay Point in 1996. An extension to Dublin/Pleasanton in 1997 added a fifth line to the system for the first time in BART&#x27;s history. The system was expanded to San Francisco International Airport in 2003 and to Oakland International Airport via an automated guideway transit spur line in 2014. eBART, an extension using diesel multiple units along conventional railroad infrastructure between Pittsburg/Bay Point and Antioch on the Yellow Line, opened on May 26, 2018. BART&#x27;s most significant current extension project is the Silicon Valley BART extension on the Green and Orange Lines. The first phase extended the Fremont line to Warm Springs/South Fremont in early 2017, and the second phase to Berryessa/North San José began service on June 13, 2020. The third phase to Santa Clara is contingent upon the allocation of funding , but is planned to be completed by 2036.

Plans had long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, but the most recent proposal was rejected by the BART board in 2018. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High-Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges. In 2018, BART announced that a feasibility study for installing a second transbay crossing would commence the following year. By 2019, the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority (CCJPA) had joined with BART to study a multi-modal crossing, which could also allow &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; and &quot;San Joaquins&quot; routes to serve San Francisco directly.

=== System modernization ===
In 2007, BART stated its intention to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position, stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed the implementation of the plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.

In 2008, BART announced that it would install solar panels at two yards, maintenance facilities, and Orinda station (the only station that receives sufficient sunlight to justify installation cost).

In 2012, the California Transportation Commission announced that they would provide funding for expanding BART facilities, through the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, in anticipation of the opening of the Silicon Valley Berryessa Extension. $50 million would go in part to improvements to the Hayward Maintenance Complex.

In March 2019, BART announced that they would begin updating ticket add-fare machines inside the paid area to accept debit and credit cards for payment (for Clipper cards only). In December 2020, BART completed the changeover to Clipper and stopped issuing magstripe paper tickets. Existing paper tickets remained valid. In April 2021, BART began accepting Clipper cards on Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Clipper app at all BART stations. By December 2023, the fare system was entirely Clipper-only.

During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the BART equipment was mostly undamaged. A 2010 study concluded that along with some Bay Area freeways, some of BART&#x27;s overhead structures could collapse in a major earthquake, which has a significant probability of occurring within three decades. Seismic retrofitting has been carried out since 2004 upon voter approval to address these deficiencies, especially in the Transbay Tube. BART projects that Transbay Tube retrofits are expected to be completed in 2023.

== Rolling stock ==
=== Car types ===

The mainline BART network operates with electric powered, self-propelled railcars. For most lines, six cars are coupled together in a train, except the Yellow Line, which uses eight-car trains. BART trains have gangway connections, and passengers can move freely between cars. The cars have three doors on each side, bike racks, 54 seats per car, and interior and exterior displays giving information. The new cars, branded by BART as its &quot;Fleet of the Future&quot;, were unveiled in April 2016. The first cars were expected to be in service in December 2016, however, glitches and a failed CPUC inspection delayed introduction to January 19, 2018. A total of 775 cars were ordered from Bombardier (which merged with Alstom during production): 310 cab cars (D-cars) and 465 non-cab cars (E-cars). , BART has received all 775 D and E cars, of which 769 have been certified for service. To run its peak service, BART requires 400 cars. Of those, 384 are scheduled to be in active service; the others are used to build up spare trains (used to maintain on-time service).

The previous BART fleet, consisting of A, B, and C cars, was built between 1968 and 1996. It was retired from regular service on September 11, 2023, with the final revenue runs on April 20, 2024.

The Oakland Airport Connector uses a completely separate and independently operated fleet of cable car-based automated guideway transit vehicles. It uses four Cable Liner trains built by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car, arranged as three-car sets, but the system can accommodate four-car trains in the future.

The eBART extension uses eight Stadler GTW diesel railcars. The Stadler GTW vehicles are diesel multiple units, which operate over standard gauge tracks (as opposed to BART&#x27;s broad gauge).

=== Depots ===
The initial BART system included car storage and maintenance yards in Concord, Hayward, and Richmond, with an additional maintenance only (no car storage) yard in Oakland. The Daly City car storage and maintenance yard opened in December 1988. The Oakland Airport Connector uses the Doolittle Maintenance and Storage Facility. eBART vehicles use a facility in Antioch.

== Fares ==
=== Fare schedule ===
BART has distance-based fares, which requires riders to use fare gates to both enter and exit, with a flat fare of $2.15 for trips under . A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube ($1.40), to/from Oakland International Airport ($6.70) or San Francisco International Airport ($4.95), and to/from San Mateo County ($1.45, except $1.25 for Daly City). The maximum fare, including both airport surcharges and the Transbay surcharge, is $17.60; the maximum without surcharges (–) is $10.30. , the average fare paid is $3.93.

Because of the varied fares, it is possible to enter the system with enough stored value for a shorter trip, but not a longer trip. Passengers without sufficient fare to complete their journey must use an add-fare machine to add value in order to exit the station. , entering and exiting at the same station incurs an &quot;excursion fare&quot; of $6.40 – significantly higher than many station-to-station fares. This was originally introduced to allow people to tour the then-futuristic system; it was kept to discourage undesired behaviors such as tech bus riders using BART parking lots. The excursion fare has been criticized for negatively impacting riders who leave stations during service disruptions (although station agents can allow riders to exit without fare payment). As of December 2022, BART is working to implement a 30-minute &quot;grace period&quot; before the fare is charged.

Unlike many other rapid transit systems, BART does not have weekly or monthly passes with unlimited rides. The only discount provided to the general public is a 6.25% reduction when &quot;high value tickets&quot; (only available on Clipper cards with autoload) are purchased with fare values of $48 and $64. 50% discount is available to youth aged 5–18 (children age 4 and under ride free), and a 62.5% discount is provided to seniors and the disabled. The Clipper START program for low-income adults provides a 50% discount. The San Francisco Muni and BART offer a combined monthly &quot;A&quot; Fast Pass, which allows unlimited rides on Muni services plus BART service within San Francisco.

In August 2022, BART launched Clipper BayPass, a two-year pilot program to examine the viability of a transit pass that is compatible with all the public transit agencies in the Bay Area. The program was initially made available to around 50,000 college students and affordable housing residents.

=== Fare media ===
The primary fare media for BART is the Clipper card, which is used by most Bay Area transit agencies. Clipper is a contactless smart card; passengers tap in and out at card readers on fare gates. Clipper cards in Apple Pay and Google Wallet electronic wallets can also be used.
BART&#x27;s original fare system used tickets made of a paper-plastic composite with a magnetic stripe. The tickets were sold by fare vending machines. When exiting, fare gates read the magnetically stored value on the card, encoded the new value with the fare subtracted, and printed the new value on the card. Tickets with no remaining value were retained by the machine rather than being returned. The entire fare system was designed and built by IBM under a $7 million contract (equivalent to $ million in ). It was the third system in the US to use encoded-value magnetic stripe tickets, following the Illinois Central Gulf commuter line (now the Metra Electric District) in 1964 and the PATCO Speedline in 1968.

Although tickets could be refilled at fare machines, riders often discarded tickets with small values remaining. BART formerly relied on unused ticket values on such discarded cards for additional revenue – as much as $9.9 million annually in 1999 (equivalent to $ million in ). Tickets stopped being sold in December 2020 in favor of Clipper cards, and can no longer be used. A 50-cent surcharge per trip (25 cents for discounted fares) is applied to all journeys made on paper tickets. However, due to supply chain shortages resulting in a lack of plastic Clipper cards, BART started issuing tickets again at the SFO station in October 2022. Sales of paper tickets again ended on September 30, 2023, and they were no longer usable after November 30.

BART first piloted a smart card for fare payment called EZ Rider in 2006; this program was abandoned in 2010 in favor of a regional farecard. In 2009, BART became one of the first five transit agencies to accept TransLink (later renamed Clipper) cards for fare payment and began phasing out tickets. By December 2020, all BART ticket machines, except for add-fare machines inside of paid areas, were converted to Clipper use only. Tickets were no longer accepted starting in December 2023.

== Ridership levels ==
For most of its history, BART&#x27;s ridership has reflected the U.S. economy, growing modestly during periods of economic expansion and dropping slightly during recessions. A major exception occurred in 1989 in the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake, which severely damaged the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, causing its closure for a month. BART became the only direct route between the East Bay and San Francisco, resulting in a nearly 17% ridership jump for the 1990 fiscal year. Ridership would not drop back to previous levels after the repair of the bridge until the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect the Bay Area in March 2020.

Between 2010 and 2015, BART ridership grew rapidly, mirroring strong economic growth in the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012.

After six straight years of expansion, ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, dropping by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. Although the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, showed an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in BART&#x27;s history, this was a 2.3% drop from FY 2016. Ridership continued to decline by approximately 3% per year between 2016 and 2019, mirroring a nationwide decline in mass transit ridership in the second half of the decade. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and LA Streetsblog attributed the national decline in ridership to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Ride-hailing has especially affected ridership on the lines to the San Francisco International Airport and the Oakland International Airport. At SFO, ride-hailing services grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport between 2014 and 2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART&#x27;s share of airport transit.

Stations in the urban cores of San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley have the highest ridership, while suburban stations record lower rider numbers. During fiscal year 2017, the busiest station was Embarcadero with 48,526 average weekday exits, followed by Montgomery Street with 45,386. The busiest station outside of San Francisco was 12th Street Oakland City Center with 13,965 riders, followed by 19th Street Oakland with 13,456. The least busy station was Oakland International Airport with 1,517 riders, while the least busy standard BART station was North Concord / Martinez with 2,702 weekday exits.

BART&#x27;s one-day ridership record was set on Halloween of 2012 with 568,061 passengers attending the San Francisco Giants&#x27; victory parade for their World Series championship. This surpassed the record set two years earlier of 522,198 riders in 2010 for the Giants&#x27; 2010 World Series victory parade. Before that, the record was 442,100 riders in October 2009, following an emergency closure of the Bay Bridge. During a planned closure of the Bay Bridge, there were 475,015 daily riders on August 30, 2013, making that the third highest ridership. On June 19, 2015, BART recorded 548,078 riders for the Golden State Warriors championship parade, placing second on the all-time ridership list.

BART set a Saturday record of 419,162 riders on February 6, 2016, coinciding with Super Bowl 50 events and a Golden State Warriors game. That easily surpassed the previous Saturday record of 319,484 riders, which occurred in October 2012, coinciding with several sporting events and Fleet Week. BART set a Sunday ridership record of 292,957 riders in June 2013, in connection with the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade, surpassing Sunday records set the previous two years when the Pride Parade was held.

Ridership dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns beginning in March 2020, during which BART was forced to drastically cut service. Ridership in the weeks immediately following the start of the Bay Area&#x27;s lockdown (on March 17, 2020) fell by as much as 93%. If ridership does not recover and additional revenue is not obtained, in the worst case the agency projected it would only be able to sustain trains on three lines running once an hour from 5am to 9pm weekdays, and would have to close nine stations. , weekday ridership is at 41% of pre-pandemic levels, Saturday ridership is at 63%, and Sunday ridership is at 75%.

In a 2022 survey, 31% of riders report household income below $50,000 (up from 26% in 2018), and 44% did not own a vehicle (up from 31% in 2018). Compared to the region, BART riders are more likely to be Black or Latino, and less likely to be White or Asian.

== Infrastructure ==

The entirety of the system runs in exclusive, grade-separated right-of-way. BART&#x27;s rapid transit revenue routes cover about with 50 stations. On the main lines, approximately of lines run through underground sections with on elevated tracks.

The main system uses an unusual broad gauge (mostly seen in India and Pakistan) and mostly ballastless track. Originally using flat-edge rail and wheelsets with cylindrical treads, in 2016 BART started switching to conical treads to reduce the noise caused by flange/rail contact and loss of adhesion of one of the wheels on curves. 1,000 volts DC is delivered to the trains over a third rail. An automated guideway transit line and an additional station were opened in 2014, using off-the-shelf cable car technology developed by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car: the Cable Liner. The section of the Antioch-SFO/Millbrae line east of the Pittsburg/Bay Point station, known as EBART, runs on conventional unelectrified rail.

Schedules call for trains to operate at up to , but certain segments (in particular, the Transbay Tube) are designed for operation when making up delays.

, rapid transit trains are typically six cars long, except on the Yellow Line, which uses eight-car trains. The minimum train length is four cars, and the maximum length is ten cars. A ten-car train is , the longest of any metro system in the United States, and extending slightly beyond the platforms. Cars are wide, the maximum gradient is four percent, and the minimum curve radius is . The combination of unique loading gauges and unusual rail technologies has complicated maintenance and increased cost of the system, as rolling stock requires custom wheelsets, brake systems, and power systems.

Many of the original 1970s-era stations, especially the aerial stations, feature simple Brutalist architecture, but newer stations are a mix of Neomodern and Postmodern architecture. The additional double-tracked upper deck of the Market Street subway and its four underground stations were built by BART for Muni Metro.

=== Lines ===
The routes run on track segments (&quot;lines&quot;), which are internally but not commonly known by letters.


=== Automation ===
BART was one of the first U.S. rail transit systems of any size to be substantially automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART&#x27;s Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator&#x27;s routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after station stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.

=== Parking ===
Many BART stations offer parking; however, underpricing causes station parking lots to overflow in the morning. Pervasive congestion and underpricing forces some to drive to distant stations in search of parking. BART operates Parking Lots at 36 stations and offers parking passes for designated spots at many stations.

BART hosts car sharing locations at many stations, a program introduced by City CarShare. Riders can transfer from BART and complete their journeys by car. BART offers long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor at most East Bay stations. Travelers must make an online reservation in advance and pay the daily fee of $5 before they can leave their cars at the BART parking lot.

Parking at stations in Santa Clara County (Milpitas and Berryessa/North San José) is managed by Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rather than BART.

=== Accessibility ===
All BART trains have dedicated spaces for wheelchair users and every station has accessible elevators. Estimated train arrival times and service announcements are both displayed on platform-level screens and announced audibly over the public address system. Station platforms are equipped with tactile paving to aid those with visual impairments, and Braille/tactile signs are present throughout stations.

==== Platform elevators ====

At some stations, the elevator to the platform (which is inside the paid area) is accessed from an unpaid area of the station. To enter the BART system at one of these stations, passengers using the elevator must first pass through a faregate into the paid area and then exit back through the swing gate adjacent to the station agent booth before taking the elevator to the platform. To exit the system from one of these stations, passengers must do the reverse: take the elevator from the platform to the concourse level, enter the paid area through the swing gate, and then process their ticket at a faregate to exit the paid area once again. Station agents may be able to assist upon request. The configuration of these stations enables fare evasion and causes confusion for passengers.

As of 2020, eighteen stations had a platform elevator outside of the paid area. Of these, three stations had ticket processing machines near the elevators that allowed elevator users to avoid having to enter, then exit, then re-enter the paid area; however, these did nothing to deter fare evasion. BART has begun to correct this issue at stations either by expanding the paid area on the concourse level or by installing a single accessible faregate in front of the elevator doors. By December 2021, the number of stations with elevators outside the paid area had been reduced to eight. Five of these stations had elevator faregates installed by January 2023, while the paid area on the concourse level at was expanded to include a new elevator as part of a larger renovation. As of March 2023, only Orinda and Powell Street stations have a platform elevator outside the paid area. New elevator faregates are expected to be installed at these two remaining stations by April 2023.

=== Cell phone and Wi-Fi ===
In 2004, BART became the first transit system in the United States to offer cellular telephone communication to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground. Service was made available for customers of Verizon Wireless, Sprint/Nextel, AT&amp;T Mobility, and T-Mobile in and between the four San Francisco Market Street stations from Civic Center to Embarcadero. In 2009, service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube, thus providing continuous cellular coverage between West Oakland and Balboa Park. In 2010, service was expanded to all underground stations in Oakland (19th Street, 12th Street/Oakland City Center, and Lake Merritt).

In 2007, BART ran a beta test of Wi-Fi Internet access for travelers. It initially included the four San Francisco downtown stations: Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell, and Civic Center. It included above ground testing to trains at BART&#x27;s Hayward Test Track. The testing and deployment were extended into the underground interconnecting tubes between the four downtown stations and further. The successful demonstration provided for a ten-year contract with WiFi Rail, Inc. for the services throughout the BART right of way. In 2008, the Wi-Fi service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube. BART terminated the relationship with Wi-Fi Rail in December 2014, citing that WiFi Rail had not submitted an adequate financial or technical plan for completing the network throughout the BART system.

In 2011, during the Charles Hill killing and aftermath BART disabled cell phone service to hamper demonstrators. The ensuing controversy drew widespread coverage that raised legal questions about free speech rights of protesters and the federal telecommunications laws that relate to passengers. In response, BART released an official policy on cutting off cell phone service.

== Organization and management ==
=== Governance ===
The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District is a special district consisting of Alameda County, Contra Costa County, and the City and County of San Francisco. San Mateo County, which hosts six BART stations, and Santa Clara County, which hosts two, are not part of the BART District. A nine-member elected Board of Directors represents nine districts. BART has its own police force.

While the district includes all of the cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART would take them (many Fremonters commute to San Jose). This would be remedied with the completion of the Silicon Valley BART extension. Phase I of the extension opened on June 13, 2020, giving San Jose its first BART station, Berryessa/North San José station.

=== Budget ===
In 2005, BART required nearly $300 million in funds after fares. About 37% of the costs went to maintenance, 29% to actual transportation operations, 24% to general administration, 8% to police services, and 4% to construction and engineering. In 2005, 53% of the budget was derived from fares, 32% from taxes, and 15% from other sources, including advertising, station retail space leasing, and parking fees. BART reported a farebox recovery ratio of 75.67% in February 2016, up from 2012&#x27;s 68.2%. BART train operators and station agents have a maximum salary of $62,000 per year with an average of $17,000 in overtime pay. (BART management claimed that in 2013, union train operators and station agents averaged about $71,000 in base salary and $11,000 in overtime, and pay a $92 monthly fee from that for health insurance.)

== Incidents and controversies ==
=== BART Police shootings ===

==== Oscar Grant III ====

On January 1, 2009, a BART Police officer, Johannes Mehserle, fatally shot Oscar Grant III. Eyewitnesses gathered direct evidence of the shooting with video cameras, which were later submitted to and disseminated by media outlets and watched hundreds of thousands of times in the days following the shooting. Both peaceful and violent demonstrations occurred protesting the shooting.

BART held multiple public meetings to ease tensions led by BART Director Carole Ward Allen who called on the BART Board to hire two independent auditors to investigate the shooting, and to provide recommendations to the board regarding BART Police misconduct. Director Ward Allen established BART&#x27;s first Police Department Review Committee and worked with Assemblyman Sandre Swanson to pass AB 1586 in the California State Legislature, which enforced civilian oversight of the BART Police Department. BART Director Lynette Sweet said that &quot;BART has not handled this [situation] correctly,&quot; and called for the BART police chief and general manager to step down, but only one other BART Director, Tom Radulovich, supported such action.

Mehserle was arrested and charged with murder, to which he pleaded not guilty. Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris filed a US$25 million wrongful death claim against the district on behalf of Grant&#x27;s daughter and girlfriend. Mehserle&#x27;s trial was subsequently moved to Los Angeles following concerns that he would be unable to get a fair trial in Alameda County. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty on a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was released on parole on June 13, 2011.

==== Charles Hill ====
On July 3, 2011, an officer of the BART Police shot and killed Charles Hill at Civic Center Station in San Francisco. Hill had thrown a bottle at the officers and was in the process of throwing a knife at them from a distance of about 15 feet when the first shot was fired.

On August 12, 2011, BART shut down cellphone services on the network for three hours in an effort to hamper possible protests against the shooting and to keep communications away from protesters at the Civic Center station in San Francisco. The shutdown caught the attention of state senator Leland Yee and international media, as well as drawing comparisons to the internet shutdowns during the Egyptian revolution earlier that year. Antonette Bryant, the union president for BART, stated that &quot;BART have lost our confidence and are putting rider and employee safety at risk.&quot;

Members of Anonymous broke into BART&#x27;s website and posted names, phone numbers, addresses, and e-mail information on the Anonymous website.

On August 15, 2011, there was more disruption in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; reported that the protests were a result of the shootings, including that of Oscar Grant.

On August 29, 2011, a coalition of nine public interest groups led by Public Knowledge filed an Emergency Petition asking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to declare &quot;that the actions taken by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (&quot;BART&quot;) on August 11, 2011, violated the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, when it deliberately interfered with access to Commercial Mobile Radio Service (&quot;CMRS&quot;) by the public&quot; and &quot;that local law enforcement has no authority to suspend or deny CMRS, or to order CMRS providers to suspend or deny service, absent a properly obtained order from the Commission, a state commission of appropriate jurisdiction, or a court of law with appropriate jurisdiction&quot;.

In December 2011 BART adopted a new &quot;Cell Service Interruption Policy&quot; that only allows shutdowns of cell phone services within BART facilities &quot;in the most extraordinary circumstances that threaten the safety of District passengers, employees and other members of public, the destruction of District property, or the substantial disruption of public transit service&quot;. According to a spokesperson for BART, under the new policy the wireless phone system would not be turned off under circumstances similar to those in August 2011. Instead police officers would arrest individuals who break the law.

In February 2012, the San Francisco District Attorney concluded that the BART Police Officer that shot and killed Charles Hill at the Civic Center BART station the previous July &quot;acted lawfully in self defense&quot; and would not face charges for the incident.

In March 2012, the FCC requested public comment on the question of whether or when the police and other government officials can intentionally interrupt cellphone and Internet service to protect public safety.

A federal lawsuit filed against BART by Charles Hill&#x27;s brother was dismissed in 2013. The federal judge concluded that &quot;a reasonable officer in that situation could believe that he was in danger of being hit by a knife after having had a bottle thrown at him.&quot; The lawyers of Hill&#x27;s family did not dispute that he had thrown a knife at the officer, but argued that both officers should have done more to deescalate the situation.

=== Worker fatalities ===

==== 1979 fatal electrical fire ====

In January 1979, an electrical fire occurred on a train as it was passing through the Transbay Tube. One firefighter (Lt. William Elliott, 50, of the Oakland Fire Department) was killed in the effort to extinguish the blaze. Since then, safety regulations have been updated.

==== James Strickland ====
On October 14, 2008, track inspector James Strickland was struck and killed by a train as he was walking along a section of track between the Concord and Pleasant Hill BART stations. Strickland&#x27;s death started an investigation into BART&#x27;s safety alert procedures. At the time of the accident, BART had assigned trains headed in opposite directions to a shared track for routine maintenance. BART came under further fire in February 2009 for allegedly delaying payment of death benefits to Strickland&#x27;s family.

==== October 2013 incident ====
On the afternoon of October 19, 2013, a BART employee and a contractor, who were inspecting tracks, were struck and killed near Walnut Creek by a train being moved for routine maintenance. A labor strike by BART&#x27;s two major unions was underway at the time, which caused BART to use an undertrained operator. Instead of the usual 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer was not in the cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the passenger compartment. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the accident occurred because BART facilitated access to the railway line. BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.

=== Crime ===
In mid-2017, BART came under criticism for refusing to publicly release video evidence of crimes committed at Oakland stations. That year, in at least three incidents, groups of young people had boarded stopped trains and attacked and robbed train riders.
In response to the criticism, a BART manager argued that &quot;to release these videos would create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district [...] and in addition it would create a racial bias in the riders against minorities on the trains.&quot; According to an internal memo, the agency decided to not issue a press release about one of the cases (where a woman had her phone stolen by one of a group of teenagers) in order to avoid having BART look &quot;crime ridden&quot; and because it would &quot;unfairly affect and characterize riders of color, leading to sweeping generalizations in media reports.&quot; A spokesman also stated that state laws about &quot;juvenile police records&quot; prohibited BART from releasing surveillance video.

In 2018, BART released surveillance video from one of the 2017 incidents, showing (as summarized by KRON4) &quot;the moments leading up to a mob-style attack on a BART train [... with] about 40 teens jumping the fare gates and pushing through the emergency gates at the station as an overwhelmed station agent calls for help.&quot; BART stated that two juveniles and an 18-year-old had been arrested for the incident, with the 18-year-old ending up serving one year in jail. In September 2017, six victims of the robberies/assaults filed suit against BART for gross negligence, claiming BART did not provide adequate security for its riders. In January 2020, two passengers affected by the same incident lost their lawsuits, one of them on the grounds that she had been attacked on the platform rather than on the train, outside of BART&#x27;s common carrier duties.

On July 22, 2018, a man fatally stabbed 18-year-old Nia Wilson with a knife as she exited a train car at the MacArthur station. This was the third homicide at a BART station within five days. In June 2019, the Alameda County Civil Grand Jury released a report documenting a 128% increase in thefts on BART between 2014 and 2018, and an 83% increase in aggravated assault during the same time period.
BART has historically suffered from fare evasion. Prior police crackdowns have occurred, but have not curbed the issue. An estimated 448 calls per month are made to BART police regarding fare evaders, and riders have observed that, at times, there are more fare evaders than paying customers. In April 2023, BART announced plans to install new gates resistant to fare evasion. The project, which was projected to cost $90 million, began with a pilot program at West Oakland station.

<text>Richmond is a city in western Contra Costa County, California, United States. The city was incorporated on August 3, 1905, and has a city council. Located in the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s East Bay region, Richmond borders San Pablo, Albany, El Cerrito and Pinole in addition to the unincorporated communities of North Richmond, Hasford Heights, Kensington, El Sobrante, Bayview-Montalvin Manor, Tara Hills, and East Richmond Heights, and for a short distance San Francisco on Red Rock Island in the San Francisco Bay.

Richmond is one of two cities, the other being San Rafael, that sits on the shores of both San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay. Its population was 116,448 as of the 2020 United States census making it the second largest city in the United States named Richmond after Richmond, Virginia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Richmond&quot; predates incorporation of the city by more than fifty years. Edmund Randolph, originally from Richmond, Virginia, represented the city of San Francisco when California&#x27;s first legislature met in San Jose in December 1849, and he became state assemblyman from San Francisco. Out of fondness for his hometown, Randolph persuaded a federal surveying party, surveying and mapping the San Francisco Bay, to place the names &quot;Point Richmond&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot; on their 1854 geodetic coastal map. The map was used at the terminal selected by the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad. By 1899 maps made by the railroad carried the name &quot;Point Richmond Avenue&quot;, a county road that later became Barrett Avenue, a central street in Richmond. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad purchased the railroad making their terminus at Richmond. The first post office opened in 1900, and the city of Richmond incorporated in 1905.

==History==
The Ohlone were the first inhabitants of the Richmond area, settling an estimated 5,000 years ago. They spoke the Chochenyo language, and subsisted as hunter-gatherers and harvesters.

===Origins===
The site that would eventually become the city of Richmond was part of the Rancho San Pablo land granted to Don Francisco María Castro, from which the nearby town of San Pablo inherited its name; the Point Richmond area was known originally as The Potrero and then renamed as Point Stevens in early charts of San Francisco Bay. Point Richmond was an island, but industrial development and deliberate fill connected it to the mainland by the early 1900s.

On July 4, 1900, the Santa Fe Railroad&#x27;s western terminus was established at Point Richmond with ferry connections from Ferry Point in the Brickyard Cove area to San Francisco. The Santa Fe railroad also built a major rail yard next to Point Richmond. It constructed a tunnel through the Potrero San Pablo ridge to run track from the yard to a ferry landing from which freight cars could be transshipped to San Francisco. Where this track crosses the main street in Point Richmond, there remain two of the last operational wigwag grade crossing signals in the United States, and the only surviving examples of the &quot;upside-down&quot; type. The wigwag is a type of railroad crossing signal that was phased out in the 1970s and &#x27;80s across the country. There was controversy in 2005 when the State Transportation Authority ordered the BNSF railroad company to upgrade the railroad crossing signals. A compromise was achieved that included installing new modern crossing gates, red lights and bells while not removing, but simply shutting off, the historic ones and preserving their functionality for special events.

Standard Oil set up operations on land sold by Emily Tewksbury in 1901, including what is now the Chevron Richmond Refinery and tank farm, which Chevron still operates. There is a pier into San Francisco Bay south of Point Molate for oil tankers.

===Early days===
The city of Richmond was incorporated in 1905. Until the enactment of prohibition in 1919, the city had the largest winery in the world; the small abandoned village of Winehaven remains fenced off along Western Drive in the Point Molate Area. Richmond was a small town at that time, with some industrial development centered on the waterfront based around the railroad and oil refineries.

The Pullman Company also established a major facility in Richmond in the early 20th century. The facility connected with both the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific and serviced their passenger coach equipment. The Pullman Company was a large employer of African American men, who worked mainly as porters on the Pullman cars. Many of them settled in the East Bay, from Richmond to Oakland, before World War II.
From 1917 and throughout the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan was active in the city.

In 1930 the Ford Motor Company opened the Richmond Assembly Plant, which later moved to Milpitas in 1956. The old Ford plant in Richmond has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. In 2004 it was purchased by developer Eddie Orton, who converted it into an events center named Ford Point Building–The Craneway.

===Wartime boomtown and shifting demographics===
At the onset of World War II, the four Richmond Shipyards were built along Richmond&#x27;s waterfront, employing thousands of workers, many migrating to Richmond from other parts of the country after being recruited. These new workers generally lived in housing constructed specifically for the wartime boom, scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including Richmond, Berkeley and Albany. Many of these new migrants were Black Americans from the South and to a lesser extent the Midwest who took jobs in heavy industry and transport as those industries expanded to meet the needs of the war economy, while increased numbers of women also joined the industrial workforce for the first time as large numbers of working-age men were drafted for the war effort. During the war, Richmond&#x27;s population increased dramatically, rising from 23,000 in 1940 to 114,899 in 1942 and peaking at around 120,000 by 1945.

A specially built rail line, the Shipyard Railway, transported workers to the shipyards. Kaiser&#x27;s Richmond shipyards built 747 Victory and Liberty ships for the war effort, more than any other site in the U.S. The shipyards broke many records, including the completion of a Liberty ship in just five days. On average the yards built a new ship in 30 days.

The medical system established for the shipyard workers at the Richmond Field Hospital eventually became today&#x27;s Kaiser Permanente HMO. The hospital remained in operation until 1993, when it was replaced by the Richmond Medical Center hospital, which has since expanded to a multi-building campus.

Point Richmond was Richmond&#x27;s original commercial hub, but a new downtown arose in the center of the city along Macdonald Avenue during the war. It was populated by department stores such as Kress, J.C. Penney, Sears, Macy&#x27;s, and Woolworth&#x27;s.
===Post-war decline and rebound===
When the war ended the shipyard workers were no longer needed, and a decades-long population decline ensued. The census listed 99,545 residents in 1950. By 1960 much of the temporary housing built for the shipyard workers was torn down, and the population dropped to about 71,800.

Just before his April 1968 assassination, Martin Luther King Jr. had been working on plans for the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign, including a multi-city tour of the U.S. with a stop in Richmond. His son, Martin Luther King III, completed the Poverty in America Tour in 2007, stopping in Richmond. Unrest in late June 1968, sparked by the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy, damaged businesses in downtown along Macdonald Avenue. Most notably, the Travalini Furniture Store was destroyed by fire, which was assumed to be the result of the violent protests, but according to Fraser Felter, who was a reporter for the &quot;Richmond Independent&quot;, police sources told him the fire was set to avoid a debt instead by destroying store records.
In the 1970s, the Hilltop area was developed in Richmond&#x27;s northern suburbs, further depressing the downtown area as it drew retail clients and tenants away to the large indoor Hilltop Mall, which opened in 1976. The shopping mall, last named Hilltop Horizon, was opened under Taubman Centers, and has been sold since then to GM Pension Trust (1998), Simon Property Group (2007), Jones Lang LaSalle (2012), LBG Real Estate (2017), and Prologis (2021), who announced plans to close and demolish the building, reusing the land for a mixed-use development including residential, retail, and logistics facilities.

In the late 1990s the Richmond Parkway was built along Richmond&#x27;s western industrial and northwestern parkland, connecting Interstates 80 and 580. Construction of the Parkway, which follows the alignment of SR 93 as proposed in 1958, started in 1990 and completed in 1996 at a cost of $193 million. However, Caltrans issued a letter in 1998 saying it would not take over responsibility for the road unless it was brought up to expressway standards; as it was cost-prohibitive to convert it, the road remains the responsibility of the city and county.

In 2006, the city celebrated its centennial. This coincided with the repaving and streetscaping project of Macdonald Avenue. The city&#x27;s old rundown commercial district along Macdonald has been designated the city&#x27;s &quot;Main Street District&quot; by the state of California. This has led to funding of improvements in the form of state grants.

===Climate===
Richmond, like much of the coastal East Bay, enjoys a very mild Mediterranean climate year round. The climate is slightly warmer than the coastal areas of San Francisco, the Peninsula, and Marin County; it is however more temperate than areas further inland. The average highs range from and the lows range from year round. Richmond usually enjoys an &quot;Indian summer&quot;, and September is, on average, the warmest month. January is on average the coldest month.

The highest recorded temperature in Richmond was in September 1971 while the coldest was in December 1990.

The rainy season begins in late October and ends in April, with some showers in May. Most of the rain occurs during stronger storms which occur between November and March and drop of rain per month. January and February are the rainiest months.

Like most of the Bay Area, Richmond is made up of several microclimates. Southern parts of the city and the ridges receive more fog than northern areas. Summer temperatures are higher in inland areas, where the moderating influence of San Francisco Bay is lessened. The average wind speed is with stronger winds from March through August; the strongest winds are in June. The city also enjoys more than 80% sunshine seven months out of the year and ten months with 60% or more. December and January are the darkest months with about 45% average brightness. The city experiences virtually no snowfall, and brief hail annually.

==Environment==

Richmond is home to many species of animals. Canada geese visit the city on their annual migrations. Harbor seals live on the Castro Rocks, and pigeons and gulls populate the sidewalks and parking lots. Tadpoles and frogs can be found in the local creeks and vernal pools. Field mice and lizards are also found. Herons and egrets nest in protected areas on Brooks Island. Deer, falcons, raccoons, ducks, foxes, owls, and mountain lions live in Wildcat Canyon and Point Pinole Regional Shoreline.

A license is needed for fishing on the waterfront or city waters but not on the piers, where in addition to crabs, sturgeon are plentiful and bat rays may also be found. Striped bass, bat rays, leopard sharks, surf perch, jacksmelt, sturgeon, white croaker, and flounders are also found. Richmond is one of the few places where you can find the rare Olympia oyster on the West Coast, in the waters along the refinery&#x27;s shoreline. Rainbow trout have recently returned to San Pablo and Wildcat creeks.

Red-tailed hawks patrol the skies. Monarch butterflies migrate through the city on their journey between Mexico and Canada. Wildcat Marsh has two ponds where Canada geese often rest, and is also the home of the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse and California clapper rail. Another endangered species in the city is the Santa Cruz tarweed which survives alongside Interstate 80. Wildcat Canyon also hosts falcons and vultures. Threatened black rails also live in the city&#x27;s marshes.

After a baby gray whale was beached on the Point Richmond shore in May 2007, its rotting corpse became bothersome to neighbors. Removal was delayed as various agencies argued over which would have to pay for it, at an eventual cost of $18,000.

Richmond is also home to one of the last pristine moist grassland habitats in the entire Bay Area at the former Campus Bay UC Berkeley Field Station near Meeker Slough. Richmond residents, however, have limited access to other environmental benefits. Because of the refineries located in Richmond, air quality is particularly low, and residents are especially at risk of air-pollution-related health issues.

In 2006, the city was sued by an environmental group for dumping raw sewage into the Bay. Councilmember Tom Butt was very vocal on the subject, accusing the city council of turning a blind eye to the problem.

A 60-acre, 10.5-megawatt solar farm was opened within the city in 2018. The farm sits on a former landfill owned by Chevron.

==Crime==
The city has in the past suffered from a high crime rate; at one point, the city council requested a declaration of a state of emergency and asked for the intervention of the Contra Costa County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. Murder, vehicle theft, and larceny rates remain high, although they tend to be concentrated in the Iron Triangle and adjacent unincorporated North Richmond, which is outside the jurisdiction of the Richmond Police Department. By 1991, the city&#x27;s all-time high of 62 homicides, among a population of 98,000, was seven times the national average. The portion of these homicides that were drug- or gang-related increased from 5 percent to 55 percent between 1989 and 1991.

Despite the city making extreme headway in crime reduction and prevention, Richmond received widespread attention in 2009 when a girl was gang raped at a homecoming dance at Richmond High School.

In 2007, Richmond opened a program to prevent gun violence, the Office of Neighborhood Safety. The program collects information and analyzes public records to determine &quot;the 50 people in Richmond most likely to shoot someone and to be shot themselves.&quot; It then offers selected individuals &quot;a spot in a program that includes a stipend to turn their lives around&quot;. &quot;Over an 18-month period, if the men demonstrate better behavior, ONS offers them up to $1,000 a month in cash, plus opportunities to travel beyond Richmond.&quot;

In 2004, Richmond was ranked the 12th most dangerous city in America. Those rankings have changed, and Richmond is no longer ranked as a &quot;most dangerous&quot; city, in either California or the United States. This is in large part due to the efforts of Police Chief Chris Magnus, who established &quot;community policing&quot;, which involves police officers engaging with affected high crime communities.

==Disasters==
Richmond lies in the volatile California region that has a potential for devastating earthquakes. Many buildings were damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The city has also had at least one minor tornado. The Chevron Richmond Refinery had highly noted chemical leaks in the 1990s. The company has been fined thousands, and sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars.

Richmond has a siren system consisting of 17 emergency warning sirens located across the city; they are tested on the first Wednesday of every month, at 11 am PST (12 pm PDT), and are usually used to warn of toxic chemical releases from the Chevron Richmond Refinery.
In a July 26, 1993, industrial accident, a General Chemical company rail tanker car containing oleum overheated and exploded in the General Chemical railyard. This resulted in a area contaminated with the poisonous gas, and led to 25,000 people landing in the hospital. The incident led to lawsuits, and has been referred to as a mini-Bhopal.

=== 2007 San Francisco Bay Oil Spill ===
The city&#x27;s shoreline and wildlife were seriously affected by the 2007 San Francisco Bay oil spill. Beaches and shoreline were closed, but later reopened. Keller Beach was closed to public access for swimmers.

=== 2010 sinkhole ===
On April 15, 2010, a sinkhole roughly deep appeared at the intersection of El Portal Drive and Via Verdi. Although no one was hurt, a car fell into the sinkhole.

=== 2012 Chevron Refinery fire ===
On August 6, 2012, at around 6:15 PM, a large fire erupted at the Chevron refinery, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the surrounding area and resulting in nearly 15,000 people to seek medical treatment following the incident. Just minutes after the fire was reported, Contra Costa Health Services notified residents “shelter in place”; the local siren system was activated and several messages were issued through the Emergency Alert System. The fire was reported contained at around 10:40 PM.

==Economy==


Many industries have been and are still sited in Richmond. It had a dynamite and gunpowder works (the Giant Powder Company, closed in 1960, now the site of Point Pinole Regional Shoreline), the last active whaling station in the country at Point Molate (closed in 1971), and one of the world&#x27;s largest wineries (Winehaven), closed by Prohibition in 1919.

During World War II, Richmond developed rapidly as a heavy industrial town, chiefly devoted to shipbuilding. Its major activity now is as a seaport, with 26 million tons of goods shipped through Port Richmond in 1993, mostly oil and petroleum products. The seaport is also home to a major oil refinery operated by Chevron Corporation. The Social Security Administration employs over 1,000 at its regional office and program service center in Downtown Richmond. Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s Richmond Medical Center hospital in the Downtown Richmond is one of the largest employers in the city.

===Retail===
The Hilltop District includes Prologis Hilltop Center and a 16-screen Century Theatres alongside Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center. The 23rd Street business district has evolved into a predominantly Latino neighborhood over the last twenty years as have the storefronts.

In the Downtown Richmond District the Richmond Shopping Center was built as part of the city&#x27;s &quot;main street&quot; revitalization efforts.

The Macdonald 80 Shopping Center is a commercial plot along the trunk route of Macdonald Avenue which has been designated the city&#x27;s main street under the aforementioned program. It was once anchored by the now-defunct Montgomery Wards and a Toys&quot;R&quot;Us. Demolition of the former buildings and construction of a new shopping mall were completed in 2006.

===Redevelopment===

The former Richmond Shipyard No. 2 and Inner Harbor were transformed starting in the late 1980s into a multiunit residential area, now known as Marina Bay. Starting in the early 2000s, the city began an aggressive redevelopment effort spurring exurban tract housing, condominiums, townhomes, a transit village, and terraced hillside subdivisions. The city also created a redevelopment agency that refurbished Macdonald Avenue, funded the Metro Walk transit village, resurrected the Macdonald 80 Shopping Center, and created the Richmond Greenway rails-to-trails trail and urban farming project. Since 1996, new homes have increased in price by 32%, and there has been a 65.6% increase in the total amount of new dwellings built annually.

Country Club Vista is a development surrounding the Richmond Country Club to the south and north. It includes suburban style tract houses with cul-de-sac courts and small yards. Seacliff, at Point Richmond, is a development of luxury waterfront homes built on a terraced hillside. San Marcos is a series of about ten condominium multistory buildings between The Shops at Hilltop and Country Club Vista. Richmond Transit Village has been constructed in the former west parking lot and an adjacent empty lot of the combined Richmond BART and Amtrak station. The development is part of the city&#x27;s downtown revitalization efforts.

===Richmond CARES===
On September 11, 2013, the seven-member Richmond City Council, in a four-to-three vote, decided to pursue a scheme for using eminent domain to buy out mortgages. The vote was on &quot;[setting] up a Joint Powers Authority to bring more cities into the plan&quot;. However, at least five votes would be needed before any mortgage could actually be bought out. North Las Vegas, Nevada and California governments including El Monte Fontana, the city of Ontario and San Bernardino County had considered such plans but decided not to pursue them. The vote made Richmond the first to accept the idea. The plan had been opposed by the vice-mayor and some members of the city council, who said it would &quot;compromise&quot; the city&#x27;s finances.

Critics of the plan noted that the company Mortgage Resolution Partners stood to potentially profit: it would receive $4,500 from the new lenders for each refinanced mortgage for arranging the financing to purchase the original loans and for handling all legal, administrative, and refinancing operations (an amount matching what lenders are compensated for under the Federal HARP loan modification program). Critics also questioned the inclusion of wealthy neighborhoods such as &quot;the area near the Richmond Country Club&quot;. The Western Contra Costa Association of Realtors hired a public relations agency and sent mass mailings warning against the scheme; its advertising was &quot;funded, in part, by more than $70,000 from the California Association of Realtors and the National Associations of Realtors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://richmondconfidential.org/2013/09/10/realtors-and-residents-debate-richmonds-eminent-domain-plan/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo had sued, claiming the program was unconstitutional. &quot;[T]he National Housing Law Project, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, Bay Area Legal Aid, the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, and the California Reinvestment Coalition&quot; opposed the suit, calling the banks&#x27; request for an injunction against the city &quot;discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act&quot;.

Supporters of the plan include the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell University.

==Casinos==
Many casinos have been proposed for the West Contra Costa area. Point Molate would have a casino, resort, and a luxury shopping mall. Sugar Bowl Casino proposed a casino, a steakhouse, and a buffet promoted by the Pomo Tribe&#x27;s Scotts Valley Band near the border between North Richmond and the city of Richmond&#x27;s Parchester Village, whose residents have lauded it as a boon to fighting crime by adding more of a police presence and creating jobs for shiftless youth, but residents from neighboring newly developed sub-divisions along the Richmond Country Club were fervently opposed based on potential losses to property values. Casino San Pablo has already been built in neighboring San Pablo, with 2,500 slots. The projects have been the subject of much civic debate; supporters contend that the often cash-strapped government would get a major new source of revenue, while opponents air their concerns over the ramifications, including an increase in already high crime rates, lowered property values, and worsening neighborhood quality of life.

Point Molate is currently slated to either become a housing and conference center, a casino resort shopping area, or a large regional park.

In 2010, the city approved the environmental review of the plan in which the tribe agreed to contain development of the casino to the footprint of the buildings on the former naval depot site. The lobbying and reports required by Richmond have cost the tribe $15 million. This approval won over the region&#x27;s strict environmentalists and many council members. Later that year residents were given the opportunity to weigh in on the issue and voted on the non-binding measure U to determine their approval of the project. 58% of voters opposed the $1 billion project. Citing the people&#x27;s opposition and the inability to negotiate several key points with the developer, the city council voted down the project in 2011. Councilman Nat Bates remained a proponent of the plan with its projected 17,000 jobs, while the remainder of the council was chagrined at the fact that there was no guarantee that the jobs would go to Richmonders. The city of San Pablo, whose lifeline is their card club, Casino San Pablo, was elated. The Guideville Band of Pomo Indians was given the opportunity of 150 days to create a non-casino plan for the site such as alternatives in the environmental report for a convention center, conference center, hotel, spa, and housing.

==Government==
The Richmond city government operates under a council-manager system with seven members (including mayor and vice mayor) elected to alternating four-year terms. Politically, the city is a Democratic stronghold. By the early 1990s, not a single Republican remained on the council. The city council has four African Americans, four whites and two Latinos.

The position of Mayor rotated between members of the Richmond City Council until 1981, when the office became an elected position. George D. Carroll, who was voted by the City Council to become Mayor on July 6, 1964, was described at the time as &quot;the first Negro mayor in California and first in America with the exception of small, scattered all-Negro communities in the Deep South,&quot;. George Livingston Sr. was the first elected African American mayor. He served from 1985 to 1993. Rosemary Corbin served as the mayor from 1993 to 2001. The current mayor Eduardo Martinez was elected Mayor of Richmond in 2022, winning 39% of the vote. Prior to winning the mayoral election, he had served on the Richmond City Council since 2014. Martinez, a former primary school teacher, is Richmond&#x27;s first Latino mayor and a vocal critic of Chevron.

Years of political domination by the local firefighters union subsided after an FBI corruption investigation. In the early 2000s Gayle McLaughlin was the first Green elected to the council, with the support of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA), a coalition of liberal Democrats, progressive independents, and Greens. In November 2006, McLaughlin was elected mayor, defeating incumbent first-term Mayor Irma Anderson. During McLaughlin&#x27;s mayoralty (2007–2015), Richmond was the nation&#x27;s largest city with a Green Party mayor.

In 2006, the city implemented a computer program that it had ordered from a German firm that provides the city with statistical interactive maps. These maps cover such areas as signage locations, streets, crime hot-spots, and zoning information. In 2007 the city won a contest in which its previously substandard website was upgraded and improved to make it more modern and functional. The prize includes two years of free webmastering.

Mayor McLaughlin and Councilperson Butt opposed Chevron&#x27;s Renewal Project that would replace their 1950s era Hydrogen Manufacturing plant with a newer more efficient plant and would increase pollution by using dirtier, thicker, but cheaper crude oil.

The city of Richmond has eight community centers which are located within city parks. Many of the city&#x27;s community centers were closed in the early 2000s following budget miscalculations and financial difficulties. In the 2006 city elections many candidates ran on platforms promising to reopen these community centers, most of which had been closed due to budget cuts. That election also featured a city sales tax increase, Measure Q, which failed.

There are 53 voting precincts in Richmond. Richmond has formerly been home to black culture and activist movements, most notably the Black Panther Party.

Richmond became the first city in the United States to pass a resolution for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war on October 25, 2023, eighteen days after the outbreak of hostilities.

===Cannabis===
The city has eight cannabis dispensaries, and although the city has passed legislation approving them and has legalized their presence, city management does not accept their legality. In fact, the city had sued to close them. It is trying to enforce an injunction that would suspend their operating licenses. Although the city council has passed an ordinance permitting the dispensaries, city management refuses to cooperate with the spirit of the law because it has yet to take effect. The question remains whether the clubs will be closed before the law allowing them to open takes effect.

In 2019 the city approved &quot;Power Plant Park&quot; a marijuana farm consisting of 45 greenhouses on 18 acres north of North Richmond near Breuner Marsh and a solar farm. It is expected the create 500 new jobs and become a major economic contributor to the city.

===Political party affiliation===
According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Richmond has 52,364 registered voters. Of those, 33,166 (63.3%) are registered Democrats, 2,979 (5.7%) are registered Republicans, 14,108 (26.9%) have declined to state a political party, and 4.1% are registered members of a third party.

==Education==

The public schools in all portions of Richmond are administered by the West Contra Costa Unified School District, formerly the Richmond Unified School District. There are also many private schools, mostly Catholic schools under the authority of the Diocese of Oakland.

The city has four high schools: De Anza High School, Salesian College Preparatory, Richmond High School, and Kennedy High School. In addition, there are four charter high schools, Making Waves Academy, Aspire Richmond California College Preparatory Academy, Leadership Public Schools: Richmond and West County Community High School, although West County Community High School was shut down in 2012. In 2012, Richmond Charter Academy, part of the Amethod Public Schools system, opened a charter middle school. There are also three middle schools, 16 elementary schools, and seven elementary-middle schools. Richmond also hosts three adult education schools.

The Contra Costa Community College District serves all of Contra Costa County, and Richmonders who decide to attend a community college typically go to Contra Costa College, located in the neighboring city of San Pablo.

79.8% of Richmonders have a high school diploma or equivalent, compared with 84.2% nationally. But 27.1% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree compared with a statistically similar 27.2% nationally.

Since an exit exam requirement was implemented for California high schools, the CAHSEE, some Richmond high school students have been protesting against it. Some students sued the district in an attempt to eliminate the requirement. In July 2007, a compromise was reached in which the district would provide two additional years of educational assistance for the purposes of passing the exam. That year, only 28% of Richmond High School students had passed the CAHSEE, a prerequisite for graduating.

===Obesity===
All Richmond schools have banned junk food, such as candy, soda, Twinkies, pizza, and other similar items in attempt to curb childhood obesity and change children&#x27;s eating habits. It has been speculated that this was done preemptively, because some believe the state will soon mandate such restrictions. Despite these efforts, soda consumption in Richmond schools has not diminished. Furthermore, the current 32% of Richmond children who are obese will increase the current 24% adult obesity rate to 42% according to the Contra Costa County Health Services. This led the city council to approve a referendum on a 1 cent per ounce tax on beverages with a high sugar content for the 2012 elections, a first in the nation. The measure was opposed by councilmembers Corky Boozé and Nat Bates, who stated that he knew &quot;many obese people that are perfectly healthy&quot; and that it was &quot;elitist&quot; and &quot;targeted black&quot; people respectively. Members Jovanka Beckles and Jeff Ritterman – the latter a cardiologist – expressed horror at the obesity rate. Beckles chastized the other black members (Bates and Boozé) for not supporting the measure, as she found that the epidemic most affected people of color like themselves. The revenues would have been used to counter obesity through health and fitness campaigns and expenditures. The referendum was defeated by voters in the November 2012 election.

==Attractions and landmarks==

The city of Richmond has dozens of parks, national historic parks, and 10 sites listed under the National Register of Historic Places.

===Point Richmond===

Point Richmond, a neighborhood in Richmond, is known for its small-town appearance. &quot;The Point&quot;, as it is known by locals, offers owner-operated stores, coffee shops, historic benches, and streetlights. The Masquers Playhouse is a performing arts center that offers shows and productions year round. Hotel Mac is one of the oldest buildings in the area and has classic early 20th century architecture, like many other buildings in the area. There is also The Plunge, a natatorium which had been closed due to seismic safety issues but was re-opened in August 2010 after the retrofitting was completed. The city expressed a desire to demolish the building at one point, but this was halted by the actions of a neighborhood preservation campaign which continues its mission to &quot;Save the Plunge!&quot;.

The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge extends across San Pablo Bay, entering Richmond just to the north of Point Richmond. The bridge is the origin of the term &quot;rollercoaster span&quot;, due to its curves, bumps, and appearance, which have also earned the bridge the nickname of &quot;the rollercoaster bridge&quot;. It was completed in 1957, and connects Contra Costa County with Marin County. Automobiles are charged a $6 toll in the westbound (towards Marin) direction only.

The Richmond Chevron Refinery occupies most of the land north of Point Richmond and the eastern end of the bridge. Some areas of this northern section are protected and publicly accessible, including Point Molate Beach Park, a park on the western coast of Richmond along Western Drive. It was originally a Chinese shrimp camp in the 1870s. On the northern end, near Point San Pablo, there is a yacht harbor that accommodates hundreds of private boats.

===Brickyard Cove===
The Ferry Point Tunnel is one of the oldest tunnels in California, connecting Point Richmond with Brickyard Cove to the south. Built in 1899, this structure still gives access to many attractions and neighborhoods in Brickyard Cove. The tunnel goes to the Golden State Railroad Museum, the USS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot;, and many beaches and parks, and to Ferry Point where an abandoned ferry-rail pier stands with a historic ferry slip still standing, though somewhat damaged by fire. It can be viewed from an adjacent fishing pier.
The Santa Fe Railroad established ferry service to San Francisco in 1900 and later built a station that operated as the western terminus for the railroad from 1903 to 1992. It has now been transformed into a museum to exemplify the feel of the terminal in that era. The Golden State Railroad Museum is a complex series of model railroad layouts in a museum in the Brickyard Cove area of Point Richmond. A visitor can operate trains of various eras, and there are miniature freight and passenger terminals, trestles, tunnels, and meticulously detailed town and city scenes, many of which are copied from real life scenes of the 1950s.

Keller Beach is one of the city&#x27;s beaches, located at Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline, a park in Brickyard Cove. It offers picnicking, sunbathing, wading, and swimming. The beach is overlooked by vehicles exiting the Brickyard Cove drive, Ferry Point tunnel and houses on the steep cliffs above. The beach, as with most of the cove, offers spectacular panoramic bay views of the Oakland hills, bridges, the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate.

===Southern waterfront / Shipyards===

Further east, the is a restored World War II Victory ship, the 558th ship made in Richmond. It is moored in the former Richmond Shipyard No. 3. Liberty and Victory ships built in Richmond transported troops and supplies during World War II.

East across the Harbor/Santa Fe Channel, the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park is in Richmond, and commemorates women&#x27;s shipbuilding and support for the war effort in the 1940s. The visitor&#x27;s center is in a small utility building next to the former Ford Assembly Plant. Regular ferry service is provided to San Francisco from the Richmond Ferry Terminal via San Francisco Bay Ferry.

This area is connected by the San Francisco Bay Trail to several city parks along the waterfront, including Lucretia Edwards Shoreline Park, Marina Bay Park and the Rosie the Riveter Memorial, Barbara and Jay Vincent Park, and Shimada Friendship Park. The Bay Trail continues past these parks further southeast to Point Isabel Regional Shoreline and beyond to parks in El Cerrito, Albany, and Berkeley.

===Civic Center===

In 1990, a major improvement program was designed by the city also involving Knox Freeway. It is named after the founder of the Port of Richmond, Henry Cutting.
* 23rd Street runs through the heart of the city north–south from where it turns to Marina Bay Parkway at I-580 through this heavily Latino business district and neighborhood to San Pablo Avenue in the city of San Pablo.

The voyage took approximately 45 minutes each way. The service began in 1999, but was discontinued in the late 2000s in the economic downturn following the dot-com bust. Ferry ridership plummeted and the service became economically unsustainable, which led Red and White Fleet to discontinue the service. The Richmond ferry terminal is at Ford Point located adjacent to the historic Ford Plant in Marina Bay which is now open as an industrial park and under renovation. The terminal had its own dedicated AC Transit feeder service from Point Richmond and downtown Richmond with route 374 also now discontinued. A new ferry service from Richmond is planned for 2018 by the San Francisco Bay Area Water Transit Authority. The new ferry will take only half an hour to San Francisco and will use the existing terminal and parking facilities at Ford Point in Marina Bay.

<text>Asaṅga (Sanskrit: असंग, , ; Romaji: &quot;Mujaku&quot;) (fl. 4th century C.E.) was one of the most important spiritual figures of Mahayana Buddhism and the founder of the Yogachara school. Traditionally, he and his half-brother Vasubandhu are regarded as the major classical Indian Sanskrit exponents of Mahayana Abhidharma, &quot;Vijñanavada&quot; (awareness only; also called &quot;Vijñaptivāda&quot;, the doctrine of ideas or percepts, and &quot;Vijñaptimātratā-vāda&quot;, the doctrine of &#x27;mere representation) thought and Mahayana teachings on the bodhisattva path. He is also traditionally considered as one of the seventeen Nalanda masters who taught at the monastery which is located in modern-day Bihar.

==Biography==
There are differing views as to Asaṅga&#x27;s birthplace. Some sources record that he was born in Puruṣapura (present day Peshawar in Pakistan) in a Brahmin family, which at that time was part of the ancient kingdom of Gandhāra. However the writings of Buton Rinchen Drub state that Asanga and his brother, Vasubandhu, were born in Central India. Current scholarship places him in the fourth century CE. He was perhaps originally a member of the Mahīśāsaka school or the Mūlasarvāstivāda school but later converted to Mahāyāna. According to some scholars, Asaṅga&#x27;s frameworks for Abhidharma writings retained many underlying Mahīśāsaka traits, but other scholars argue that there is insufficient data to determine which school he originally belonged to.

In the record of his journeys through the kingdoms of India, Xuanzang wrote that Asaṅga was initially a Mahīśāsaka monk, but soon turned toward the Mahāyāna teachings. Asaṅga had a half-brother, Vasubandhu, who was a monk from the Sarvāstivāda school. Vasubandhu is said to have taken up Mahāyāna Buddhism after meeting with Asaṅga and one of Asaṅga&#x27;s disciples.

Asaṅga spent many years in serious meditation and study under various teachers but the narrative of the 6th century monk Paramārtha states that he was unsatisfied with his understanding. Paramārtha then recounts how he used his meditative powers (siddhis) to travel to Tuṣita Heaven to receive teachings from Maitreya Bodhisattva on emptiness, and how he continued to travel to receive teachings from Maitreya on the Mahayana sutras.

Xuanzang (fl. c. 602 – 664), a Chinese monk who traveled to India to study in the Yogacara tradition tells a similar account of these events:

Modern scholars disagree on whether the figure of Maitreya in this story is to be considered as Asaṅga&#x27;s human teacher or as a visionary experience in meditation. Scholars such as Frauwallner held that this figure, sometimes termed Maitreya-nātha, was an actual historical person and teacher. Other scholars argue that this figure was the tutelary deity of Asaṅga (&quot;Iṣṭa-devatā&quot;) as well as numerous other Yogacara masters, a point noted by the 6th century Indian monk Sthiramati. Whatever the case, Asaṅga&#x27;s experiences led him to travel around India and propagate the Mahayana teachings. According to Taranatha&#x27;s &quot;History of Buddhism in India&quot;, he founded 25 Mahayana monasteries in India.

Among the most famed monasteries that he established was Veluvana in Magadha region of what is now Bihar. It was here that he hand-picked eight chosen disciples who would all become famed in their own right and spread the Mahayana. 

==Works==

Asaṅga went on to write some key treatises (shastras) of the Yogācāra school. Over time, many different works were attributed to him (or to Maitreya, with Asaṅga as transmitter), although there are discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning which works are attributed to him. Modern scholars have also problematized and questioned these attributions after critical textual study of the sources. The many works attributed to this figure can be divided into the three following groups.

The first are three works which are widely agreed by ancient and modern scholars to be by Asaṅga:

* &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (Summary of the Great Vehicle), a systematic exposition of the major tenets of the Yogacara school in ten chapters. Considered his magnum opus, survives in one Tibetan and four Chinese translations.
* &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya,&quot; a short summary of the main Mahayana Abhidharma doctrines, in a traditional Buddhist Abhidharma style similar to non-Mahayana expositions. According to Walpola Rahula, the thought of this work is closer to that of the Pali &quot;&quot; than is that of the Theravadin Abhidhamma.
* &quot;Xianyang shengjiao lun,&quot; variously retranslated into Sanskrit as &quot;Āryadeśanāvikhyāpana, Āryapravacanabhāṣya, Prakaraṇāryaśāsanaśāstra&quot;, &quot;Śāsanodbhāvana&quot;, and &quot;Śāsanasphūrti.&quot; A work strongly based on the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;. Only available in Xuanzang&#x27;s Chinese translation, but parallel Sanskrit passages can be found in the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi.&quot;

=== The Maitreya Corpus ===
The next group of texts are those that Tibetan hagiographies state were taught to Asaṅga by Maitreya and are thus known as the &quot;Five Dharmas of Maitreya&quot; in Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism. According to D.S. Ruegg, the &quot;five works of Maitreya&quot; are mentioned in Sanskrit sources from only the 11th century onwards. As noted by S.K. Hookham, their attribution to a single author has been questioned by modern scholars. 

According to the Tibetan tradition, the so called Asanga-Maitreya is:

* &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra-kārikā&quot;, (&quot;The Adornment of Mahayana sutras&quot;, Tib. &quot;theg-pa chen-po&#x27;i mdo-sde&#x27;i rgyan&quot;), which presents the Mahāyāna path from the Yogācāra perspective and shows structural similarities with the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi.&quot; There is a closely related commentary on this text, the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra-bhāṣya.&quot; Some scholars, like Mario D&#x27;amato, have questioned the attribution of this text to Asanga-Maitreya. Instead, D&#x27;amato places this text (together with the commentary, which he considers the work of one author) after the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, but before the composition of Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (which quotes the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; as an authoritative text). 
* &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing the Middle and the Extremes&quot;, Tib. &quot;dbus-dang mtha&#x27; rnam-par &#x27;byed-pa&quot;), 112 verses that are a key work in Yogācāra philosophy. D&#x27;amato also places this text in the second phase of Yogacara scholarship, i.e. after the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi,&quot; but before the classic works of Asanga and Vasubandhu. 
* &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being&quot;, Tib. &quot;chos-dang chos-nyid rnam-par &#x27;byed-pa&quot;), a short Yogācāra work discussing the distinction and correlation (&quot;vibhāga&quot;) between phenomena (&quot;dharma&quot;) and reality (&quot;dharmatā&quot;).
* &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; ( &quot;Ornament for clear realization&quot;, &quot;Tib. mngon-par rtogs-pa&#x27;i rgyan&quot;), a verse text which attempts a synthesis of &quot;Prajñaparamita&quot; doctrine and Yogacara thought. There are differing scholarly opinions on authorship, John Makransky writes that it is possible the author was actually Arya Vimuktisena, the 6th century author of the first surviving commentary on this work. Makransky also notes that it is only the later 8th century commentator Haribhadra who attributes this text to Maitreya, but that this may have been a means to ascribe greater authority to the text. As Brunnholzl notes, this text is also completely unknown in the Chinese Buddhist tradition&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot; (Exposition of the Jeweled lineage, Tib. &quot;theg-pa chen-po rgyud bla-ma&#x27;i bstan,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Uttāratantra śāstra)&quot;, a compendium on Buddha-nature attributed to Maitreya via Asaṅga by the Tibetan tradition. The Chinese tradition attributes it to a certain Sāramati (3rd-4th century CE), according to the Huayan patriarch Fazang. According to S.K. Hookham, modern scholarship favors Sāramati as the author of the RGV. She also notes there is no evidence for the attribution to Maitreya before the time of Maitripa (11th century). Peter Harvey concurs, finding the Tibetan attribution less plausible.

According to Karl Brunnholzl, the Chinese tradition also speaks of five Maitreya-Asanga texts (first mentioned in Dunlun&#x27;s &quot;Yujia lunji&quot;), &quot;but considers them as consisting of the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi, *Yogavibhāga&quot; [now lost]&quot;, Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakā, Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; and the &quot;Vajracchedikākāvyākhyā.&quot;&quot;

While the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi śāstra&quot; (“Treatise on the Levels of Spiritual Practitioners”), a massive and encyclopaedic work on yogic praxis, has traditionally been attributed to Asaṅga or Maitreya &quot;in toto&quot;, but most modern scholars now consider the text to be a compilation of various works by numerous authors, and different textual strata can be discerned within its contents. However, Asaṅga may still have participated in the compilation of this work.

The third group of texts associated with Asaṅga comprises two commentaries: the &quot;Kārikāsaptati&quot;, a work on the &quot;Vajracchedikā&quot;, and the &quot;Āryasaṃdhinirmocana-bhāṣya&quot; (Commentary on the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot;)&quot;.&quot; The attribution of both of these to Asaṅga is not widely accepted by modern scholars.

<doc id="60343" wikidata="Q180184" url="?curid=60343" title="Sediment">
<text>Sediment is a solid material that is transported to a new location where it is deposited. It occurs naturally and, through the processes of weathering and erosion, is broken down and subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea bed deposited by sedimentation; if buried, they may eventually become sandstone and siltstone (sedimentary rocks) through lithification.

Sediments are most often transported by water (fluvial processes), but also wind (aeolian processes) and glaciers. Beach sands and river channel deposits are examples of fluvial transport and deposition, though sediment also often settles out of slow-moving or standing water in lakes and oceans. Desert sand dunes and loess are examples of aeolian transport and deposition. Glacial moraine deposits and till are ice-transported sediments.

== Classification ==

Sediment can be classified based on its grain size, grain shape, and composition.

===Grain size===

Sediment size is measured on a log base 2 scale, called the &quot;Phi&quot; scale, which classifies particles by size from &quot;colloid&quot; to &quot;boulder&quot;.

===Shape===

The shape of particles can be defined in terms of three parameters. The &quot;form&quot; is the overall shape of the particle, with common descriptions being spherical, platy, or rodlike. The &quot;roundness&quot; is a measure of how sharp grain corners are. This varies from well-rounded grains with smooth corners and edges to poorly rounded grains with sharp corners and edges. Finally, &quot;surface texture&quot; describes small-scale features such as scratches, pits, or ridges on the surface of the grain.

====Form====

Form (also called &quot;sphericity&quot;) is determined by measuring the size of the particle on its major axes. William C. Krumbein proposed formulas for converting these numbers to a single measure of form, such as

:formula_1

where formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 are the long, intermediate, and short axis lengths of the particle. The form formula_5 varies from 1 for a perfectly spherical particle to very small values for a platelike or rodlike particle.

An alternate measure was proposed by Sneed and Folk:

:formula_6

which, again, varies from 0 to 1 with increasing sphericity.

====Roundness====
Roundness describes how sharp the edges and corners of particle are. Complex mathematical formulas have been devised for its precise measurement, but these are difficult to apply, and most geologists estimate roundness from comparison charts. Common descriptive terms range from very angular to angular to subangular to subrounded to rounded to very rounded, with increasing degree of roundness.

====Surface texture====
Surface texture describes the small-scale features of a grain, such as pits, fractures, ridges, and scratches. These are most commonly evaluated on quartz grains, because these retain their surface markings for long periods of time. Surface texture varies from polished to frosted, and can reveal the history of transport of the grain; for example, frosted grains are particularly characteristic of aeolian sediments, transported by wind. Evaluation of these features often requires the use of a scanning electron microscope.

===Composition===
Composition of sediment can be measured in terms of:
* Parent rock lithology
* Mineral composition
* Chemical make-up

This leads to an ambiguity in which clay can be used as both a size-range and a composition (see clay minerals).

== Sediment transport ==


Sediment is transported based on the strength of the flow that carries it and its own size, volume, density, and shape. Stronger flows will increase the lift and drag on the particle, causing it to rise, while larger or denser particles will be more likely to fall through the flow.

=== Fluvial processes ===
===Aeolian processes: wind===

Wind results in the transportation of fine sediment and the formation of sand dune fields and soils from airborne dust.

===Glacial processes===

Glaciers carry a wide range of sediment sizes, and deposit it in moraines.

===Mass balance===
The overall balance between sediment in transport and sediment being deposited on the bed is given by the Exner equation. This expression states that the rate of increase in bed elevation due to deposition is proportional to the amount of sediment that falls out of the flow. This equation is important in that changes in the power of the flow change the ability of the flow to carry sediment, and this is reflected in the patterns of erosion and deposition observed throughout a stream. This can be localized, and simply due to small obstacles; examples are scour holes behind boulders, where flow accelerates, and deposition on the inside of meander bends. Erosion and deposition can also be regional; erosion can occur due to dam removal and base level fall. Deposition can occur due to dam emplacement that causes the river to pool and deposit its entire load, or due to base level rise.

== Shores and shallow seas ==
Seas, oceans, and lakes accumulate sediment over time. The sediment can consist of &quot;terrigenous&quot; material, which originates on land, but may be deposited in either terrestrial, marine, or lacustrine (lake) environments, or of sediments (often biological) originating in the body of water. Terrigenous material is often supplied by nearby rivers and streams or reworked marine sediment (e.g. sand). In the mid-ocean, the exoskeletons of dead organisms are primarily responsible for sediment accumulation.

Deposited sediments are the source of sedimentary rocks, which can contain fossils of the inhabitants of the body of water that were, upon death, covered by accumulating sediment. Lake bed sediments that have not solidified into rock can be used to determine past climatic conditions.

=== Key marine depositional environments ===

The major areas for deposition of sediments in the marine environment include:
* Littoral sands (e.g. beach sands, runoff river sands, coastal bars and spits, largely clastic with little faunal content)
* The continental shelf (silty clays, increasing marine faunal content).
* The shelf margin (low terrigenous supply, mostly calcareous faunal skeletons)
* The shelf slope (much more fine-grained silts and clays)
* Beds of estuaries with the resultant deposits called &quot;bay mud&quot;.

One other depositional environment which is a mixture of fluvial and marine is the turbidite system, which is a major source of sediment to the deep sedimentary and abyssal basins as well as the deep oceanic trenches.

Any depression in a marine environment where sediments accumulate over time is known as a sediment trap.

The null point theory explains how sediment deposition undergoes a hydrodynamic sorting process within the marine environment leading to a seaward fining of sediment grain size.

==Environmental issues==
===Erosion and agricultural sediment delivery to rivers===
One cause of high sediment loads is slash and burn and shifting cultivation of tropical forests. When the ground surface is stripped of vegetation and then seared of all living organisms, the upper soils are vulnerable to both wind and water erosion. In a number of regions of the earth, entire sectors of a country have become erodible. For example, on the Madagascar high central plateau, which constitutes approximately ten percent of that country&#x27;s land area, most of the land area is devegetated, and gullies have eroded into the underlying soil to form distinctive gulleys called &quot;lavakas&quot;. These are typically wide, long and deep. Some areas have as many as 150 lavakas/square kilometer, and lavakas may account for 84% of all sediments carried off by rivers. This siltation results in discoloration of rivers to a dark red brown color and leads to fish kills. In addition, sedimentation of river basins implies sediment management and siltation costs. The cost of removing an estimated 135 million m3 of accumulated sediments due to water erosion only is likely exceeding 2.3 billion euro (€) annually in the EU and UK, with large regional differences between countries.

Erosion is also an issue in areas of modern farming, where the removal of native vegetation for the cultivation and harvesting of a single type of crop has left the soil unsupported. Many of these regions are near rivers and drainages. Loss of soil due to erosion removes useful farmland, adds to sediment loads, and can help transport anthropogenic fertilizers into the river system, which leads to eutrophication.

The Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) is fraction of gross erosion (interill, rill, gully and stream erosion) that is expected to be delivered to the outlet of the river. The sediment transfer and deposition can be modelled with sediment distribution models such as WaTEM/SEDEM. In Europe, according to WaTEM/SEDEM model estimates the Sediment Delivery Ratio is about 15%.

===Coastal development and sedimentation near coral reefs===

Watershed development near coral reefs is a primary cause of sediment-related coral stress. The stripping of natural vegetation in the watershed for development exposes soil to increased wind and rainfall and, as a result, can cause exposed sediment to become more susceptible to erosion and delivery to the marine environment during rainfall events. Sediment can negatively affect corals in many ways, such as by physically smothering them, abrading their surfaces, causing corals to expend energy during sediment removal, and causing algal blooms that can ultimately lead to less space on the seafloor where juvenile corals (polyps) can settle.

When sediments are introduced into the coastal regions of the ocean, the proportion of land, marine, and organic-derived sediment that characterizes the seafloor near sources of sediment output is altered. In addition, because the source of sediment (i.e., land, ocean, or organically) is often correlated with how coarse or fine sediment grain sizes that characterize an area are on average, grain size distribution of sediment will shift according to the relative input of land (typically fine), marine (typically coarse), and organically-derived (variable with age) sediment. These alterations in marine sediment characterize the amount of sediment suspended in the water column at any given time and sediment-related coral stress.
===Biological considerations===
In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in &quot;quasi-suspended animation&quot;, were found in organically-poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, 250 feet below the seafloor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (&quot;the deadest spot in the ocean&quot;), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found.

<doc id="60347" wikidata="Q456963" url="?curid=60347" title="Chandrakirti">
<text>Chandrakirti (; Sanskrit: चंद्रकीर्ति; ; , meaning &quot;glory of the moon&quot; in Sanskrit) or &quot;Chandra&quot; was a Buddhist scholar of the Madhyamaka school who was based out of the monastery of Nalanda. He was a noted commentator on the works of Nagarjuna () and those of his main disciple, Aryadeva. He wrote two influential works on Madhyamaka, the &quot;Prasannapadā&quot; and the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;.

Chandrakirti does not seem to have been very influential during the 7th to 10th centuries, and his works were never translated into Chinese. However, by the 11th and 12th centuries, his work became influential in the north, especially in Kashmir and in Tibet. Over time, Chandrakirti became a major source for the study of Madhyamaka philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism. Chandrakirti&#x27;s work was especially promoted by Tibetans like Rendawa Zhönnu Lodrö and his student Tsongkhapa as a way to counter the widespread influence of the Uttaratantra, and the shentong views associated with it.

As noted by Kevin A. Vose, Chandrakirti is seen by many Tibetan Buddhists as offering &quot;the most thorough and accurate vision of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s emptiness, which, in turn, most fully represents the final truth of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching.&quot; He is considered by Tibetans to be the main exponent of what they term the &quot;Prāsaṅgika&quot; sub-school of madhyamaka. However, this doxographical categorization only arose in Tibet during the 12th century.

== Life ==
Very little is known about Chandrakirti&#x27;s life, though Tibetan sources state that he was born in South India, became a Buddhist monk and was a student of Kamalabuddhi (who was the student of Buddhapalita). Tibetan sources like Bu ston and Taranatha state that Chandrakirti was active at Nalanda, where he is said to have become an abbot. 

According to Karen Lang:According to Bus ton and Taranatha, Candrakirti was born in south India and entered a monastery, where he mastered all the Buddhist scriptures. Taranatha adds that he was born in Samanta during the reign of King Sila, the son of Sriharsa. He took a special interest in Nagarjuna&#x27;s treatises and studied them with the disciples of two rival interpreters, Bhavaviveka and Buddhapalita. He preferred Buddhapalita&#x27;s interpretations of Madhyamaka teachings and defended them in a famous debate with the grammarian Candragomin, who supported the idealist position of the Vijñanavada (Doctrine of Consciousness) school.

Tibetan sources further add that during the latter period of his life, he returned to the South of India, where he stayed in the region of &quot;Koṅkuna&quot;. During his time here, he is said to have worked to defeat and convert many non-Buddhists.

===Debate at Nalanda===
Bu ston and Taranatha both reference a debate that took place at Nalanda between Chandrakirti and the poet-lay scholar, Chandragomin. The debate started after Chandrakirti noticed Chandragomin delivering a lecture to a large crowd on the topics of Pāṇinian grammar, sūtra, and tantra. Chandrakirti invited Chandragomin to come with him to Nalanda, where he could be enrolled into the sangha. However, due to a disagreement, a debate ensued between the two, with Chandrakirti arguing for the Madhyamaka position and Chandragomin taking on the Yogacara view. This debate was said to have attracted a large crowd. Over the course of the debate, Chandrakirti failed to defeat Chandragomin&#x27;s position, and he began to suspect that someone was secretly teaching Chandragomin. Legend even states that Chandragomin was being tutored by the bodhisattva, Avalokiteśvara himself. Both Bu Ston and Taranatha record that the debate only ended after seven years, although neither writer specifies who the winner was.

==Philosophy==
Chandrakirti was a philosopher of the madhyamaka school of Nagarjuna. This school held that all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) were empty of intrinsic nature or self-existence (Sanskrit: &quot;svabhāva&quot;). This includes all Buddhist phenomena including the Buddha, the four noble truths and nirvana. According to Chandrakirti, the apophatic method of madhyamaka is a thoroughgoing negation of all concepts, propositions (&quot;pratijñā&quot;) and views (&quot;dṛṣṭi&quot;) which affirms neither existence nor non-existence. Due to this radical negation, madhyamaka is seen as a middle way which rejects all extreme views and positions.

For Chandrakirti, even though all phenomena lack svabhāva, sentient beings impute svabhāva in their experience due to their ignorance about the true nature of reality. Ultimately, all phenomena are merely conceptual constructs (&quot;prajñaptimatra&quot;) which do not exist in themselves but are mentally imputed dependent designations (&quot;prajñāptirupādāya&quot;).

Thubten Jinpa outlines what has been seen by commentators as the main philosophical ideas put forth by Chandrakirti as follows:(1) rejection of formal inference based on criteria grounded in objects facts of the world, relying instead on consequential reasoning that reveals logical contradictions and absurd consequences entailed by an opponent&#x27;s positions, (2) rejection of the key tenets of the Buddhist epistemology initiated by Dignaga and developed further by Dharmakirti, (3) a radical understanding of the inaccessibility of ultimate truth through language and thought, (4) an understanding of conventional truth that appeals for its validity to everyday intuitions of the world instead of philosophical grounding, (5) a unique interpretation of Nagarjuna&#x27;s statement about his having no thesis, and (6) the possible cessation of mind and mental factors in buddhahood.

=== Two Truths ===
Like all madhyamikas, Chandrakirti defends a theory of two truths with a strict anti-foundationalist character. According to Chandrakirti, all things (&quot;bhāva&quot;) have two natures, the conventional and the ultimate.

The conventional truth (&quot;saṁvṛti&quot; &quot;satya&quot;) is the fact that, provisionally speaking, phenomena have a nature or existence (&quot;bhāva&quot;). For example, a property of fire is heat and so on. This is the truth of the everyday world (&quot;lokasaṁvṛtisatya&quot;) and the truth of conventional transaction (&quot;vyavahārasatya&quot;). However, these conventional properties are not intrinsic natures or &quot;svabhāvas&quot; (even conventionally speaking), since for Chandra, even conventional truth is empty of intrinsic natures. This view differentiates Chandrakirti from other madhyamikas like Bhāviveka which affirm the &quot;conventional existence&quot; of intrinsic natures.

Regarding the ultimate truth (&quot;paramārtha satya&quot;), when fire is analyzed to find its ultimate nature, no independent essence is found that makes fire hot, and thus fire (and all things, including the most basic concepts like time and causality) have no ultimate essence or nature. This is the ultimate truth i.e. emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) or the lack of self-existence (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;). It is this very lack of inherent nature in conventional truth that allows it to change and have causal efficacy (&quot;arthakriya&quot;) and thus, to be a dependent arising (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;).

==== The nature of conventional truth ====
The conventional is the &quot;domain of mundane cognitive process, and is readily accessible for ordinary beings&quot; according to Sonam Thakchoe. The conventional truth can be contrasted with conventional falsehood based on erroneous cognitions. Correct cognition is differentiated from false cognitions by sense faculties that are not impaired. A related distinction which Chandrakirti makes is that between worldly conventions (&quot;lokasaṃvṛti&quot;), which are epistemically reliable from the point of view of ordinary beings and conventions that do not reflect the world (&quot;alokasaṃvṛti)&quot; and are thus deceptive even by worldly standards.

&quot;Conventional&quot; &quot;(saṁvṛti)&quot; can also mean &quot;covering&quot; according to Chandrakirti and is also associated with delusion or ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;). Furthermore, he also glosses the term as codependent (&quot;paraparasaṃbhavana)&quot; and as being signified &quot;(saṁket)&quot; or worldly convention &quot;(lokavyavahāra).&quot;

The conventional truth, especially as experienced by ordinary people (who reify reality), is a concealing and deluded kind of truth which may act as an obstacle to understanding the ultimate.&quot;&quot; From the ultimate point of view in fact, &quot;saṁvṛtisatya&quot; is not really true. Indeed, Chandrakirti explains that conventional phenomena are illusory and unreal and can be compared to a mirage. The only difference is that conventional phenomena have some causal efficacy from the mundane point of view (for example, water can help a thirsty person, a mirage cannot)&quot;.&quot;

Furthermore, these conventional phenomena are to be differentiated from conventionally illusory entities, such as intrinsic natures or essences that are imputed on to things (which do not exist at all, even conventionally) and conventionally unreal entities (like the horns of a rabbit, which also do not exist at all)&quot;.&quot; The main difference between these latter two unreal phenomena is that the conventionally unreal entities are understood to be unreal by ordinary people, whereas intrinsic nature is not understood to be unreal by ordinary persons. Instead, ordinary persons impute intrinsic nature on to conventional phenomena (such as water etc.) and perceive them as being intrinsically real (only noble beings realize that this is illusory). As such, intrinsic nature is a conceptual fiction in the minds of ordinary beings.&quot;&quot;

In spite of the unreality of the conventional, Chandrakirti states that the Buddha taught using language and conventional expressions as a way to guide people to the ultimate truth, which is beyond language and cannot be expressed through words.

For Chandrakirti, the way that ordinary beings experience the conventional is very different from the way that awakened saints or noble beings (&quot;āryas&quot;) experience the conventional. Chandrakirti introduced the concept of &quot;mere convention&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;kun rdzob tsam&quot;) to refer to how noble ones experience conventionality, which is quite different to what is held to be &quot;conventionally real&quot; or &quot;conventional true&quot; (&quot;kun rdzob bden pa&quot;). Ordinary beings grasp at and misconstrue phenomena as being intrinsically real, thus they experience conventional &quot;reality.&quot; Enlightened beings meanwhile, only experience a non-reified kind of appearance, which is perceived as being an unreal construct, like a reflected image.&quot;

==== The nature of the ultimate truth ====
Chandrakirti defines ultimate reality as &quot;the nature of things found by particular exalted cognitive processes (yeshes) of those who perceive reality.&quot; He further defines it as follows:“Ultimate is the object, the nature of which is found by &quot;particular&quot; exalted cognitive processes of those who perceive reality. But it does not exist by virtue of its &quot;intrinsic objective reality&quot; (&quot;svarūpatā&quot; / &quot;bdag gi ngo bo nyid&quot;).&quot;As such, the ultimate truth for Chandra is the nature of all conventional things that is found by a particular exalted perception which sees how things really are. However, as indicated by Chandra, this nature is also not truly real.

According to Chandrakirti, the ultimate truth, emptiness, is seen as having two aspects: selflessness of persons (&quot;pudgalanairātmya&quot;) and selflessness of phenomena (&quot;dharmanairātmya&quot;). Chandrakirti provides various arguments to show that persons, phenomena (dharmas) and emptiness itself are all unreal and empty.

The ultimate truth, the lack of self-nature in all phenomena, also refers to the fact that phenomena do not arise or cease at all. Even though conventional phenomena appear to arise and pass away through dependent arising, this appearance is in fact unreal and illusory. Thus, for Chandrakirti, the wisdom which realizes the ultimate truth is the realization that phenomena (dharmas) do not arise or come into being from themselves, from another thing, from both themselves and another thing, or without a cause. Just like Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti refutes all positions regarding the arising of phenomena, summing up his position as follows:Entities do not arise causelessly, and they do not arise through causes like God, for example. Nor do they arise out of themselves, nor from another, nor from both. They arise codependently.In this sense then, all phenomena are intrinsically unreal and like illusions, since they truly are not what they appear to be.

According to Chandrakirti, this very ultimate truth (i.e. emptiness and non-arising), is also empty, in the sense that it is also dependent on the provisional truth of dependent imputation. Another way to state this is that only what lacks inherent nature is dependently originated and causally efficacious.

Chandrakirti explains the emptiness of emptiness as follows:The emptiness of intrinsic reality of things is itself called by the wise as ‘emptiness,’ and this emptiness also is considered to be empty of any intrinsic reality. The emptiness of that which is called ‘emptiness’ is accepted as ‘the emptiness of emptiness’ (&quot;śūnyatāśūnyatā&quot;). It is explained in this way for the purpose of controverting objectification of the emptiness as intrinsically real (&quot;bhāva&quot;).Thus, according to Chandrakirti&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;the emptiness of emptiness&quot;, the ultimate truth is not some absolute reality, existential ground or ontological foundation, but refers to a mere absence of nature, and thus to the illusory and unreal character of things.

Because of the unreality of the conventional and the ineffability of the ultimate, Chandrakirti holds that madhyamikas do not formally put forth any elaborate theory of the conventional truth apart from the ordinary worldly experience that is accepted by worldly convention or common consensus. According to Chandrakirti, theories which seek to explain the workings of the conventional truth (like the metaphysics of samkhya or yogacara) actually obscure and undermine our understanding of conventional truth, since it is at variance with direct experience. These theories also undermine our understanding of the ultimate truth (which is the very nature of our experience) since the ultimate cannot be understood conceptually and can only be accessed through the gateway of one&#x27;s conventional direct experience.

=== &quot;Prāsaṅga&quot; and reasoning ===
Chandrakirti defended Buddhapālita and his madhyamaka method against the views of Bhāviveka. According to Chandra, Madhyamikas should not use autonomous or independent inferences (&quot;svatantrānumāna&quot;) when debating an opponent. This method had been developed by the Buddhist epistemologist Dignāga and had been adopted by madhyamikas like Bhāviveka. Bhāviveka had argued that to be able to accurately and effectively defend the madhyamaka view against its opponents, one needed to positively prove one&#x27;s thesis by means of independent inferences (&quot;svatantrānumāna&quot;) in formal syllogisms (&quot;prayoga&quot;) which proved the madhyamika thesis in a self-contained manner independent of the views of non-madhyamika interlocutors. He therefore faulted Buddhapālita&#x27;s analysis of madhyamaka as inadequate.

Chandrakirti critiqued Bhāviveka on this point and argued that madhyamaka thinkers should instead only rely on &quot;prāsaṅga&quot; arguments (literally &quot;consequence&quot;), which mainly refers to reductio arguments that seek to show how an opponent&#x27;s views lead to absurd or unwanted consequences. Furthermore, these reductio arguments only refute the opponents position on the opponent&#x27;s own terms. They do not put forth a counter-position in return nor do they commit the madhyamika to the principles and conclusions used in the course of the argument. In this sense, the madhyamikas merely point out the absurdity of their opponents views without stating a position of their own, and merely indicate the truth indirectly.

Chandrakirti states:Whoever speaks in terms of independently valid logical arguments (inferences) reaps some fault. We do not rely on them, because the only fruit of our arguments is the annulment of someone else&#x27;s thesis. Chandrakirti argues that the idea that one &quot;must&quot; use the syllogistic arguments commits one to the acceptance of inherent natures or some other form of foundationalism or essentialism. He also points out that Nagarjuna did not make use of such arguments and relied on &quot;prāsaṅga&quot;. Chandrakirti sees figures like Bhāviveka as not really being madhyamikas, instead he sees them as logicians which &quot;may take the side of the madhyamaka school out of a desire to parade the extent of his own dialectical skill.&quot; According to Chandrakirti, the philosophical practices of these logicians, motivated as they are by a desire for certainty and logic, becomes &quot;an enormous reservoir where faults pile up one after another.&quot; Thus, Chandrakirti does not see Bhāviveka as being a madhyamika (unlike later Tibetan doxographers), but sees him as being a logician (&quot;tārkika&quot;), like other Buddhist thinkers such as Dignaga.

Another problem which Chandrakirti sees with the idea that a madhyamika must use independent syllogisms is that a madhyamika interlocutor and any essentialist or realist opponent do not share a basic set of premises required for syllogistic reasoning. This is because they do not have the same idea of what it means for something to &quot;exist&quot; and therefore they cannot even agree on a set of basic premises on which to develop an independent syllogism. The validity of any independent syllogism depends on the fact that the terminology it uses has the same meaning for both parties in the debate. However, this is impossible in a debate between a madhyamika and a realist according to Chandrakirti, since the very subject of debate is the nature of how the very objects of discussion are said to exist. Thus, a true madhyamika cannot put forth an independent syllogism which is not defective. Furthermore, if both parties use the same terminology but interpret them differently, they also lack a common understanding on which to ground a debate.

&quot;Prāsaṅga&quot; arguments meanwhile, are mainly negative, and thus do not require the affirmation of any positive thesis or view, but merely deconstructs the arguments of one&#x27;s opponent. As such, Chandrakirti thinks &quot;prāsaṅga&quot; arguments are more suited to the apophatic method of madhyamaka philosophy. Indeed, according to Chandrakirti, madhyamaka presents no positive view at all and he cites Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī&quot; in which he states &quot;I have no thesis&quot; in this regard.

Chandrakirti also critiques the view of the non-madhyamika epistemologists like Dignāga for having failed to provide a sufficiently indisputable foundation for their premises and for having failed to respond to Nagarjuna&#x27;s criticism of the foundations of pramana in the &quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī.&quot;

There is a further problem with the view of the logicians and this is that, for Chandrakirti, all cognitions involve ignorance from an ultimate point of view and thus no cognition is fully reliable. Because of this, meditation on emptiness does not rely on an object at all (even the idea or view of emptiness) and ultimate truth is thus said to be beyond the ordinary mind. However, there is a role for reasoning in Chandrakirti&#x27;s thought. Reasoning is only useful for negating all views regarding existence and non-existence. Furthermore, reasoning must also negate itself, because it also relies on conceptual proliferation (&quot;prapañca&quot;), which is based on ignorance. Thus, for Chandrakirti, reasoning and conceptual thought cannot know the ultimate truth, because the ultimate is beyond all concepts and discursive proliferation (&quot;prapañca&quot;). However, reasoning &quot;can&quot; be used to understand the very limitations of reason and thought in explaining the ultimate and how any attempt at conceptually understanding the ultimate leads to contradictions. Reason can thus indirectly point to the ineffable ultimate truth (which can only be realized by another means, i.e. through wisdom, &quot;jñana&quot;) by revealing what it is not.

=== Buddhahood ===
Chandrakirti&#x27;s view of Buddhahood is related to his apophatic views. For Chandrakirti, a Buddha&#x27;s knowing of emptiness is not really knowing anything at all. Instead, a Buddha&#x27;s knowledge of emptiness is a non-knowing in which there is neither an object nor a mind engaged in the act of knowing the object. Because of this, Chandrakirti holds that for a Buddha, all mind and mental factors (&quot;cittacaitta&quot;) have ceased. Even though from the point of view of ordinary people, a Buddha seems to teach and engage in activities, from the point of view of a Buddha, no conscious decisions are being made and no cognition occurs. Yet, as Dunne notes, Chandrakirti thereby faces serious difficulties in explaining &quot;the improbable state of affairs&quot; by which a Buddha could teach and benefit sentient beings without any cognitive relation to the world.

=== Critiques of Yogācāra ===
In his &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra,&quot; Chandrakirti also offered refutations of a number of Buddhist views such as those of the &quot;vijñānavāda&quot; (&quot;consciousness doctrine&quot;) or yogācāra school. Chandrakirti understood this tradition as positing a kind of subjective idealism. According to Chandrakirti, the yogācāra school fails to fully understand the empty nature of consciousness since they ontologically privilege consciousness over its objects. However, according to Chandrakirti, both are equally empty and neither have any ontological primacy or ultimate existence. Thus, for Chandrakirti, yogācāra fails to appreciate how everything, including consciousness, is conditioned and empty.

Chandrakirti also examines and refutes the basic theories of yogācāra, including the theory of the three natures and the theory of the storehouse consciousness. Chandrakirti cites the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; in order to argue that the storehouse consciousness is a provisional teaching of indirect meaning (&quot;neyartha&quot;). He also critiques the yogācāra denial of an external object (&quot;bāhyārtha, bahirartha&quot;) of knowledge and the yogācāra theory of ‘self-awareness’ (&quot;svasamvedana, svasamvitti&quot;).

Furthermore, Chandrakirti interprets the various statements in the Mahayana sutras which seem to promote idealism in a different way than the yogācāra school. According to Chandrakirti, sutra teachings which state that &quot;all is mind&quot; and the like were taught by the Buddha as a way to counter the idea that our sufferings are caused by external forces and actors. According to Chandrakirti, to counter this wrong view and to help people understand that suffering mainly arises due to the way we understand our experience, the Buddha taught that all is mind (&quot;citta-matra&quot;) or idea/impressions (&quot;vijñapti-matra&quot;). Chandrakirti argues that it is a mistake to take this literally as an ontological statement and to conclude that only consciousness exists.

==Major works==
Chandra&#x27;s major works are: 
*&quot;Mūlamadhyamaka-vṛtti-prasannapadā&quot; (Clear-word Commentary on the Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way), known simply as the &quot;Prasannapadā&quot; (Clear Words), A commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;.
* &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; (Introduction to Madhyamaka), along with an auto-commentary, the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra-bhāśya&quot;. The &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; is used as the main sourcebook by most of the Tibetan monastic colleges in their studies of Madhyamaka.
* &quot;Catuúṣataka-ṭika&quot; (Commentary on the Four Hundred): a commentary on the &quot;Four Hundred Verses&quot; of Aryadeva. 
* &quot;Yuktiṣaṣṭhika-vṛtii&quot; (Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning), a commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Yuktiṣaṣṭhika&quot;.
* &quot;Śūnayatāsaptati-vṛtti&quot; (Commentary on the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness), a commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Śūnayatāsaptati&quot;.
*&quot;Pañcaskandhaprakaraṇa&quot; (Discussion on the Five Aggregates).

== Later Influence and Commentaries ==
Only one Indian commentary on Chandrakirti exists, a 12th-century commentary to the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; by the Kashmiri pandit Jayānanda&quot;.&quot; An earlier Indian author, Prajñakaramati (950–1030) repeadately cites the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; in his commentary on Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;. The work of Atisha (982–1054), particularly his &quot;Introduction to the Two Truths&quot; (&quot;Satyadvayāvatāra&quot;)&quot;,&quot; cites Chandrakirti and defends his view which rejects the applicability of valid cognition (&quot;pramana&quot;) to ultimate truth.

Another late Indian author which seems to have held Chandrakirti&#x27;s position is Maitrīpadā (c. 1007–1085) and he is held to be one of the sources of the Kagyu school&#x27;s Prāsaṅgika lineage. Chandrakirti is also cited in some late Indian Buddhist tantric works, such as the &quot;Compendium of Good Sayings,&quot; indicating that he may have been influential among Indian tantric authors, especially among the Arya lineage of the &quot;Guhyasamaja tantra.&quot; The Arya lineage includes the works of tantric authors who go by the names Nagarjuna, Aryadeva and Chandrakirti (the last two can be dated to the 9th or 10th centuries) and who should not be confused with the earlier Madhyamaka philosophers. Later Tibetan authors also began to believe that the tantric figures and the Madhyamaka philosophers were the same persons.

Another critical Indian author who refers to the work of Chandrakirti (and responds to it) is the later Bhāvaviveka or Bhāvaviveka II (author of the &quot;Madhyamakārthasaṃgraha&quot; and the &quot;Madhyamakaratnapradīpa&quot;), not to be confused with the first Bhāvaviveka (c. 500 – c. 578) who pre-dates Chandrakirti and authored the &quot;Madhyamakahrdaya&quot; and the &quot;Prajñāpradīpa&quot;. According to Ruegg, this might be the same person as the tantric Bhavyakīrti (c. 1000).

The first Tibetan translation of Chandrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; and its auto-commentary was completed by Naktso Lotsawa, a student of Atisha. Another early Tibetan commentator on Chandrakirti was Patsab Nyima Drag (fl. 12th century), who also translator most of Chandra&#x27;s major works. The logician Chapa Chökyi Sengé (12th century) is known for discussing the views of Chandrakirti and composing refutations of them in his defense of the epistemological tradition of Dharmakirti. Chapa&#x27;s student, Mabja Changchub Tsöndrü (1109–1169) is also another important early figure who wrote on Chandrakirti. Mabja&#x27;s work attempted to harmonize Dharmakirti&#x27;s epistemology with Chandrakirti&#x27;s Madhyamaka. Chandrakirti was categorized by Tibetans as part of the Uma Thelgyur () school, an approach to the interpretation of Madhyamaka philosophy typically back-translated into Sanskrit as  or rendered in English as the &quot;Consequentialist&quot; or &quot;Dialecticist&quot; school.

The influence of these early commentators lead to the increased popularity of Chandrakirti in Tibet. Later important Tibetan Buddhist figures like Tsongkhapa, Wangchuk Dorje (the 9th Karmapa) and Jamgon Mipham also wrote commentaries on the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra.&quot;

==Other Chandrakirtis==
The Tibetan translation of &quot;Charyapada&quot; provided the name of its compiler as Munidatta, that its Sanskrit commentary is &quot;Caryāgītikośavṛtti&quot;, and that its lotsawa &quot;translator&quot; was Chandrakirti. This is a later Chandrakirti, who assisted in Tibetan translation in the Later Transmission of Buddhism to Tibet.

The author of the &quot;Triśaraṇasaptati&quot; (Seventy Verses on Taking Refuge) is also called Chandrakirti, but this does not seem to be the same person as the 7th century Chandrakirti. The same is the case with the author of the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra-prajñā.&quot;

There is also another figure called Chandrakirti or Chandrakirtipada. This is the author of the &quot;Pradīpoddyotana,&quot; a commentary on the &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra.&quot; As such, he is sometimes called the &quot;tantric Chandrakirti&quot;&quot;.&quot;

<text>Amherst College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1821 as an attempt to relocate Williams College by its then-president Zephaniah Swift Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts. The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Jeffery, Lord Amherst, Commander-in-Chief of British forces of North America during the French and Indian War. Originally established as a men&#x27;s college, Amherst became coeducational in 1975.

Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution; 1,971 students were enrolled in fall 2021. Admissions are highly selective. Students choose courses from 42 major programs in an open curriculum and are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution requirements; students may also design their own interdisciplinary major. 

Amherst competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference. Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with Williams College and Wesleyan University, which form the Little Three colleges. The college is also a member of the Five College Consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions: Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

==History==

=== Founding and 19th century ===

In 1812, funds were raised in Amherst for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened December 1814. The academy incorporated in 1816, and eventually counted among its students Emily Dickinson, Sylvester Graham, and Mary Lyon (founder of Mount Holyoke College). The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Jeffery, Lord Amherst, a veteran from the Seven Years&#x27; War and later commanding general of the British forces in North America. On November 18, 1817, a project was adopted at the Academy to raise funds for the free instruction of &quot;indigent young men of promising talents and hopeful piety, who shall manifest a desire to obtain a liberal education with a sole view to the Christian ministry&quot;. This required a substantial investment from benefactors.

During the fundraising for the project, it became clear that without larger designs, it would be impossible to raise sufficient funds. This led the committee overseeing the project to conclude that a new institution should be created. On August 18, 1818, the Amherst Academy board of trustees accepted this conclusion and began building a new college.

Founded in 1821, Amherst College developed from Amherst Academy, first established as a secondary school. The college was originally suggested as an alternative to Williams College, which was struggling to stay open. Although Williams survived, Amherst was formed and developed as a distinct institution.

===Establishment===
Moore, then President of Williams College, however, still believed that Williamstown was an unsuitable location for a college. When Amherst College was established, he was elected its first president on May 8, 1821. At its opening, Amherst had forty-seven students. Fifteen of these had followed Moore from Williams College. Those fifteen represented about one-third of the total students at Amherst, and about one-fifth of the whole number in the three classes to which they belonged in Williams College. President Moore died on June 29, 1823, and was replaced with a Williams College trustee, Heman Humphrey.

Williams alumni are fond of an apocryphal story ascribing the removal of books from the Williams College library to Amherst College. In 1995, Williams president Harry C. Payne declared the story false, but many still nurture the legend.

In 1826, Edward Jones became Amherst&#x27;s first Black graduate.

Amherst grew quickly, and for two years in the mid-1830s, it was the second largest college in the United States, behind Yale. In 1835, Amherst attempted to create a course of study parallel to the classical liberal arts education. This parallel course focused less on Greek and Latin, instead emphasizing contemporary English, French, and Spanish languages, chemistry, economics, etc. The parallel course did not take hold and replace the classical, however, until the next century.

Amherst was founded as a non-sectarian institution &quot;for the classical education of indigent young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry&quot; (Tyler, &quot;A History of Amherst College&quot;). One of the hallmarks of the new college was its Charity Fund, an early form of financial aid that paid the tuition of poorer students. Although officially non-denominational, Amherst was considered a religiously conservative institution with a strong connection to Calvinism; the Puritans still controlled much of Massachusetts life.

As a result, there was considerable debate in the Massachusetts government over whether the new college should receive an official charter from the state. A charter was not granted until February 21, 1825, as reflected on the Amherst seal. Religious conservatism persisted at Amherst until the mid-nineteenth century: students who consumed alcohol or played cards were subject to expulsion. A number of religious revivals were held at Amherst. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, however, the college began a transition toward secularism. This movement was considered to culminate in the 1949 demolition of the college church.

=== Development and academic reform ===

Academic hoods in the United States are traditionally lined with the official colors of the school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst&#x27;s hoods are purple (Williams&#x27; official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records one of the first uses of Latin honors of any American college, dating back to 1881. The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Four-College Consortium (Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, UMass) attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974, the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975–1976 school year. This was done while John William Ward served as president. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they became the first female graduates of the college.

The college established the Black Studies Department in 1969. In 1973, it launched the nation&#x27;s first undergraduate neuroscience program. In 1983, it established a Department of Asian Languages and Literatures, which was later to become the Department of Asian Languages and Civilizations. 
In 1984, on-campus fraternities were abolished. The former fraternity buildings, which were owned by the college, were converted into residence halls. The Department of Women&#x27;s and Gender Studies, which later became the Department of Sexuality, Women&#x27;s, and Gender Studies, was established in 1987, and the Department of Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought in 1993.

In March 2013, the faculty adopted an open-access policy. Eight years later, the college ended its practice of legacy admissions and increased financial aid to increase access to low and middle-income students and diversify the college.

==Campus==
Amherst College is located in the town of Amherst in Western Massachusetts. 
Amherst College has a total of 34 residence halls, seven of which are strictly for first year students. Following their first year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors have the choice to live off campus and are offered options of Themed Houses including Arts House, Russian House, and French House, however this option is only available for two years of residence.
First-year students are required to live on campus.

The college also owns the Emily Dickinson Museum, operated as a museum about the life and history of poet Emily Dickinson, and the Inn on Boltwood near to the main campus.

===Sustainability===
Amherst College is reducing its energy consumption through a computerized monitoring system for lighting and the use of an efficient cogeneration facility. The cogeneration facility features a gas turbine that generates electricity in addition to steam for heating the campus. Amherst also operates a composting program, in which a portion of the food waste from dining halls is sent to a farmer in Vermont.

==Academics==
Amherst College offers 41 fields of study (with 850+ courses) in the sciences, arts, humanities, mathematics and computer sciences, social sciences, foreign languages, classics, and several interdisciplinary fields (including premedical studies) and provides an unusually open curriculum. Students are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution requirements and may even design their own unique interdisciplinary major. Freshmen may take advanced courses, and seniors may take introductory ones. Amherst College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Forty-five percent of Amherst students in the class of 2019 were double majors. Amherst College has been the first college to have undergraduate departments in the interdisciplinary fields of American Studies; Law, Jurisprudence and Social Thought; and Neuroscience and has helped to pioneer other interdisciplinary programs, including Asian Languages and Civilizations. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Mathematics (40)
::Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (34)
::Research and Experimental Psychology (31)
::Political Science and Government (25)
::History (22)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (21)
::Neuroscience (19)
::American/U.S. Law/Legal Studies/Jurisprudence (19)

The Amherst library is named for long-time faculty member, poet Robert Frost. The student-faculty ratio is 7:1 and 84% of classes have fewer than 30 students.

Notable faculty members include, among others, modern literature and poetry critic William H. Pritchard, Beowulf translator Howell Chickering, Jewish and Latino studies scholar Ilan Stavans, novelist and legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, physicist Arthur Zajonc, Pulitzer Prize-winning Nikita Khrushchev biographer William Taubman, African art specialist Rowland Abiodun, Natural Law expert Hadley Arkes, Mathematician Daniel Velleman, Biblical scholar Susan Niditch, law and society expert Austin Sarat, Asian American studies scholar and former Director of the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center Franklin Odo, and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis Spratlan, professor emeritus of the music faculty.

===Reputation and rankings===

Since the inception of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings in 1987, Amherst College has been ranked ten times as the first overall among 266 liberal arts colleges in the United States, and in 2022 ranked second, behind Williams. In 2023, Amherst College was ranked as the best liberal arts college and 8th best college or university overall in the United States by The WSJ/College Pulse 2024 Best College Rankings. In 2022, Amherst was ranked as the best liberal arts college in the country by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Amherst College as the 24th best college or university in the United States for their 2024-25 rankings and the 16th best college or university in the United States in 2021.

&quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Amherst 11th in its 2016 ranking of best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.

Amherst ranked 6th in the 2021 &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; liberal arts college rankings, which focus on contribution to the public good in three broad categories: social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

===Academic freedom debate===
The writings of Amherst College political science Professor Hadley Arkes about homosexuality led to a dispute in 2013 over whether a college seeking to create a diverse, respectful academic community should speak out when a faculty member disparages community members or should instead remain silent as a way to protect academic freedom. The issue arose when a group of alumni petitioned the college trustees and President Biddy Martin to &quot;dissociate the institution&quot; from Arkes&#x27;s &quot;divisive and destructive&quot; views, focusing particularly on his May 2013 comparison of homosexuality to bestiality, pedophilia and necrophilia. The alumni said, &quot;Amherst College cannot credibly maintain its professed commitment to be an inclusive community as long as it chooses to remain silent while a sitting professor disparages members of its community in media of worldwide circulation and accessibility.&quot;

Martin disagreed, citing past debates over the college&#x27;s position on the Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa—issues on which the college initially remained silent but eventually took a public position. In such times, she said, colleges should &quot;avoid taking institutional positions on controversial political matters, except in extraordinary circumstances&quot; and should simultaneously both &quot;protect their communities from discrimination and disrespect&quot; and &quot;cherish a diversity of viewpoints&quot;.

===Five College Consortium===
Amherst is a member of the Five Colleges consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions. These include Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In addition to the 850 courses available on campus, Amherst students have an additional 5,300 classes to consider through the Consortium (without paying additional tuition) and access to 8 million library volumes. The Five Colleges are geographically close to one another and are linked by buses that run between the campuses.

The Five Colleges share resources and develop common academic programs. Museums10 is a consortium of local art, history and science museums. The Five College Dance Department is one of the largest in the nation. The joint Astronomy department shares use of the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory, which contributed to work that won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences Program offers an interdisciplinary curriculum to undergraduates in the Five Colleges.

==Admissions==
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; classifies Amherst as being &quot;most selective&quot; of liberal arts colleges in the United States; the Carnegie Foundation classifies Amherst as one of the &quot;more selective&quot; institutions whose first-year students&#x27; test scores places these institutions in roughly the top fifth of baccalaureate institutions. For the class first enrolled in fall 2021, Amherst received 13,999 applications and accepted 1,224 (an 8.7% acceptance rate). 514 students ultimately enrolled; 91% were in the top 10% of their high school classes, and the middle 50% scored between 1440 and 1540 on the SAT and between 32 and 35 on the ACT. 38 states and 23 countries were reflected among the first-year class, 55% received financial aid and 11% were first-generation college students. In addition, 16 transfer students enrolled.

Despite its high cost of attendance – comprehensive tuition, room, and board fee for the 2022–23 academic year was $80,250 – Amherst College meets the full demonstrated need of every admitted student. Sixty percent of current students receive scholarship aid, and the average financial aid package award amounts to $62,071; college expenditures are approximately $109,000 per student each year.

In July 2007, Amherst announced that grants would replace loans in all financial aid packages beginning in the 2008–09 academic year. Amherst had already been the first school to eliminate loans for low-income students, and with this announcement it joined Princeton University, Cornell University and Davidson College, then the only colleges to eliminate loans from need-based financial aid packages. Increased rates of admission of highly qualified lower income students has resulted in greater equality of opportunity at Amherst than is usual at elite American colleges.

In the 2008–2009 academic year, Amherst College also extended its need-blind admission policy to international applicants. In 2021, it also eliminated preferences for students whose parents are alumni (&quot;legacies&quot;).

==Student life==
Amherst&#x27;s resources, faculty, and academic life allow the college to enroll students with a range of talents, interests, and commitments. Students represent 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and sixty-six countries. The median family income of Amherst students is $158,200, with 51% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 24% from the bottom 60%. Ninety-eight percent of students live on campus. Ninety-eight percent of Amherst freshmen enrolled in Fall 2020 returned for their sophomore year; ninety-two percent of the most recent cohort graduated within six years. There are more than 200 student groups at Amherst. More than a third of the student body are members of a varsity athletics team.

Students pursue their interests through student-led organizations funded by a student fee and distributed by the student government, including a variety of cultural and religious groups, publications, fine and performing arts and political advocacy and service groups. Groups include a medieval sword-fighting club, a knitting club, and a club devoted to random acts of kindness, among others. Community service groups and opportunities (locally—through the Center for Community Engagement, nationally, and internationally) have been a priority at Amherst and for former President Anthony Marx, who helped start a secondary school for black students in apartheid South Africa.

One of the longstanding traditions at the college involves the &quot;Sabrina&quot; statue. Even year and odd year classes battle for possession of the historic statue, often engaging in elaborate pranks in the process.

=== Sexual assault ===
In 2012, President Biddy Martin began a community-wide review of the sexual misconduct and disciplinary policies at the college. This review was sparked by several factors, including an underground fraternity&#x27;s T-shirt design that critics alleged was misogynist and an essay by Angie Epifano published in &quot;The Amherst Student&quot;, wherein she accused the college of inappropriate handling of a case of sexual assault. In January 2013, a college committee published a report noting Amherst&#x27;s rate of sexual assault as similar to other colleges and universities, and making recommendations to address the problem. In May 2014, the Amherst board of trustees banned students from joining any underground or off-campus fraternity.

After a complaint was filed by Epifano and an anonymous former student in November 2013, the US Department of Education opened an investigation into the college&#x27;s handling of sexual violence and potential violations of Title IX. In May 2014, the Department of Education announced a list of 55 colleges and universities (including Amherst) currently under investigation.

A report from Amherst College stated that 2009 to 2011, Amherst reported 35 instances of &quot;forcible sex offenses&quot;, a term that encompasses rape, attempted rape, and lesser forms of sexual contact.

In 2022, in response to the anonymous sharing of sexual assault experiences at Amherst College on the Instagram account @amherstshareyourstory, then President Biddy Martin announced the launch of a new comprehensive review of the issue of sexual misconduct and assault on campus. According to the 2023 NECHE Interim Crediting Report listening sessions and interviews were conducted, and a website for anonymous reporting of concerns was created. The NECHE interim report also suggested that the review was expected to be published in Spring 2023. However currently there has been no update or public disclosure of the 2022 review.

=== Mascot ===
In the second decade of the 21st century, the original unofficial mascot of Amherst College, Lord Jeffery Amherst, became a cause of concern in the Amherst community. Many sought to separate the school from the problematic legacy of Lord Jeffery Amherst, in particular his advocacy of the use of biological warfare against Native Americans.

In May 2014, after a wild moose found its way onto the Amherst College campus and into the backyard of the house of the college president, students organized a Facebook campaign to change the mascot of the school to a moose. The page grew rapidly in popularity, receiving over 900 &quot;likes&quot; in under two weeks, and inspiring both a Twitter and Tumblr account for the newly proposed mascot. At the Commencement ceremony for the class of 2014, the moose mascot was mentioned by Biddy Martin in her address, and the Dining Hall served Moose Tracks ice cream in front of an ice sculpture of a moose.

In February 2015, discussion of a mascot change continued when the editorial board of the &quot;Amherst Student&quot;, the college&#x27;s official student-run newspaper, came out in favor of &quot;the moose-scot&quot;. In November 2015 the student body and the faculty overwhelmingly voted to vacate the mascot. That same month, several hundred students who staged a sit-in protest against racism at the college library included among their demands a call for the college to cease use of the Lord Jeff mascot. The decision to drop the mascot was made official by the college&#x27;s trustees on January 26, 2016.

In April 2017, Amherst announced that their official mascot would be the mammoth. Mammoths beat the other finalists &quot;Valley Hawks&quot;, &quot;Purple and White&quot;, &quot;Wolves&quot;, and &quot;Fighting Poets&quot; in a ranked-choice election process. The mammoth is linked to Amherst due to the long-standing presence of a Columbian Mammoth skeleton on display in the Beneski Museum of Natural History on campus dating back to the 1920s excavation of the skeleton by Amherst professor Frederic Brewster Loomis in Melbourne, Florida.

==Athletics==
Amherst participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Small College Athletic Conference, which includes Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Connecticut College, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, Wesleyan, and Williams College. Amherst is also one of the &quot;Little Three&quot;, along with Williams and Wesleyan. A Little Three champion is informally recognized by most teams based on the head-to-head records of the three schools, but three-way competitions are held in some of the sports.

Amherst claims its athletics program as the oldest in the nation, pointing to its compulsory physical fitness regimen put in place in 1860 (the mandate that all students participate in sports or pursue physical education has been discontinued). Amherst and Williams played the first college baseball game July 2, 1859.

Amherst&#x27;s growing athletics program has been the subject of controversy in recent years due to dramatic contrasts between the racial and socioeconomic makeup of its student athletes and the rest of its student body, the clustering of athletes in particular academic departments, and a perceived &quot;divide&quot; on campus between varsity athletes and other students. Athletic skill plays a factor in the admissions decisions of between 28% and 35% of each incoming class.
Amherst fields several club athletic teams, including ultimate, soccer, crew, rugby union, water polo, equestrian, mountain biking, fencing, sailing and skiing. Intramural sports include soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, volleyball and softball.

The sport of Ultimate was started and named at Amherst College in the mid-1960s by Jared Kass.

===Varsity sports===

==Alumni==

Although a relatively small college, Amherst has many accomplished alumni, including Nobel, Crafoord Prize and Lasker Award laureates, MacArthur Fellowship and Pulitzer Prize winners, National Medal of Science and National Book Award recipients, and Academy, Tony, Grammy and Emmy Award winners; a U.S. President, the current Sovereign Prince of Monaco, two Prime Ministers and one Foreign Minister of Greece, a President of Kenya, a President of El Salvador, a Chief Justice of the United States, three Speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives, a U.S. Poet Laureate, the legal architect of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and the inventor of the blood bank; leaders in science, religion, politics, the Peace Corps, medicine, law, education, communications, and business; and acclaimed actors, architects, artists, astronauts, engineers, human rights activists, inventors, musicians, philanthropists, and writers.

Among its alumni, faculty and affiliates are six Nobel Prize laureates and twenty Rhodes Scholars. President Calvin Coolidge, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone, and other notable writers, academics, politicians, entertainers, businesspeople, and activists have been graduates as well.

There are approximately 23,000 living alumni, of whom about 45% make a gift to Amherst each year—one of the highest alumni participation rates of any college in the country.

<text>Albany ( ) is a city on the east shore of San Francisco Bay in northwestern Alameda County, California, United States. The population was 20,271 at the 2020 United States census.

==History==

In 1908, a group of local women protested the dumping of Berkeley garbage in their community. Armed with two shotguns and a twenty-two-caliber rifle, they confronted the drivers of the wagons near what is now the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street. The women told the drivers of the horse-drawn garbage wagons to go home, which they did quickly and without complaint. Shortly thereafter, the residents of the town voted to incorporate as the City of Ocean View. 

In 1909, voters changed the name of the city, primarily to distinguish the city from the adjacent section of Berkeley which had previously been named Ocean View. On a vote of 38 to 6 the city was renamed in honor of Albany, New York, the birthplace of the city&#x27;s first mayor, Frank Roberts.

The Albany Sauna is one of the oldest Finnish-style saunas open to the public in North America. Built in 1934 by Finnish-American Henry Walter Lundgren (a founding member of the Finnish Lodge in West Berkeley), the original furnace and rooms have been maintained.

Albany has a history of real estate discrimination, which made it difficult for non-white buyers to acquire property and build homes in Albany.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (67.28%) is water.

The principal shopping street in Albany is Solano Avenue, which cuts across the city from west to east. Another important street is San Pablo Avenue, which travels from north to south.

Albany is a small city located on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay, bordering the city of Berkeley to the south and east, and the Contra Costa County cities of El Cerrito and Richmond to the north. Albany&#x27;s northern and southern borders are defined by two creeks, Codornices Creek on the south and Cerrito Creek on the north. Cerrito Creek takes its name from &quot;El Cerrito de San Antonio&quot;, now known as Albany Hill. The hill&#x27;s unusual location near the bay shore makes it a prominent landmark in the East Bay. The rest of the city is relatively flat by Bay Area standards, except for a small area near the base of the Berkeley Hills.

Albany&#x27;s waterfront has undergone significant man-made changes; the most prominent landform is now the Albany Bulb, a former garbage landfill jutting out into San Francisco Bay. The bulb was the site of a small art colony and shanty town until it was cleared to turn the area into part of the new Eastshore State Park.

University Village, a housing unit of the University of California Berkeley, is located in Albany.

<doc id="60358" wikidata="Q507477" url="?curid=60358" title="Internal rate of return">
<text>Internal rate of return (IRR) is a method of calculating an investment&#x27;s rate of return. The term &quot;internal&quot; refers to the fact that the calculation excludes external factors, such as the risk-free rate, inflation, the cost of capital, or financial risk.

The method may be applied either ex-post or ex-ante. Applied ex-ante, the IRR is an estimate of a future annual rate of return. Applied ex-post, it measures the actual achieved investment return of a historical investment.

It is also called the discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) or yield rate.

==Definition (IRR) ==

The IRR of an investment or project is the &quot;annualized effective compounded return rate&quot; or rate of return that sets the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. Equivalently, it is the interest rate at which the net present value of the future cash flows is equal to the initial investment, and it is also the interest rate at which the total present value of costs (negative cash flows) equals the total present value of the benefits (positive cash flows).

IRR represents the return on investment achieved when a project reaches its breakeven point, meaning that the project is only marginally justified as valuable. When NPV demonstrates a positive value, it indicates that the project is expected to generate value. Conversely, if NPV shows a negative value, the project is expected to lose value. In essence, IRR signifies the rate of return attained when the NPV of the project reaches a neutral state, precisely at the point where NPV breaks even.

IRR accounts for the time preference of money and investments. A given return on investment received at a given time is worth more than the same return received at a later time, so the latter would yield a lower IRR than the former, if all other factors are equal. A fixed income investment in which money is deposited once, interest on this deposit is paid to the investor at a specified interest rate every time period, and the original deposit neither increases nor decreases, would have an IRR equal to the specified interest rate. An investment which has the same total returns as the preceding investment, but delays returns for one or more time periods, would have a lower IRR.

==Uses==
===Savings and loans===
In the context of savings and loans, the IRR is also called the effective interest rate.

===Profitability of an investment===
The IRR is an indicator of the profitability, efficiency, quality, or yield of an investment. This is in contrast with the NPV, which is an indicator of the net value or magnitude added by making an investment.

To maximize the value of a business, an investment should be made only if its profitability, as measured by the internal rate of return, is greater than a minimum acceptable rate of return. If the estimated IRR of a project or investment - for example, the construction of a new factory - exceeds the firm&#x27;s cost of capital invested in that project, the investment is profitable. If the estimated IRR is less than the cost of capital, the proposed project should not be undertaken.

The selection of investments may be subject to budget constraints. There may be mutually exclusive competing projects, or limits on a firm&#x27;s ability to manage multiple projects. For these reasons, corporations use IRR in capital budgeting to compare the profitability of a set of alternative capital projects. For example, a corporation will compare an investment in a new plant versus an extension of an existing plant based on the IRR of each project. To maximize returns, the higher a project&#x27;s IRR, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.

There are at least two different ways to measure the IRR for an investment: the project IRR and the equity IRR. The project IRR assumes that the cash flows directly benefit the project, whereas equity IRR considers the returns for the shareholders of the company after the debt has been serviced. 

Even though IRR is one of the most popular metrics used to test the viability of an investment and compare returns of alternative projects, looking at the IRR in isolation might not be the best approach for an investment decision. Certain assumptions made during IRR calculations are not always applicable to the investment. In particular, IRR assumes that the project will have either no interim cash flows or the interim cash flows are reinvested into the project which is not always the case. This discrepancy leads to overestimation of the rate of return which might be an incorrect representation of the value of the project. 

===Fixed income===
IRR is used to evaluate investments in fixed income securities, using metrics such as the yield to maturity and yield to call.

===Liabilities===
Both IRR and net present value can be applied to liabilities as well as investments. For a liability, a lower IRR is preferable to a higher one.

===Capital management===
Corporations use IRR to evaluate share issues and stock buyback programs. A share repurchase proceeds if returning capital to shareholders has a higher IRR than candidate capital investment projects or acquisition projects at current market prices. Funding new projects by raising new debt may also involve measuring the cost of the new debt in terms of the yield to maturity (internal rate of return).

===Private equity===
IRR is also used for private equity, from the limited partners&#x27; perspective, as a measure of the general partner&#x27;s performance as investment manager. This is because it is the general partner who controls the cash flows, including the limited partners&#x27; draw-downs of committed capital.

==Calculation==

Given a collection of pairs (time, cash flow) representing a project, the NPV is a function of the rate of return. The internal rate of return is a rate for which this function is zero, i.e. the internal rate of return is a solution to the equation NPV = 0 (assuming no arbitrage conditions exist).

Given the (period, cash flow) pairs (formula_1, formula_2) where formula_1 is a non-negative integer, the total number of periods formula_4, and the formula_5, (net present value); the internal rate of return is given by formula_6 in:

: formula_7
This rational polynomial can be converted to an ordinary polynomial having the same roots by substituting &quot;g&quot; (gain) for formula_8 and multiplying by formula_9 to yield the equivalent but simpler condition

: formula_10

The possible IRR&#x27;s are the real values of &quot;r&quot; satisfying the first condition, and 1 less than the real roots of the second condition (that is, formula_11 for each root &quot;g&quot;). Note that in both formulas, formula_12 is the negation of the initial investment at the start of the project while formula_13 is the cash value of the project at the end, equivalently the cash withdrawn if the project were to be liquidated and paid out so as to reduce the value of the project to zero. In the second condition formula_12 is the leading coefficient of the ordinary polynomial in &quot;g&quot; while formula_13 is the constant term.

The period formula_1 is usually given in years, but the calculation may be made simpler if formula_6 is calculated using the period in which the majority of the problem is defined (e.g., using months if most of the cash flows occur at monthly intervals) and converted to a yearly period thereafter.

Any fixed time can be used in place of the present (e.g., the end of one interval of an annuity); the value obtained is zero if and only if the NPV is zero.

In the case that the cash flows are random variables, such as in the case of a life annuity, the expected values are put into the above formula.

Often, the value of formula_6 that satisfies the above equation cannot be found analytically. In this case, numerical methods or graphical methods must be used.

===Example===

If an investment may be given by the sequence of cash flows
&#x27;

then the IRR formula_6 is given by

: formula_20

In this case, the answer is 5.96% (in the calculation, that is, r = .0596).

====Numerical solution====
Since the above is a manifestation of the general problem of finding the roots of the equation formula_21, there are many numerical methods that can be used to estimate formula_6. For example, using the secant method, formula_6 is given by

: formula_24

where formula_25 is considered the formula_1th approximation of the IRR.

This formula_6 can be found to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Different accounting packages may provide functions for different accuracy levels. For example, Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets have built-in functions to calculate IRR for both fixed and variable time-intervals; &quot;=IRR(...)&quot; and &quot;=XIRR(...)&quot;.

The convergence behaviour of by the following:
*If the function formula_28 has a single real root formula_6, then the sequence converges reproducibly towards formula_6.
*If the function formula_28 has formula_1 real roots formula_33, then the sequence converges to one of the roots, and changing the values of the initial pairs may change the root to which it converges.
*If function formula_28 has no real roots, then the sequence tends towards +∞.

Having formula_35 when formula_36 or formula_37 when formula_38 may speed up convergence of formula_25 to formula_6.

====Numerical solution for single outflow and multiple inflows====
Of particular interest is the case where the stream of payments consists of a single outflow, followed by multiple inflows occurring at equal periods. In the above notation, this corresponds to:

: formula_41

In this case the NPV of the payment stream is a convex, strictly decreasing function of interest rate. There is always a single unique solution for IRR.

Given two estimates formula_42 and formula_43 for IRR, the secant method equation (see above) with formula_44 always produces an improved estimate formula_45. This is sometimes referred to as the Hit and Trial (or Trial and Error) method. More accurate interpolation formulas can also be obtained: for instance the secant formula with correction
: formula_46

(which is most accurate when formula_47) has been shown to be almost 10 times more accurate than the secant formula for a wide range of interest rates and initial guesses. For example, using the stream of payments {−4000, 1200, 1410, 1875, 1050} and initial guesses formula_48 and formula_49 the secant formula with correction gives an IRR estimate of 14.2% (0.7% error) as compared to IRR = 13.2% (7% error) from the secant method.

If applied iteratively, either the secant method or the improved formula always converges to the correct solution.

Both the secant method and the improved formula rely on initial guesses for IRR. The following initial guesses may be used:

::formula_50

::formula_51

where

::formula_52

::formula_53

Here, formula_54 refers to the NPV of the inflows only (that is, set formula_55 and compute NPV).

===Exact dates of cash flows===
A cash flow formula_2 may occur at any time formula_57 years after the beginning of the project. formula_57 may not be a whole number. The cash flow should still be discounted by a factor formula_59. And the formula is

: formula_60

For numerical solution we can use Newton&#x27;s method

: formula_61
where formula_62 is the derivative of formula_5 and given by
: formula_64
An initial value formula_42 can be given by
: formula_66

==Problems with use==
===Comparison with NPV investment selection criterion===
As a tool applied to making an investment decision on whether a project adds value or not, comparing the IRR of a single project with the required rate of return, in isolation from any other projects, is equivalent to the NPV method. If the appropriate IRR (if such can be found correctly) is greater than the required rate of return, using the required rate of return to discount cash flows to their present value, the NPV of that project will be positive, and vice versa. However, using IRR to sort projects in order of preference does not result in the same order as using NPV.

===Maximizing NPV===
One possible investment objective is to maximize the total NPV of projects.

When the objective is to maximize total value, the calculated IRR should not be used to choose between mutually exclusive projects. In cases where one project has a higher initial investment than a second mutually exclusive project, the first project may have a lower IRR (expected return), but a higher NPV (increase in shareholders&#x27; wealth) and should thus be accepted over the second project (assuming no capital constraints).

When the objective is to maximize total value, IRR should not be used to compare projects of different duration. For example, the NPV added by a project with longer duration but lower IRR could be greater than that of a project of similar size, in terms of total net cash flows, but with shorter duration and higher IRR.

===Practitioner preference for IRR over NPV===
Despite a strong academic preference for NPV, surveys indicate that executives prefer IRR over NPV. Apparently, managers prefer to compare investments of different sizes in terms of forecast investment performance, using IRR, rather than maximize value to the firm, in terms of NPV. This preference makes a difference when comparing mutually exclusive projects.

===Maximizing long-term return===
Maximizing total value is not the only conceivable possible investment objective. An alternative objective would for example be to maximize long-term return. Such an objective would rationally lead to accepting first those new projects within the capital budget which have the highest IRR, because adding such projects would tend to maximize overall long-term return.

====Example====
To see this, consider two investors, Max Value and Max Return. Max Value wishes her net worth to grow as large as possible, and will invest every last cent available to achieve this, whereas Max Return wants to maximize his rate of return over the long term, and would prefer to choose projects with smaller capital outlay but higher returns. Max Value and Max Return can each raise &quot;up to&quot; 100,000 US dollars from their bank at an annual interest rate of 10 percent paid at the end of the year.

Investors Max Value and Max Return are presented with two possible projects to invest in, called Big-Is-Best and Small-Is-Beautiful. Big-Is-Best requires a capital investment of 100,000 US dollars today, and the lucky investor will be repaid 132,000 US dollars in a year&#x27;s time. Small-Is-Beautiful only requires 10,000 US dollars capital to be invested today, and will repay the investor 13,750 US dollars in a year&#x27;s time.

=====Solution=====
The cost of capital for both investors is 10 percent.

Both Big-Is-Best and Small-Is-Beautiful have positive NPVs:
:formula_67
:formula_68
and the IRR of each is (of course) greater than the cost of capital:
:formula_69
so the IRR of Big-Is-Best is 32 percent, and
:formula_70
so the IRR of Small-Is-Beautiful is 37.5 percent.

Both investments would be acceptable to both investors, but the twist in the tale is that these are mutually exclusive projects for both investors, because their capital budget is limited to 100,000 US dollars. How will the investors choose rationally between the two?

The happy outcome is that Max Value chooses Big-Is-Best, which has the higher NPV of 20,000 US dollars, over Small-Is-Beautiful, which only has a modest NPV of 2,500, whereas Max Return chooses Small-Is-Beautiful, for its superior 37.5 percent return, over the attractive (but not as attractive) return of 32 percent offered on Big-Is-Best. So there is no squabbling over who gets which project, they are each happy to choose different projects.

How can this be rational for both investors? The answer lies in the fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.

===Multiple IRRs===
When the sign of the cash flows changes more than once, for example when positive cash flows are followed by negative ones and then by positive ones (+ + − − − +), the IRR may have multiple real values. In a series of cash flows like (−10, 21, −11), one initially invests money, so a high rate of return is best, but then receives more than one possesses, so then one owes money, so now a low rate of return is best. In this case, it is not even clear whether a high or a low IRR is better.

There may even be multiple real IRRs for a single project, like in the example 0% as well as 10%. Examples of this type of project are strip mines and nuclear power plants, where there is usually a large cash outflow at the end of the project.

The IRR satisfies a polynomial equation. Sturm&#x27;s theorem can be used to determine if that equation has a unique real solution. In general the IRR equation cannot be solved analytically but only by iteration.

With multiple internal rates of return, the IRR approach can still be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the present value approach if the underlying investment stream is correctly identified as net investment or net borrowing.

See for a way of identifying the relevant IRR from a set of multiple IRR solutions.

===Limitations in the context of private equity===
In the context of survivorship bias which makes the high IRR of large private equity firms a poor representation of the average, according to Ludovic Phalippou,

&quot;...a headline figure that is often shown prominently as a rate of return in presentations and documents is, in fact, an IRR. IRRs are not rates of return. Something large PE firms have in common is that their early investments did well. These early winners have set up those firms&#x27; since-inception IRR at an artificially sticky and high level. The mathematics of IRR means that their IRRs will stay at this level forever, as long as the firms avoid major disasters. In passing, this generates some stark injustice because it is easier to game IRRs on LBOs in Western countries than in any other PE investments. That means that the rest of the PE industry (e.g. emerging market growth capital) is sentenced to look relatively bad forever, for no reason other than the use of a game-able performance metric.&quot;

Also,

&quot;Another problem with the presentation of pension fund performance is that for PE, time-weighted returns...are not the most pertinent measure of performance. Asking how much pension funds gave and got back in dollar terms from PE, i.e. MoM, would be more pertinent. I went through the largest 15 funds websites to collect information on their performance. Few of them post their PE fund returns online. In most cases, they post information on their past performance in PE, but nothing that enables any meaningful benchmarking. &quot;E.g.&quot;, CalSTRS [a California public pension fund] provide only the net IRR for each fund they invest in. As IRR is often misleading and can never be aggregated or compared to stock-market returns, such information is basically useless for gauging performance.&quot;

===Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)===
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) considers cost of capital, and is intended to provide a better indication of a project&#x27;s probable return. It applies a discount rate for borrowing cash, and the IRR is calculated for the investment cash flows. This applies in real life for example when a customer makes a deposit before a specific machine is built.

When a project has multiple IRRs it may be more convenient to compute the IRR of the project with the benefits reinvested. Accordingly, MIRR is used, which has an assumed reinvestment rate, usually equal to the project&#x27;s cost of capital.

===Average internal rate of return (AIRR)===
Magni (2010) introduced a new approach, named AIRR approach, based on the intuitive notion of mean, that solves the problems of the IRR. However, the above-mentioned difficulties are only some of the many flaws incurred by the IRR. Magni (2013) provided a detailed list of 18 flaws of the IRR and showed how the AIRR approach does not incur the IRR problems.
==Mathematics==
Mathematically, the value of the investment is assumed to undergo exponential growth or decay according to some rate of return (any value greater than −100%), with discontinuities for cash flows, and the IRR of a series of cash flows is defined as any rate of return that results in a NPV of zero (or equivalently, a rate of return that results in the correct value of zero after the last cash flow).

Thus, internal rate(s) of return follow from the NPV as a function of the rate of return. This function is continuous. Towards a rate of return of −100% the NPV approaches infinity with the sign of the last cash flow, and towards a rate of return of positive infinity the NPV approaches the first cash flow (the one at the present). Therefore, if the first and last cash flow have a different sign there exists an IRR. Examples of time series without an IRR:

* Only negative cash flows — the NPV is negative for every rate of return.
* (−1, 1, −1), rather small positive cash flow between two negative cash flows; the NPV is a quadratic function of 1/(1 + &quot;r&quot;), where &quot;r&quot; is the rate of return, or put differently, a quadratic function of the discount rate &quot;r&quot;/(1 + &quot;r&quot;); the highest NPV is −0.75, for &quot;r&quot; = 100%.

In the case of a series of exclusively negative cash flows followed by a series of exclusively positive ones, the resulting function of the rate of return is continuous and monotonically decreasing from positive infinity (when the rate of return approaches -100%) to the value of the first cash flow (when the rate of return approaches infinity), so there is a unique rate of return for which it is zero. Hence, the IRR is also unique (and equal). Although the NPV-function itself is not necessarily monotonically decreasing on its whole domain, it &quot;is&quot; at the IRR.

Similarly, in the case of a series of exclusively positive cash flows followed by a series of exclusively negative ones the IRR is also unique.

Finally, by Descartes&#x27; rule of signs, the number of internal rates of return can never be more than the number of changes in sign of cash flow.

==The reinvestment debate==
It is often stated that IRR assumes reinvestment of all cash flows until the very end of the project. This assertion has been a matter of debate in the literature.

Sources stating that there is such a hidden assumption have been cited below. Other sources have argued that there is no IRR reinvestment assumption.

To understand the source of this confusion let&#x27;s consider an example with a 3-year bond of $1000 face value and coupon rate of 5% (or $50).

As can be seen, although the total return is different the IRR is still the same. Put in other words, IRR is neutral to reinvestments made at the same rate. No matter whether the cash is taken out early or reinvested at the same rate and taken out late - the rate is the same.

To understand why, we need to calculate the present value (PV) of our future cash flows, effectively reproducing IRR calculations manually:

==In personal finance==
The IRR can be used to measure the money-weighted performance of financial investments such as an
individual investor&#x27;s brokerage account. For this scenario, an 
equivalent, 
more intuitive definition of the IRR is, &quot;The IRR is the annual interest rate of the fixed rate account (like a somewhat idealized savings account)
which, when subjected to the same deposits and withdrawals as the actual investment, has the same ending balance as the actual investment.&quot; 
This fixed rate account is also called the &quot;replicating fixed rate account&quot; for the investment. There are examples where 
the replicating fixed rate account encounters negative balances despite the fact that the actual investment did not. 
In those cases, the IRR calculation assumes that the same interest rate that is paid on positive balances is charged on 
negative balances. It has been shown that this way of charging interest is the root cause of the IRR&#x27;s multiple solutions 
problem. If the model is modified so that, as is the case in real life, an externally supplied cost of borrowing 
(possibly varying over time) is charged on negative balances, the multiple solutions issue 
disappears. The resulting rate is 
called the &quot;fixed rate equivalent&quot; (&quot;FREQ&quot;).

==Unannualized internal rate of return==
In the context of investment performance measurement, there is sometimes ambiguity in terminology between the periodic rate of return, such as the IRR as defined above, and a holding period return. The term &quot;internal rate of return&quot; (&quot;IRR)&quot; or &quot;Since Inception Internal Rate of Return&quot; (&quot;SI-IRR)&quot; is in some contexts used to refer to the unannualized return over the period, particularly for periods of less than a year.

<text>Benthos (), also known as benthon, is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the bottom of a sea, river, lake, or stream, also known as the benthic zone. This community lives in or near marine or freshwater sedimentary environments, from tidal pools along the foreshore, out to the continental shelf, and then down to the abyssal depths.

Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column. The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for every 10 metres of water depth).

Because light is absorbed before it can reach deep ocean water, the energy source for deep benthic ecosystems is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths. This dead and decaying matter sustains the benthic food chain; most organisms in the benthic zone are scavengers or detritivores.

The term &quot;benthos&quot;, coined by Haeckel in 1891, comes from the Greek noun &#x27;depth of the sea&#x27;. &quot;Benthos&quot; is used in freshwater biology to refer to organisms at the bottom of freshwater bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. There is also a redundant synonym, &quot;Benton&quot;.

==Overview==
Compared to the relatively featureless pelagic zone, the benthic zone offers physically diverse habitats. There is a huge range in how much light and warmth is available, and in the depth of water or extent of intertidal immersion. The seafloor varies widely in the types of sediment it offers. Burrowing animals can find protection and food in soft, loose sediments such as mud, clay and sand. Sessile species such as oysters and barnacles can attach themselves securely to hard, rocky substrates. As adults they can remain at the same site, shaping depressions and crevices where mobile animals find refuge. This greater diversity in benthic habitats has resulted in a higher diversity of benthic species. The number of benthic animal species exceeds one million. This far exceeds the number of pelagic animal species (about 5000 larger zooplankton species, 22,000 pelagic fish species and 110 marine mammal species).

==By size==

===Macrobenthos===

Macrobenthos, prefix , comprises the larger, visible to the naked eye, benthic organisms greater than about 1 mm in size. In shallow waters, seagrass meadows, coral reefs and kelp forests provide particularly rich habitats for macrobenthos. Some examples are polychaete worms, bivalves, echinoderms, sea anemones, corals, sponges, sea squirts, turbellarians and larger crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters and cumaceans.


===Meiobenthos===

Meiobenthos, prefix , comprises tiny benthic organisms that are less than about 1 mm but greater than about 0.1 mm in size. Some examples are nematodes, foraminiferans, tardigrades, gastrotriches and smaller crustaceans such as copepods and ostracodes.


===Microbenthos===
Microbenthos, prefix from the Greek &quot;mikrós&quot; &#x27;small&#x27;, comprises microscopic benthic organisms that are less than about 0.1 mm in size. Some examples are bacteria, diatoms, ciliates, amoeba, flagellates.


Marine microbenthos are microorganisms that live in the benthic zone of the ocean – that live near or on the seafloor, or within or on surface seafloor sediments. Microbenthos are found everywhere on or about the seafloor of continental shelves, as well as in deeper waters, with greater diversity in or on seafloor sediments. In photic zones benthic diatoms dominate as photosynthetic organisms. In intertidal zones changing tides strongly control opportunities for microbenthos.



Both foraminifera and diatoms have planktonic and benthic forms, that is, they can drift in the water column or live on sediment at the bottom of the ocean. Regardless of form, their shells sink to the seafloor after they die. These shells are widely used as climate proxies. The chemical composition of the shells are a consequence of the chemical composition of the ocean at the time the shells were formed. Past water temperatures can be also be inferred from the ratios of stable oxygen isotopes in the shells, since lighter isotopes evaporate more readily in warmer water leaving the heavier isotopes in the shells. Information about past climates can be inferred further from the abundance of forams and diatoms, since they tend to be more abundant in warm water.The sudden extinction event which killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago also rendered extinct three-quarters of all other animal and plant species. However, deep-sea benthic forams flourished in the aftermath. In 2020 it was reported that researchers have examined the chemical composition of thousands of samples of these benthic forams and used their findings to build the most detailed climate record of Earth ever.

Some endoliths have extremely long lives. In 2013 researchers reported evidence of endoliths in the ocean floor, perhaps millions of years old, with a generation time of 10,000 years. These are slowly metabolizing and not in a dormant state. Some Actinomycetota found in Siberia are estimated to be half a million years old.

==By type==
===Zoobenthos===
Zoobenthos, prefix , animals belonging to the benthos. Examples include polychaete worms, starfish and anemones.

===Phytobenthos===
Phytobenthos, prefix , plants belonging to the benthos, mainly benthic diatoms and macroalgae (seaweed).

==By location==
===Endobenthos===
Endobenthos (or endobenthic), prefix , lives buried, or burrowing in the sediment, often in the oxygenated top layer, e.g., a sea pen or a sand dollar.

===Epibenthos===
Epibenthos (or epibenthic), prefix , lives on top of the sediments, e.g., sea cucumber or a sea snail.

===Hyperbenthos===
Hyperbenthos (or hyperbenthic), prefix , lives just above the sediment, e.g., a rock cod.

==Food sources==
The main food sources for the benthos are phytoplankton and organic detrital matter. In coastal locations, organic run off from land provides an additional food source. Meiofauna and bacteria consume and recycle organic matter in the sediments, playing an important role in returning nitrate and phosphate to the pelagic.

The depth of water, temperature and salinity, and type of local substrate all affect what benthos is present. In coastal waters and other places where light reaches the bottom, benthic photosynthesizing diatoms can proliferate. Filter feeders, such as sponges and bivalves, dominate hard, sandy bottoms. Deposit feeders, such as polychaetes, populate softer bottoms. Fish, such as dragonets, as well as sea stars, snails, cephalopods, and crustaceans are important predators and scavengers.

Benthic organisms, such as sea stars, oysters, clams, sea cucumbers, brittle stars and sea anemones, play an important role as a food source for fish, such as the California sheephead, and humans.

== Ecological role ==

=== Benthos as bioindicators ===
Benthic macro-invertebrates play a critical role in aquatic ecosystems. These organisms can be used to indicate the presence, concentration, and effect of water pollutants in the aquatic environment. Some water contaminants—such as nutrients, chemicals from surface runoff, and metals—settle in the sediment of river beds, where many benthos reside. Benthos are highly sensitive to contamination, so their close proximity to high pollutant concentrations make these organisms ideal for studying water contamination.

Benthos can be used as bioindicators of water pollution through ecological population assessments or through analyzing biomarkers. In ecological population assessments, a relative value of water pollution can be detected. Observing the number and diversity of macro-invertebrates in a waterbody can indicate the pollution level. In highly contaminated waters, a reduced number of organisms and only pollution-tolerant species will be found. In biomarker assessments, quantitative data can be collected on the amount of and direct effect of specific pollutants in a waterbody. The biochemical response of macro-invertebrates&#x27; internal tissues can be studied extensively in the laboratory. The concentration of a chemical can cause many changes, including changing feeding behaviors, inflammation, and genetic damage, effects that can be detected outside of the stream environment. Biomarker analysis is important for mitigating the negative impacts of water pollution because it can detect water pollution before it has a noticeable ecological effect on benthos populations.

==Carbon processing==
Organic matter produced in the sunlit layer of the ocean and delivered to the sediments is either consumed by organisms or buried. The organic matter consumed by organisms is used to synthesize biomass (i.e. growth) converted to carbon dioxide through respiration, or returned to the sediment as faeces. This cycle can occur many times before either all organic matter is used up or eventually buried. This process is known as the biological pump.

In the long-term or at steady-state, i.e., the biomass of benthic organisms does not change, the benthic community can be considered a black box diverting organic matter into either metabolites or the geosphere (burial). The macrobenthos also indirectly impacts carbon cycling on the seafloor through bioturbation.

== Threats ==
Benthos are negatively impacted by fishing, pollution and litter, deep-sea mining, oil and gas activities, tourism, shipping, invasive species, climate change (and its impacts such as ocean acidification, ocean warming and changes to ocean circulation) and construction such as coastal development, undersea cables, and wind farm construction.

<doc id="60360" wikidata="Q331974" url="?curid=60360" title="Anapsid">
<text>An anapsid is an amniote whose skull lacks one or more skull openings (fenestra, or fossae) near the temples. Traditionally, the Anapsida are considered the most primitive subclass of amniotes, the ancestral stock from which Synapsida and Diapsida evolved, making anapsids paraphyletic. It is, however, doubtful that all anapsids lack temporal fenestra as a primitive trait, and that all the groups traditionally seen as anapsids truly lacked fenestra.

==Anapsids and the turtles==
While &quot;anapsid reptiles&quot; or &quot;Anapsida&quot; were traditionally spoken of as if they were a monophyletic group, it has been suggested that several groups of reptiles that had anapsid skulls might be only distantly related. Scientists still debate the exact relationship between the basal (original) reptiles that first appeared in the late Carboniferous, the various Permian reptiles that had anapsid skulls, and the Testudines (turtles, tortoises, and terrapins). However, it was later suggested that the anapsid-like turtle skull is due to reversion rather than to anapsid descent. The majority of modern paleontologists believe that the Testudines are descended from diapsid reptiles that lost their temporal fenestrae. More recent morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within diapsids, or, more commonly, within Archelosauria.

==Phylogenetic position of turtles==
All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids; some place turtles within Archosauria, or, more commonly, as a sister group to extant archosaurs. One molecular study, published in 2012, suggests that turtles are lepidosauromorph diapsids, most closely related to the lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes, and tuataras). However, in a later paper from the same authors, published in 2014, based on more extensive data, the archosauromorph hypothesis is supported.

Reanalysis of prior phylogenies suggests that they classified turtles as anapsids both because they assumed this classification (most of them were studying what sort of anapsid turtles are) and because they did not sample fossil and extant taxa broadly enough for constructing the cladogram. Testudines is suggested to have diverged from other diapsids between 200 and 279 million years ago, though the debate is far from settled. Although procolophonids managed to survive into the Triassic, most of the other reptiles with anapsid skulls, including the millerettids, nycteroleterids, and pareiasaurs, became extinct in the Late Permian period by the Permian-Triassic extinction event.

Despite the molecular studies, there is evidence that contradicts their classification as diapsids. All known diapsids excrete uric acid as nitrogenous waste (uricotelic), and there is no known case of a diapsid reverting to the excretion of urea (ureotelism), even when they return to semi-aquatic lifestyles. Crocodilians, for example, are still uricotelic, although they are also partly ammonotelic, meaning they excrete some of their waste as ammonia. Ureotelism appears to be the ancestral condition among primitive amniotes, and it is retained by mammals, which likely inherited ureotelism from their synapsid and therapsid ancestors. Ureotelism therefore would suggest that turtles were more likely anapsids than diapsids. The only known uricotelic chelonian is the desert tortoise, which likely evolved it recently as adaptation to desert habitats. Some desert mammals are also uricotelic, so since practically all known mammals are ureotelic, uricotelic adaptation is a likely result of convergence among desert species. Therefore, turtles would have to be the only known case of a uricotelic reptile reverting to ureotelism.

==Anapsida in modern taxonomy==
Anapsida is still sporadically recognized as a valid group, but is not favoured by current workers. Anapsids in the traditional meaning of the word are not a clade, but rather a paraphyletic group composed of all the early reptiles retaining the primitive skull morphology, grouped together by the absence of temporal openings. Gauthier, Kluge and Rowe (1988) attempted to redefine Anapsida so it would be monophyletic, defining it as the clade containing &quot;extant turtles and all other extinct taxa that are more closely related to them than they are to other reptiles&quot;.

This definition explicitly includes turtles in Anapsida; because the phylogenetic placement of turtles within Amniota is very uncertain, it is unclear what taxa, other than turtles themselves, would be included in such defined Anapsida, and whether its content would be similar to the Anapsida of tradition. Indeed, Gauthier, Kluge and Rowe (1988) themselves included only turtles and Captorhinidae in their Anapsida, while excluding the majority of anapsids in the traditional sense of the word from it.

==Temporal openings in traditional anapsids==
Tsuji and Müller (2009) noted that the name Anapsida implies a morphology (lack of temporal openings) that is in fact absent in the skeletons of a number of taxa traditionally included in the group. A temporal opening in the skull roof behind each eye, similar to that present in the skulls of synapsids, has been discovered in the skulls of a number of members of Parareptilia (the group containing most of reptiles traditionally referred to as anapsids), including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs. The presence of temporal openings in the skulls of these taxa makes it uncertain whether the ancestral reptiles had an anapsid-like skull as traditionally assumed or a synapsid-like skull instead.

<text>In classical and late antiquity, Illyria (; , &quot;Illyría&quot; or , &quot;Illyrís&quot;; , &quot;Illyricum&quot;) was a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by numerous tribes of people collectively known as the Illyrians.

The Ancient Greeks initially used the term Illyris to define approximately the area of northern and central Albania down to the Aoös valley (modern Vjosa) and the Bay of Vlorë, including in most periods much of the lakeland area (Ohrid and Prespa). It corresponded to the region that neighboured Macedonia and Epirus. In Roman times the terms Illyria, Illyris, or Illyricum were extended from the territory that was roughly located in the area of the south-eastern Adriatic coast (modern Albania and Montenegro) and its hinterland, to a broader region stretching between the whole eastern Adriatic and the Danube.

From about mid-1st century BC the term &quot;Illyricum&quot; was used by the Romans for the province of the Empire that stretched along the eastern Adriatic coast north of the Drin river, south of which the Roman province of Macedonia began including the southern part of the traditional region of Illyria. In the Late Roman Empire the name was used for the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.

==Etymology==

In Greek mythology, the name of Illyria is aetiologically traced to Illyrius, the son of Cadmus and Harmonia, who eventually ruled Illyria and became the eponymous ancestor of the Illyrians. A later version of the myth identifies Polyphemus and Galatea as parents of Celtus, Galas, and Illyrius.

Ancient Greek writers used the name &quot;Illyrian&quot; to describe peoples between the Liburnians and Epirus. Fourth-century BC Greek writers clearly separated the people along the Adriatic coast from the Illyrians, and only in the 1st century AD was &quot;Illyrian&quot; used as a general term for all the peoples across the Adriatic. Writers also spoke of &quot;Illyrians in the strict sense of the word&quot;; Pomponius Mela (43 AD) the &quot;stricto sensu&quot; Illyrians lived north of the Taulantii and Enchele, on the Adriatic shore; Pliny the Elder used &quot;properly named Illyrians&quot; (&quot;Illyrii proprii/proprie dicti&quot;) for a small people south of Epidaurum, or between Epidaurum (now Cavtat) and Lissus (now Lezhë). In the Roman period, &quot;Illyricum&quot;, a term which signified a broader region than Illyria, was used for the area between the Adriatic and Danube.

==History==

The prehistory of Illyria and the Illyrians is known from archaeological evidence. The Romans conquered the region in 168 BC in the aftermath of the Illyrian Wars.

===Kingdoms===
The earliest recorded Illyrian kingdom was that of the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the Ardiaei began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well. As for the Dardanians, they always had separate domains from the rest of the Illyrians.

The Illyrian kingdoms were composed of small areas within the region of Illyria. Only the Romans ruled the entire region. The internal organization of the south Illyrian kingdoms points to imitation of their neighbouring Greek kingdoms and influence from the Greek and Hellenistic world in the growth of their urban centres. Polybius gives as an image of society within an Illyrian kingdom as peasant infantry fought under aristocrats which he calls in Greek &quot;Polydynastae&quot; (Greek: Πολυδυνάστες) where each one controlled a town within the kingdom. The monarchy was established on hereditary lines and Illyrian rulers used marriages as a means of alliance with other powers. Pliny (23–79 AD) writes that the people that formed the nucleus of the Illyrian kingdom were &#x27;Illyrians proper&#x27; or Illyrii proprie dicti. They were the Taulantii, the Pleraei, the Endirudini, Sasaei, Grabaei and the Labeatae. These later joined to form the Docleatae.

===Roman and Byzantine rule===
The Romans defeated Gentius, the last king of Illyria, at Scodra (in present-day Albania) in 168 BC and captured him, bringing him to Rome in 165 BC. Four client-republics were set up, which were in fact ruled by Rome. Later, the region was directly governed by Rome and organized as a province, with Scodra as its capital.

The Roman province of &quot;Illyricum&quot; replaced the formerly independent kingdom of Illyria. It stretched from the Drilon river in modern Albania to Istria (Croatia) in the west and to the Sava river (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the north. Salona (near modern Split in Croatia) functioned as its capital.

After subduing a troublesome revolt of Pannonians and Daesitiates, Roman administrators dissolved the province of Illyricum and divided its lands between the new provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south. Although this division occurred in 10 AD, the term &quot;Illyria&quot; remained in use in Late Latin and throughout the medieval period. After the division of the Roman Empire, the bishops of Thessalonica appointed papal vicars for Illyricum. The first of these vicars is said to have been Bishop Acholius or Ascholius (died 383 or 384), the friend of St. Basil. In the 5th century, the bishops of Illyria withdrew from communion with Rome, without attaching themselves to Constantinople, and remained for a time independent, but in 515, forty Illyrian bishops renewed their loyalty to Rome by declaring allegiance to Pope Hormisdas. The patriarchs of Constantinople succeeded in bringing Illyria under their jurisdiction in the 8th century.

==Legacy==

The name &quot;Illyria&quot; only disappears from the historical record after the Ottoman expansion into the Balkans in the 15th century, and re-emerges in the 17th century, acquiring a new significance in the Ottoman–Habsburg Wars, as Leopold I designated as the &quot;Illyrian nation&quot; the South Slavs in Hungarian territory. The term &quot;Illyrian&quot; was sometimes used for the language they spoke. Several armorials of the Early modern period, popularly called the &quot;Illyrian Armorials&quot;, depicted fictional coats of arms of Illyria.

The name &quot;Illyria&quot; was revived by Napoleon for the Illyrian Provinces that were incorporated into the French Empire from 1809 to 1813, and the Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849) was part of Austria until 1849, after which time it was not used in the reorganised Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The Illyrian movement was a South Slavic cultural and political campaign by a group of young Croatian intellectuals during the first half of the 19th century, that led to Yugoslavism.

==In culture==

William Shakespeare chose a fictionalized Illyria as the setting for his play &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. (The modernized film spoof &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; is set in &quot;Illyria High School&quot; in California.) Shakespeare also mentioned the region in &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;.

An extensive history of Illyria by Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange, was published by Joseph Keglevich in 1746.

Illyria is the setting for Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Les Mains Sales.&quot;

Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s &quot;The Illyrian Adventure&quot; is set in Illyria in 1872.

John Hawkes&#x27; 1970 novel &quot;The Blood Oranges&quot; is set in a fictionalized Illyria.

There is a fictional Illyria with its inhabitants, winged fae, in the fantasy series &quot;A Court of Thorns and Roses&quot; by Sarah J. Maas.

The fighting game series &#x27;Guilty Gear&#x27; created by Daisuke Ishiwatari, features a fictional Illyria in its world.

The television series &quot;Angel (1999 TV series)&quot; has a character named Illyria who is a main character for the back half of the final season, as well as a prominent figure in the comic spin-offs. 

The character of Una &quot;Number One&quot; Chin-Riley in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; is a member of a humanoid species called &quot;Illyrians&quot;.

<doc id="60364" wikidata="Q187655" url="?curid=60364" title="Mostly Harmless">
<text>Mostly Harmless is a 1992 novel by Douglas Adams and the fifth book in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series. It is described on the cover of the first edition as &quot;The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhikers Trilogy&quot;. It was the last &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; book written by Adams and his final book released in his lifetime.

==Plot summary==
Arthur Dent plans to sightsee across the Galaxy with his girlfriend Fenchurch, but she disappears during a hyperspace jump, a result of being from an unstable sector of the Galaxy. Depressed, Arthur continues to travel the galaxy using samples of his bodily tissues/fluids to fund his travels, assured of his safety until he visits Stavromula Beta, having killed an incarnation of Agrajag at some point in the future at said planet. During one trip, he ends up stranded on the homely planet Lamuella, and decides to stay to become a sandwich maker for the local population.
Meanwhile, Ford Prefect has returned to the offices of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, and is annoyed to find out the original publishing company, Megadodo Publications, has been taken over by InfiniDim Enterprises, which are run by the Vogons. Fearing for his life, he escapes the building, along the way stealing the yet-unpublished, seemingly sentient Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide Mk. II. He goes into hiding after sending the Guide to himself, care of Arthur, for safekeeping.

On Lamuella, Arthur is surprised by the appearance of Trillian with a teenage daughter, Random Dent. Trillian explains that she wanted a child, and used the only human DNA she could find, thus claiming that Arthur is Random&#x27;s father. She leaves Random with Arthur to allow her to better pursue her career as an intergalactic reporter. Random is frustrated with Arthur and life on Lamuella; when Ford&#x27;s package to Arthur arrives, she takes it and discovers the Guide. The Guide helps her to escape the planet on Ford&#x27;s ship after Ford arrives on the planet looking for Arthur. Discovering Random, the Guide, and Ford&#x27;s ship missing, the two manage to find a way to leave Lamuella and head for Earth, where they suspect Random is also heading to find Trillian. Ford expresses concern at the Guide&#x27;s manipulation of events, noting its &quot;Unfiltered Perception&quot; and fearing its potence and ultimate objective.

Reporter Tricia McMillan is a version of Trillian living on an alternate Earth who never took Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s offer to travel in space. She is approached by an extraterrestrial species, the Grebulons, who have created a base of operations on the planet Rupert, a recently discovered tenth planet in the Solar System. However, due to damage to their ship in arriving, they have lost most of their computer core and their memories, with the only salvageable instructions being to observe something interesting with Earth. They ask Tricia&#x27;s help to adapt astrology charts for Rupert in exchange for allowing her to interview them. She fulfills their request and conducts the interview, but the resulting footage looks so fake that she fears it will destroy her reputation if broadcast. She is called away from editing the footage to report on a spaceship landing in the middle of London.

As Tricia arrives at the scene, Random steps off the ship and begins to yell at her, mistaking Tricia for her mother. Arthur, Ford, and Trillian arrive and help Tricia to calm Random. They remove her from the chaos surrounding the spacecraft and take her to a bar. Trillian tries to warn the group that the Grebulons, having become bored with their mission, are about to destroy the Earth. Random disrupts the discussion by producing a laser gun she took from her ship. Arthur, still believing he cannot die, tries to calm Random, but a distraction causes her to fire the weapon, sending the bar into a panic. Arthur tends to a man hit by the blast, who drops a matchbook with the name of the bar - &quot;Stavro Mueller – Beta&quot; - and Arthur realizes that this is the scene of Agrajag&#x27;s final death. He sees Ford laughing wildly at this turn of events and experiences a &quot;tremendous feeling of peace&quot;.

The Grebulons destroy the Earth, believing that their horoscopes will improve if it is removed from their astrological charts. It is revealed that the Vogons designed the Guide Mk. II to achieve their desired outcome by manipulating temporal events. As a result, every version of the Earth in all realities is obliterated, fulfilling the demolition order that was issued in the first novel. Its mission complete, the Guide collapses into nothingness.

==Title==
The title derives from a joke early in the series, when Arthur Dent discovers that the entry for Earth in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; consists, in its entirety, of the word &quot;Harmless&quot;. His friend Ford Prefect, a contributor to the &quot;Guide&quot;, assures him that the next edition will contain the article on Earth that Ford has spent the last 15 years researching—somewhat cut due to space restrictions, but still an improvement. The revised article, he eventually admits, will simply read &quot;&quot;Mostly&quot; harmless&quot;. Ford had written an extensive entry covering life and recreation on Earth, but the &quot;Guide&quot; editors cut it back to &quot;Harmless&quot;. Later in the series, Ford is surprised to find that the entry on Earth has been updated to include all of his original material, prompting him to hitchhike across the galaxy and reunite with Arthur on the alternate Earth in &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;.

==Reception==
Unlike the previous books in the series, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; received mixed reviews noting its darker tone. Nicholas Lezard in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;I doubt there is a comedy sci-fi work bleaker than &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; concluded &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; has all the wit and inventiveness of vintage Douglas Adams, though its loose ends are not tied together as comprehensively as in previous &quot;Hitch-Hiker&quot; books&quot;. David Edelman in the &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;Somewhere buried in the mess is a moral about learning how to feel at home in a chaotic universe. Unfortunately, Adams&#x27; skills at conveying serious messages are nowhere near on a level with his skill at conjuring up non sequiturs, and the idea gets buried&quot;.

In an interview reprinted in &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, Adams expressed dissatisfaction with the tone of this book, which he blamed on personal problems, saying &quot;for all sorts of personal reasons that I don&#x27;t want to go into, I just had a thoroughly miserable year, and I was trying to write a book against that background. And, guess what, it was a rather bleak book!&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Radio===
Dirk Maggs adapted the book as the &quot;Quintessential Phase&quot; of the radio series, and it was broadcast in June 2005. The radio version has an entirely new, upbeat ending, appended to the existing story.

In the alternate ending, after the destruction of Earth, the description of the Babel fish from the earlier series is replayed with an additional section, which states that dolphins and Babel fish are acquainted, and that the dolphins&#x27; ability to travel through possibility space (first mentioned in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and elaborated on in &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;) is shared by the Babel fish as well. During the ending, Ford explains that the dolphins got taught this skill from the Babel fish in exchange for knowing a good place to have parties. All the major characters are carrying Babel fish in their ears, which rescue them at the moment of Earth&#x27;s destruction by transporting them to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It&#x27;s also revealed that Fenchurch was transported here when she vanished and has been patiently waiting for Arthur to show up. The characters are reunited with Marvin, and it is revealed that beyond the Restaurant (and beyond the car park in which Marvin works) lies an endless series of blue lagoons — the final destination of the dolphins. The series ends with Arthur asking Fenchurch, &quot;Will you come flying with me?&quot;, and her reply, &quot;Always.&quot;

The version released on CD contains an even longer set of alternate endings, including one set after the events of the twelfth radio episode (with Arthur Dent and Lintilla), and on an alternate Earth where Arthur Dent and Fenchurch engage together in a stand-off against Mr. Prosser.

===Audiobook===
There have been four unabridged audiobook recordings of the novel. In 1992, Adams himself recorded an edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new edition of the audiobook. This is the only book in the five novel series not to have also had a prior, abridged edition read by Stephen Moore.
In addition, the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped released a version of the book, narrated by George Guidall-Shapiro, on 4-track cassette tape in 1993.

<text>Front 242 was a Belgian electronic music group that came into prominence during the 1980s. Pioneering the style they called electronic body music, they influenced the electronic and industrial music genres.

==History==
===Formation===
Front 242 were formed in 1981 in Aarschot, near Leuven, Belgium, by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen, who wanted to create music and graphic design using emerging electronic tools. Prior to forming Front 242, Bressanutti worked on a music project called &quot;Prothese&quot; that had already produced several one-off tracks. The &quot;front&quot; part of the name comes from the idea of an organized popular uprising and the fact that the word can be translated in many languages while retaining the same meaning. The number &quot;242&quot; could have been chosen in tribute to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 which formally established the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State can live in security&quot;. The first single by the duo, &quot;Principles&quot;, with b-side &quot;Body To Body,&quot; was released in 1981.

Patrick Codenys and Jean-Luc De Meyer had separately formed a group called &quot;Underviewer&quot; at around the same time. The groups merged in 1982 after Underviewer had given their demo tapes to Bressanutti who was working at a music instruments shop at the time (Hill&#x27;s Music in Brussels.) Daniel was so impressed he asked Patrick and Jean-Luc to join Front 242.

Recordings by the band were initially created in Daniel&#x27;s apartment studio, where the entire band and their equipment were packed into a 2.5m x 2.5m room. The band incorporated as an artistic association in Belgium which allowed them to access government assistance and made it easier to afford better studio equipment.

Bressanutti, Codenys and De Meyer took turns on vocals at first, until they settled on De Meyer as the lead vocalist (early recordings with Bressanutti on vocals were subsequently released in 2004). De Meyer came to write most of the lyrics, although Valerie Jane Steele wrote several tracks including &quot;Don&#x27;t Crash.&quot; Despite falling into specific roles, however, the band sought to project a more anonymous, mysterious image, replete with dark sunglasses and militaristic uniforms so that they could not be easily identified. Bressanutti took this anonymity to the extreme, leaving stage entirely to run live shows from the sound board behind the audience.

The band self-released their first album, &quot;Geography&quot;, in 1982 and shortly after signed to the Belgian indie label consortium Les Disques du Crépuscule who later re-released the album. Their next single, &quot;U-Men&quot;, was released the same year as was the band&#x27;s first music video, produced by Marcel Vanthilt and played on the program RoodVonk on VRT (Vlaamse Radio Televisie - Flemish Radio &amp; TV). The video proved a challenge, not only conceptually given the band&#x27;s insistence on anonymity, but because of the small budget; ultimately the video was shot on location in Daniel&#x27;s bedroom.

In 1983, the band brought on Richard Jonckheere (a.k.a.: Richard 23), who they became familiar with through Richard&#x27;s own &quot;noise concept,&quot; as a percussionist and second vocalist to help boost the band&#x27;s live presence. Not long after, Dirk Bergen left the band to manage the group and pursue a graphic design career. Also in 1983 the band released the EP &quot;Endless Riddance&quot;.

===Rising popularity===
Front 242 became a popular musical group in Belgium, particularly for their &quot;infamous&quot; live performances that involved loud sound, aggressive stage presence, smoke, and bright flashing lights. The music press in Belgium was less receptive, sometimes interpreting their militaristic appearance, dark music, and samples from war movies - especially given the backdrop of the Cold War and terror incidents in Belgium - as being pro-fascist, an interpretation that the band firmly rejected.

Their second album, &quot;No Comment&quot;, released in 1984, was the first to introduce the term electronic body music in association with their sound via the liner notes, which stated: &quot;Electronic body music composed and produced on eight tracks by Front 242.&quot; The band followed the release with a European tour.

It was around this time that Front 242 had some collaborations with Luc van Acker, who was a familiar presence at Hill&#x27;s Music. On one occasion, Luc brought his guitar and gear to the band&#x27;s studio where samples of the session were used in composing the track &quot;No Shuffle.&quot; Luc was also known to take the stage with the band at times.

Front 242 signed with the American label Wax Trax! in 1984. At the behest of Alain Jourgensen who was working with Wax Trax at the time, Front 242 was invited to be the support band for Ministry during their upcoming tour in the United States. This tour led to the creation of Revolting Cocks by Richard 23, Luc van Acker, and Alain Jourgensen.

In 1985 the band played the Seaside Festival and the first ever Pukkelpop Festival in Belgium. An incident between the band and security at Pukkelpop resulted in more poor reflections and accusations in the press. That year they also released the &quot;Politics of Pressure&quot; EP and a 12&quot; for &quot;No Shuffle.&quot;

In 1986, Front 242 turned down a contract with ZTT Records and instead signed with the Red Rhino (RRE) label in Europe - a sub-label of Play It Again Sam - who released &quot;Backcatalogue&quot; and &quot;Official Version&quot; in 1987. Trouser Press credited &quot;Official Version&quot; with helping Front 242 &quot;emerge from relative obscurity to become a significant cult force, selling records all over the world.&quot; In the fall of 1987, Front 242 supported Depeche Mode on the first European leg of their &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; tour.

In 1988, &quot;Front by Front&quot; was released, and in December of that same year, &quot;Headhunter&quot; (with a video by Anton Corbijn), became the band&#x27;s first club hit, reaching number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play Songs chart.

===1990s===
&quot;Tyranny (For You)&quot;, released in 1991, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album, reaching #95 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Tyranny (For You)&quot; was the first album they released under contract with a major corporate label, Sony/Epic, after the widespread popularity of &quot;Front by Front&quot;. Two further releases were extracted from &quot;Tyranny&quot; — &quot;Mixed by Fear&quot;, which contained remixes of the track &quot;Gripped by Fear&quot;, and the single &quot;Rhythm of Time&quot;, which included a remix by The Orb.

Sony/Epic also acquired the rights to the band&#x27;s back catalog from Wax Trax! and issued re-released versions of the albums with new cover art and bonus tracks taken from singles and EPs.

In 1992, Bressanutti returned to combining graphic arts with music, taking his lithographs on tour to three U.S. galleries. Bressanutti also composed a solo half-hour atmospheric recording called &quot;Art and Strategy&quot; (or The Art Corporation) to play during viewings of the lithographs, and released it in a limited edition of 1,000 CDs.

Front 242&#x27;s style shifted abruptly with each of their next two albums, released in rapid succession in 1993 on Epic&#x27;s sub-label RRE (originally planned as a double-CD): &quot;06:21:03:11 UP EVIL&quot; and &quot;05:22:09:12 OFF&quot; (the numbers correspond to letters, spelling &quot;FUCK UP EVIL&quot; and &quot;EVIL OFF&quot;). The band describes the two albums as &quot;based on the duality of good and evil.&quot; However, strains were emerging, with the band members apparently having different artistic views. Despite these tensions, they performed on the main stage of the 1993 Lollapalooza tour.

Neither of these albums had significant input from Richard 23, and &quot;05:22:09:12 OFF&quot; only included their lead vocalist, Jean-Luc De Meyer, on a remixed track originally from &quot;Up Evil&quot;. On the other hand, a variety of new contributors were listed as members of Front 242 on these albums: Jean-Marc Pauly and Pierre Pauly (of the Belgian electronic group Parade Ground) on &quot;Up Evil&quot;, and 99 Kowalski, John Dubs and Eran Westwood on &quot;Off&quot;.

99 Kowalski is the stage name of Kristin Kowalski, making a tradition out of Richard 23&#x27;s idea of number-as-name. Kowalski, Dubs and Westwood were originally members of a New York City band called Spill who Bressanutti and Codenys had brought to Belgium to produce their debut album. After the recording sessions fell apart, they contributed to Front 242 on the &quot;Off&quot; release.

After the release of &quot;06:21:03:11 Up Evil&quot; and &quot;05:22:09:12 Off&quot;, there was no new material from Front 242 under any lineup. Instead, the band released a stream of live recordings and remixes. However, this period also saw a proliferation of side projects, an inordinate number of which involved De Meyer.

Earlier, Richard 23 played in the Revolting Cocks, and De Meyer had a side project doing vocals for Bigod 20 for their single, &quot;The Bog&quot; in 1990. In 1995, De Meyer met Marc Heal of Cubanate at a Front Line Assembly concert, and the two of them collaborated along with Ged Denton and Jonathan Sharp, to record as Cyber-Tec Project for the new (and short-lived) Cyber-Tec record label.

After the departure of Sharp and the demise of the Cyber-Tec label, the remaining group continued working under the name C-Tec. De Meyer also took over as vocalist for Birmingham 6 for their 1996 album &quot;Error of Judgment&quot;. 1996 also saw the debut album &quot;Elemental&quot; from Cobalt 60, which De Meyer formed with Dominique Lallement and Frederic Sebastien of Reims, France, members of Kriegbereit. This was the start of a number of releases from Cobalt 60, which also did the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Wing Commander V&quot;. Meanwhile, Richard 23 recorded with the groups Holy Gang, and later, LaTchak.

The four core members of Front 242 regrouped in 1998 to compose radically reworked versions of many of their songs, which they then performed on their first tour in five years, appropriately called the Re:Boot tour. They acknowledged the influence of The Prodigy and their &quot;Fat of the Land&quot; album in crafting the new, more techno style of Re:Boot.

The new tour material was the subject of Front 242&#x27;s new recording contract in the U.S. with Metropolis Records. Front 242 also indicated at this time that they were recording new material. However, they had little activity after 1998, making occasional appearances in Europe and Mexico, while Codenys recorded under the name Gaiden with Steve Stoll in 2001.

===2000s===
2002 saw the beginning of a wave of new material from Bresanutti and Codenys, and then from Front 242. In August 2002 a DVD/CD two-disc set called &quot;Speed Tribe&quot; was released by Dance.com. The DVD was a collaboration with experimental documentary filmmakers Rod Chong and Sharon Matarazzo, who filmed the 2001 24 Hour Le Mans. In the video, the racecars, clouds, rain and spectators form an impressionistic visual backdrop for the music.

Several months later, the first release from Male or Female, also known as Morf, a new project for Bresanutti and Codenys along with vocalist Elko Blijweert. In 2002 and 2003, Morf released an album, an E.P., a double album, and a DVD/CD two-disc combo, on the Belgian record label Alfa Matrix, and went on tour through the U.S.

Then, 2002 and 2003 also saw the release of the new material from Front 242 in a decade: the EP &quot;Still &amp; Raw&quot; and the album &quot;Pulse&quot;, released on XIIIBis Records in Europe and Metropolis in the U.S. These represented another iteration of Front 242&#x27;s explicitly stated goal of reinventing itself. The style of the two new releases is more mellow than some of their past work, using more &quot;glitchy&quot; and &quot;bleepy&quot; sounds. As well, it uses the manipulated voice as a musical instrument. The new releases have a much more emotional style from De Meyer, which was presaged in his later recordings with C-Tec and particularly Cobalt 60 on its album &quot;Twelve&quot;.

Front 242 promised a new U.S. tour to perform new material from these releases. They have made occasional appearances in Latin America and Europe, even being rejoined by Dirk Bergen for a reunion concert in Aarschot (De Klinker club) in 2004 under the original lineup of Bresanutti, Bergen, Codenys and De Meyer. This performance was kept secret until two days before the show but when the scene magazine Side-Line and the band&#x27;s label Alfa Matrix launched the news, tickets were quickly sold out.

The band has now also set itself to re-release its entire back catalogue both as a normal CD and as a limited edition consisting of a 2-CD set holding previously unreleased material. For this the band is working together with the Belgian label Alfa Matrix that already took care of releasing the albums of the Front 242 side-project Male Or Female. The first re-release is their debut album &quot;Geography&quot;, this time newly remastered personally by Bresanutti to surprisingly powerful effect and including 3 extra tracks (two hidden ones) on the normal CD format.

Meanwhile, their enthusiasm for side projects has continued, as Patrick Codenys started appearing with a new group called Red Sniper, Bresanutti started recording with a new group called Troissoeur, and Codenys and Richard 23 formed a quasi-DJ project called Coder23 which toured in late 2004 and early 2005 as the opening act for VNV Nation. De Meyer contributed vocals on two studio tracks for the Glis album &quot;Nemesis&quot; in 2005. The lyrical content of the two songs (&quot;The Irreparable&quot; and &quot;La Béatrice&quot;) were based on the poems of Charles Baudelaire.

Front 242 toured through twenty venues in North America in November 2005, their first tour as a full band since 2000. The band performed at the Roskilde Festival in 2006. The band&#x27;s sold out two-day performance at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels has been recorded for a future release via Alfa Matrix.

In December 2006, Front 242 announced from their MySpace page that they were writing music for a video game called &quot;Cipher Complex&quot; and provided a link to a teaser trailer with a short sample of one of their scores.

In 2007, De Meyer announced a new project: 32CRASH via the Alfa Matrix label. The band is preparing for an album release in October 2007 after the release of the EP &quot;Humanity&quot;.

In August 2008, Front 242 played live at the Infest Festival in Bradford, England.

In October 2008, Front 242 performed for the first time in Finland, at the Alternative Party 2008 media arts festival.

===2008–present===
In 2008, the band added two new members: Tim Kroker on percussion and Sylvain Guigon on live video projection and effects.

On 1 June 2008, the Alfa Matrix label announced that Front 242 would make an ultimate statement towards abusive audio compression by releasing the free two-track download, &quot;First Moment&quot;. By 15 June the same year, the tracks were made available for free on Alfa Matrix&#x27;s site in medium and high bit-rate MP3s, WAV, FLAC, and M4A formats. Contrary to what fans and some media speculated, the two-track download was not new studio material. Instead, &quot;First Moments&quot; consisted of two previously unreleased live tracks, &quot;U-Men&quot; and &quot;Im Rhythmus Bleiben&quot;, in rather stunning sound quality. It is rumored that over 20,000 people downloaded the tracks within hours of being made available. The label later confirmed that over 25,000 people downloaded the free tracks.

On 4 June 2008, Alfa Matrix announced the release of &quot;Moments...&quot; The album was a live recording encompassing the best of Front 242&#x27;s compositions. The album was shipped in several formats including limited CD box sets, vinyl in different colors including 300-copy limited editions, and as a one-disc CD release.

On 15 April 2016, Alfa Matrix released the remastered edition of P.U.L.S.E. The re-release featured the companion Still+Raw EP, in multicolored two-disc CD formats with the special collector box set limited to 1242 copies; this box set included the album in vinyl and CD formats, as well as a 1989 live recording, a laminated live pass, posters, and the Alfa Matrix Sounds from the Matrix 017 compilation.

In February 2020, Front 242 announced the &quot;Black To Square One&quot; US Tour with a planned 13 dates across the country which were to be preceded by a string of concerts in the EU. The US tour was rescheduled for 2021 and many of the European dates were postponed or cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled 16 date US tour was announced in May 2021 with the first show planned for 15 September 2021, in New York City.

While Front 242 have not released new music since &quot;Pulse&quot; in 2003, on the &quot;Black To Square One&quot; US Tour they played three &#x27;new&#x27; songs: &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Fix It&quot;, and &quot;Deeply Asleep.&quot; There is no information on whether these songs or a new studio album will see a release.

In March 2024 Front 242 announced the &quot;Black Out&quot; tour, stated to be their last, after which they will retire from live performance. The band performed their final three shows at Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, Brussels Capital, Belgium on January 23, 24 &amp; 25, 2025, which were streamed and is available on YouTube.

==Influences and style==
Bressanutti cites Musique Concrète, Avant Garde, and the experimental music of Karlheinz Stockhausen as early influences. De Meyer cited Joy Division as an early influence for their &quot;dramatic content.&quot; The electro-pop style of Fad Gadget also provided early inspiration for the band. While they were aware of, enjoyed, and learned from musical progenitors such as Klaus Schulze, Kraftwerk, and fellow countrymen Telex, the band did not see their styles as particularly influential. When asked in a 1989 interview about Front 242&#x27;s being grouped with other industrial bands, Codenys replied that they &quot;were somewhere in between Throbbing Gristle, Kraftwerk, and bands like that, but... wanted to be exclusive, and to have nothing to do with any fashion.&quot;

Despite the stated intention of remaining genre-neutral, Front 242 did latch onto a phrase to describe their style: &quot;electronic body music&quot; or EBM; a phrase that would expand into a genre in itself. The band was not the first to use &quot;electronic body music&quot; as a music descriptor. Kraftwerk used the phrase to describe their 1978 album &quot;Die Mensch Maschine&quot; (translated: The Man-Machine) and the German group Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (DAF) used a similar term - &quot;körpermusik&quot; - to describe their music at the beginning of the 1980s. Despite not having coined the term originally, Front 242 was the first to explicitly claim EBM as a descriptor on the liner notes of their 1984 album &quot;No Comment&quot; and cemented their claim to the genre when given the lead track on the seminal Play It Again Sam compilation &quot;This Is Electronic Body Music&quot; in 1988.

==Legacy and cultural influence==

In the 1980s, Front 242 strived to project a visual mystery and anonymity to accompany their aggressive physical stage performances. The band&#x27;s ethic is largely responsible for defining the rivethead style of industrial and EBM culture which included the wearing of military gear, such as flak jackets, camouflage, and combat boots, as well as hairstyles, sunglasses, accessories, tattoos, and piercings.

During the 1991 Gulf War, US Navy ships continuously played a list of songs by Front 242 and other bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, and Ministry as a means of boosting morale and aggression during combat operations. The band were informed of this by military personnel who attended their 1993 tour.

A broader public was exposed to Front 242&#x27;s music in 1992 in the film &quot;Single White Female&quot;, starring Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In the film, obsessed roommate Leigh ties Fonda to a chair but leaves her with the television remote control. In order to attract attention, Fonda tunes in to a music video channel and turns up the volume. The video playing at the time is Front 242&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Of Time&quot;, from the album &quot;Tyranny (For You)&quot;. Also in 1992, the television commercials for the film &quot;K2&quot; were set to the Front 242 song &quot;Moldavia&quot;, from the same album.

In 1997, Billboard Encyclopedia featured Front 242 in their &quot;Top 500 Best Producers in Rock History.&quot;
