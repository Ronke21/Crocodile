<text>Sakhalin () is an island in Northeast Asia. Its north coast lies off the southeastern coast of Khabarovsk Krai in Russia, while its southern tip lies north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido. An island of the West Pacific, Sakhalin divides the Sea of Okhotsk to its east from the Sea of Japan to its southwest. It is administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast and is the largest island of Russia, with an area of . The island has a population of roughly 500,000, the majority of whom are Russians. The indigenous peoples of the island are the Ainu, Oroks, and Nivkhs, who are now present in very small numbers.

The island&#x27;s name is derived from the Manchu word &quot;Sahaliyan&quot; (). The Ainu people of Sakhalin paid tribute to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and accepted official appointments from them. Sometimes the relationship was forced but control from dynasties in China was loose for the most part. 

The ownership of the island has been contested during the past millienium, with China, Russia, and Japan all making claims on the territory at different times. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries it was Russia and Japan, and the disputes sometimes involved military conflicts and divisions of the island between the two powers. In 1875, Japan ceded its claims to Russia in exchange for the northern Kuril Islands. In 1897 more than half of the population were Russians and other European and Asian minorities. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, the island was divided, with Southern Sakhalin going to Japan. After the Siberian intervention, Japan invaded the northern parts of Sakhalin, and ruled the entire island from 1918 to 1925. Russia has held all of the island since seizing the Japanese portion in the final days of World War II in 1945, as well as all of the Kurils. Japan no longer claims any of Sakhalin, although it does still claim the southern Kuril Islands. Most Ainu on Sakhalin moved to Hokkaido, to the south across the La Pérouse Strait, when Japanese civilians were displaced from the island in 1949.

==Etymology==

Sakhalin has several names including (), (), (), (), (Nivkh: ).

The Manchus called it . , the word that has been borrowed in the form of &quot;Sakhalin&quot;, means &quot;black&quot; in Manchu, means &quot;river&quot; and is the proper Manchu name of the Amur River.

The island was also called &quot;Kuye Fiyaka&quot;. The word &quot;Kuye&quot; used by the Qing is &quot;most probably related to &quot;kuyi&quot;, the name given to the Sakhalin Ainu by their Nivkh and Nanai neighbors.&quot; When the Ainu migrated onto the mainland, the Chinese described a &quot;strong Kui (or Kuwei, Kuwu, Kuye, Kugi, &quot;i.e.&quot; Ainu) presence in the area otherwise dominated by the Gilemi or Jilimi (Nivkh and other Amur peoples).&quot; Related names were in widespread use in the region, for example the Kuril Ainu called themselves .

The origins of the traditional Japanese name, (), are unclear and multiple competing explanations have been proposed. These include:

* A borrowing of Mongolian &quot;karahoton&quot;, meaning &quot;distant fortress&quot;.
* A modification of &quot;Karahito&quot;, meaning &quot;Chinese person&quot;, from the presence of Chinese traders on the island.
* A derivation from dialect words meaning &quot;prawns&quot; or &quot;many herring&quot;.
* An aphetic form of (&quot;kamuy kar put ya mosir&quot;) &quot;The island created by God at the estuary&quot;.

The Japanese form 樺太 equates to &quot;Hwangt&#x27;ae&quot;, an earlier name for the island now superseded by the transcription 사할린 &quot;Sahallin&quot;.

The island was also historically referred to as &quot;Tschoka&quot; by European travelers in the late 18th century, such as Lapérouse and Langsdorff. This name is believed to derive from an obsolete endonym used by Sakhalin Ainu, possibly based on the word &quot;&quot; (, &quot;we&quot;) in Sakhalin Ainu language.

==History==
===Early history===
Humans lived on Sakhalin in the Neolithic Stone Age. Flint implements such as those found in Siberia have been found at Dui and Kusunai in great numbers, as well as polished stone hatchets similar to European examples, primitive pottery with decorations like those of the Olonets, and stone weights used with fishing nets. A later population familiar with bronze left traces in earthen walls and kitchen-middens on Aniva Bay.
Indigenous people of Sakhalin include the Ainu in the southern half, the Oroks in the central region, and the Nivkhs in the north.

====Yuan and Ming tributaries====

After the Mongols conquered the Jin dynasty (1234), they suffered raids by the Nivkh and Udege peoples. In response, the Mongols established an administration post at Nurgan (present-day Tyr, Russia) at the junction of the Amur and Amgun rivers in 1263, and forced the submission of the two peoples.

From the Nivkh perspective, their surrender to the Mongols essentially established a military alliance against the Ainu who had invaded their lands. According to the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;, a group of people known as the &quot;Guwei&quot; (, the Nivkh name for Ainu) from Sakhalin invaded and fought with the Jilimi (Nivkh people) every year. On 30 November 1264, the Mongols attacked the Ainu. The Ainu resisted the Mongol invasions but by 1308 had been subdued. They paid tribute to the Mongol Yuan dynasty at posts in Wuliehe, Nanghar, and Boluohe.

The Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644) placed Sakhalin under its &quot;system for subjugated peoples&quot; (&quot;ximin tizhi&quot;). From 1409 to 1411 the Ming established an outpost called the Nurgan Regional Military Commission near the ruins of Tyr on the Siberian mainland, which continued operating until the mid-1430s. There is some evidence that the Ming eunuch Admiral Yishiha reached Sakhalin in 1413 during one of his expeditions to the lower Amur, and granted Ming titles to a local chieftain.

The Ming recruited headmen from Sakhalin for administrative posts such as commander (), assistant commander (), and &quot;official charged with subjugation&quot; (). In 1431, one such assistant commander, Alige, brought marten pelts as tribute to the Wuliehe post. In 1437, four other assistant commanders (Zhaluha, Sanchiha, Tuolingha, and Alingge) also presented tribute. According to the &quot;Ming Veritable Records&quot;, these posts, like the position of headman, were hereditary and passed down the patrilineal line. During these tributary missions, the headmen would bring their sons, who later inherited their titles. In return for tribute, the Ming awarded them with silk uniforms.

Nivkh women in Sakhalin married Han Chinese Ming officials when the Ming took tribute from Sakhalin and the Amur river region.

==== Qing tributary ====
The Manchu Qing dynasty, which came to power in China in 1644, called Sakhalin &quot;Kuyedao&quot; () or &quot;Kuye Fiyaka&quot; (). The Manchus called it &quot;Sagaliyan ula angga hada&quot; (Island at the Mouth of the Black River). The Qing first asserted influence over Sakhalin after the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, which defined the Stanovoy Mountains as the border between the Qing and the Russian Empires. In the following year the Qing sent forces to the Amur estuary and demanded that the residents, including the Sakhalin Ainu, pay tribute. This was followed by several further visits to the island as part of the Qing effort to map the area. To enforce its influence, the Qing sent soldiers and mandarins across Sakhalin, reaching most parts of the island except the southern tip. The Qing imposed a fur-tribute system on the region&#x27;s inhabitants.

The Qing dynasty established an office in Ningguta, situated midway along the Mudan River, to handle fur from the lower Amur and Sakhalin. Tribute was supposed to be brought to regional offices, but the lower Amur and Sakhalin were considered too remote, so the Qing sent officials directly to these regions every year to collect tribute and to present awards. By the 1730s, the Qing had appointed senior figures among the indigenous communities as &quot;clan chief&quot; (&quot;hala-i-da&quot;) or &quot;village chief&quot; (&quot;gasan-da&quot; or &quot;mokun-da&quot;). In 1732, 6 &quot;hala&quot;, 18 &quot;gasban&quot;, and 148 households were registered as tribute bearers in Sakhalin. Manchu officials gave tribute missions rice, salt, other necessities, and gifts during the duration of their mission. Tribute missions occurred during the summer months. During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–95), a trade post existed at Delen, upstream of Kiji (Kizi) Lake, according to Rinzo Mamiya. There were 500–600 people at the market during Mamiya&#x27;s stay there.

Local native Sakhalin chiefs had their daughters taken as wives by Manchu officials as sanctioned by the Qing dynasty when the Qing exercised jurisdiction in Sakhalin and took tribute from them.

==== Japanese exploration and colonization ====
In 1635, Matsumae Kinhiro, the second daimyō of Matsumae Domain in Hokkaidō, sent Satō Kamoemon and Kakizaki Kuroudo on an expedition to Sakhalin. One of the Matsumae explorers, Kodō Shōzaemon, stayed on the island in the winter of 1636 and sailed along the east coast to Taraika (now Poronaysk) in the spring of 1637.

In an early colonization attempt, a Japanese settlement was established at Ōtomari on Sakhalin&#x27;s southern end in 1679. Cartographers of the Matsumae clan drew a map of the island and called it &quot;Kita-Ezo&quot; (Northern Ezo, Ezo being the old Japanese name for the islands north of Honshu).

In the 1780s, the influence of the Japanese Tokugawa Shogunate on the Ainu of southern Sakhalin increased significantly. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Japanese economic zone extended midway up the east coast, to Taraika. With the exception of the Nayoro Ainu located on the west coast in close proximity to China, most Ainu stopped paying tribute to the Qing dynasty. The Matsumae clan was nominally in charge of Sakhalin, but they neither protected nor governed the Ainu there. Instead they extorted the Ainu for Chinese silk, which they sold in Honshu as Matsumae&#x27;s special product. To obtain Chinese silk, the Ainu fell into debt, owing much fur to the Santan (Ulch people), who lived near the Qing office. The Ainu also sold the silk uniforms (&quot;mangpao&quot;, &quot;bufu&quot;, and &quot;chaofu&quot;) given to them by the Qing, which made up the majority of what the Japanese knew as &quot;nishiki&quot; and &quot;jittoku&quot;. As dynastic uniforms, the silk was of considerably higher quality than that traded at Nagasaki, and enhanced Matsumae prestige as exotic items. Eventually the Tokugawa government, realizing that they could not depend on the Matsumae, took control of Sakhalin in 1807.

Japan proclaimed sovereignty over Sakhalin in 1807; in 1809, Mamiya Rinzō claimed that it was an island.

==== European exploration ====
The first European known to visit Sakhalin was Martin Gerritz de Vries, who mapped Cape Patience and Cape Aniva on the island&#x27;s east coast in 1643. The Dutch captain, however, was unaware that it was an island, and 17th-century maps usually showed these points (and often Hokkaido as well) as part of the mainland. As part of a nationwide Sino-French cartographic program, Jesuits Jean-Baptiste Régis, Pierre Jartoux, and Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli joined a Chinese team visiting the lower Amur (known to them under its Manchu name, Sahaliyan Ula, &quot;the Black River&quot;), in 1709, and learned of the existence of the nearby offshore island from the Nanai natives of the lower Amur.

The Jesuits did not have a chance to visit the island, and the geographical information provided by the Nanai people and Manchus who had been to the island was insufficient to allow them to identify it as the land visited by de Vries in 1643. As a result, many 17th-century maps showed a rather strangely shaped Sakhalin, which included only the northern half of the island (with Cape Patience), while Cape Aniva, discovered by de Vries, and the &quot;Black Cape&quot; (Cape Crillon) were thought to form part of the mainland.

Only with the 1787 expedition of Jean-François de La Pérouse did the island began to resemble something of its true shape on European maps. Though unable to pass through its northern &quot;bottleneck&quot; due to contrary winds, La Perouse charted most of the Strait of Tartary, and islanders he encountered near today&#x27;s Nevelskoy Strait told him that the island was called &quot;Tchoka&quot; (or at least that is how he recorded the name in French), and &quot;Tchoka&quot; appears on some maps thereafter.

=== 19th century ===
==== Russo-Japanese rivalry ====

On the basis of its belief that it was an extension of Hokkaido, both geographically and culturally, Japan again proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island (as well as the Kuril Islands chain) in 1845, in the face of competing claims from Russia. In 1849, however, the Russian navigator Gennady Nevelskoy recorded the existence and navigability of the strait later given his name, and Russian settlers began establishing coal mines, administration facilities, schools, and churches on the island. In 1853–54, Nikolay Rudanovsky surveyed and mapped the island.

In 1855, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimoda, which declared that nationals of both countries could inhabit the island: Russians in the north, and Japanese in the south, without a clearly defined boundary between. Russia also agreed to dismantle its military base at Ootomari. Following the Second Opium War, Russia forced China to sign the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860), under which China lost to Russia all claims to territories north of Heilongjiang (Amur) and east of Ussuri.

In 1857, the Russians established a penal colony, or &quot;katorga&quot;, on Sakhalin. The island remained under shared sovereignty until the signing of the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, in which Japan surrendered its claims in Sakhalin to Russia. In 1890, the author Anton Chekhov visited the penal colony on Sakhalin. He spent three months there interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census and published his memoir &quot;Sakhalin Island&quot; () of his journey.

==== Division along 50th parallel ====
Japanese forces invaded and occupied Sakhalin in the closing stages of the Russo-Japanese War. In accordance with the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, the southern part of the island below the 50th parallel north reverted to Japan, while Russia retained the northern three-fifths.

South Sakhalin was administered by Japan as Karafuto Prefecture (), with the capital at Toyohara (today&#x27;s Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk). A large number of migrants were brought in from Korea.

The northern, Russian, half of the island formed Sakhalin Oblast, with the capital at Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky. In response to the United States opening of Japan by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and, later, the subsequent signing of the Convention of Kanagawa on March 31, 1854, Tsar Nicholas I, who was personally involved in the &quot;Sakhalin issue&quot;, in April 1853 ordered the Russian-American Company (RAC) to immediately occupy the Sakhalin Island and begin colonization by constructing two redoubts armed with cannons on the western and southern coasts of the island. On September 20, 1853, the RAC ship &quot;Emperor Nikolai I&quot; () under the command of skipper Martin Fyodorovich Klinkowström () and under the general guidance of Captain Nevelskoy arrived at Tomari-Aniva on Aniva Bay, not far from the main Japanese settlement on the island, and put ashore men and materials to form a military outpost.

At the oldest stettlement on Sakhlin Island, Sakhalin Oblast had a Czarist era penal colony named Due () on Cape Douai which had the 1853 established Makaryevka () coal mine, which was supported by both the Muravyovsky post (), now known as Korsakov (), at Aniva Bay (), which was named after Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky who had sponsored the the expedition commanded by Gennady Nevelskoy that explored the coast of Sakhalin Island from 1849 to 1853, and the Russian-American Company, and hosted its first prisoner beginning in 1876. On April 18, 1869, Tsar Alexander II approved the &quot;Regulations of the Committee on the Arrangement of Hard Labor&quot; () which formed the legal basis for Sakhalin Island to be a penal colony.

In 1920, during the Siberian Intervention, Japan again occupied the northern part of the island, returning it to the Soviet Union in 1925 after the Treaty of Beijing was signed on January 20, 1925. However, Japan formed the state owned firm North Sakhalin Oil () which extracted oil from the OKHA Oil Field () near Okha on North Sakhalin from 1926 to 1944.

==== Whaling ====
Between 1848 and 1902, American whaleships hunted whales off Sakhalin. They cruised for bowhead and gray whales to the north and right whales to the east and south.

On June 7, 1855, the ship &quot;Jefferson&quot; (396 tons), of New London, was wrecked on Cape Levenshtern, on the northeastern side of the island, during a fog. All hands were saved as well as 300 barrels of whale oil.

=== Second World War ===
In August 1945, after repudiating the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviet Union invaded southern Sakhalin, an action planned secretly at the Yalta Conference. The Soviet attack started on August 11, 1945, a few days before the surrender of Japan. The Soviet 56th Rifle Corps, part of the 16th Army, consisting of the 79th Rifle Division, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 214 Armored Brigade, attacked the Japanese 88th Infantry Division. Although the Soviet Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by three to one, they advanced only slowly due to strong Japanese resistance. It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovetskaya Gavan landed on Tōro, a seashore village of western Karafuto, on August 16 that the Soviets broke the Japanese defense line. Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing. Actual fighting continued until August 21. From August 22 to August 23, most remaining Japanese units agreed to a ceasefire. The Soviets completed the conquest of Karafuto on August 25, 1945, by occupying the capital of Toyohara.

Of the approximately 400,000 people – mostly Japanese and Korean – who lived on South Sakhalin in 1944, about 100,000 were evacuated to Japan during the last days of the war. The remaining 300,000 stayed behind, some for several more years.

While the vast majority of Sakhalin Japanese and Koreans were gradually repatriated between 1946 and 1950, tens of thousands of Sakhalin Koreans (and a number of their Japanese spouses) remained in the Soviet Union.

No final peace treaty has been signed and the status of four neighboring islands remains disputed. Japan renounced its claims of sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the Treaty of San Francisco (1951), but maintains that the four offshore islands of Hokkaido currently administered by Russia were not subject to this renunciation. Japan granted mutual exchange visas for Japanese and Ainu families divided by the change in status. Recently, economic and political cooperation has gradually improved between the two nations despite disagreements.

===Recent history===
On 1 September 1983, Korean Air Flight 007, a South Korean civilian airliner, flew over Sakhalin and was shot down by the Soviet Union, just west of Sakhalin Island, near the smaller Moneron Island. The Soviet Union claimed it was a spy plane; however, commanders on the ground realized it was a commercial aircraft. All 269 passengers and crew died, including a U.S. Congressman, Larry McDonald.

On 27 May 1995, the 7.0 Neftegorsk earthquake shook the former Russian settlement of Neftegorsk with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). Total damage was $64.1–300 million, with 1,989 deaths and 750 injured. The settlement was not rebuilt.

==Geography==
Sakhalin is separated from the mainland by the narrow and shallow Strait of Tartary, which often freezes in winter in its narrower part, and from Hokkaido, Japan, by the Soya Strait or La Pérouse Strait. Sakhalin is the largest island in Russia, being long, and wide, with an area of . It lies at similar latitudes to England, Wales and Ireland.

Its orography and geological structure are imperfectly known. One theory is that Sakhalin arose from the Sakhalin Island Arc. Nearly two-thirds of Sakhalin is mountainous. Two parallel ranges of mountains traverse it from north to south, reaching . The Western Sakhalin Mountains peak in Mount Ichara, , while the Eastern Sakhalin Mountains&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Lopatin , is also the island&#x27;s highest mountain. Tym-Poronaiskaya Valley separates the two ranges. Susuanaisky and Tonino-Anivsky ranges traverse the island in the south, while the swampy Northern-Sakhalin plain occupies most of its north.

Crystalline rocks crop out at several capes; Cretaceous limestones, containing an abundant and specific fauna of gigantic ammonites, occur at Dui on the west coast; and Tertiary conglomerates, sandstones, marls, and clays, folded by subsequent upheavals, are found in many parts of the island. The clays, which contain layers of good coal and abundant fossilized vegetation, show that during the Miocene period, Sakhalin formed part of a continent which comprised north Asia, Alaska, and Japan, and enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The Pliocene deposits contain a mollusc fauna more Arctic than that which exists at the present time, indicating that the connection between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans was probably broader than it is now.

Main rivers: The Tym, long and navigable by rafts and light boats for , flows north and northeast with numerous rapids and shallows, and enters the Sea of Okhotsk. The Poronay flows south-southeast to the Gulf of Patience or Shichiro Bay, on the southeastern coast. Three other small streams enter the wide semicircular Aniva Bay or Higashifushimi Bay at the southern extremity of the island.

The northernmost point of Sakhalin is Cape of Elisabeth on the Schmidt Peninsula, while Cape Crillon is the southernmost point of the island. &quot;See also: Cape Khalpili&quot;

Sakhalin has two smaller islands associated with it, Moneron Island and Ush Island. Moneron, the only land mass in the Tatar strait, long and wide, is about west from the nearest coast of Sakhalin and from the port city of Nevelsk. Ush Island is an island off of the northern coast of Sakhalin.

==Demographics==

According to the 1897 census, Sakhalin had a population of 28,113, of which 56.2% were Russians, 8.4% Ukrainians, 7.0% Nivkh, 5.8% Poles, 5.4% Tatars, 5.1% Ainu, 2.82% Oroks, 0.95% Germans, 0.81% Japanese, with the non-indigenous people living mainly from agriculture, or being convicts or exiles. The majority of Nivkh, Ainu and Japanese lived from fishing or hunting, whereas the Oroks lived mainly by livestock (reindeer) breeding. The Ainu, Japanese and Koreans lived almost exclusively in the southern part of the island. Since 1925, many Poles fled Soviet Russian persecution in the north to the then Japanese south.

The 400,000 Japanese inhabitants of Sakhalin (including the Japanized indigenous Ainu) who had not already been evacuated during the war were deported following the invasion of the southern portion of the island by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II.

In 2010, the island&#x27;s population was recorded at 497,973, 83% of whom were ethnic Russians, followed by about 30,000 Koreans (5.5%). Smaller minorities were the Ainu, Ukrainians, Tatars, Sakhas and Evenks. The native inhabitants currently consist of some 2,000 Nivkhs and 750 Oroks. The Nivkhs in the north support themselves by fishing and hunting. 

The administrative center of the oblast, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a city of about 175,000, has a large Korean minority, typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans, who were forcibly brought by the Japanese during World War II to work in the coal mines. Most of the population lives in the southern half of the island, centered mainly around Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and two ports, Kholmsk and Korsakov (population about 40,000 each). In 2008 there were 6,416 births and 7,572 deaths.

==Climate==
The Sea of Okhotsk ensures that Sakhalin has a cold and humid climate, ranging from humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) in the south to subarctic (&quot;Dfc&quot;) in the centre and north. The maritime influence makes summers much cooler than in similar-latitude inland cities such as Harbin or Irkutsk, but makes the winters much snowier and a few degrees warmer than in interior East Asian cities at the same latitude. Summers are foggy with little sunshine.

Precipitation is heavy, owing to the strong onshore winds in summer and the high frequency of North Pacific storms affecting the island in the autumn. It ranges from around on the northwest coast to over in southern mountainous regions. In contrast to interior east Asia with its pronounced summer maximum, onshore winds ensure Sakhalin has year-round precipitation with a peak in the autumn.

==Flora and fauna==

The whole of the island is covered with dense forests, mostly coniferous. The Yezo (or Yeddo) spruce (&quot;Picea jezoensis&quot;), the Sakhalin fir (&quot;Abies sachalinensis&quot;), the Dahurian larch (&quot;Larix gmelinii&quot;), &#x27;and &#x27;Picea glehnii&quot; are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the mountains are the Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;Pinus pumila&quot;) and the Kurile bamboo (&quot;Sasa kurilensis&quot;). Birches, both Siberian silver birch (&quot;Betula platyphylla&quot;) and Erman&#x27;s birch (&quot;B. ermanii&quot;), poplar, elm (&quot;Ulmus laciniata&quot;), bird cherry (&quot;Prunus padus&quot;), Japanese yew (&quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot;), and several willows are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the maple, rowan and oak, as also the Japanese &quot;Kalopanax septemlobus&quot;, the Amur cork tree (&quot;Phellodendron amurense&quot;), the spindle (&quot;Euonymus macropterus&quot;) and the vine (&quot;Vitis thunbergii&quot;) make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), red-berried elder (&quot;Sambucus racemosa&quot;), wild raspberry, and Spiraea.

Brown bear, Eurasian river otter, red fox, eurasian lynx, leopard cat and sable are fairly numerous (as are reindeer in the north); rarely seen, but still present, is the elusive Sakhalin musk deer, a subspecies of Siberian musk deer. Smaller mammals include hare, squirrels, and various rodents (including rats and mice) nearly everywhere. The bird population is made-up of mostly the common eastern Siberian forms, but there are some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Nordmann&#x27;s greenshank (&quot;Tringa guttifer&quot;) and the Sakhalin leaf warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus borealoides&quot;). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;). Numerous cetaceans visit the sea coast, including the endangered Western Pacific gray whale, for which the waters off of Sakhalin are their only known feeding ground, thus being a vitally important region for their population&#x27;s longevity. Other cetaceans known to occur in this area are the North Pacific right whale, the bowhead whale, and the beluga whale, the latter two generally preferring icy waters and colder conditions to the north. All are potential prey species for the highly social killer whale, or orca. The once-common Japanese sea lion and Japanese sea otter, both hunted to extinction, formerly ranged from Japan&#x27;s coastline to Sakhalin, Korea, Kamchatka, and the Yellow Sea; however, over-harvesting depleted their numbers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Today, ringed seals and the giant Steller sea lion can be spotted around Sakhalin Island.

==Transport==
===Sea===
Transport, especially by sea, is an important segment of the economy. Nearly all the cargo arriving for Sakhalin (and the Kuril Islands) is delivered by cargo boats, or by ferries, in railway wagons, through the Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry from the mainland port of Vanino to Kholmsk. The ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk are the largest and handle all kinds of goods, while coal and timber shipments often go through other ports. In 1999, a ferry service was opened between the ports of Korsakov and Wakkanai, Japan, and operated through the autumn of 2015, when service was suspended.

For the 2016 summer season, this route will be served by a highspeed catamaran ferry from Singapore named Penguin 33. The ferry is owned by Penguin International Limited and operated by Sakhalin Shipping Company.

Sakhalin&#x27;s main shipping company is Sakhalin Shipping Company, headquartered in Kholmsk on the island&#x27;s west coast.

===Rail===
About 30% of all inland transport volume is carried by the island&#x27;s railways, most of which are organized as the Sakhalin Railway (Сахалинская железная дорога), which is one of the 17 territorial divisions of the Russian Railways.

The Sakhalin Railway network extends from Nogliki in the north to Korsakov in the south. Sakhalin&#x27;s railway has a connection with the rest of Russia via a train ferry operating between Vanino and Kholmsk.

The process of converting the railways from the Japanese gauge to the Russian gauge began in 2004 and
was completed in 2019.
The original Japanese D51 steam locomotives were used by the Soviet Railways until 1979.

Besides the main network run by the Russian Railways, until December 2006 the local oil company (Sakhalinmorneftegaz) operated a corporate narrow-gauge line extending for from Nogliki further north to Okha (Узкоколейная железная дорога Оха – Ноглики). During the last years of its service, it gradually deteriorated; the service was terminated in December 2006, and the line was dismantled in 2007–2008.

===Air===
Sakhalin is connected by regular flights to Moscow, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok and other cities of Russia. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport has regularly scheduled international flights to Hakodate, Japan, and Seoul and Busan, South Korea. There are also charter flights to the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Niigata, and Sapporo and to the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Dalian and Harbin. The island was formerly served by Alaska Airlines from Anchorage, Petropavlovsk, and Magadan.

===Fixed links===
The idea of building a fixed link between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland was first put forward in the 1930s. In the 1940s, an abortive attempt was made to link the island via a undersea tunnel. The project was abandoned under Premier Nikita Khrushchev. In 2000, the Russian government revived the idea, adding a suggestion that a 40-km (25 mile) long bridge could be constructed between Sakhalin and the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, providing Japan with a direct connection to the Eurasian railway network. It was claimed that construction work could begin as early as 2001. The idea was received skeptically by the Japanese government and appears to have been shelved, probably permanently, after the cost was estimated at as much as $50 billion.

In November 2008, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev announced government support for the construction of the Sakhalin Tunnel, along with the required regauging of the island&#x27;s railways to Russian standard gauge, at an estimated cost of 300–330 billion roubles.

In July 2013, Russian Far East development minister Viktor Ishayev proposed a railway bridge to link Sakhalin with the Russian mainland. He also again suggested a bridge between Sakhalin and Hokkaidō, which could potentially create a continuous rail corridor between Europe and Japan. In 2018, president Vladimir Putin ordered a feasibility study for a mainland bridge project.

==Economy==
The economy of Sakhalin relies primarily on oil and gas exports, coal mining, forestry, and fishing. Limited quantities of rye, wheat, oats, barley and vegetables grow there, although the growing season averages less than 100 days.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent economic liberalization, Sakhalin has experienced an oil with extensive petroleum-exploration and mining by most large oil multinational corporations. The oil and natural- gas reserves contain an estimated 14 billion barrels (2.2 km3) of oil and 2,700 km3 (96 trillion cubic feet) of gas and are being developed under production-sharing agreement contracts involving international oil- companies like ExxonMobil and Shell.

In 1996, two large consortia, Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II, signed contracts to explore for oil and gas off the northeast coast of the island. The two consortia&#x27;s pre-project estimate of costs were a combined US$21 billion on the two projects; costs had almost doubled to $37 billion as of September 2006, triggering Russian governmental opposition. The cost will include an estimated US$1 billion to upgrade the island&#x27;s infrastructure: roads, bridges, waste management sites, airports, railways, communications systems, and ports. In addition, Sakhalin-III-through-VI are in various early stages of development.

The Sakhalin I project, managed by Exxon Neftegas, completed a production-sharing agreement (PSA) between the Sakhalin I consortium, the Russian Federation, and the Sakhalin government. Russia is in the process of building a pipeline across the Tatar Strait from Sakhalin Island to De-Kastri terminal on the Russian mainland. From De-Kastri, the resource will be loaded onto tankers for transport to East Asian markets, namely Japan, South Korea and China.

A second consortium, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd (Sakhalin Energy), is managing the Sakhalin II project. It has completed the first production-sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian Federation. Sakhalin Energy will build two 800-km pipelines running from the northeast of the island to Prigorodnoye (Prigorodnoe) in Aniva Bay at the southern end. The consortium will also build, at Prigorodnoye, the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant to be built in Russia. The oil and gas are also bound for East Asian markets.

Sakhalin II has come under fire from environmental groups, namely Sakhalin Environment Watch, for dumping dredging material in Aniva Bay. These groups were also worried about the offshore pipelines interfering with the migration of whales off the island. The consortium has () rerouted the pipeline to avoid the whale migration. After a doubling in the projected cost, the Russian government threatened to halt the project for environmental reasons. There have been suggestions that the Russian government is using the environmental issues as a pretext for obtaining a greater share of revenues from the project and/or forcing involvement by the state-controlled Gazprom. The cost overruns (at least partly due to Shell&#x27;s response to environmental concerns), are reducing the share of profits flowing to the Russian treasury.

In 2000, the oil-and-gas industry accounted for 57.5% of Sakhalin&#x27;s industrial output. By 2006 it is expected to account for 80% of the island&#x27;s industrial output. Sakhalin&#x27;s economy is growing rapidly thanks to its oil-and-gas industry.

, Gazprom had taken a 50% plus one share interest in Sakhalin II by purchasing 50% of Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi&#x27;s shares.

In June 2021, it was announced that Russia aims to make Sakhalin Island carbon neutral by 2025.

<text>ITV, legally known as Channel 3, is a British free-to-air public broadcast television network. It is branded as ITV1 in most of the UK except for central and northern Scotland, where it is branded as STV. It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television to provide competition, eliminating what had been the monopoly of BBC Television (established in 1936). ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK. Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, it has been legally known as Channel 3 to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time: BBC1, BBC2 and Channel 4.

ITV was, for decades, a network of separate companies that provided regional television services and also shared programmes among themselves to be shown on the entire network. Each franchise was originally owned by a different company. After several mergers, the fifteen regional franchises are now held by two companies: ITV plc, which runs the ITV1 channel, and STV Group, which runs the STV channel.

The ITV network is a separate entity from ITV plc, the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004. ITV plc holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences for every region except for central and northern Scotland, which are held by STV Group.

Today, ITV plc simply commissions the network schedule centrally; programmes are made by its own subsidiary ITV Studios and independent production companies. Regional programming remains in news and some current affairs series.

Although the ITV network&#x27;s history goes back to 1955, many regional franchisees changed over the years. Some of the most important names in the network&#x27;s past—notably Thames, ABC and ATV—have no connection with the modern network.

==History==

The origins of ITV lie in the passing of the Television Act 1954, designed to break the monopoly on television held by the BBC Television Service. The act created the Independent Television Authority (ITA, then IBA after the Sound Broadcasting Act) to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises. The first six franchises were awarded in 1954 for London, the Midlands and the North of England, with separate franchises for Weekdays and Weekends. The first ITV service to launch was London&#x27;s Associated-Rediffusion on 22 September 1955, with the Midlands and North services launching in February 1956 and May 1956 respectively. Following these launches, the ITA awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by fourteen regional stations, all launched by 1962.

The network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in 1963, 1967, 1974, 1980 and 1991, during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced. Only one service operator has ever been declared bankrupt, WWN in 1963, with all other operators leaving the network as a result of a franchise review. Separate weekend franchises were removed in 1968 (with the exception of London) and over the years more services were added; these included a national breakfast franchise from 1983 onward—operating between 6:00 am and 9:25 am—and a teletext service. The Broadcasting Act 1990 changed the nature of ITV; the then regulator the IBA was replaced with a light-touch regulator, the ITC; companies became able to purchase other ITV regional companies and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest-bidder auction, with few safeguards in place. This heavily criticised part of the review saw four operators replaced, and the operators facing different annual payments to the Treasury: Central Independent Television, for example, paid only £2,000—despite holding a lucrative and large region—because it was unopposed, while Yorkshire Television paid £37.7 million for a region of the same size and status, owing to heavy competition.

Following the 1993 changes, ITV as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies. By 2004, the ITV network was owned by five companies, of which two, Carlton and Granada had become major players by owning between them all the franchises in England, Wales, the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man. That same year, the two merged to form ITV plc with the only subsequent acquisitions being the takeover of Channel Television, the Channel Islands franchise, in 2011; and UTV, the franchise for Northern Ireland, in 2015.

==Organisation (other networks)==
The ITV network is not owned or operated by one company, but by a number of licensees, which provide regional services while also broadcasting programmes across the network. Since 2016, the fifteen licences are held by two companies, with the majority held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.

The network is regulated by the media regulator Ofcom who is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences. The last major review of the Channel 3 franchises was in 1991, with all operators&#x27; licences having been renewed between 1999 and 2002 and again from 2014 without a further contest. While this has been the longest period that the ITV network has gone without a major review of its licence holders, Ofcom announced (following consultation) that it would split the Wales and West licence from 1 January 2014, creating a national licence for Wales and joining the newly separated West region to Westcountry Television, to form a new licence for the enlarged South West of England region.

All companies holding a licence were part of the non-profit body ITV Network Limited, which commissioned and scheduled network programming, with compliance previously handled by ITV plc and Channel Television. However, due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of ITV Network Limited (and given Channel Television is now owned by ITV plc), it has been replaced by an affiliation system. Approved by Ofcom, this results in ITV plc commissioning and funding the network schedule, with STV and UTV paying a fee to broadcast it. All licensees have the right to opt out of network programming (except for the national news bulletins), but, unlike the previous system, will receive no fee refund for doing so. Therefore many do not opt out due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources. Prior to the affiliate system being introduced, STV would frequently (and sometimes controversially) opt out of several popular network programmes – such as the original run of the first series of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; – citing the need to provide more Scottish content to its viewers.

As a public service broadcaster, the ITV network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance, including news, current affairs, children&#x27;s and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events, such as the Budget. The network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles, signing and audio description. In exchange for this programming, the ITV network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the EPG of all providers.

Since the launch of the platform in 1998, all of the ITV licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform. At present, the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the ITV plc owned ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and ITVBe in their region. UTV and STV (formerly Scottish Television and Grampian Television) previously broadcast their own services – UTV2 in Northern Ireland and S2 in central and northern Scotland – until 2002, when they adopted the ITV plc channels. Despite this, STV was given a broadcasting licence for what would become the STV2 channel in 2013, however this was short-lived and the channel closed in 2018. The broadcasters all make use of the Digital 3&amp;4 multiplex, shared with Channel 4. CITV launched in March 2006 (closed September 2023). ITV Encore launched in June 2014 (closed May 2018) and ITVBe launched in October 2014. ITV Box Office launched in February 2017 (closed January 2020).

On 13 September 2022, ITV confirmed that during the day of Monday 19 September, the day of the state funeral for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, all programming schedules on ITV&#x27;s digital channels will be scrapped, with the main ITV News coverage being shown live and uninterrupted on every channel. This was the first time ITV decided to do this, with the company keeping their digital channels&#x27; schedules mostly as advertised in the run up to the funeral (with a few amendments for cancelled sporting events on ITV4) and all royal coverage being on their main channel.

===ITV plc===

ITV plc owns thirteen of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland through its subsidiary company ITV Broadcasting Limited. The company also owns the breakfast television licence, which as of January 2020, broadcasts across the network between 6:00 and 10:00am each morning using the &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (previously &quot;Daybreak&quot;) and &quot;Lorraine&quot; names. The company broadcasts a centralised service under the ITV1 brand. In Northern Ireland, ITV used the UTV brand name as the name of the channel until April 2020.

The group also owns ITV Studios, the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licences they own. The company produces a large proportion of ITV&#x27;s networked programming (around 47%, but previously as high as 66% according to some reports), with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers (under the Broadcasting Act 1990, at least 25% of ITV&#x27;s total output must be from independent companies). ITV plc hopes to increase the amount of in-house programming to as close to the 75% limit as possible.

The group cut the number of regional news programmes offered from 17 in 2007 to 9 by 2009, resulting several regions being merged to form one programme, including the Border and Tyne Tees regions, the Westcountry and West regions and the removal of sub regional programming, with some regions only represented by pre-recorded segments. Sub-regions were restored in 2013.

===STV Group===
STV Group plc owns two franchises, covering central and northern Scotland, through subsidiary companies STV Central and STV North, broadcasting a central service under the STV brand.

The company had several disputes with ITV plc in the late 2000s and early 2010s over network programming. STV aimed to broadcast more Scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key ITV plc programmes from their schedule in July 2009 including &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and &quot;Lewis&quot;. Despite STV&#x27;s explanation of expense, ITV plc were angered by the decision, as a recent schedule change had made &quot;The Bill&quot; central to their programming, and broadcast the programmes on ITV3 as well to ensure Scottish viewers could see the programmes. On 23 September ITV plc was reported to be in the process of suing STV for £20 million, as ITV felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements; STV subsequently counter-sued ITV plc for £35 million.

The dispute was ended in 2011 with STV agreeing to pay ITV plc £18 million. The signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in STV paying a flat fee for all networked programming, and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved.

==Current licensees==
There are fifteen regional licences, covering fourteen regions (there are separate weekday and weekend licences for the London region), and one national licence for the breakfast service. All licences listed here were renewed until the end of 2024. Licences in England and Wales were held by the individual regional ITV plc owned companies prior to November 2008.

The appointment to provide national news for Channel 3 is also subject to approval by Ofcom. This appointment has been held by ITN since the channel&#x27;s inception, and has also been approved through the end of 2024.


==Programming==


For over 60 years of ITV, its homegrown programmes have become among the best remembered as well as being extremely successful. Before the 1990s, nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees: the regional companies.

However, following legislation in the Broadcasting Act 1990 imposing a 25% quota for commissioning of independent productions, the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional ITV network, has increased rapidly. Notable examples include Talkback Thames (one half of which, Thames Television, was itself a former ITV franchisee), producers of &quot;The Bill&quot; and co-producers of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, and 2waytraffic, producers of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

From the late 1990s, ITV&#x27;s long-standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as &quot;World in Action&quot; (Granada Television), &quot;This Week&quot; (Rediffusion London/Thames Television), &quot;First Tuesday&quot; (Yorkshire Television), &quot;Network First&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot; (Anglia Television), and &quot;Weekend World&quot; (LWT) and their replacement with populist shows such as &quot;Tonight&quot;. &quot;News at Ten&quot; was also axed in 1999, although it was reinstated in 2001. In December 2009, the final edition of ITV&#x27;s long-running arts programme, &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; was broadcast.

ITV&#x27;s primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas, such as the flagship &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. At the start of the 21st century, ITV faced criticism for including a large amount of &quot;reality TV&quot; programmes in the schedule, such as &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot;. In its defence, ITV does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions, and it continues to schedule national news in primetime.

===Breakfast===
Breakfast Television programmes have been broadcast on ITV at breakfast since 1 February 1983. It was initially run by an independent contractor - TV-am, and later GMTV - until GMTV Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc in November 2009.

Historically, ITV aired breakfast programmes from 6am until 9.25am but ITV extended this to 10am on weekdays on 6 January 2020. and now broadcasts two breakfast programmes on weekdays - &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; and &quot;Lorraine&quot;. &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; keeps viewers up to date with all the latest news, sports, features and weather, whilst &quot;Lorraine&quot; predominantly focuses on celebrity interviews, recipes, fashion and showbiz. Until 27th August 2023, the service would show a simulcast of the CITV channel, but since that service has closed, a mix of repeated programming is shown whilst the CITV service that still exist broadcasts at breakfast time on ITV2 (which has the CITV block), ITV3, ITV4 and ITVBe from 7am show other repeats some of which provide a sign language service within the broadcast as part of its quota and licence requirements.

===Daytime programming===
ITV&#x27;s strong daytime line-up helped by programmes such as &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s Real Deal&quot; and game shows &quot;Tipping Point&quot; and &quot;The Chase&quot; are very popular, achieving the highest audience share during the daytime slot.

===Entertainment===
In recent years the network has tried to use formats that ITV Studios own outright (whether they have originated in the UK with their Lifted Entertainment company or have come from production companies they own abroad), though some popular programme formats like &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; have still been acquired from other companies abroad. Currently ITV are behind the formats for &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, &quot;The Voice UK&quot; (the format originally coming from their Dutch production company) and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, while forthcoming music game show &quot;Walk The Line&quot; has been co-developed by Simon Cowell&#x27;s Syco Entertainment and ITV.

===National and international news===

Since the network started, Independent Television News Limited (ITN) has held the contract to produce news for the ITV network, with 30-minute national news bulletins currently broadcast at 1:30 pm, and 10:00 pm, and an hour-long bulletin at 6.30pm. These bulletins were broadcast under the ITN brand from 1955 until 1999, when a new network identity reinforced the ITV brand, resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the ITV News brand.

ITN has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news, and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes, the latest being in May 2011 when &quot;News at Ten&quot; was named best news programme by the Royal Television Society and BAFTA.

====Weather====
The ITV National Weather forecast was first broadcast in 1989, using data supplied by the Met Office, and was presented by a number of weather forecasters. The forecasts are sponsored with the sponsor&#x27;s message appearing before and after the forecast. The forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins.

Prior to the creation of the national forecast, each regional company provided its own regional forecast. The regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins, and in the summer months, includes a pollen count.

===Late-night programming===
Currently only new episodes of long-form news and current affairs programmes like &quot;Exposure&quot;, &quot;Peston&quot; and &quot;On Assignment&quot; are being scheduled after &quot;News at Ten&quot;, with the latter title only appearing on a monthly basis, typically on the last Tuesday of the month. The channel broadcasts a partnership teleshopping service for a couple of hours after midnight, replacing gambling broadcasts: the time between the news and the shopping is usually kept for re-runs, with ITV repeating its primetime entertainment shows, films, or sports programming from ITV4.

ITV continues with its regular scheduled programming after the shopping service finishes at around 3am with showbiz news bulletin &quot;FYI Extra&quot; and repeats, many of which have on-screen BSL signing for the deaf community. Replacing the information-based &quot;ITV Nightscreen&quot; slot in 2021 was &quot;Unwind With ITV&quot;, programming produced in association with the Campaign Against Living Miserably. At around 4am each night this mindfulness programme shows calming shots of natural landscapes and relaxing animations for around an hour, with versions of the footage also seen on ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4. These three channels continue programming until around 02:30, sometimes using the &quot;Unwind with ITV&quot; sequences to fill small pieces of time before this. Teleshopping on ITVBe starts at 01:00 and continues until 07:00. There are some occasions when other coverage means this cycle of programmes get misplaced, for example a live event overnight, such as the Super Bowl or the Oscars, both of which ITV started airing in 2024, or, over Christmas, failing to sell Teleshopping slots, meaning more repeats, films and long &quot;Unwind&quot; sequences are used as filler instead. Overnight, STV broadcasts an overnight rolling news and information service, mixing reports from STV News and other information-based services, instead of ITV&#x27;s shopping slot and &quot;Unwind&quot;. Due to STV opt-outs, this service can start later than or earlier than ITV&#x27;s teleshopping. STV originally simulcast the &quot;Unwind&quot; slot, but this was eventually phased out and replaced with the aforementioned news and information service. This overnight programme service is very different to what used to be shown on the network in the years after 24-hour broadcasting was introduced - this included new entertainment, imports, sports and other information programmes, and, in some regions, a job finder service, however due to the small audience this was phased out and replaced by more relaxed and niche programming. Before 24-hour broadcasts, ITV&#x27;s franchises simply closed down and restarted the following morning with &quot;ITV Morning News&quot;, followed by breakfast TV.

===Regional programming===
The regional ITV companies are required to provide local news as part of their franchise agreement together with local weather forecasts, with the main local bulletin at 6pm and regional bulletins located after each national news programme. In addition to this, traditionally ITV companies would provide other regional programming based on current affairs, entertainment or drama. However, apart from a monthly political programme, most non-news regional programming in the English regions was dropped by ITV plc in 2009, although it continues in Wales and the Channel Islands, as well as on STV and UTV and ITV Border in Scotland from 2014 to cover mainly Scottish politics whilst ITV Border in England broadcast network programming . On 14 January 2013, ITV plc regional news programmes titles were discontinued in favour of more generic branding under the &quot;ITV News&quot; title with the region listed as the subheading. However some &quot;heritage&quot; brand names were retained including &quot;Calendar&quot;, &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and &quot;Lookaround&quot;. On 28 June 2014, &quot;ITV News Cymru Wales&quot; returned to its historic name of &quot;Wales at Six&quot;.

*Football
**ITV holds joint rights for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship with the BBC and has shown every World Cup live since 1966, on a shared basis with the BBC. This arrangement has been in place since the 1960s. ITV shares the rights for the FA Cup with the BBC, having previously done so from 1955 to 1988. ITV also held the live rights to the competition from 1998 to 2001 and from 2008 until 2014.

**ITV other flagship sporting coverage is as the exclusive free to air home of British Horse Racing. ITV&#x27;s deal, which began on 1 January 2017, encompasses horse racing every Saturday afternoon on ITV or ITV4.
*Boxing
**ITV Sport has broadcast many boxing matches over the years under the &quot;Big Fight Live&quot; banner and the sport was a regular fixture on ITV screens until the mid 1990s when ITV lost its two premier contracts to Sky Sports In 2005, ITV returned to the ring when it reached an agreement to broadcast the main share of Frank Warren&#x27;s Sports Network fights. This continued until 2008, and in 2010 ITV decided to stop covering the sport as ITV thought that boxing was no longer commercially viable. In the late 2010s ITV showed some boxing on a pay-per-view channel ITV Box Office. However ITV&#x27;s boxing coverage is now restricted to Premier Boxing Champions which it shows on ITV4, having closed ITV Box Office at the start of 2020.
*Cycling
**ITV has shown the Tour de France in 2002. Initially, live coverage was only broadcast at the weekend but since the 2010 Tour de France, ITV4 has broadcast daily live coverage of every stage. ITV also broadcasts the Women&#x27;s Tour and Tour of Britain live.
*Darts
**ITV4 covers six tournaments each year, including the UK Open, The Masters and the World Series of Darts. ITV had previously extensively covered the sport and did so from 1972 until it decided to drop the sport in 1988. ITV resumed coverage of darts in 2007 and since then it has gradually increased the number of events it shows.
*Motorsport
**ITV&#x27;s flagship motorsport coverage is of the British Touring Car Championship and has shown the event extensively and in full since 2002. ITV also broadcasts highlights of the World Superbike Championship and the British Superbike Championship. ITV had previously covered Formula One and did so for 12 seasons, from 1997 to 2008.
*Rugby
**ITV has broadcast every Rugby World Cup live since 1991 and will show the 2023 tournament. ITV also broadcasts the Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup for the first time and the Under 20 World Cup. Since 2016, ITV has shared coverage of the Six Nations Championship with the BBC. ITV broadcasts all England, France Ireland and Italy home matches live, while BBC shows all Scotland and Wales home matches live. ITV also shows 7 live matches from Premiership Rugby including the final and a weekly highlights show on ITV4 on Sunday evenings, repeated later on ITV1.
*Snooker
**Snooker is another sport which ITV dropped but has subsequently restarted showing. In the 1980s and early 1990s, ITV broadcast four tournaments per season. ITV dropped snooker after the 1993 British Open and the sport was mostly absent from ITV screens until the 2010s. In summer 2014 ITV and Barry Hearn announced they had signed a 5-year deal to cover 2 Snooker Tournaments per year, keeping coverage of the Champion of Champions and a new tournament called the World Grand Prix. ITV now shows four tournaments each year, including the Champion of Champions and the World Grand Prix.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
The network broadcasts children&#x27;s programming under the CITV (Children&#x27;s ITV) strand. Children&#x27;s programming was originally provided during weekday afternoons and weekend mornings, however following the launch of the CITV channel in 2006, all children&#x27;s programming, with the exception of the weekend ITV Breakfast slot, were relocated from the ITV line-up to the CITV channel in 2007, a move which was challenged by Ofcom in April 2007. In 2023, ITV announced that CITV would cease broadcasting as a linear channel, and would be replaced by ITVX Kids, a streaming media service which launched in July 2023. The CITV channel closed on 1 September 2023, with a dedicated CITV programming block now broadcasting on ITV2 every morning, from 2 September 2023.

===Schools programming===
Schools programming on the network began in 1957 in some regions and expanded as more regions began broadcasting. It was a contractual obligation for some ITV companies to broadcast schools programming, and this was initially broadcast as part of the normal scheduling. The programmes were moved into a segment for broadcast during the day in the 1960s, under the banner &quot;Independent Television for Schools and Colleges&quot; and from 1987 were broadcast on Channel 4 in the &quot;ITV Schools on Channel 4&quot; segment. In 1993, this segment became &quot;Channel 4 Schools&quot; and later in 2000 &quot;4Learning&quot;. These strands of programming consisted of schools programming from all the ITV companies or from independent sources. The schools strand itself is now defunct, with no particular branding segment used.

=== Acquired programming ===
ITV was originally very reliant on broadcasting American series, with westerns such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Rawhide&quot; in particular being considerable successes for the network during its earlier years. Action drama &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and sci-fi anthology &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; were also broadcast by various regions in the early 1960s, with &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; shown later on in the decade. Due to the varying schedules of many ITV regions, acquired content was not broadcast by some franchises.

By the 1970s, most ITV regions were airing the likes of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. 1972 also saw the beginning of ITV&#x27;s daytime programmes at lunchtime, a slot that would become associated with the many Australian soap operas that were broadcast in the newly expanded schedule, including &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. By the 1980s, more were added to the schedule, such as &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;A Country Practice&quot;.

In primetime by the 1980s, ITV was broadcasting the likes of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (which ITV began showing just one week after its debut on NBC in the United States) and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. It was also early in the decade when Australian evening soap opera &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; was bought by ITV, and was broadcast after &quot;News at Ten&quot;.

By 1982, Channel 4 had launched, and despite originally being related to ITV, it competed against its parent network to screen popular American programmes such as &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot;, although the latter did receive a single ITV broadcast as part of a night showcasing Channel 4 programmes. Both &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot; had moved from ITV to Channel 4 by the end of their runs.

A heavy emphasis on action, fantasy and science fiction series was also placed by ITV during this 1980s, with &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, and &quot;Airwolf&quot; being broadcast by the network, as well as the likes of &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;SeaQuest DSV&quot; by the 1990s. ITV also picked up a glut of older-skewing CBS dramas through that period, including &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. 

In February 1989, in tandem with the network launching its national weather forecast, and as part of a new early evening lineup which involved the shortening of Children&#x27;s ITV, Australian soap &quot;Home and Away&quot; was acquired by ITV, particularly to compete with the success of rival Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; on BBC One. ITV also broadcast &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; beginning in early 1991, in the same Saturday teatime slot that &quot;Baywatch&quot; had occupied, although some episodes were broadcast in later time slots. It moved to Sky One beginning with the third season. 

ITV reshuffled its daytime schedules in the Autumn of 1993, and just a few months prior, Central began broadcasting the New Zealand soap opera &quot;Shortland Street&quot;. The revamp saw more ITV companies pick it up, with Scottish Television the only region to reject the series outright. Central also broadcast the Australian soap opera &quot;Echo Point&quot; around the same time, although no other franchises picked it up. ITV also aired a considerable amount of syndicated unscripted US programmes in daytime during the 90s, such as &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.

By 1996, ITV had been quiet with US series in primetime, particularly as Channel 4 and Sky One increased the competition for securing the most popular US dramas and sitcoms. However, that summer, ITV debuted the primetime soap &quot;Savannah&quot;, in a 9pm Friday slot. It was a considerable success for ITV&#x27;s standards, and it became the highest rated new American series of that year. Despite this success, ITV moved the show for its second season, no longer networking the series and moving to late night slots.

ITV tried again at broadcasting an American drama series in September 1997, with the ABC legal drama &quot;The Practice&quot;, which ran in the same slot that &quot;Savannah&quot; had the year prior. It saw nowhere near the same levels of success, and was dropped by the network after just three episodes. It later resurfaced in late night before moving to BBC One in 2000.

ITV attempted launching a Monday night block for American sitcoms in the post-&quot;News at Ten&quot; slot in the autumn of 1998, with &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot; (which ITV beat Channel 4 for the rights to) followed by &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;. After this failed to catch much steam, ITV all but pulled out from showing American programmes on the main network by the end of the decade, and it would prove to be the final time ITV aired US comedy on the main network.

ITV made attempts during the mid 2000s to poach proven popular US shows such as the mystery comedy-drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and medical drama &quot;House&quot; from Channel 4 and Five, respectively, but both shows ended up remaining on their incumbent rights holders. ITV were reportedly also interested in 2004 about acquiring the &quot;Friends&quot; spin-off &quot;Joey&quot; but later denied such interest, and in 2007 were close to picking up &quot;Neighbours&quot; after the BBC declined to continue broadcasting it, although Five eventually won the rights to both programmes.

ITV returned to US programming in 2006, acquiring &quot;Six Degrees&quot;. Initially it had been planned to air in a primetime slot in 2007, but ended up being shown in late nights in 2008. This could be due to the show being cancelled after its first season by original network ABC due to low ratings, despite high expectations and its slot following top-10 hit &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. It was also around this time that &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Dexter&quot;, which ITV2 &amp; ITV4 aired respectively, were given late night repeats on ITV1.

The following year, ITV acquired another US programme, fellow ABC series &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;. It debuted in 2008 in a Saturday evening slot and initially did well garnering 5.7 million viewers, although there were fan complaints when ITV chose to skip broadcasting the second episode, blaming football coverage, eventually releasing it on their website. The last attempt so far by ITV to broadcast acquired output in primetime was the TV adaption of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; in 2017, where it remained for all three seasons.

As of 2024, most US acquired programming that ITV owns the UK rights to, such as &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and &quot;Superstore&quot; air on ITV2, as opposed to the main ITV network.

===Teletext provider===
The Public Teletext Licence allows the holder to broadcast a text-based information service around the clock on Channel 3 (as well as Channel 4 and S4C) frequencies. Teletext on ITV was provided by ORACLE from 1974 until 1993 and from 1993 to 2010 by Teletext Ltd., whose news, sport and TV listings pages rivalled the BBC&#x27;s offering, Ceefax on terrestrial and BBC Red Button on digital. Teletext Ltd. also provided digital teletext for the Channel 3 services, as well as the text output for both Channel 4 and S4C under the same licence and Channel 5. However, the licence was revoked by Ofcom on 29 January 2010 for failing to provide news and local non-news information on ITV and there is currently no teletext licence holder for ITV.

==Availability outside the UK==
ITV (as UTV) is widely available in Ireland, where it is received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales (as ITV Cymru Wales). Until 2015, it was also carried on cable, when it was replaced by UTV Ireland, which was itself replaced by be3, now Virgin Media Three. ITV programming is also available to Irish viewers on Virgin Media One (including soap operas &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;). ITV is also available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Since 27 March 2013, it has been offered by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS3 TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.

==Criticism==
Since the launch of ITV, there have been concerns from politicians and the press that ITV faced a conflict concerning programme audiences and advertisers. As advertisers are reluctant to buy advertising space around low viewing programmes, there is a pressure on ITV to broadcast more popular programmes in peak times. This became more profound in the early 21st century, following a relaxation in regulation and significantly more competition in the advertising market following the huge increase in commercial channels. In the 2000s, programmes from the reality television genre including the celebrity and talent show subgenres became a dominant presence on the channel. This led to accusations of ITV &#x27;dumbing down&#x27; their programmes and appealing to the &#x27;lowest common denominator&#x27;, accusations that are at odds with the network&#x27;s status as a public service broadcaster. ITV was/is also heavily criticized for scaling back its regional programmes, including regional news.

==Awards and nominations==
==Visual identity==

There has never been an identity for ITV as a whole that was adopted uniformly by all broadcasters within the ITV network. Before 1989, each regional company used its own name for identification and the name &quot;ITV&quot; was rarely seen on screen, except for some sub-brands such as ITV Schools or ITV Sport. In September 1989, a national ITV corporate identity was established, which saw regional brands combined with the national ITV brand, although the balance between regional and national brands varied from company to company, and some companies never used the ITV brand at all. It was not until October 2002 that national ITV-branded continuity was adopted across all the regions in England and Wales (see ITV1), although regional continuity before local programmes continued until November 2006.

<doc id="58090" wikidata="Q294478" url="?curid=58090" title="Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse">
<text>Commodore Jean François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse (23 August 1741 – ) was a French Navy officer and explorer. Having enlisted in the French navy at the age of 15, he had a successful career and in 1785 was appointed to lead a scientific expedition around the world. His ships stopped in Chile, Hawaii, Alaska, California, Macau, the Philippines, Korea, Russia, Japan, Samoa, Tonga, and Australia before wrecking on the reefs of Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands.

==Early career==
Jean-François de Galaup was born on 23 August 1741 near Albi, France. His family had been ennobled in 1558.

Lapérouse studied in a Jesuit college and joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine in Brest on 19 November 1756. In 1757 he was appointed to the French ship &quot;Célèbre&quot; and participated in a supply expedition to the fort of Louisbourg in New France. Lapérouse also took part in a second supply expedition in 1758 to Louisbourg, but as it was in the early years of the Seven Years&#x27; War the fort was under siege and the expedition was forced to make a circuitous route around Newfoundland to avoid British patrols.

In 1759 Lapérouse was wounded in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, where he was serving aboard &quot;Formidable&quot;. He was captured by the British and briefly imprisoned before being paroled back to France; he was formally exchanged in December 1760. He participated in a 1762 attempt by the French to gain control of Newfoundland, escaping with the fleet when the British arrived in force to drive them out.

At the outbreak of the Anglo-French War in 1778, Lapérouse was given command of the 32-gun frigate &quot;Amazone&quot;. On 7 October 1779, he captured the 20-gun HMS &quot;Ariel&quot;. Lapérouse was promoted to Captain on 4 April 1780, and was part of the Expédition Particulière under Admiral Ternay, departing Brest on 2 May 1780. From October to November 1780, &quot;Amazone&quot; sailed from Rhode Island to Lorient, and from there to the Caribbean. 

Lapérouse then transferred to &quot;Astrée&quot;. In the summer of 1781, he was offered command of the 50-gun &quot;Sagittaire&quot;, but as his crew was sick with scurvy, he requested permission to keep command of &quot;Astrée&quot;, and was appointed to lead a frigate division, along with &quot;Hermione&quot;, under Latouche-Tréville.

Lapérouse escorted a convoy to the West Indies in December 1781, participated in the attack on St. Kitts in February 1782 and then fought in the defeat at the Battle of the Saintes against the squadron of Admiral Rodney. In August 1782, he made his name by capturing two British trading posts (the Prince of Wales Fort and York Fort) on the coast of Hudson Bay, but allowed the survivors, including Governor Samuel Hearne of Prince of Wales Fort, to sail off to England in exchange for a promise to release French prisoners held in England. The next year, his family finally consented to his marriage to Louise-Eléonore Broudou, a young creole of modest origins whom he had met on Île de France (present-day Mauritius) eight years earlier.

==Scientific expedition around the world==

===Objectives===
Lapérouse was appointed in 1785 by Louis XVI and by the Secretary of State of the Navy, the Marquis de Castries, to lead an expedition around the world. Many countries were initiating voyages of scientific explorations at that time.

Louis XVI and his court had been stimulated by a proposal from the Dutch-born merchant adventurer William Bolts, who had earlier tried unsuccessfully to interest Louis&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (brother of Queen Marie Antoinette), in a similar voyage. The French court adopted the concept (though not its author, Bolts), leading to the dispatch of the Lapérouse expedition. Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Director of Ports and Arsenals, stated in the draft memorandum on the expedition that he submitted to the Louis XVI: &quot;the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery ... has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise&quot;. But Fleurieu explained to the King: &quot;I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts&quot;.

The expedition&#x27;s aims were to complete the Pacific discoveries of James Cook (whom Lapérouse greatly admired), correct and complete maps of the area, establish trade contacts, open new maritime routes and enrich French science and scientific collections. His ships were &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; (under Fleuriot de Langle) and &quot;La Boussole&quot;, both 500 tons. They were storeships reclassified as frigates for the occasion. Their objectives were geographic, scientific, ethnological, economic (looking for opportunities for whaling or fur trading), and political (the eventual establishment of French bases or colonial cooperation with their Spanish allies in the Philippines). They were to explore both the north and south Pacific, including the coasts of the Far East and of Australia, and send back reports through existing European outposts in the Pacific.

===Preparations===
As early as March 1785, Lapérouse proposed that Paul Mérault Monneron, who had been chosen as the expedition&#x27;s chief engineer, go to London to find out about the anti-scurvy measures recommended by Cook and the exchange items used by Cook in his dealings with native peoples, and to buy scientific instruments of English manufacture.

The best-known figure from Cook&#x27;s missions, Joseph Banks, intervened at the Royal Society to obtain for Monneron two inclining compasses that had belonged to Cook. Furnished with a list produced by Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Monneron also bought scientific instruments from some of the largest English firms, particularly Ramsden. He even surpassed Fleurieu&#x27;s directives by acquiring two sextants of a new type.

The Montgolfier brothers gave to Laperouse two prototypes of the newly invented hot air balloons to carry on board the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;. There is no evidence that they were used during the voyage.

====Crew====

Lapérouse was well liked by his men. Among his crew there were ten scientists: Joseph Lepaute Dagelet (1751–1788), an astronomer and mathematician; Robert de Lamanon, a geologist; La Martinière, a botanist; a physicist; three naturalists; and three illustrators, Gaspard Duché de Vancy and an uncle and nephew named Prévost. Another of the scientists was Jean-André Mongez. Even both chaplains were scientifically schooled.

One of the young men who applied for the voyage was a 16-year-old Corsican named Napoléon Bonaparte. Bonaparte, a second lieutenant from Paris&#x27; military academy at the time, made the preliminary list but he was ultimately not chosen for the voyage list and remained behind in France. At the time, Bonaparte was interested in serving in the navy rather than army because of his proficiency in mathematics and artillery, both valued skills on warships.

Copying the work methods of Cook&#x27;s scientists, the scientists on this voyage would base their calculations of longitude on precision chronometers and the distance between the Moon and the Sun followed by theodolite triangulations or bearings taken from the ship, the same as those taken by Cook to produce his maps of the Pacific islands. As regards geography, Lapérouse decisively showed the rigour and safety of the methods proven by Cook. From his voyage, the resolution of the problem of longitude was evident and mapping attained a scientific precision. Impeded (as Cook had been) by the continual mists enveloping the northwestern coast of America, he did not succeed any better in producing complete maps, though he managed to fill in some of the gaps.

===Chile and Hawaii===
Lapérouse and his 220 men left Brest on 1 August 1785, rounded Cape Horn, and investigated the Spanish colonial government in the Captaincy General of Chile. He arrived on 9 April 1786 at Easter Island. He then sailed to the Sandwich Islands, the present-day Hawaiian Islands, where he became the first European to set foot on the island of Maui.

===Alaska===

Lapérouse sailed on to Alaska, where he landed near Mount Saint Elias in late June 1786 and explored the environs. On 13 July 1786 a barge and two longboats, carrying 21 men, were lost in the heavy currents of the bay called &quot;Port des Français&quot; by Lapérouse, but now known as Lituya Bay. The men visited the Tlingit people. This encounter was dramatized briefly in episode 13 of Carl Sagan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Next, he headed south, exploring the northwest coast, including the outer islands of present-day British Columbia.

===California===
Lapérouse sailed between 10 and 30 August all the way south to the Spanish Las Californias Province, present-day California. He reportedly observed the only historical eruption of Mount Shasta on 7 September 1786, although this account is now discredited. He stopped at the Presidio of San Francisco long enough to create an outline map of the Bay Area, &quot;Plan du port de St. François, situé sur la côte de la Californie septentrionale&quot; (&quot;Map of the port of San Francisco, situated on the coast of Northern California&quot;), which was reproduced as Map 33 in L. Aubert&#x27;s 1797 &quot;Atlas du voyage de La Pérouse&quot;. He arrived in Monterey Bay and at the Presidio of Monterey on 14 September 1786. He examined the Spanish settlements, ranchos, and missions. He reported, &quot;The country of the Ecclemachs extends above 20 leagues to the [south-]eastward of Monterey.&quot; He made critical notes on the missionary treatment of the California indigenous peoples with the Indian Reductions at the Franciscan run missions. Lapérouse likened conditions at a mission to a slave plantation. France and Spain were on friendly terms at this time. Lapérouse was the first non-Spanish visitor to California since Drake in 1579, and the first to come to California after the founding of Spanish missions and &quot;presidios&quot; (military forts).

===East Asia===
Lapérouse again crossed the Pacific Ocean in 100 days, arriving at Macau, where he sold the furs acquired in Alaska, dividing the profits among his men. The next year, on 9 April 1787, after a visit to Manila, he set out for the northeast Asian coasts. He saw the island of Quelpart, in the Korean Peninsula (present-day Cheju in South Korea), which had been visited by Europeans only once before when a group of Dutchmen shipwrecked there in 1635. He visited the Asian mainland coasts of Korea.

===Japan and Russia===

Lapérouse then sailed northward to Northeast Asia and &quot;Oku-Yeso&quot; Island, present day Sakhalin Island, Russia. The Ainu people, &quot;Oku-Yeso&quot; Island residents, drew him a map showing: their second domain of Yezo Island, present day Hokkaidō Island, Japan; and the coasts of Tartary, Russia on mainland Asia. Lapérouse wanted to sail north through the narrow Strait of Tartary between &quot;Oku-Yeso&quot; Island and mainland Asia, but failed. Instead, he turned south, and then sailed east through La Pérouse Strait, between &quot;Oku-Yeso&quot; Island (Sakhalin) and &quot;Yezo&quot; (Hokkaidō), where he met more Ainu in their third domain of the Kuril Islands, and explored.

Lapérouse then sailed north and reached Petropavlovsk on the Russian Kamchatka peninsula on 7 September 1787. Here they rested from their trip, and enjoyed the hospitality of the Russians and Kamchatkans. In letters received from Paris, Lapérouse was ordered to investigate the settlement the British were establishing in New South Wales, Australia. Barthélemy de Lesseps, son of the French vice consul at Kronstadt, Russia, who had joined the expedition as an interpreter, disembarked in Petropavlovsk to bring the expedition&#x27;s ships&#x27; logs, charts, and letters to France, which he reached after a year-long, epic journey across Siberia and Russia.

===South Pacific===
Lapérouse next stopped in the Navigator Islands (Samoa), on 6 December 1787. Just before he left, the Samoans attacked a group of his men at Massacre Bay, killing twelve, among whom were Lamanon and de Langle, commander of &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot;. Twenty men were wounded. The expedition drifted to Tonga, for resupply and help, and later recognized the &quot;île Plistard&quot; and Norfolk Island.

===Australia===
The expedition continued to Australia, arriving off Botany Bay on 24 January 1788. There Lapérouse encountered a British convoy (known later as the &quot;First Fleet&quot;) led by Captain Arthur Phillip RN, who was to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. While it had been intended that the colony would be located at Botany Bay, Phillip had quickly decided that the site was unsuitable and the colony would instead be established at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson. High winds—which had hindered Lapérouse&#x27;s ships in entering Botany Bay—delayed the relocation until 26 January (later commemorated as Australia Day).

The French were received courteously and spent six weeks at the British colony (this would be their last recorded landfall). While Lapérouse and Phillip did not meet, French and British officers visited each other formally on at least 11 occasions, and offered each other assistance and supplies. The senior French officer to visit Sydney Cove and wait upon Governor Phillip was Robert Sutton de Clonard, Captain of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;, who took despatches to him for forwarding to the French ambassador in London by the returning &quot;Alexander&quot; transport. Clonard was an Irishman (from Wexford) in the French service, &quot;esteemed for his bravery, and beloved for his humanity&quot;. After de Langle had been killed during the expedition&#x27;s visit to Tutuila, he had succeeded him as commander of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;.

During their stay, the French established an observatory and a garden, held masses, and made geological observations. Lapérouse also took the opportunity to send journals, charts and letters back to Europe, with the British merchant ship , which had come to Sydney as part of the First Fleet. The chaplain from &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot;, Father Louis Receveur, never recovered from injuries he had sustained in a clash with indigenous people in the Samoan Islands and died at Botany Bay on 17 February; Receveur was buried on shore at Frenchman&#x27;s Cove.

On 10 March, after taking on sufficient wood and fresh water, the French expedition left New South Wales—bound for New Caledonia, Santa Cruz, the Solomons, the Louisiades, and the western and southern coasts of Australia. While Lapérouse had reported in a letter from Port Jackson that he expected to be back in France by June 1789, neither he nor any members of his expedition were seen again by Europeans. Louis XVI is recorded as having asked, on the morning of his execution in January 1793, &quot;Any news of La Pérouse?&quot;

Documents that had been relayed to France from Lapérouse&#x27;s expedition were published in Paris in 1797, under the title &quot;Voyage de La Pérouse autour du monde&quot; (&quot;The voyage of La Pérouse around the world&quot;). In 1825, another French naval officer, Captain Hyacinthe de Bougainville, founded the Lapérouse Monument at Frenchman&#x27;s Bay, near Receveur&#x27;s grave. The bay later became part of the suburb of La Perouse. The anniversary of Receveur&#x27;s death, Lapérouse Day (on varying dates in February/March) and Bastille Day (14 July) have long been marked at the monument (along with Bougainville).

==Epilogue==
===Rescue mission of d&#x27;Entrecasteaux===
On 25 September 1791, Rear Admiral Antoine Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux departed Brest in search of Lapérouse. His expedition followed Lapérouse&#x27;s proposed path through the islands northwest of Australia while at the same time making scientific and geographic discoveries. The expedition consisted of two ships, &quot;Recherche&quot; and &quot;Espérance&quot;.

In May 1793, Entrecasteaux sighted Santa Cruz, now part of the Solomon Islands, and another, uncharted, island to the southeast; this island was Vanikoro. The French did not approach Vanikoro, only recording it on their charts before sailing away to explore the Solomon Islands further. Two months later, Entrecasteaux died of scurvy. The botanist Jacques Labillardière, attached to the expedition, eventually returned to France and published his account, &quot;Relation du voyage à la recherche de La Pérouse&quot;, in 1800.

Franco-British relations deteriorated during the French Revolution, and unfounded rumours spread in France blaming the British for the tragedy which had occurred in the vicinity of the new colony. Before the mystery was solved, the French government had published the records of the voyage as far as Kamchatka: &quot;Voyage de La Pérouse autour du monde&quot;, 1–4 (Paris, 1797). These volumes are still used for cartographic and scientific information about the Pacific. Three English translations were published in 1798–99.

===Discovery of the expedition===
In 1825 Royal Navy Captain Thomas Manby brought a report, supported by presumptive evidence, that the spot where Lapérouse and his crew had perished was now ascertained. An English whaler discovered a long and low island, surrounded by innumerable breakers, situated between New Caledonia and New Guinea, at nearly an equal distance from each island. The inhabitants came on board the whaler, and one of the chiefs had a cross of St. Louis hanging as an ornament from one of his ears. Other natives had swords, on which the word &#x27;Paris&#x27; was engraved, and some were observed to have medals of Louis XVI. One of the chiefs, aged about fifty, said that when he was young, a large ship was wrecked on a coral reef during a violent gale. During his voyage, Manby had seen several medals of the same kind, which Lapérouse had distributed among the natives of California; and Lapérouse, on his departure from Botany Bay, intimated that he intended to steer from the northern part of New Holland (Australia), and explore that archipelago.

====1826 expedition====
It was not until 1826 that an Irish sea captain, Peter Dillon, found enough evidence to piece together the events of the tragedy. In Tikopia (one of the islands of Santa Cruz), he bought some swords that he had reason to believe had belonged to Lapérouse or his officers. He made enquiries and found that they came from nearby Vanikoro, where two big ships had broken up years earlier. Dillon managed to obtain a ship in Bengal and sailed for Vanikoro, where he found cannonballs, anchors and other evidence of the remains of ships in water between coral reefs. A Tikopin by the name of Pu Ratia showed Dillon and his crew the direction to sail to Vanikoro. He was on board as well with a European by the name of Bushat who lived in Tikopia before the third trip of Dillon to Tikopia.

Dillon brought several of these artifacts back to Europe, as did Dumont d&#x27;Urville in 1828. Lesseps, the only member of the original expedition still alive at the time, identified them as all belonging to &quot;Astrolabe&quot;. From the information Vanikoro inhabitants gave Dillon, a rough reconstruction could be made of the disaster that struck Lapérouse. Dillon&#x27;s reconstruction was later confirmed by the discovery and subsequent examination, in 1964, of what was believed to be the shipwreck of &quot;Boussole&quot;.

====2005 expedition====
In May 2005, the shipwreck examined in 1964 was formally identified as that of &quot;Boussole&quot;. The 2005 expedition had embarked aboard &quot;Jacques Cartier&quot;, a ship of the French Navy. The ship supported a multi-discipline scientific team assembled to investigate the &quot;Mystery of Lapérouse&quot;. The mission was named &quot;Opération VanikoroSur les traces des épaves de Lapérouse 2005&quot; (Operation VanikoroTracing the Lapérouse wrecks 2005).

====2008 expedition====
A further similar mission was mounted in 2008.

The 2008 expedition showed the commitment of France, in conjunction with the New Caledonian &quot;Association Salomon&quot;, to seek further answers about Lapérouse&#x27;s mysterious fate. It received the patronage of the President of the French Republic as well as the support and co-operation of the French Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and the Ministry of Culture and Communication.

Preparation for this, the eighth expedition sent to Vanikoro, took 24 months. It brought together more technological resources than previously and involved two ships, 52 crew members and almost 30 scientists and researchers. On 16 September 2008, two French Navy ships set out for Vanikoro from Nouméa (New Caledonia), and arrived on 15 October, thus recreating a section of the final voyage of discovery undertaken more than 200 years earlier by Lapérouse.

==Fate==
Both ships had been wrecked on Vanikoro&#x27;s reefs, &quot;Boussole&quot; first. &quot;Astrolabe&quot; was unloaded and taken apart. A group of men, probably the survivors of &quot;Boussole&quot;, were massacred by the local inhabitants. According to the islanders, some surviving sailors built a two-masted craft from the wreckage of &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and left in a westward direction about nine months later, but what happened to them is unknown. Also, two men, one a &quot;chief&quot; and the other his servant, had remained behind, but had left Vanikoro a few years before Dillon arrived.

Sven Wahlroos, in his 1989 book, &quot;Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas&quot;, suggests that there was a narrowly missed chance to rescue one or more of the survivors in 1791. In November 1790, Captain Edward Edwards—in command of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;—had sailed from England with orders to comb the Pacific for the mutineers of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;. In March of the following year, &quot;Pandora&quot; arrived at Tahiti and picked up 14 &quot;Bounty&quot; crewmen who had stayed on that island. Although some of the 14 had not joined the mutiny, all were imprisoned and shackled in a cramped &quot;cage&quot; built on the deck, which the men grimly nicknamed &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;. &quot;Pandora&quot; then left Tahiti in search of &quot;Bounty&quot; and the leader of the mutiny, Fletcher Christian.

Captain Edwards&#x27; search for the remaining mutineers ultimately proved fruitless. However, when passing Vanikoro on 13 August 1791, he observed smoke signals rising from the island. Edwards, single-minded in his search for &quot;Bounty&quot; and convinced that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, ignored the smoke signals and sailed on.

Wahlroos argues that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lapérouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time—three years after &quot;Boussole&quot; and &quot;Astrolabe&quot; had foundered. Wahlroos is &quot;virtually certain&quot; that Captain Edwards, whom he characterizes as one of England&#x27;s most &quot;ruthless&quot;, &quot;inhuman&quot;, &quot;callous&quot;, and &quot;incompetent&quot; naval captains, missed his chance to become &quot;one of the heroes of maritime history&quot; by solving the mystery of the lost Lapérouse expedition.

===Museum collections===
Objects relating to the life and voyages of Lapérouse are held at The Lapérouse Museum in Albi in southern France, and the Maritime Museum of New Caledonia. Both museums contain objects recovered from the ships &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Boussole&quot;. There is also the Lapérouse Museum in La Perouse, which records his time in Australia.

===Lapérouse in literature and film===
The fate of Lapérouse, his ships and his men are the subjects of a chapter in the 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; by Jules Verne. Lapérouse was also mentioned in episode &quot;The Quest&quot; of the series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, wherein the character Joel (Rob Morrow) finds an old chart of the French explorer that will lead to a legendary &quot;jewelled city of the North&quot; (New York City).

The novel &quot;Landfalls&quot; by Naomi J. Williams explores the Lapérouse expedition in depth.

Henry David Thoreau mentions him (as &quot;La Perouse&quot;) in his book &quot;Walden&quot;. In the first chapter, &quot;Economy&quot;, when writing about how indispensable it is to cultivate the habits of a businessman in anything one does, Thoreau describes these habits in a very long list, including

... taking advantage of the results of all exploring expeditions, using new passages and all improvements in navigation;—charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pier—there is the untold fate of La Perouse.

Jon Appleton composed a full-length opera based on the final voyage of Lapérouse, &quot;Le Dernier Voyage de Jean-Gallup de la Perouse&quot;.

===Monuments===
In 1989, the Government of Australia commissioned from artist Ante Dabro (working in Australia) a monumental bronze statue of de Galaup, for the French Bicentenary. It was installed at the Promenade d&#x27;Australie in Paris.

<text>is the second-largest island of Japan and comprises the largest and northernmost prefecture, making up its own region. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaidō from Honshu; the two islands are connected by railway via the undersea Seikan Tunnel.

The largest city on Hokkaido is its capital, Sapporo, which is also its only ordinance-designated city. Sakhalin lies about to the north of Hokkaidō, and to the east and northeast are the Kuril Islands, which are administered by Russia, though the four most southerly are claimed by Japan. The position of the island on the northern end of the archipelago results in a colder climate, with the island seeing significant snowfall each winter. Despite the harsher climate, it serves as an agricultural breadbasket for many crops.

Hokkaido was formerly known as &quot;Ezo&quot;, &quot;Yezo&quot;, &quot;Yeso&quot;, or &quot;Yesso&quot;. Although Japanese settlers ruled the southern tip of the island since the 16th century, Hokkaido was primarily inhabited by the Ainu people. In 1869, following the Meiji Restoration, the entire island was annexed, colonized and renamed Hokkaido by Japan. Japanese settlers dispossessed the Ainu of their land and forced them to assimilate. In the 21st century, the Ainu are almost totally assimilated into Japanese society; as a result, the majority of Japanese people of Ainu descent have no knowledge of their heritage and culture.

==Names==

When establishing the Development Commission, the Meiji government decided to change the name of Ezochi. Matsuura Takeshirō submitted six proposals, including names such as and , to the government. The government eventually decided to use the name Hokkaidō, but decided to write it as , as a compromise between and because of the similarity with names such as . According to Matsuura, the name was thought up because the Ainu called the region &quot;Kai&quot;. The &quot;kai&quot; element also strongly resembles the On&#x27;yomi, or Sino-Japanese, reading of the characters (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; as [, カイ], &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; as [, えみし]) which have been used for over a thousand years in China and Japan as the standard orthographic form to be used when referring to Ainu and related peoples; it is possible that Matsuura&#x27;s &quot;kai&quot; was actually an alteration, influenced by the Sino-Japanese reading of &quot;Ka-i&quot;, of the Nivkh exonym for the Ainu, namely &quot;Qoy&quot; or .

In 1947, Hokkaidō became a full-fledged prefecture. The historical suffix 道 (&quot;-dō&quot;) translates to &quot;prefecture&quot; in English, ambiguously the same as 府 (&quot;-fu&quot;) for Osaka and Kyoto, and 県 (&quot;-ken&quot;) for the rest of the &quot;prefectures&quot;. &quot;Dō&quot;, as shorthand, can be used to uniquely identify Hokkaido, for example as in 道道 (&quot;dōdō&quot;, &quot;Hokkaido road&quot;) or 道議会 (&quot;Dōgikai&quot;, &quot;Hokkaido Assembly&quot;), the same way 都 (&quot;-to&quot;) is used for Tokyo. The prefecture&#x27;s government calls itself the &quot;Hokkaidō Government&quot; rather than the &quot;Hokkaidō Prefectural Government&quot;.

With the rise of indigenous rights movements, there emerged a notion that Hokkaido should have an Ainu language name. If a decision to change the name is made, however, whichever Ainu phrase is chosen, its original referent is critically different from the large geographical entity. The phrase &#x27; () has been a preferred choice among Japanese activists. Its primary meaning is the &quot;land of humans&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;land of gods&quot; (&#x27;). When contrasted with &#x27; (the land of the neighbors, often pointing to Honshu or Japanese settlements on the southern tip of Hokkaido), it means the land of the Ainu people, which, depending on context, can refer to Hokkaido, although from a modern ethnolinguistic point of view, the Ainu people have extended their domain to a large part of Sakhalin and the entire Kuril Islands. Another phrase, &#x27; (ヤウンモシㇼ), has gained prominence. It literally means the &quot;onshore land&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;offshore land&quot; (), which, depending on context, can refer to the Kuril Islands, Honshu, or any foreign country. If the speaker is a resident of Hokkaido, &#x27; can refer to Hokkaido. Yet another phrase, &#x27; (アコㇿモシㇼ) means &quot;our (inclusive) land&quot;. When used by Hokkaido Ainus, it can refer to Hokkaido or Japan as a whole.

==History==
=== Early history ===
During the Jomon period the local culture and the associated hunter-gatherer lifestyle flourished in Hokkaidō, beginning over 15,000 years ago. In contrast to the island of Honshu, Hokkaidō saw an absence of conflict during this time period. Jomon beliefs in natural spirits are theorized to be the origins of Ainu spirituality. About 2,000 years ago, the island was colonized by Yayoi people, and much of the island&#x27;s population shifted away from hunting and gathering towards agriculture.

The , finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaidō in recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and Emishi. One of the places Hirafu went to was called , which is often believed to be present-day Hokkaidō. However, many theories exist concerning the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu people.

During the Nara and Heian periods (710–1185), people in Hokkaidō conducted trade with Dewa Province, an outpost of the Japanese central government. From the feudal period, the people in Hokkaidō began to be called Ezo. Hokkaidō subsequently became known as or . The Ezo mainly relied upon hunting and fishing and obtained rice and iron through trade with the Japanese.

=== Feudal Japan ===
During the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the Japanese established a settlement at the south of the Oshima Peninsula, with a series of fortified residences such as that of Shinoridate. As more people moved to the settlement to avoid battles, disputes arose between the Japanese and the Ainu. The disputes eventually developed into war. Takeda Nobuhiro (1431 – 1494) killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain, and defeated the opposition in 1457. Nobuhiro&#x27;s descendants became the rulers of the Matsumae-han, which was granted exclusive trading rights with the Ainu in the Azuchi-Momoyama and Edo periods (1568–1868). The Matsumae family&#x27;s economy relied upon trade with the Ainu, who had extensive trading networks.
The Matsumae held authority over the south of Ezochi until the end of the Edo period.

The Matsumae clan rule over the Ainu must be understood in the context of the expansion of the Japanese feudal state. Medieval military leaders in northern Honshu (ex. Northern Fujiwara, Akita clan) maintained only tenuous political and cultural ties to the imperial court and its proxies, the Kamakura shogunate and Ashikaga shogunate. Feudal strongmen sometimes defined their own roles within the medieval institutional order, taking shogunate titles, while in other times they assumed titles that seemed to give them a non-Japanese identity. In fact, many of the feudal strongmen were descended from Emishi military leaders who had been assimilated into Japanese society. The Matsumae clan were of Yamato descent like other ethnic Japanese people, whereas the Emishi of northern Honshu were a distinctive group related to the Ainu. The Emishi were conquered and integrated into the Japanese state dating back as far as the 8th century and as result began to lose their distinctive culture and ethnicity as they became minorities. By the time the Matsumae clan ruled over the Ainu, most of the Emishi were ethnically mixed and physically closer to Japanese than they were to Ainu. From this, the &quot;transformation&quot; theory postulates that native Jōmon peoples changed gradually with the infusion of Yayoi immigrants into the Tōhoku region of northern Honshu, in contrast to the &quot;replacement&quot; theory that posits the Jōmon was &quot;replaced&quot; by the Yayoi.

There were numerous revolts by the Ainu against feudal rule. The last large-scale resistance was Shakushain&#x27;s revolt in 1669–1672. In 1789, a smaller movement known as the Menashi–Kunashir rebellion was crushed. After that rebellion, the terms &quot;Japanese&quot; and &quot;Ainu&quot; referred to clearly distinguished groups, and the Matsumae were unequivocally Japanese.

According to John A. Harrison of the University of Florida, prior to 1868 Japan used proximity as its claim to Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands; however, Japan had never thoroughly explored, governed, or exploited the areas, and this claim was invalidated by the movement of Russia into the Northeast Pacific area and by Russian settlements on Kamchatka (from 1699), Sakhalin (1850s) and the Sea of Okhotsk Coast (1640s onwards).

Prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate realized the need to prepare northern defenses against a possible Russian invasion and took over control of most of Ezochi in 1855-1858. Many Japanese settlers regarded the Ainu as &quot;inhuman and the inferior descendants of dogs&quot;.
The Tokugawa irregularly imposed various assimilation programs on the Ainu due to the Tokugawa&#x27;s perception of a threat from Russia. For example, assimilation programs were implemented in response to perceived threats from Russia, which included the of 1793 and the Golovnin Incident of 1804. Once the respective Russian threats appeared to subside, the assimilation programs were halted until 1855. However, in 1855, once the Treaty of Shimoda was signed, which defined the borders between Russian Empire and Tokugawa Japan, the Tokugawa again viewed Russia as a threat to Japanese sovereignty over Hokkaido and reinstated assimilation programs on the Ainu.

=== Meiji Era ===
==== Colonization of Hokkaido ====
Prior to the Meiji era, the island was called Ezochi, which can be translated as &quot;land of the barbarians&quot; or &quot;the land for people who did not obey the government.&quot; Shortly after the Boshin War in 1868, a group of Tokugawa loyalists led by Enomoto Takeaki temporarily occupied the island (the polity is commonly but mistakenly known as the Republic of Ezo), but the rebellion was defeated in May 1869. Through colonial practices, Ezochi was annexed into Japanese territory. Ezochi was subsequently put under control of Hakodate Prefectural Government. When establishing the , the Meiji government introduced a new name. After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaidō, which can be translated to &quot;northern sea route,&quot; and regional subdivisions were established, including the provinces of Oshima, Shiribeshi, Iburi, Ishikari, Teshio, Kitami, Hidaka, Tokachi, Kushiro, Nemuro and Chishima.

The initiative to colonize Ezo, which later became Hokkaido, traces back to 1869, where Japanese proponents argued that the colonization of Ezo would serve as a strategic move to enhance Japan&#x27;s standing and influence on the global stage, particularly in negotiations with Western powers, specifically Russia. The Meiji government invested heavily in colonizing Hokkaido for several reasons. Firstly, they aimed to assert their control over the region as a buffer against potential Russian advances. Secondly, they were attracted to Hokkaido&#x27;s rich natural resources, including coal, timber, fish, and fertile land. Lastly, since Western powers viewed colonial expansion as a symbol of prestige, Japan viewed the colonization of Hokkaido as an opportunity to present itself as a modern and respected nation to Western powers.


The primary purpose of the Development Commission was to secure Hokkaidō before the Russians extended their control of the Far East beyond Vladivostok. The Japanese failed to settle in the interior lowlands of the island because of aboriginal resistance. The resistance was eventually destroyed, and the lowlands were under the control of the commission. The most important goal of the Japanese was to increase the farm population and to create a conducive environment for emigration and settlement. However, the Japanese did not have expertise in modern agricultural techniques, and only possessed primitive mining and lumbering methods. Kuroda Kiyotaka was put in charge of the project, and turned to the United States for help.

His first step was to journey to the United States and recruit Horace Capron, President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s commissioner of agriculture. From 1871 to 1873 Capron bent his efforts to expounding Western agriculture and mining, with mixed results. Frustrated with obstacles to his efforts, Capron returned home in 1875. In 1876, William S. Clark arrived to found an agricultural college in Sapporo. Although he only remained a year, Clark left a lasting impression on Hokkaidō, inspiring the Japanese with his teachings on agriculture as well as Christianity. His parting words, &quot;Boys, be ambitious!&quot;, can be found on public buildings in Hokkaidō to this day. The population of Hokkaidō increased from 58,000 to 240,000 during that decade. 

Kuroda hired Capron for $10,000 per year and paid for all expenses related to the mission. Kuroda and his government were likely intrigued by Capron&#x27;s previous colonial experience, particularly his involvement in the forced removal of Native Americans from Texas to new territories after the Mexican–American War. Capron introduced capital-intensive farming techniques by adopting American methods and tools, importing seeds for Western crops, and bringing in European livestock breeds, which included his favorite North Devon cattle. He founded experimental farms in Hokkaido, conducted surveys to assess mineral deposits and agricultural potential, and advocated for improvements in water access, mills, and roads.

The settler colonization of Hokkaido by the Japanese was organized and supported through collaboration between the Japanese state and American experts and technology. From the 1870s to the 1880s, Japanese leaders placed their efforts on settling Hokkaido by systematically migrating former samurai lords, samurai retainers, and common citizens, which included farmers and peasants, providing them with &quot;free&quot; land and financial assistance. This transformation was facilitated with the expertise of American advisors who introduced various colonization technologies, transforming Hokkaido into land suitable for Japan&#x27;s capitalist aspirations. 

Japanese leaders drew inspiration from American settler colonialism during their diplomatic visits to the United States. Japanese colonial officials learned settler colonial techniques from Western imperial powers, particularly the United States. This included declaring large portions of Hokkaido as ownerless land, providing a pretext for the dispossession of the Ainu people. Japan established the Hokkaido Colonization Board in 1869, a year after the start of the Meiji era, with the goal of encouraging Japanese settlers to Hokkaido. Mainland Japanese settlers began migrating to Hokkaido, leading to Japan&#x27;s colonization of the island. Motivated by capitalist and industrial goals, the Meiji government forcefully appropriated fertile land and mineral-rich regions throughout Hokkaido, without consideration for their historical Ainu inhabitancy. The Meiji government implemented land seizures and enacted land ownership laws that favored Japanese settlers, effectively stripping Ainu people of their customary land rights and traditional means of subsistence. The 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act further marginalized and impoverished the Ainu people by forcing them to leave their traditional lands and relocating them to the rugged, mountainous regions in the center of the island. The act prohibited the Ainu from fishing and hunting, which were their main source of subsistence. The Ainu were valued primarily as a source of inexpensive manual labor, and discriminatory assimilation policies further entrenched their sense of inferiority as well as worsened poverty and disease within Ainu communities. These policies exacerbated diasporic trends among the Ainu population, as many sought employment with the government or private enterprises, often earning meager wages that barely sustained their families. 

The Meiji government embarked on assimilation campaigns aimed not only at assimilating the Ainu but also eradicating their language and culture entirely. They were forced to take on Japanese names and language, and gradually saw their culture and traditions eroded. The Ainu were forbidden to speak their own language and taught only Japanese at school. Facing pervasive stigma, many Ainu concealed their heritage. UNESCO has recognized the Ainu language as critically endangered. Given the Meiji state&#x27;s full political control over the island, the subsequent subjugation of its indigenous inhabitants, aggressive economic exploitation, and ambitious permanent settlement endeavors, Hokkaido emerged as the sole successful settler colony of Japan. 

After the Meiji colonization of Hokkaido, Meiji Japan depended on prison labour to accelerate the colonization process. The Japanese built three prisons and rendered Hokkaido a prison island, where political prisoners were incarcerated and used as prison labour. During the opening ceremony of the first prison, the Ainu name “Shibetsuputo” was replaced with the Japanese name “Tsukigata,” as an attempt to “Japanize” Hokkaido&#x27;s geography. The second prison opened near the Hokutan Horonai coal mine, where Ainu people were forced to work. Cheap prison labour played an important role in coal and sulphur mining, as well as road construction in Hokkaido. Eventually, several types of indentured labour, Korean labour, child labour and women labour replaced convict labour in Hokkaido. Working conditions were difficult and dangerous. Japan&#x27;s transition to capitalism depended heavily on the growth of the coal mining sector in Hokkaidō. The importance of coal from Hokkaidō increased throughout the First World War, and the mines required a large amount of labourers.

=== World War II ===
In mid-July 1945, various shipping ports, cities, and military facilities in Hokkaidō were attacked by the United States Navy&#x27;s Task Force 38. On 14–15 July, aircraft operating from the task force&#x27;s aircraft carriers sank and damaged a large number of ships in ports along Hokkaidō&#x27;s southern coastline as well as in northern Honshu. In addition, on 15 July a force of three battleships and two light cruisers bombarded the city of Muroran. Before the Japanese surrender was formalized, the Soviet Union made preparations for an invasion of Hokkaidō, but U.S. President Harry Truman made it clear that the surrender of all of the Japanese home islands would be accepted by General Douglas MacArthur per the 1943 Cairo Declaration.

=== Present ===
Hokkaidō became equal with other prefectures in 1947, when the revised Local Autonomy Act became effective. The Japanese central government established the as an agency of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office in 1949 to maintain its executive power in Hokkaidō. The agency was absorbed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in 2001. and the of the ministry still have a strong influence on public construction projects in Hokkaidō.

== Geography ==

The island of Hokkaidō is located in the north of Japan, near Russia (Sakhalin Oblast). It has coastlines on the Sea of Japan (to the west of the island), the Sea of Okhotsk (to the north), and the Pacific Ocean (to the east). The center of the island is mountainous, with volcanic plateaux. Hokkaidō has multiple plains such as the Ishikari Plain , Tokachi Plain , the (the largest wetland in Japan) and Sarobetsu Plain . Hokkaidō is which make it the second-largest island of Japan.

The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaidō from Honshu (Aomori Prefecture); La Pérouse Strait separates Hokkaidō from the island of Sakhalin in Russia; Nemuro Strait separates Hokkaidō from Kunashir Island in the Russian Kuril Islands.

The governmental jurisdiction of Hokkaidō incorporates several smaller islands, including Rishiri, Okushiri Island, and Rebun. (By Japanese reckoning, Hokkaidō also incorporates several of the Kuril Islands.) Hokkaidō Prefecture is the largest and northernmost Japanese prefecture. The island ranks 21st in the world by area.

===Population===


Hokkaidō has the third-largest population of Japan&#x27;s five main islands, with 5,111,691 people . It has the lowest population density in Japan, with just . Hokkaidō ranks 21st in population among the world&#x27;s islands. Major cities include Sapporo and Asahikawa in the central region, and the port of Hakodate facing Honshu in the south. Sapporo is Hokkaidō&#x27;s largest city and the fifth-largest in Japan. It had a population of 1,959,750 and a population density of .

=== Flora and fauna ===

There are three populations of the Ussuri brown bear found on the island. There are more brown bears in Hokkaidō than anywhere else in Asia besides Russia. The Hokkaidō brown bear is separated into three distinct lineages. There are only eight lineages in the world. Those on Honshu died out long ago.

The native conifer species in northern Hokkaidō is the Sakhalin fir (&quot;Abies sachalinensis&quot;). The flowering plant &quot;Hydrangea hirta&quot; is also found on the island.

=== Geologic activity ===
Like many areas of Japan, Hokkaidō is seismically active. Aside from numerous earthquakes, the following volcanoes are considered still active (at least one eruption since 1850):

* Hokkaido Koma-ga-take
* Mount Meakan
* Mount Tarumae
* Mount Tokachi
* Mount Usu and Shōwa-shinzan

In 1993, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 generated a tsunami which devastated Okushiri, killing 202 inhabitants. An earthquake of magnitude 8.3 struck near the island on September 26, 2003. On September 6, 2018, an earthquake of magnitude 6.6 struck with its epicenter near the city of Tomakomai, causing a blackout across the whole island.

On May 16, 2021, an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck off Japan&#x27;s Hokkaidō prefecture.

=== Parks ===


* Twelve prefectural natural parks (道立自然公園). The prefectural natural parks cover 146,802 ha, the largest area of any prefecture.
**Akkeshi Prefectural Natural Park
**Esan Prefectural Natural Park
**Furano-Ashibetsu Prefectural Natural Park
**Hiyama Prefectural Natural Park
**Kariba-Motta Prefectural Natural Park
**Matsumae-Yagoshi Prefectural Natural Park
**North Okhotsk Prefectural Natural Park
**Nopporo Shinrin Kōen Prefectural Natural Park
**Notsuke-Fūren Prefectural Natural Park
**Sharidake Prefectural Natural Park
**Shumarinai Prefectural Natural Park
**Teshiodake Prefectural Natural Park

== Subprefectures ==

, Hokkaidō has nine General Subprefectural Bureaus (総合振興局) and five Subprefectural Bureaus (振興局). Hokkaidō is one of eight prefectures in Japan that have subprefectures (支庁 &quot;shichō&quot;). However, it is the only one of the eight to have such offices covering the whole of its territory outside the main cities (rather than having them just for outlying islands or remote areas). This is mostly because of its great size; many parts of the prefecture are simply too far away to be effectively administered by Sapporo. Subprefectural offices in Hokkaidō carry out many of the duties that prefectural offices fulfill elsewhere in Japan.

== Municipalities ==
Hokkaidō is divided into 179 municipalities.
=== Cities ===
There are 35 cities in Hokkaidō:
=== Towns and villages ===

==Climate==

As Japan&#x27;s coldest region, Hokkaidō has relatively cool summers and icy/snowy winters. Most of the island falls in the humid continental climate zone with Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot; (hemiboreal) in most areas but &quot;Dfa&quot; (hot summer humid continental) in some inland lowlands. The average August temperature ranges from , while the average January temperature ranges from , in both cases depending on elevation and distance from the ocean, though temperatures on the western side of the island tend to be a little warmer than on the eastern. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 26 May 2019.

The northern portion of Hokkaidō falls into the taiga biome with significant snowfall. Snowfall varies widely from as much as on the mountains adjacent to the Sea of Japan down to around on the Pacific coast. The island tends to have isolated snowstorms that develop long-lasting snowbanks. Total precipitation varies from on the mountains of the Sea of Japan coast to around (the lowest in Japan) on the Sea of Okhotsk coast and interior lowlands and up to around on the Pacific side. The generally high quality of powder snow and numerous mountains in Hokkaidō make it a popular region for snow sports. The snowfall usually commences in earnest in November and ski resorts (such as those at Niseko, Furano, Teine and Rusutsu) usually operate between December and April. Hokkaidō celebrates its winter weather at the Sapporo Snow Festival.

During the winter, passage through the Sea of Okhotsk is often complicated by large floes of drift ice. Combined with high winds that occur during winter, this frequently brings air travel and maritime activity to a halt beyond the northern coast of Hokkaidō. Ports on the open Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan are generally ice-free year round, though most rivers freeze during the winter.

Unlike the other major islands of Japan, Hokkaidō is normally not affected by the June–July rainy season and the relative lack of humidity and typically warm, rather than hot, summer weather makes its climate an attraction for tourists from other parts of Japan.

===Temperature comparison===

== Major cities and towns ==

Hokkaidō&#x27;s largest city is the capital, Sapporo, which is a designated city. The island has two core cities: Hakodate in the south and Asahikawa in the central region. Other important population centers include Tomakomai, Iwamizawa, Kushiro, Obihiro, Kitami, Abashiri, Wakkanai, and Nemuro.

==Economy==

Although there is some light industry (most notably paper milling and beer brewing) most of the population is employed by the service sector. In 2001, the service sector and other tertiary industries generated more than three-quarters of the gross domestic product.

Agriculture and other primary industries play a large role in Hokkaidō&#x27;s economy. Hokkaidō has nearly one fourth of Japan&#x27;s total arable land. It ranks first in the nation in the production of a host of agricultural products, including wheat, soybeans, potatoes, sugar beets, onions, pumpkins, corn, raw milk, and beef. Hokkaidō also accounts for 22% of Japan&#x27;s forests with a sizable timber industry. The prefecture is first in the nation in production of marine products and aquaculture. The average farm size in Hokkaidō is 26 hectares per farmer in 2013, which is almost 11 times bigger than the national average of 2.4 hectares.
Tourism is an important industry, especially during the cool summertime when visitors are attracted to Hokkaidō&#x27;s open spaces from hotter and more humid parts of Japan and other Asian countries. During the winter, skiing and other winter sports bring other tourists, and increasingly international ones, to the island.

Coal mining played an important role in the industrial development of Hokkaidō, with the Ishikari coalfield. Cities such as Muroran were primarily developed to supply the rest of the archipelago with coal.

In 2023, Rapidus Corporation announced Hokkaido&#x27;s largest business investment with a 5 trillion yen plan to build a semiconductor manufacturing factory in Chitose. The site is expected to eventually host over 1,000 employees.

==Transportation==

Hokkaido&#x27;s only land link to the rest of Japan is the Seikan Tunnel. Most travellers travel to the island by air: the main airport is New Chitose Airport at Chitose, just south of Sapporo. Tokyo–Chitose is in the top 10 of the world&#x27;s busiest air routes, handling more than 40 widebody round trips on several airlines each day. One of the airlines, Air Do was named after Hokkaidō.

Hokkaidō can be reached by ferry from Sendai, Niigata and some other cities, with the ferries from Tokyo dealing only in cargo. The Hokkaido Shinkansen takes passengers from Tokyo to near Hakodate in slightly over four hours. There is a fairly well-developed railway network, but many cities can be accessed only by road. The coal railways were constructed around Sapporo and Horonai during the late 19th century, as advised by American engineer Joseph Crawford.

Hokkaidō is home to one of Japan&#x27;s Melody Roads, which is made from grooves cut into the ground, which when driven over causes a tactile vibration and audible rumbling transmitted through the wheels into the car body.

== Education ==

The Hokkaido Prefectural Board of Education oversees public schools (except colleges and universities) in Hokkaidō. Public elementary and junior high schools (except Hokkaido Noboribetsu Akebi Secondary School and schools attached to Hokkaidō University of Education) are operated by municipalities, and public high schools are operated by either the prefectural board or municipalities.

===Senior high schools===

, there are 291 high schools in Hokkaido: 4 national schools, 55 private schools, 233 public schools, and 2 integrated junior-senior schools.

===Colleges and universities===

Hokkaidō has 34 universities (7 national, 6 local public, and 21 private universities), 15 junior colleges, and 6 colleges of technology (3 national, 1 local public, and 2 private colleges).

, 74 individual municipalities in Hokkaidō have sister city agreements with 114 cities in 21 countries worldwide.

== Politics ==

=== Governor ===
The current governor of Hokkaido is Naomichi Suzuki. He won the governorship in the gubernatorial election in 2019 as an independent. In 1999, Hori was supported by all major non-Communist parties and Itō ran without party support. Before 1983, the governorship had been held by Liberal Democrats Naohiro Dōgakinai and Kingo Machimura for 24 years. In the 1971 election when Machimura retired, the Socialist candidate Shōhei Tsukada lost to Dōgakinai by only 13,000 votes; Tsukada was also supported by the Communist Party – the leftist cooperation in opposition to the US-Japanese security treaty had brought joint Socialist-Communist candidates to victory in many other prefectural and local elections in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, Machimura had defeated Yokomichi&#x27;s father Setsuo in the race to succeed Hokkaidō&#x27;s first elected governor, Socialist Toshibumi Tanaka who retired after three terms. Tanaka had only won the governorship in 1947 in a run-off election against Democrat Eiji Arima because no candidate had received the necessary vote share to win in the first round as required by law at the time.

=== Assembly ===
The Hokkaido Legislative Assembly has 100 members from 47 electoral districts. , the LDP caucus holds a majority with 51 seats, the DPJ-led group has 26 members. Other groups are the &quot;Hokkaidō Yūshikai&quot; of New Party Daichi and independents with twelve seats, Kōmeitō with eight, and the Japanese Communist Party with four members. General elections for the Hokkaido assembly are currently held together with gubernatorial elections in the unified local elections (last round: April 2015).

=== National representation ===

For the lower house of the National Diet, Hokkaidō is divided into twelve single-member electoral districts. In the 2017 election, candidates from the governing coalition of Liberal Democrats and Kōmeitō won seven districts and the main opposition Constitutional Democrats five. For the proportional election segment, Hokkaidō and Tokyo are the only two prefectures that form a regional &quot;block&quot; district of their own. The Hokkaido proportional representation block elects eight Representatives. In 2017, the Liberal Democratic Party received 28.8% of the proportional vote and won three seats, the Constitutional Democratic Party won three (26.4% of the vote), one seat each went to Kibō no Tō (12.3%) and Kōmeitō (11.0%). The Japanese Communist Party, who won a seat in 2014, lost their seat in 2017 while receiving 8.5% of the votes.

In the upper house of the National Diet, a major reapportionment in the 1990s halved the number of Councillors from Hokkaidō per election from four to two. After the elections of 2010 and 2013, the Hokkaido electoral district – like most two-member districts for the upper house – is represented by two Liberal Democrats and two Democrats. In the 2016 upper house election, the district magnitude will be raised to three, Hokkaidō will then temporarily be represented by five members and six after the 2019 election.

<doc id="58096" wikidata="Q208054" url="?curid=58096" title="La Pérouse Strait">
<text>La Pérouse Strait (), or Sōya Strait (), is a strait dividing the southern part of the Russian island of Sakhalin from the northern part of the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, and connecting the Sea of Japan on the west with the Sea of Okhotsk on the east.

The strait is wide and deep. The narrowest part of the strait is in the west between Cape Krillion in Sakhalin and Cape Sōya in Hokkaidō, which is also the shallowest at only deep. A small rocky island, appropriately named Kamen Opasnosti (Russian for &quot;Rock of Danger&quot;) is located in the Russian waters in the northeastern part of the strait, southeast of Cape Krillion. Another small island, Bentenjima, lies near the Japanese shore of the strait.

The strait is named after Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, a French naval officer who explored it in 1787 as part of a round-the-world voyage.

Japan&#x27;s territorial waters extend to three nautical miles into La Pérouse Strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan&#x27;s prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.

==History==
Between 1848 and 1892, American whaleships passed through the strait in the spring and summer as they made their way from the right whale grounds in the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk to hunt right and bowhead whales. The ship &quot;David Paddack&quot; (352 tons), Captain Swain, of Nantucket, was bound home with a full cargo when it wrecked in the strait in 1848.

The legendary submarine &quot;USS Wahoo&quot;, skippered by Dudley W. &quot;Mush&quot; Morton, was sunk in the strait on her seventh war patrol in October 1943. The submarine&#x27;s hull was found and identified as &quot;Wahoo&quot; on Oct. 31, 2006.

==Proposed rail crossing==
The Sakhalin–Hokkaido Tunnel has been proposed to connect Japan and Russia under the Strait, further connecting to the Trans-Siberian Railroad. A bridge has also been proposed.

<text>Magadan () is a port town and the administrative centre of Magadan Oblast, Russia. The city is located on the isthmus of the Staritsky Peninsula by the Nagaev Bay; it serves as a gateway to the Kolyma region.

Magadan, founded in 1929, was a major transit centre for political prisoners during the Stalin era and the administrative centre of the Dalstroy forced-labor gold-mining operation. The town later served as a port for exporting gold and other metals and was visited by U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace in 1944. Magadan plays a significant role in transportation with the Port of Magadan and Sokol Airport.

The local economy relies on gold mining and fisheries, although gold production has declined. The town has various cultural institutions and religious establishments, such as the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity. The Mask of Sorrow memorial commemorates Stalin&#x27;s victims. Magadan experiences a subarctic climate with prolonged and cold winters, causing the soil to remain permanently frozen.

==History==
The settlement of Magadan was founded in 1929 in the Ola river valley, near the settlement of Nagayevo. During the Stalin era, Magadan was a major transit centre for inmates sent to Gulag forced labour camps. From 1932 to 1953, it was the administrative centre of the Dalstroy organisation—a vast forced-labour gold-mining operation and forced-labour camp system. The first director of Dalstroy was Eduard Berzin, who between 1932 and 1937 established the infrastructure of the forced labour camps in Magadan. Berzin was executed in 1938 by Stalin, towards the end of the Great Purge.

The town later served as a port for exporting gold and other metals mined in the Kolyma region. Its size and population grew quickly as facilities were rapidly developed for the expanding mining activities in the area. Town status was granted to it on July 14, 1939.

Magadan was visited by U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace in May 1944. He took an instant liking to his NKVD host, admired handiwork done by the enslaved political prisoners, and later glowingly called the town a combination of Tennessee Valley Authority and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Magadan is the administrative centre of the Magadan Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with the urban-type settlements of Sokol and Uptar, incorporated as the &quot;town of oblast significance of Magadan&quot;—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Magadan is incorporated as Magadan Urban Okrug.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
=== Transport ===

The Port of Magadan is the second largest seaport in the North-East of Russia after Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky located on Nagaev Bay and Sea of Okhotsk. It operates all year round with the help of icebreakers. There is currently no operating railway in Magadan. However, the Magadan-Palatka line was operational between 1941 and 1956. Russian Railways are considering the possibility of building a railway from the Nizhny Bestyakh of the Amur-Yakutsk railway to Magadan by 2035, which will contribute to the development of an area with huge mineral deposits. Magadan is the final destination of the federal highway R504 Kolyma Highway, which connects the region with Yakutia and other parts of Russia. Anadyr Highway, currently under construction, will provide access to Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Sokol Airport and Magadan-13 airport provide access to air transport for numerous destinations in Russia with the former being for big aircraft and the latter is mainly for small aircraft.

Magadan is also the home of the Magadan/Sokol Flight Information Region (FIR) and Magadan Oceanic FIR, which controls the Northeastern part of the Russia and its Arctic airspace. Most of the westbound transpacific flights from North America to Asia will use those FIRs.

=== Economy ===
The principal sources of income for the local economy are gold mining and fisheries. Recently, gold production has declined. Fishing production, although improving from year to year, is still well below the allocated quotas, apparently as a result of an aging fleet. Other local industries include pasta and sausage plants, and a distillery. Although farming is difficult owing to the harsh climate, there are many public and private farming enterprises.

===Other===
The Central Intelligence Agency wrote a report on Ship Repair Yard No. 2 near Magadan in June 1965. Magadan was repeatedly reported as a base for the Soviet Navy during the Cold War.

==Culture and religion==
===Culture===

It has a number of cultural institutions, including the Regional Museum of Anthropology, a geological museum, a regional library and a university. &quot;Magadanskaya Pravda&quot; is the main newspaper.

The town figures prominently in the gulag literature of Varlam Shalamov and in the eponymous song by Mikhail Krug. Actor of film and stage Georgiy Zhzhonov worked at Magadan Theatre for two years after being released from a gulag in May 1945.

Magadan was home to a Soviet and Russian rock group founded there in 1986.

The town was a focal point of the &quot;Long Way Round&quot; TV series of a motorcycle journey made by Ewan McGregor, Charley Boorman and their team in 2004.

===Religion===

The town features the recent Orthodox Cathedral of the Life-Giving Trinity (completed in 2008), and the Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity (completed in 2002), among others.

===Memorials===

The Mask of Sorrow memorial, a large sculpture in memory of Stalin&#x27;s victims, was designed by Ernst Neizvestny. The Church of the Nativity ministers to survivors of the labor camps. It is staffed by several priests and nuns.

== Geography ==
The , a 192 km long river flowing to the Sea of Okhotsk, passes the city. The city is located on the isthmus of the Staritsky Peninsula by the Nagaev Bay.

Ecologically situated in the Northeast Siberian taiga, the town&#x27;s arboreal flora is made up of conifer trees, such as firs and larches, and silver birches. The city is surrounded by mountains to the west and northeast. Permafrost and tundra cover most of the region. The growing season is only one hundred days long.

The city of Magadan is on the same longitude as the suburbs of Greater Western Sydney, Australia, which lie on the eastern end of the 150th meridian east line, bordering the 151st meridian and is on the same latitude as Southern Scandinavia, and the far north of Scotland.

=== Climate ===

The climate of Magadan is subarctic (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). Winters are prolonged and very cold, with up to six months of sub-zero high temperatures, so that the soil remains permanently frozen; although they are still much milder than those of interior eastern Siberia. Average temperatures on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk range from in January to in July. Average temperatures in the interior range from in January to in July. Due to the wet nature of October and November, a snowpack is built up early, which then lasts throughout the winter even while the influence from the Siberian High lowers precipitation throughout those months.

<text>Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose KCN (born 21 September 1963) is an Antiguan former cricketer who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. Widely acknowledged as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height—he is tall—allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a very difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. He was chosen as one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year in 1992; after he retired he was entered into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame and selected as one of West Indies all-time XI by a panel of experts.

Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a relatively late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team until his retirement in 2000. On many occasions, his bowling spells were responsible for winning matches for West Indies which seemed lost, in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he bowled one of the greatest bowling spells of all time, when he took seven wickets while conceding a single run, hence taking figures of 7/1 for the first spell of the match. Similarly, in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six wickets for 24 runs. He is regarded as one of the greatest match-winning bowlers of all time.

Ambrose&#x27;s bowling method relied on accuracy and conceding few runs; several of his best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed that he was no longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.

==Early life and career==
Ambrose was born in Swetes, Antigua on 21 September 1963, the fourth of seven children. His father was a carpenter from a village. The family had no background in cricket, but his mother was a fan, and Ambrose played in his youth, primarily as a batsman. At school, he performed well academically, particularly in mathematics and French, and became an apprentice carpenter upon leaving at the age of 17. He briefly considered emigrating to America. At the time, his favourite sport was basketball, although he occasionally umpired cricket matches. Ambrose was not particularly tall until he reached his late teens, when he grew several inches to reach a height of . Around this time, his mother encouraged him to become more involved in cricket. Success as a fast bowler in a softball cricket match persuaded Ambrose to play in some club matches at the age of 20. He quickly attracted the attention of coaches and progressed to the St John&#x27;s cricket team. Selected in the Leeward Islands competition, he took seven for 67 (seven wickets for 67 runs) for Antigua against St Kitts. He made his first-class debut for the Leeward Islands in 1985–86 and took four wickets in the game, but failed to retain his place the following year.

A Viv Richards scholarship provided funding for him to play club cricket in England for Chester Boughton Hall Cricket Club in the highly rated Liverpool Competition during 1986 where he took 84 wickets at an average of 9.80. The following year, he returned to England to play for Heywood Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire League, for whom he took 115 wickets in the season; these experiences helped to improve his bowling technique.

Upon his return to Antigua, Ambrose practised intensely, regained his place in the Leeward Islands team and, in the absence of leading bowlers Winston Benjamin and Eldine Baptiste with the West Indies team, became the main attacking bowler in the side. He was no-balled for throwing in the first match, which &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; later attributed to confusion caused by his attribute of flicking his wrist prior to releasing the ball to impart extra pace, and there were no subsequent doubts about the legality of his bowling action. Retaining his place when the international bowlers returned, he took 35 wickets—including 12 in a match against Guyana, of which nine were bowled—in five matches in the competition. &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; report on the West Indian season said his performance was &quot;dominant&quot;, although few had heard of him previously. Identifying his yorker as his most effective delivery, it noted that he &quot;never lost his pace, his accuracy, or his thirst for wickets&quot;.

==International bowler==

===Debut and first years===
When Pakistan toured the West Indies in 1988, Ambrose played in the One Day International (ODI) series, taking the place of the recently retired Joel Garner. He made his debut during the first match, on 12 March 1988 in Kingston, Jamaica, taking wickets with his third and ninth deliveries; he ended the innings with four for 39 from 10 overs. In the second match, he took four for 35 and followed with another two wickets in the third. West Indies won those first three matches to take the series, and Ambrose did not play in the fourth or fifth game. In the Test series which followed, Ambrose was less effective. In the first Test, he took two for 121 as West Indies lost at home for the first time in 10 years. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that his debut was &quot;unimpressive&quot;, but that he improved in the subsequent matches. He finished the series with seven wickets at an average of over 50 runs per wicket. Later that year, Ambrose was chosen to tour England. After appearing in early tour games, he was chosen for the first two ODIs, taking three wickets in total, but was omitted from the third. In the Test series, he played in all five matches to take 22 wickets at an average of 20.22; his best figures of four for 58 came in the fourth Test, in which he took seven wickets and was named man of the match. Writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, commentator Tony Cozier described Ambrose as &quot;a ready-made replacement for Garner&quot;; the amount of bounce he generated after the ball pitched &quot;made him a constant menace&quot;.

In 1988–89, West Indies took part in an ODI tournament in Sharjah. Ambrose took 8 wickets, and was man of the match with four for 29 when West Indies defeated Pakistan in the final. From there, West Indies travelled to Australia for a series in which Ambrose was a dominant figure. The West Indies won the Test series 3–1, using controversial short-pitched bowling tactics. Ambrose&#x27;s height made him difficult to play as he made the ball bounce more than other bowlers. Writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, John Woodcock noted: &quot;As in England, earlier in 1988, Ambrose&#x27;s bowling was a telling factor ... [His] advance compensated for something of a decline in [Malcolm] Marshall&#x27;s effectiveness&quot;. In the first Test, he took seven wickets; in the second, he took five wickets in a Test innings for the first time with five for 72, and finished with eight in the game; and in the third, he took six wickets. His performances earned him man of the match award in the first and third games, and he ended the series with 26 wickets at an average of 21.46. He was West Indies&#x27; leading wicket-taker and headed the team bowling averages. In the ODI tournament that took place during the tour, West Indies defeated Australia in the final; Ambrose took 21 wickets in the series and twice took five wickets in an innings.

Suffering from fatigue and illness, Ambrose was less successful later in 1989 when India toured the West Indies: he took just five wickets in the four-Test series at an average of 54.60.

===County cricketer and success against England===
Ambrose made his debut in the English County Championship for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1989—the club signed him for the 1988 season but as he was playing in the West Indies touring team, he was unavailable that year. He took a wicket with his first delivery for the club, but was not particularly successful in the first part of the season; he settled down later and took 28 first-class wickets at 28.39 for Northamptonshire in nine games.

Early in 1990, England toured the West Indies and played four Tests—a fifth was abandoned owing to rain. The visiting team dominated the first part of the series but West Indies eventually won 2–1. Ambrose was unfit for the first Test, which West Indies lost, and the first four ODIs, but returned to take four for 18 in an ODI organised to replace the rained-off second Test. After a drawn third Test, West Indies won the fourth game. The home captain, Viv Richards, set England 356 to win, but after losing early wickets, the English batsmen entered the last hour of the game with five wickets still to fall. Ambrose took the new ball and removed the last five batsmen for 18 runs in 46 deliveries, four of them leg before wicket. He finished with figures of eight for 45, ten wickets in the match, and West Indies levelled the series with a 164-run win. Ambrose was man of the match. He took six wickets in the final match, to finish the series with 20 wickets at 15.35, finishing top of the West Indies&#x27; averages. Ambrose, along with the other home bowlers, was described by Alan Lee in &quot;Wisden&quot; as an &quot;awesome handful in the latter part of the series&quot;, and described his match-winning spell in the fourth Test as &quot;unforgettable&quot;. Ambrose&#x27;s other appearances for West Indies in 1989–90 were all in ODIs, although he did not take more than two wickets in any innings except in the match against England. He also took 22 first-class wickets for the Leeward Islands, and when he returned to England to play for Northamptonshire in 1990, took 58 first-class wickets to top the club&#x27;s bowling averages. In one-day cricket for the county, he took 13 wickets while conceding an average of just 2.53 runs per over.

==Leading bowler in the world==

===Series against Australia and England===
West Indies toured Pakistan in late 1990, and Ambrose topped the team&#x27;s bowling averages in a three-match series which was drawn 1–1. He took 14 wickets at 17.07, but was overshadowed slightly by the performances of Ian Bishop. He played the first two ODIs, but missed the third after Pakistan had already won the series, and his best figures in the Tests came in the final match when he took five for 35. Then, when Australia toured West Indies from February 1991, Ambrose took 18 wickets in the five Tests at an average of 27.38. West Indies won the series 2–1, and Ambrose was fourth in the averages, but Tony Cozier observed in &quot;Wisden&quot; that the whole West Indies attack was dependable. Ambrose made an impression batting as part of a West Indian lower batting order which repeatedly added crucial runs during the series. He took part in two important partnerships to help his team recover from a difficult situation, and in the third match, he scored his only half-century in Tests. He also took 20 first-class wickets for Leeward Islands.

West Indies&#x27; next matches were in England. The Test series was drawn 2–2 and Ambrose was the team&#x27;s leading wicket-taker with 28 (averaging 20.00); he also came top of the bowling averages. He had a particular impact on Graeme Hick, who was appearing in Test cricket for the first time, dismissing him six times in seven innings with short-pitched bowling. Accurate bowling was important in the series, played on a series of slow-paced pitches; according to Scyld Berry, writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, &quot;Since the 1988 tour, Ambrose had improved his control to the point where a batsman had to play almost every ball—and not with a scoring stroke, either&quot;. Berry suggests that West Indies may have won the series had Viv Richards used a different tactical approach with Ambrose&#x27;s bowling. The bowler was not fully fit in the final Test, which may have affected the outcome. Berry describes &quot;Ambrose&#x27;s rise to the status of a giant—with the mannerism of celebrating each wicket by whirling his arms upwards, like a flock of doves taking to the air.&quot; Ambrose twice took five wickets in an innings—his best figures were six for 52 in the first Test, when he twice took wickets with consecutive deliveries. Ambrose was named man-of the-match in the third Test and adjudged West Indies man-of-the-series. For his performances, Ambrose was named one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; Cricketers of the Year. The citation remarked on his consistency and stated: &quot;Ambrose has the ability to exert a debilitating psychological influence which so often precipitates a cluster of wickets after the initial breach has been made ... Moreover, he was arguably the essential difference between the two sides in what proved to be a zestful series.&quot; The West Indies wicket-keeper, Jeff Dujon, said: &quot;He is mature beyond his years, has pace, accuracy, heart and determination, plus, importantly, real pride in economical figures.&quot;

===Victory against South Africa===

During the 1991–92 season, West Indies played mainly one-day cricket, taking part in tournaments in Sharjah—where Ambrose took seven wickets, including an analysis of five for 53—and Australia, and took part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In this tournament, Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals. Ambrose returned home to play twice for the Leeward Islands in January 1992.

In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for the first time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, all of which were won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing regulation which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began the final day of the match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.

Returning to play for Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and suffering from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets at an average of 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games.

===Second tour of Australia===
The West Indies toured Australia in 1992–93, recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2–1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, &quot;paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world&#x27;s leading bowler&quot;. On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as &quot;one of Test cricket&#x27;s most devastating spells&quot;. West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose&#x27;s performance as &quot;instrumental in winning [the series]&quot; and his bowling as &quot;flawless&quot;.

In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final—both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals.
After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2–0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The &quot;Wisden&quot; report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team&#x27;s busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.

Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.

===More success against England===

When he returned to the West Indies, Ambrose took 19 first-class wickets for the Leeward Islands at an average of 11.68, in his first appearances for the islands in two years, but as England arrived to tour West Indies, he complained of fatigue and there were rumours he planned to retire. He played in three times in the five-match ODI series, taking two wickets, and took a further two wickets in the first Test, which West Indies won. In &quot;Wisden&quot;, Alan Lee described his performances at this time as &quot;lethargic&quot;, and in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Paul Allott wrote that he bowled &quot;like a shadow&quot; owing to the effects of continuous cricket. Ambrose was ineffective at the start of the second Test, but recovered, ending the match with eight wickets; according to Lee, he &quot;struck the critical blows of the match&quot; in the first innings. In the third Test, played in Trinidad, he took five for 60 in England&#x27;s first innings, but after the visiting team built a substantial lead, West Indies were bowled out to leave England needing 194 to win and an hour to bat on the fourth evening. Ambrose took six wickets to leave England 40 for eight at the close of play; the next morning, they were bowled out for 46 and Ambrose had figures of six for 24 in the innings and match figures of 11 for 84; he was named man of the match. Lee described the collapse as &quot;staggering&quot;, and judged Ambrose bowling to be &quot;of the highest calibre&quot;. He continued: &quot;He delivered one of the most devastating spells of even his career.&quot; Allott called it &quot;the definitive spell of fast bowling&quot;.

Ambrose took four wickets in the fourth Test, but West Indies lost the match, their first defeat in Barbados for 59 years, and Ambrose was fined £1,000 by the match referee for knocking down his stumps in frustration when he was the last man out. He took one more wicket in the drawn final Test to finish the series with 26 wickets and top the West Indian bowling averages. Writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, Lee summarised Ambrose&#x27;s performances: &quot;Ambrose was magnificent. He was deservedly named man of the series, not only for taking 26 wickets at an average of 19.96 apiece and winning the Trinidad Test single-handed, but for the more profound truth that West Indies now look to him whenever they need wickets ... [He] carried the attack alone&quot;.

Ambrose returned to play for Northamptonshire in 1994, but arrived later than scheduled. Claiming to need a rest, he missed his scheduled flight and arrived four days late. His absence may have contributed to Northamptonshire&#x27;s elimination in the preliminary stages of the Benson and Hedges Cup. At the time, members of the county were unhappy with Ambrose&#x27;s performances for the team; the committee fined him, and he expressed contrition. During the remainder of the season, he bowled extremely effectively to take 77 first-class wickets, the most for the club in 18 years, at an average of 14.45 to top the national bowling averages. According to Andrew Radd in &quot;Wisden&quot;, the club were mollified by his success, but he wrote: &quot;Rarely in Northamptonshire&#x27;s history have the performances and the personality of one cricketer dominated a season to the extent that Curtly Ambrose did in 1994.&quot; Ambrose missed the final match of the season with a shoulder problem.

==Apparent decline==

===Shoulder injury===
Ambrose&#x27;s shoulder injury, caused by his bowling workload, caused him to miss the West Indies&#x27; tour of India in the last three months of 1994. Although he returned to join the tour of New Zealand in early 1995, he did not reach his full bowling pace; he took one wicket in the ODI series and five in the two Test matches. He remained in the team when Australia toured the Caribbean later in 1995; the West Indies lost the Test series 2–1, their first defeat in a Test series since 1980. After taking two wickets in four ODIs, Ambrose took 13 wickets at 19.84 in the four-Test series to lead the West Indian averages. He took nine of these wickets in Trinidad during the third Test, when West Indies levelled the series having lost the first Test (the second was drawn). Bowling on a pitch that was extremely difficult for batting, and which both teams considered to be unsatisfactory, Ambrose took nine for 65 in the match and was named man of the match. During the game, Ambrose had to be pulled away from a verbal confrontation with Steve Waugh by the captain, Richardson. But outside of this match, the Australian team judged his bowling to have declined in pace following his shoulder injury, and that he lacked the variety to adapt to a different role. The West Indies&#x27; cricket manager, former Test bowler Andy Roberts, publicly claimed during the series that several of his team possessed &quot;attitude problems&quot;, and complained that the fast bowlers would not follow his advice.

During the tour of England which followed, Ambrose did not take a wicket in the three-match ODI series; according to journalist Simon Barnes, both Ambrose and the team lacked confidence following their defeat by Australia; he lacked rhythm and displayed signs of frustration and unhappiness. He was more effective in the Test series, and according to Tony Cozier in &quot;Wisden&quot;, &quot;was always captable of a spell of incisive, quality bowling&quot;. But he was affected by injury throughout the six-match series; he withdrew injured from the third Test having bowled fewer than eight overs and missed the fifth Test completely. Other bowlers in the team overshadowed Ambrose, and it was not until the final Test that he reached his most effective form in taking five for 96 in the first innings and seven wickets in the match. Waving to the crowd as he left the field on the final day with an injury, Ambrose seemed to indicate that he would not tour England again. He ended the series third in the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 24.09. But according to Cozier, the senior players in the team caused problems for the management, and when the players returned home, Ambrose and three other members of the team were fined 10 per cent of their tour fee—in Ambrose&#x27;s case, the fine was for &quot;general failings of behaviour and attitude&quot;, and setting a bad example to younger team-mates.

Along with other senior players, Ambrose was rested from West Indies&#x27; next tour, an ODI tournament in October 1995, but he returned to play in a three-team ODI tournament in Australia in December and January. However, affected by the refusal of Brian Lara to tour following after being fined for his behaviour during the tour of England, the team failed to qualify for the final. Ambrose took ten wickets in the tournament, and took three wickets in consecutive innings; in the latter game, he was man of the match. West Indies were more successful in the World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka which began in February. They reached the semi-finals, losing to Australia. Ambrose was man of the match with three for 28 in his team&#x27;s opening match, and took ten wickets at 17.00 in the competition. He conceded an average of just three runs per over for the tournament, the second best among those who played in more than two games. In March, Ambrose played in a home series against New Zealand. In the five match ODI series, 10 wickets at 17.60, including four for 36 in the opening game. He took eight wickets in the two-Test series at an average of 20.50, leading the team averages, and took five for 68 in the second match. During the English cricket season, he returned to Northamptonshire and took 43 wickets in nine games to lead the national bowling averages, but he missed several matches with recurring injuries and his contract was not renewed for the following year. He was replaced by the much younger Mohammad Akram as overseas player.

===Team in decline===
Following Australia&#x27;s victory in 1994–95, when West Indies toured Australia in 1996–97 the series was heavily publicised as a re-match. However, the visiting team were often ineffective, continuing a trend of decline, and depended heavily on their senior players, one of whom was Ambrose. He began the series poorly, continuing a pattern established in several preceding series, and critics suggested that he was no longer effective. After taking only three wickets in the first two Tests, both of which were lost by West Indies, Ambrose told his team-mates that he would take ten wickets in the third. On a difficult pitch for batting, he managed to take nine in the match, including three in the first hour of the game, despite struggling with a hamstring injury. West Indies won, and Ambrose was named man of the match, but he missed the fourth Test with an injury. Writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, Greg Baum suggested that Ambrose absence possibly affected the outcome of the series; Australia won easily to ensure they won the series. Ambrose returned for the final match, and on another difficult batting pitch, took five for 43 on the first day. West Indies won and Ambrose was again man of the match. He led the West Indies bowling averages with 19 wickets at 23.36, but had been the driving factor in West Indies&#x27; two wins. Ambrose also played in an ODI tournament during the tour of Australia, taking nine wickets at 27.33. Later in the season, between March and May 1997, India toured West Indies; Ambrose took ten wickets at 30.10 in the Test series, including five for 87 in the second Test, but was no longer the home team&#x27;s most effective bowler. Then in June, Sri Lanka played a two-Test series, won 1–0 by West Indies. In the first, Ambrose took five for 37 in the first innings, and eight wickets in the game, to be named man of the match. This included his 300th wicket in Test matches; he was the 12th bowler, and fourth West Indian, to reach this landmark. Ambrose also played five ODIs during the West Indies home season, taking nine wickets.

West Indies&#x27; loss of form continued in late 1997 when they lost every international match during their tour of Pakistan. Ambrose played in two out of West Indies&#x27; three matches in an ODI tournament, taking one wicket, but his performance in taking one wicket in the two Test matches he played—he missed the third match with injury—prompted Fazeer Mohammed, writing in &quot;Wisden&quot;, to describe Ambrose as &quot;a shadow of his former self&quot;. Any danger that Ambrose might have retired after this series was forestalled when Brian Lara was appointed West Indies captain and immediately spoke to Ambrose and Walsh to ask them to continue in the team. When England toured the West Indies between January and April 1998, he took 30 wickets at 14.26 to top the bowling averages for the series. Many of the pitches during the tour were poor for batting, but Ambrose was very effective, particularly in the second, third and fourth Tests. In addition, he dismissed Mike Atherton, the England captain, six times in the series. Scyld Berry wrote in &quot;Wisden&quot; that Ambrose was &quot;back to something near his peak form ... [He] defied every prediction that he was finished after his tour of Pakistan.&quot; In the second Test, Ambrose took eight wickets; he conceded only 23 runs from 26 overs in the first innings and bowled a spell of five wickets for 16 runs from 47 deliveries in the second to complete figures of five for 52. Having won the second match, West Indies lost the third, but according to Matthew Engel, &quot;Ambrose&#x27;s abiding power was the most constant feature of a fluctuating match&quot;. His eight wickets in the game, including five for 25 in the first innings, took him past fifty Test wickets in Trinidad. He followed up with six wickets in West Indies victory in the fourth Test, taking four for 38 in the final innings. Tony Cozier wrote that Ambrose &quot;thundered in, arms and knees pumping like pistons, to generate all of his old pace.&quot; Following the Test series, which West Indies won 3–1, Ambrose played in the first three matches of the ODI series, and took three wickets.

==Final years of career==
Ambrose and Walsh missed the Mini World Cup ODI tournament in October 1998, in Ambrose&#x27;s case following damage to his house caused by Hurricane Georges. They returned to the team for West Indies&#x27; first ever tour of South Africa, and Ambrose took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 23.76, but West Indies lost every game of the five-match series. In the first Test match, Ambrose and Walsh bowled effectively but lacked support from the other members of the attack. In the second Test, the pair again lacked support, but bowled well. The visiting team generally bowled too many bouncers to be effective, but Ambrose took eight wickets in the game, including six for 51 in the second innings. He was ineffective in the third Test, and despite bowling what Geoffrey Dean in &quot;Wisden&quot; called a &quot;superb opening spell&quot;, could not prevent South Africa building up a large total against an attack lacking two other main bowlers. Ambrose pulled out of the attack himself later in the innings with a back injury, and did not bowl in the second innings. He missed the final Test with a hamstring injury. He was fit to play in the first six games of a seven-match ODI series, won 6–1 by South Africa, and took six wickets. In March 1999, West Indies then faced Australia in a home series, and contrary to expectations, West Indies drew the series 2–2. The outcome of the series was decided by a small group of players, including Ambrose, whom Mike Coward described in &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;five of the most distinguished cricketers of all time&quot;. Ambrose took 19 wickets at 22.26, second to Walsh in the averages. His best figures came in the fourth and final Test, when he took five for 94 in the first innings and eight wickets in the match, but in the third match, although he only took four wickets in total, Coward described Ambrose as &quot;rampant&quot; and wrote that Steve Waugh, who scored 199, had to survive &quot;some extraordinary pace bowling from Ambrose&quot;. He played four of the ODIs which followed in April, taking three wickets. The following month, Ambrose took part in the 1999 World Cup in England, and he was the second most economical bowler in the tournament in conceding an average 2.35 runs per over while taking seven wickets at 13.42. West Indies went out in the group stages, and Matthew Engel suggested that the bowlers were tired and judged the team &quot;outright failures&quot;.

Following the World Cup, the West Indian selectors chose to rest Ambrose, along with Walsh, from alternate ODI tournaments. Ambrose consequently missed two ODI series, but in October 1999 he played two ODIs in a series against Bangladesh in Dhaka and three in a tournament in Sharjah. In the latter competition, Ambrose conceded five runs from ten overs against Sri Lanka, the second most economical bowling figures from a full allocation of 10 overs in all ODIs. However, in all five matches, he took just one wicket, and he injured his elbow in Sharjah which forced him to miss West Indies&#x27; tour of New Zealand which began in December. Ambrose recovered in time to play for the Leeward Island in domestic cricket, taking 31 wickets at 12.03 in seven first-class games. When Zimbabwe toured the West Indies, he returned to the West Indies team to be named man of the match in the first Test—Zimbabwe were bowled out for 63 when chasing 99 runs to win. He took a wicket in the second and final Test, and four wickets in six matches during a three-way ODI series also involving Zimbabwe and Pakistan. These were his final ODIs; in 176 matches, he took 225 wickets at an average of 24.12 and conceding 3.48 runs per over. Pakistan subsequently played a three-Test series against West Indies; in his last home series, Ambrose took 11 wickets at 19.90 to head the West Indian bowling averages.

Before his next series, a five-match series in England, Ambrose announced that he would retire after the final Test, although the president of the West Indies Cricket Board unavailingly tried to persuade him to continue for a little longer. West Indies lost the series 3–1, Tony Cozier, reviewing the series, suggested that only Ambrose and Walsh of the West Indian team emerged from the series with any credit. The other bowlers were ineffective, and Ambrose publicly commented during the series on the lack of support that he and Walsh received. He was second in the averages to Walsh with 17 wickets at 18.64. After taking just one wicket in the first Test, although Martin Johnson, in &quot;Wisden&quot;, suggested he bowled very well, Ambrose took five wickets in the second Test but was again unlucky as the batsmen were beaten by many deliveries that he bowled. After this match, Ambrose returned to the West Indies having been rested from an ODI tournament involving England and Zimbabwe. He took four wickets in the first innings of both the third and fourth Tests, passing 400 wickets in the latter match. After he took three wickets in his final Test match, the crowd gave him a standing ovation and the England players formed a guard-of-honour when he came out to bat. In 98 Test matches, he took 405 wickets at an average of 20.99; according to Mike Selvey, in Swetes, his mother rang a bell each time he took a Test wicket.

Having retired from cricket, Ambrose has concentrated on music, playing with several bands. He played bass guitar with the reggae band Big Bad Dread and the Baldhead; one fellow band member was his former team-mate Richie Richardson. Ambrose was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Nation (KCN) by the Antiguan Barbudan government on 28 February 2014, alongside Richardson and Andy Roberts.

==Style and technique==
Mike Selvey wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1991 that Ambrose had &quot;the sort of easy, repetitive, no-sweat action which is the key to unyielding accuracy. There is no respite and all his other qualities are byproducts.&quot; At his peak, Ambrose did not rely on pronounced swing or seam movement of the ball. Instead, he repeatedly bowled into the same areas of the pitch and the height from which he delivered the ball made him extremely difficult to face. The ball bounced sharply after pitching, sometimes deviating slightly from a straight line after pitching on the seam, and frequently took the edge of the batsman&#x27;s bat to be caught behind the wicket. His 1992 citation as &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year states that he had &quot;outright pace and he generates a disconcerting, steepling bounce from fuller-length deliveries ... His height and a slender, sinewy wrist contribute greatly to the final velocity [of the ball], the wrist snapping forward at the instant of release to impart extra thrust&quot;. Writing in 2001 following Ambrose&#x27;s retirement, Michael Atherton, whom Ambrose dismissed more often than any other batsman, said: &quot;At his best, there is no doubt that [Ambrose] moved beyond the fine line that separates the great from the very good. Quality bowlers essentially need two of three things: pace, movement and accuracy. Ambrose had all three.&quot;

Ambrose&#x27;s height, and the accuracy with which he bowled, made it difficult for batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full-length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.

As of 2024, Ambrose&#x27;s 405 Test wickets place him 17th on the list of leading Test wicket-takers. Of those who have taken over 200 Test wickets, Ambrose has the third best bowling average behind Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner, and has the eighth best economy rate; he rises to third if only those who have taken over 250 wickets are included. For much of his career, Ambrose was rated the world&#x27;s best bowler in the ICC player rankings, first reaching the top in 1991; he rarely dropped below second and was ranked in the top 10 from 1989 until the end of his career. His highest rating of 912 in the rankings, which he achieved in 1994, is the equal sixth best rating of all time. In 2010, Ambrose was chosen by a panel of writers and experts as a member of ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s &quot;All-Time XI&quot; for West Indies. The following year, he was inducted into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame. During his playing days, Ambrose had a reputation for reticence, and rarely spoke to journalists or the opposition. His response to a request for an interview in 1991—&quot;Curtly talks to no-one&quot;— became associated with him throughout his career, but he was more willing to talk to journalists after he retired.

==Coaching career==

In January 2022, Ambrose was appointed as bowling coach of Jamaica Tallawahs for CPL 2022 edition.

<doc id="58100" wikidata="Q2470173" url="?curid=58100" title="Bard the Bowman">
<text>Bard the Bowman is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. A Man of Laketown and a descendant of the ancient Lords of Dale, Bard manages to kill Smaug, the dragon, after which he becomes king of Dale. Tolkien created the character specifically to kill Smaug, since none of the other protagonists of the story were able to fulfill this role. Bard the Bowman may have been inspired by the warrior Wiglaf in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Fictional history==

Bard is a descendant of Girion, the last lord of the city of Dale, which had been destroyed by the dragon Smaug 171 years before the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which takes place in year 2941 of the Third Age. He is the captain of a company of archers in Esgaroth (also known as Lake-town). His friends accused him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, but they knew his worth and courage. He is described as tall and grim with black hair. When Smaug attacks Lake-town, Bard is the last of the archers to stand his post, but the dragon is immune to arrows. However, a thrush speaks to Bard, showing him the weak spot in the dragon&#x27;s armour in the hollow under Smaug&#x27;s left breast, which Bilbo had discovered in his conversation with Smaug. He fires his favourite shaft, the family heirloom &quot;Black Arrow&quot;, and kills Smaug, who falls onto Lake-town, destroying it.

After the dragon&#x27;s death, Bard joins the survivors of the attack on Lake-town and discovers that they had thought him dead. The survivors receive assistance from the elves of Mirkwood, and together Thranduil and the able-bodied men of Lake-town travel to the Lonely Mountain to claim a share of the dragon hoard. In the absence of Thorin Oakenshield and his company, all believed to have been killed by the dragon, Bard has a rightful claim to the treasure as the heir of Girion, and also a charitable claim to alleviate the suffering of the people of Lake-town.

However, at the Lonely Mountain, Bard discovers that Thorin Oakenshield, King under the Mountain, is very much alive, along with all his companions. Their response to Bard&#x27;s claim is to barricade themselves inside the mountain, refusing to surrender any of the treasure under threat of war. To break the stalemate, Bilbo Baggins slips out of the mountain at night and offers the Arkenstone to Bard in order to put pressure on Thorin to make peace with the Elves and Men. However, Thorin is unwilling to share any of Smaug&#x27;s treasure with an armed host at his gates, which causes the elves and men to prepare to besiege the mountain. To make matters worse, Thorin&#x27;s cousin Dáin II Ironfoot arrives to reinforce Thorin&#x27;s claim to their family home under the mountain. However, a large army of Goblins and Wargs arrives on the scene, forcing the three armies to unite to fight against them. Bard leads the men into battle, reinforced by the arrival of Beorn and the Eagles.

After the death of Thorin in the Battle of Five Armies, Dain becomes King under the Mountain. He redeems the Arkenstone from Bard with a fourteenth of the treasure, which is used to re-establish Dale. Over the next three years, Bard rebuilds the city of Dale and becomes its ruler. The city begins to prosper again. Bard&#x27;s reign lasts for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Bain. His grandson, Brand, fought alongside Dain II Ironfoot in the Battle of Dale against a horde of Sauron&#x27;s Easterling invaders during the War of the Ring.

==Creation==
During the drafting of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien considered how Smaug should die and who would kill him. Tolkien&#x27;s notes for chapter nine show him considering the option of Bilbo killing the dragon in his sleep, piercing his weak point with a lance, similar to the events in Jack the Giant Killer. This idea remained in his notes after the writing of chapter eleven, but once chapter twelve was complete, Tolkien penned &quot;Dragon killed in the Battle of the Lake&quot; in the margin of his notes.

Bard appears during the drafting for chapter thirteen, when it is said that he kills the dragon with his ancestor Girion&#x27;s favourite Black Arrow. Tolkien&#x27;s keeping Bard alive for the rest of the story significantly complicates it since, as the heir of Girion, Bard gives the inhabitants of Lake-town a legitimate claim to Smaug&#x27;s treasure.

==Analysis==

According to John D. Rateliff, Bard may have been inspired by Wiglaf in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, which inspired Tolkien with many elements in the final chapters of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Like Bard, Wiglaf is introduced late into the story, is not named until late in the story, is the only one with enough courage to face a dragon and is of royal lineage. Rateliff believes that Bard is the first human character in Tolkien&#x27;s work to experience a happy fate, unlike Beren, Húrin and Túrin Turambar. Rateliff sees Bard as a precursor and foreshadower of Aragorn: both restore their ancestor&#x27;s kingdoms in all their glory.

Marjorie Burns believes that Bard is a humble hero like Aragorn, Faramir and Gandalf, all brought into Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium to replace the powerful unworthy, such as the mayor of Lake-town, Denethor, Boromir and Saruman. In his initial appearance, Bard is shown as a negative character who always sees the worst side of situations, but Sumner G. Hunnewell believes that Bard shows happiness and generosity after the destruction of Lake-town.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

In the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated television musical, Bard was voiced by John Stephenson. 

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, Welsh actor Luke Evans portrays Bard, appearing in the latter two films of the trilogy, &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014). Evans was cast in June 2011. Bob Strauss of &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; felt that Evans&#x27; portrayal managed to expand on the character, while Erik Kain of &quot;Forbes&quot; felt that his portrayal was &quot;solid&quot;, but was &quot;never given quite enough breathing room&quot;.

===Other===

In the 1968 BBC Radio adaptation, Bard was voiced by Peter Williams.

Bard is one of the cards in Iron Crown Enterprises&#x27;s 1995 Middle-earth Collectible Card Game, which is illustrated by Angelo Montanini.

<text>Smaug () is a dragon and the main antagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, his treasure and the mountain he lives in being the goal of the quest. Powerful and fearsome, he invaded the Dwarf kingdom of Erebor 171 years prior to the events described in the novel. A group of thirteen dwarves mounted a quest to take the kingdom back, aided by the wizard Gandalf and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin describes Smaug as &quot;a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm&quot;.

Critics have identified close parallels with what they presume are sources of Tolkien&#x27;s inspiration, including the dragon in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, who is provoked by the stealing of a precious cup, and the speaking dragon Fafnir, who proposes a betrayal to Sigurd. A further source may be Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1855 poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, where Megissogwon, the spirit of wealth, is protected by an armoured shirt, but whose one weak spot is revealed by a talking bird. Commentators have noted Smaug&#x27;s devious, vain, and proud character, and his aggressively polite way of speaking, like the British upper class.

Smaug was voiced and interpreted with performance capture by Benedict Cumberbatch in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

== Story ==

Dragons lived in the Withered Heath beyond the Grey Mountains. Smaug was &quot;the greatest of the dragons of his day&quot;, already centuries old at the time he was first recorded. He heard rumours of the great wealth of the Dwarf-kingdom of Erebor, which had a prosperous trade with the Northmen of Dale. Smaug &quot;arose and without warning came against King Thrór and descended on the mountain in flames&quot;. After driving the Dwarves out of their stronghold, Smaug occupied the interior of the mountain for the next 150 years, guarding a vast hoard of treasure. He destroyed the town of Dale; the Men retreated to the Long Lake, where they built Lake-town of houses on stilts, surrounded by water to guard against the dragon.

Gandalf realized that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron. He therefore agreed to assist a party of Dwarves, led by Thrór&#x27;s grandson Thorin Oakenshield, who set out to recapture the mountain and kill the dragon. Assuming that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a Hobbit, Gandalf recruited Bilbo Baggins to join the quest.

Upon reaching Erebor, the Dwarves sent Bilbo into Smaug&#x27;s lair, and he was initially successful in stealing a beautiful golden cup as Smaug slept. Knowing the contents of the treasure hoard to the ounce, Smaug quickly realized the cup&#x27;s absence upon awakening and searched for the thief on the Mountain. Unsuccessful, he returned to his hoard to lie in wait. The Dwarves sent Bilbo down the secret tunnel a second time. Smaug sensed Bilbo&#x27;s presence immediately, even though Bilbo had rendered himself invisible with the One Ring, and accused the Hobbit (correctly) of trying to steal from him. During his discourse with the dragon, Bilbo noticed a small bare patch on Smaug&#x27;s jewel-encrusted underbelly, and narrowly escaped. A thrush overheard Bilbo&#x27;s account of the meeting, and learnt of the bare patch on Smaug&#x27;s underside.

Still enraged, Smaug flew south to Lake-town and set about destroying it. The townsmen&#x27;s arrows and spears proved useless against the dragon&#x27;s armoured body. The thrush told Bard the Bowman of Smaug&#x27;s one weak spot, a bare patch on the dragon&#x27;s belly. With his last arrow, Bard killed Smaug by shooting into this place.

==Analysis==

===Character===
Tolkien made Smaug &quot;more villain than monster&quot;, writes the author and biographer Lynnette Porter; he is &quot;devious and clever, vain and greedy, overly confident and proud.&quot; The fantasy author Sandra Unerman called Smaug &quot;one of the most individual dragons in fiction&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Anne Petty said that &quot;it was love at first sight&quot;, describing Smaug as &quot;frightening, but surprisingly knowable&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes the &quot;bewilderment&quot; that Smaug spreads: he is enchanted by gold and treasure, and those who come into contact with his powerful presence, what Tolkien describes as &quot;the effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced&quot;, similarly become bewildered by greed. In Shippey&#x27;s view, however, the most surprising aspect of Smaug&#x27;s character is &quot;his oddly circumlocutory mode of speech. He speaks in fact with the characteristic aggressive politeness of the British upper class, in which irritation and authority are in direct proportion to apparent deference or uncertainty.&quot; In sharp contrast to this is his vanity in response to flattery, rolling over &quot;absurdly pleased&quot; as Tolkien narrates, to reveal his marvellously armoured belly. Shippey comments that such paradoxes, &quot;the oscillations between animal and intelligent behaviour, the contrast between creaking politeness and plain gloating over murder&quot; join to create Smaug&#x27;s principal attribute, &quot;wiliness&quot;.

The Christian commentator Joseph Pearce describes Smaug&#x27;s weak spot as his Achilles heel, noting his boastful over-confidence in his own indestructibility, and seeing in the fact that the vulnerability is over his heart a sign that &quot;it is the wickedness of his heart which will lead to his downfall&quot;. Pearce likens Smaug&#x27;s pride to that of Achilles, whose pride leads to the death of his best friend, and of many Greeks; and to the cockerel Chauntecleer in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot;, where a boastful reply to the flattering fox causes the cockerel&#x27;s fall.

===The &quot;Beowulf&quot; dragon===
From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was a professor of English Literature at Oxford University. He was a prominent scholar of the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, on which he gave a lecture at the British Academy in 1936. He described the poem as one of his &quot;most valued sources&quot; for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Many of Smaug&#x27;s attributes and behaviour in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; derive directly from the unnamed &quot;old night-ravager&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;: great age; winged, fiery, and reptilian form; a stolen barrow within which he lies on his hoard; disturbance by a theft; and violent revenge on the lands all about, flying and attacking at night.

The scholars of English literature Stuart D. Lee and Elizabeth Solopova analyse the parallels between Smaug and the unnamed &quot;Beowulf&quot; dragon.

=== Fafnir ===


Smaug&#x27;s ability to speak, the use of riddles, the element of betrayal, his enemy&#x27;s communication via birds, and his weak spot could all have been inspired by the talking dragon Fafnir of the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. Shippey identified several points of similarity between Smaug and Fafnir.

=== Old English spell ===

Tolkien noted, in a joking letter that he was surprised to see published in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1938, that &quot;the dragon bears as name—a pseudonym—the past tense of the primitive Germanic verb &quot;smúgan&quot;, to squeeze through a hole: a low philological jest.&quot; Critics have explored what that jest might have been; an 11th-century medical text &quot;Lacnunga&quot; (&quot;Remedies&quot;) contains the Old English phrase &quot;wid smeogan wyrme&quot;, &quot;against a penetrating worm&quot; in a spell, which could also be translated &quot;against a crafty dragon&quot;. The Old English verb meant &quot;to examine, to think out, to scrutinise&quot;, implying &quot;subtle, crafty&quot;. Shippey comments that it is &quot;appropriate&quot; that Smaug has &quot;the most sophisticated intelligence&quot; in the book. All the same, Shippey notes, Tolkien has chosen the Old Norse verb &quot;smjúga&quot;, past tense &quot;smaug&quot;, rather than the Old English &quot;sméogan&quot;, past tense &quot;smeah&quot;—possibly, he suggests, because his enemies were Norse dwarves.

===&quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;===

Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth notes the similarity between Smaug&#x27;s death from Bard&#x27;s last arrow and the death of Megissogwon in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1855 poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. Megissogwon was the spirit of wealth, protected by an armoured shirt of wampum beads. Hiawatha shoots in vain, until he has only three arrows left. Mama the woodpecker sings to Hiawatha where Megissogwon&#x27;s only weak point is, the tuft of hair on his head, just as Tolkien&#x27;s thrush tells Bard where to shoot at Smaug.

== Illustrations ==

Tolkien created numerous pencil sketches and two pieces of more detailed artwork portraying Smaug. The latter were a detailed ink and watercolour labelled &quot;Conversation with Smaug&quot; and a rough coloured pencil and ink sketch entitled &quot;Death of Smaug&quot;. While neither of these appeared in the original printing of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; due to cost constraints, both have been included in subsequent editions, particularly &quot;Conversation with Smaug&quot;. &quot;Death of Smaug&quot; was used for the cover of a UK paperback edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Animated films ===

A dragon named &#x27;Slag&#x27; features in Gene Deitch&#x27;s brief 1967 animated film. 

Francis de Wolff voiced the red dragon in the long-lost 1968 BBC radio dramatization. 

Richard Boone voiced Smaug in the 1977 animated film by Rankin/Bass. Austin Gilkeson calls the film&#x27;s depiction of Smaug &quot;distinctly feline&quot; as he has cat-like eyes and whiskers &quot;and a lush mane&quot;. Gilkeson comments that the result does not resemble Western dragons, but that it works well, not least because Smaug&#x27;s nature as an &quot;intelligent, deadly, greedy&quot; and lazy predator is in his view &quot;very cat-like&quot;.

=== &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (film series) ===
Smaug was voiced and interpreted with performance capture by Benedict Cumberbatch in Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. From the motion capture, Smaug&#x27;s design was created with key frame animation. Weta Digital employed its proprietary &quot;Tissue&quot; software, which was honoured in 2013 with a &quot;Scientific and Engineering Award&quot; from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to make the dragon as realistic as possible. In addition, Weta Digital supervisor Joe Letteri said in an interview for &quot;USA Today&quot; that they used classic European and Asian dragons as inspirations to create Smaug. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; stated that Cumberbatch had &quot;the authority to make of Smaug a cunning nemesis&quot;.

In the first film, &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the audience sees only his legs, wings, and tail, and his eye; the eye is showcased in the final scene of the film. Smaug is a topic of discussion among the White Council as Gandalf&#x27;s reason to support Thorin Oakenshield&#x27;s quest. 

Smaug appears in the second film, &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot;. In an interview with Joe Letteri, Smaug&#x27;s design was changed to the wyvern-like form shown in the film after the crew saw how Benedict Cumberbatch performed Smaug while moving around on all four limbs.

In &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;, Smaug attacks Lake-town. He is killed by Bard with a black arrow and his body falls on the boat carrying the fleeing Master of Lake-town. It is later revealed that Smaug&#x27;s attack on Erebor was all part of Sauron&#x27;s design, meaning that Smaug and Sauron were in league with each other.

Smaug was considered one of the highlights of the second film of the series; several critics hailed him as cinema&#x27;s greatest dragon. Critics also praised the visual effects company Weta Digital and Cumberbatch&#x27;s vocal and motion-capture performance for giving Smaug a fully realized personality, &quot;hiss[ing] out his words with cold-blooded vitriol&quot;.

=== Video games ===
In the 2014 video game &quot;Lego The Hobbit&quot;, the portrayal departs more from the book; rather than ever more closely simulating the book&#x27;s characters, the scholar Carol L. Robinson notes, the technology has allowed new fiction to be created.

== In culture ==

In 2012, Smaug&#x27;s wealth was estimated at $61 billion, placing him in the Forbes Fictional 15.

In 2011, scientists named a genus of southern African girdled lizards, &quot;Smaug&quot;. The lizards were so named after the fictional dragon for being armoured, dwelling underground, and native to Tolkien&#x27;s birthplace, Bloemfontein. In 2015, a new species of shield bug was named &quot;Planois smaug&quot;, because of its size and its status &quot;sleeping&quot; in the researcher&#x27;s collections for about 60 years until it was discovered.

<doc id="58102" wikidata="Q1750830" url="?curid=58102" title="Beorn">
<text>Beorn is a character created by J. R. R. Tolkien, and part of his Middle-earth legendarium. He appears in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a &quot;skin-changer&quot;, a man who could assume the form of a great black bear. His descendants or kinsmen, a group of Men known as the Beornings, dwell in the upper Vales of Anduin, between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains, and are counted among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who oppose Sauron&#x27;s forces during the War of the Ring. Like the powerful medieval heroes Beowulf and Bödvar Bjarki, whose names both mean &quot;bear&quot;, he exemplifies the Northern courage that Tolkien made a central virtue in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

== Appearances ==

Beorn lives in a wooden house on his pasture-lands between the Misty Mountains and Mirkwood, to the east of the Anduin. His household includes an animal retinue (with horses, dogs, sheep, and cows); according to Gandalf, Beorn does not eat his cattle, nor hunt wild animals. He grows large areas of clover for his bees. Gandalf believes that Beorn is either a descendant of the bears who had lived in the Misty Mountains before the arrival of the giants, or a descendant of the men who had lived in the region before the arrival of the dragons or Orcs from the north.

He is of immense size and strength for a man and retains these attributes in bear-form. He has black hair (in either form) and a thick black beard and broad shoulders. While not a &quot;giant&quot; outright, Beorn&#x27;s human form is of such great size that the three and a half foot tall Bilbo judges that he could have easily walked between Beorn&#x27;s legs without touching his body. When Bilbo meets him, Beorn has &quot;great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles&quot;, and wears &quot;a tunic of wool down to his knees.&quot; Beorn names the large rock by the River Anduin the Carrock; he had created the steps that led from its base to its flat top.

Beorn receives Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins and thirteen Dwarves and aids them in their quest to reclaim their kingdom beneath the Lonely Mountain. He is convinced of their trustworthiness after going out and confirming their tale of encountering the Goblins of the Misty Mountains and Gandalf&#x27;s slaying of their leader, the Great Goblin. As well as giving the group much-needed supplies and lodging, Beorn provides them with vital information about what path to take while crossing Mirkwood.

Later, hearing of a vast host of Goblins on the move, Beorn arrives at the Lonely Mountain in time to strike the decisive blow in the Battle of Five Armies. In his bear form he kills the Goblin leader, Bolg, and his bodyguards. Without direction, the Goblin army is scattered, forming easy pickings for the other armies of Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Eagles. Beorn often leaves his home for hours or days at a time, for purposes not completely explained. It is said that &quot;Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear&#x27;s shape and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength.&quot;

In the years between the Battle of Five Armies and the War of the Ring, Beorn emerges to become a leader of the woodmen living between the Anduin river and the fringes of Mirkwood. As stated by Glóin in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the Beornings &quot;keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock.&quot; In the events leading up to the War of the Ring, the Beornings assist Aragorn, who was taking Gollum to Mirkwood so that Gandalf could find out what Gollum knew about the One Ring, to cross the Anduin.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Bear-like warrior ===


In naming his character, Tolkien used &quot;beorn&quot;, an Old English word for &quot;man&quot; and &quot;warrior&quot; (with implications of &quot;freeman&quot; and &quot;nobleman&quot; in Anglo-Saxon society). The name is cognate with the Scandinavian &quot;Björn&quot; or Bjørn, meaning &quot;bear&quot;; and the figure of Beorn can be related to the traditional Northern heroes Bödvar Bjarki and Beowulf, both of whose names also mean &quot;bear&quot;. The name Beorn survives in the name of the Scottish town Borrowstounness, which is derived from the Old English &quot;Beornweardstun&quot; (&quot;the town with Beorn as its guardian&quot;). The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that Beorn exemplifies the heroic Northern courage that Tolkien later made a central virtue in his larger novel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, as he is ferocious, rude, and cheerful, characteristics that reflect his huge inner self-confidence. 

Paul W. Lewis, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, calls Beorn &quot;essentially a berserker in battle&quot;, alluding to the Old Norse warriors who fought in a trance-like state of fury. The term means &quot;bear-shirt&quot;; its Old Norse form, &quot;hamrammr&quot;, was taken by Tolkien to mean &quot;skin-changer&quot;, and he gave Beorn this capability.

=== Distinctive loner ===

Beorn&#x27;s name for the large rock in the River Anduin, the Carrock, on the other hand, is not Germanic – whether Norse or English – but Brittonic, related to Welsh &quot;&quot;, &quot;a stone&quot;. The medievalist Marjorie Burns notes the tension between &quot;British&quot; and Norse in Tolkien&#x27;s handling of his materials. This is one of many instances of what Clyde S. Kilby called &quot;contrasistency&quot; – Tolkien&#x27;s apparently intentional &quot;doubleness&quot; or switching between opposite viewpoints. Burns comments that Beorn&#x27;s story and character embody tensions &quot;between forest and garden, home and wayside, comradeship and solitude, risk and security&quot; and in her view most strongly between &quot;freedom and obligation&quot;, not to mention bear and man. Burns calls Beorn one of

The Tolkien scholar Justin Noetzel compares Beorn to Tom Bombadil in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, another one-of-a-kind figure strongly attached to the place where he lives. Both have &quot;an intimate connection with the natural world&quot;, using this to help their visitors, protecting them from local dangers, whether wolves and goblins, or Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wight.

=== Norse and English ===

Burns writes that Beorn&#x27;s character, too, contains a complex tension between Norse and English. As a skin-changer he is evidently pagan and Norse; but his vegetarianism, reluctance to use metal, home-loving nature and flower garden all look more compatible with Christianity and Englishness, without being those things specifically. Burns comments that he is thus

Burns states that this blending of wild Norse with civilised English can be seen in Middle English literature such as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Gawain meets a big rugged Beorn-like shape-changer, Bertilak (the Green Knight), who lives in a castle in an oak forest, and speaks with Christian courtesy. She calls &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;″s oaks &quot;entirely druidic&quot;, suggesting Celtic mythology or Arthurian legend. But she notes that &quot;the oak was sacred to [the Norse god] Thor&quot;, allowing Tolkien to assemble Celtic and Norse elements in his composite Middle-earth. Further, she writes, Beorn&#x27;s home has an almost diagrammatic set of circles of &quot;mixed English and Nordic characteristics&quot;: at the centre the Nordic hall; the &quot;Shire-like flower garden&quot; and courtyard; a wider yard (Norse &quot;gaard&quot;) with its outbuildings; a &quot;high thorn-hedge&quot; in English style; a &quot;belt of tall and very ancient oaks&quot; (English or Norse) and fields of flowers; little English-like hills and valleys with oaks and elms; &quot;wide grass-lands, and a river running through it all&quot;, which remind Burns of Iceland; and finally &quot;the mountains&quot;, evidently Norse.

==Adaptations==

=== Film ===
The Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt portrays Beorn in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot; and in its sequel &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies.&quot; In the DVD commentary, the production team explain that they normally ensured that all characters had accents from the British Isles, but they made an exception for Beorn by letting Persbrandt use his natural Swedish accent. They reasoned that Beorn should have a distinctive and foreign-sounding accent, since he is the last survivor of an isolated race. Jackson stated that many actors were auditioned for the role, but that Persbrandt captured Beorn&#x27;s primitive energy. Richard Armitage, who played Thorin Oakenshield, said that Persbrandt had a fantastic voice, and that his accent was perfect for the role.

=== Games ===

In the 2003 video game adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the original encounter with Beorn at his lodge is omitted. Nevertheless, he shows up at the Battle of Five Armies to kill Bolg. Beorn only appears in bear form in the game.

The Beornings appear as trainable units in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring&quot; (2003). The Beornings were added as a playable class to the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; in Update 15 (November 2014). One can play as a male or a female Beorning, and can transform into a bear after building up sufficient wrath during combat. Grimbeorn&#x27;s Lodge in the Vales of Anduin is a starter area for the Beorning class, and Grimbeorn makes a brief appearance.

==History==

===Early history and settlement===
The earliest known inhabitants of the area that would become Montgomery County were the Mound Builders, Native Americans who built large earthen mounds, two of which were assumed to have been constructed in southeastern Franklin Township. However, research in the 1990s determined that those mounds were probably natural rather than human-made formations. Subsequent Native American tribes occupied the area until as late as 1832.

The first white settler in the area was William Offield, earlier of Tennessee, who arrived in 1821 with his wife Jennie (née Laughlin) and one child and settled near the confluence of Offield Creek and Sugar Creek, about southwest of present Crawfordsville. The first land in the county to be purchased from the government was a tract in Scott Township sold to John Loop on July 23, 1822; many more tracts were entered in subsequent months, most in Union Township. The area&#x27;s settlers mostly came from Kentucky and Ohio, with others arriving from Tennessee, Virginia and the Carolinas.

Montgomery County was established by an act of the Indiana state legislature passed on December 21, 1822, which defined the county&#x27;s boundaries and provided for the organization of its government. It was formed from parts of Wabash New Purchase attached to Parke and Putnam Counties. The county was named for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed on December 31, 1775, while attempting to capture Quebec City in the Battle of Quebec. The first county election was held on March 1, 1823, with 61 voters participating to elect the first three county commissioners — William Offield, James Blevins and John McCollough — who then ordered that the first jail and courthouse be built.

Beginning on December 24, 1824, a large land sale was held for several days at the United States Land Office on Crawfordville&#x27;s North Water Street, during which a large number of the area&#x27;s tracts were sold at auction. The money raised from the sale, mostly in the form of gold and silver, was packed into kegs, hauled by wagon to Louisville, carried by boat up the Ohio River, and eventually to Washington, D.C. Settlement increased substantially during the subsequent year.

===Courthouses===
Montgomery County&#x27;s first courthouse was ordered on June 28, 1823, to be made &quot;of good hewed logs... to be twenty-six feet long; two stories high, lower story nine feet from floor to joist; upper to be seven feet to roof&quot;. Eliakam Ashton won the contract to construct the building on Crawfordville&#x27;s Main Street; he finished it in August 1824 at a cost of $295. In 1825 a contract was issued to Henry Ristine to cut trees and pick up chips from under the courthouse so that &quot;hogs would not find a comfortable place in which to make their beds&quot;.

A more substantial structure was ordered in 1831, the contract for its construction being awarded to John Hughes for $3,420. The result was completed in 1833, a two-story, 40x40 foot brick building surmounted by a cupola, later supplemented by separate one-story buildings erected to the north and east as wings of the main structure. The building stood on the current public square until 1875, when it was removed.

The third and current Montgomery County courthouse was the first courthouse designed by George W. Bunting of Indianapolis; it is one of six of his Indiana courthouses still standing. Bunting had served as a colonel in the Confederacy during the Civil War before establishing himself in Indianapolis; General Lew Wallace, who was on the Union side during the War and was a resident of Montgomery County, spoke at the dedication of the cornerstone in 1875. The building was constructed by McCormack and Sweeney of Columbus, Indiana at a cost of $150,000, and was completed in 1876.

The cornerstone contains an embedded copper box of memorable items, including the key to the old courthouse and a Henry VIII coin.

The county council, the legislative branch of the county government, controls spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms and are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes and service taxes.

The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners execute the county&#x27;s legislative acts, collecting revenue and managing the county&#x27;s government.

The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.

The county has other elected offices including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor and circuit court clerk. Each is elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and be residents of the county.

Each township has a trustee who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.

Montgomery County is part of Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district; Indiana Senate district 23; and Indiana House of Representatives districts 28 and 41.

<text>Montgomery County is a rural county located in the southern Piedmont of the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,751. Its county seat is Troy.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area eventually comprising Montgomery County were Keyauwee and Cheraw Native Americans. The first European settlers were German and Scottish.

Montgomery County was created in 1779 out of Anson County. It was named in honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada. The law establishing the county also directed a group of commissioners to secure land near the center of the county for the construction of a country courthouse and prison. Many residents were dissatisfied with the location chosen, and after several years of demurring on a decision, a courthouse was erected in the community of Henderson, created at the confluence of the Yadkin and Uwharrie rivers in 1794. In 1816, the old courthouse was sold another was erected at the new community of Laurenceville. In 1841, the portion of Montgomery County west of the Yadkin/Pee Dee River became Stanly County. Two years later, commissioners were selected to move the courthouse to Montgomery&#x27;s geographic center, and in 1844 Troy was established as the county seat.

The county&#x27;s first paved roads were established in the 1920s. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, had a large adverse impact on the local agricultural and manufacturing industries. By 1933, 30 percent of local residents were unemployed.

<text>Montgomery County, colloquially referred to as Montco, is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population of the county was 856,553, making it the third-most populous county in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, also the most populous county in Pennsylvania without a major city. The county is part of the Southeast Pennsylvania region of the state.

The county seat and largest city is Norristown. The county is part of the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington PA-NJ–DE–MD metropolitan statistical area, known as the Delaware Valley, and marks the Delaware Valley&#x27;s northern border with the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. 

The county borders Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city, to its southeast, Bucks County to its east, Berks and Lehigh counties to its north, Delaware County to its south, and Chester County to its southwest.

The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire, which was named after one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie, since it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which was land and (0.9%) of which was water.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 census, the county was 73.27% White (72.18% White, non-Hispanic), 9.55% Black or African American, 0.22% Native American or Alaskan Native, 7.94% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, and 2.87% some other race; 6.13% were two or more races. 6.36% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

== Economy ==
Montgomery County is a suburb of Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth most populous city. Many Montco residents work in the city, but the county is also a major employment center with large business parks in Blue Bell, Lansdale, Fort Washington, Horsham, and King of Prussia attracting thousands of workers from all over the region. The strong job base and taxes generated by those jobs have resulted in Montgomery County receiving the highest credit rating of &#x27;AAA&#x27; from Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, one of fewer than 30 counties in the United States with such a rating. In 2012, Moody&#x27;s downgraded the general obligation rating to Aa1, and in 2018 the rating was revised back to Aaa.

Montgomery County historically was a stronghold for the Republican Party. The county was the only one carried by Barbara Hafer in the 1990 gubernatorial election over the incumbent governor, Bob Casey. However, the Democratic Party has made substantial gains in the county over the last quarter-century and gained the registration edge early in 2008. 

Like neighboring Bucks County, the county voted Democratic during the Civil War era, voting Democratic between 1856 and 1876, except in 1860 and 1872. Like most of Philadelphia&#x27;s suburbs, the brand of Republicanism practiced in Montgomery County for much of the 20th century was moderate. As the national parties have polarized, the county&#x27;s voters have increasingly supported Democrats at the national level. The county voted for the Republican presidential nominee in all but two elections from 1880 to 1988, that being in 1892 and 1964. However, Montgomery County residents have voted for the Democratic presidential nominee since 1992, with the margins progressively increasing between every election, except in 2012. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden became the first Democrat to obtain over 60% of the county&#x27;s vote.

Despite Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the state of Pennsylvania in the 2016 presidential election, Montgomery County was one of the few counties in Pennsylvania that swung in the Democratic presidential candidates&#x27; direction with Hillary Clinton winning Montgomery County with 58.87% of the vote, an improvement from Barack Obama&#x27;s 56.6% vote share in 2012. In the 2016 U.S. Senate and Pennsylvania Attorney General elections, Montgomery County voted for Katie McGinty and Josh Shapiro, both Democrats.

Most county-level offices were held by Republicans until after the 2007 election, when Democrats picked up control of five row offices. Democrats have also won several elections in the Pennsylvania General Assembly in recent years, including two GOP-leaning State House districts in 2004, the 148th with Mike Gerber and the 153rd with current Governor Josh Shapiro. Today, although the county is very Democratic at the national level, at the state and local level, it is not specifically partisan.

In the 2004 United States Senate election, Republican Arlen Specter won the county over Montco resident Joe Hoeffel, but Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. out-polled Rick Santorum in the 2006 Senate election. In 2006, Democrat Rick Taylor unseated incumbent Republican Eugene McGill in the 151st, although Taylor lost in 2010 to Republican Todd Stephens and, in 2008, Democrat Matthew Bradford unseated incumbent Republican Jay Moyer in the 70th. Six of the county&#x27;s 12 state house seats and four of the county&#x27;s eight senate seats are now held by Democrats. All four statewide Democratic candidates carried Montgomery in 2008, with Barack Obama receiving 60% of the county&#x27;s vote. Barack Obama won Montgomery County in 2008 and 2012.














==Government==
Montgomery County is governed by a three-person county commission. The current composition is two Democrats and one Republican. By law, the county commission must have one member of a minority party represented.

====Same-sex marriage====
On July 24, 2013, Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes, a Democrat, announced he would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, flouting Pennsylvania law banning such unions. Hanes called the commonwealth&#x27;s ban &quot;arbitrary and suspect&quot;, saying he believes it violates the Pennsylvania Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Republican administration of Governor Tom Corbett filed suit in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in an attempt to block Hanes from licensing same-sex marriage. Commonwealth Court Judge Dan Pellegrini ordered Hanes in September 2013 to stop issuing same-sex marriage licenses. After Federal Judge John Jones threw out Pennsylvania&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage in May 2014, calling it unconstitutional, offices in other counties were able to issue these licenses, while Hanes had to wait for the ruling against him to be removed.

<text>In the philologist and fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth fiction, a warg is a particularly large and evil kind of wolf that could be ridden by orcs. He derived the name and characteristics of his wargs by combining meanings and myths from Old Norse and Old English. In Norse mythology, a &quot;vargr&quot; (anglicised as warg) is a wolf, especially the wolf Fenrir that destroyed the god Odin in the battle of Ragnarök, and the wolves Sköll and Hati, Fenrir&#x27;s children, who perpetually chase the Sun and Moon. In Old English, a &quot;wearh&quot; is an outcast who may be strangled to death.

Through Tolkien&#x27;s influence, wargs have featured in fantasy books by authors including George R. R. Martin, and in media such as video games and role-playing games.

== Etymology and origins ==

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey states that Tolkien&#x27;s spelling &quot;warg&quot; is a cross of Old Norse &quot;&quot; and Old English &quot;&quot;. He notes that the words embody a shift in meaning from &quot;wolf&quot; to &quot;outlaw&quot;: &quot;vargr&quot; carries both meanings, while &quot;wearh&quot; means &quot;outcast&quot; or &quot;outlaw&quot;, but has lost the sense of &quot;wolf&quot;. 
In Old Norse, &quot;vargr&quot; is derived from the Proto-Germanic root reconstructed as &quot;*&quot;, ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root reconstructed as &quot;*werg̑ʰ-&quot; &quot;destroy&quot;. &quot;Vargr&quot; (compare modern Swedish &quot;&quot; &quot;wolf&quot;) arose as a non-taboo name for &quot;&quot;, the normal Old Norse term for &quot;wolf&quot;. 
Shippey adds that there is also an Old English verb, &quot;&quot;, meaning both &quot;to condemn [an outcast]&quot; and &quot;to strangle [an outcast to death]&quot;; he adds that a possible further sense is &quot;to [a sheep], to bite to death&quot;. He writes that 

In Norse mythology, wargs are in particular the mythological wolves Fenrir, Sköll and Hati. Sköll and Hati are wolves, one going after the Sun, the other after the Moon. Wolves served as mounts for more or less dangerous humanoid creatures. For instance, &quot;Gunnr&#x27;s horse&quot; was a kenning for &quot;wolf&quot; on the Rök runestone. In the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot;, the eponymous seeress rides a wolf. To Baldr&#x27;s funeral, the jötunn Hyrrokkin arrived on a wolf.

The medievalist and Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns writes that Tolkien uses the fact that wolves were among the Norse god Odin&#x27;s war beasts &quot;in a particularly innovative way&quot;. Odin kept two wolves, Freki and Geri, their names both meaning &quot;Greedy&quot;; and in the final battle that destroys the world, Ragnarök, Odin is killed and eaten by the gigantic wolf Fenrir. Thus, Burns points out, wolves were both associates of Odin, and his mortal enemy. She argues that Tolkien made use of both relationships in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In her view, both the dark lord Sauron and the evil Wizard Saruman embody &quot;attributes of a negative Odin&quot;. She points out that Saruman has wargs in his army, while Sauron uses &quot;the likeness of a ravening wolf&quot; for the enormous battering ram named Grond which destroys the main gate of Minas Tirith. On the other side, the benevolent Wizard Gandalf leads the fight against the wargs in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, using his ability to create fire, and understands their language. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Gandalf again uses magic and fire to drive off a great wolf, &quot;The Hound of Sauron&quot;, and his wolf-pack; Burns writes that the wolves&#x27; attempt &quot;to devour Gandalf hints at Odin&#x27;s fate&quot;, recalling the myth of Fenrir and Odin.

== J. R. R. Tolkien ==


In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s books about Middle-earth, wargs are a malevolent wolf-like race. They are usually in league with the Orcs whom they permit to ride on their backs into battle, sharing any spoils. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, they can speak: they plan their part in &quot;a great goblin-raid&quot; on the woodmen&#x27;s villages.

Tolkien&#x27;s wargs influenced the ten-year-old Rayner Unwin to write a positive review of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, with the words &quot;Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hobbit hole and &quot;never&quot; went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very ex[c]iting time fighting goblins and wargs.&quot; The review led his father, Stanley Unwin, to publish the book, still doubting its likely commercial success.

Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; extend the role of wargs as mounts for Orcs, battling the horse-riders of Rohan.

The critic Gregory Hartley treats wargs as &quot;personified animals&quot;, along with the sentient eagles, giant spiders, Smaug the dragon, ravens and thrushes. Tolkien writes about their actions using verbs like &quot;[to] plan&quot; and &quot;[to] guard&quot;, implying in Hartley&#x27;s view that the monstrous wargs are &quot;more than mere beasts&quot;, but he denies that they &quot;possess autonomous wills&quot;. T. A. Leederman calls Tolkien&#x27;s wargs &quot;a species of semi-intelligent but evil-aligned mount wolves ... on whom the orcs rode into battle&quot;. He notes that they may have been derived, in the fiction, from First Age werewolves like Carcharoth, with their own &quot;proto-language&quot;.&#x27;

== Other authors and media ==
In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s series of epic fantasy novels, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, and the series&#x27; television adaptation, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Wargs are skinchangers who can enter the mind of animals (and in Bran Stark&#x27;s case with Hodor, a person), see what they are seeing, and control their actions. In Wen Spencer&#x27;s Tinker (Elfhome) series, wargs are large magically engineered wolves.
Similar Tolkien-based creatures appear in a number of fantasy video games, including &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, &quot;Age of Conan&quot;, and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, both as four-legged monsters, and as a race of anthropomorphic werewolves, the Worgen.

<text>Montgomery County is a county located in the Valley and Ridge area of the U.S. state of Virginia. As population in the area increased, Montgomery County was formed in 1777 from Fincastle County, which in turn had been taken from Botetourt County. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 99,721. Its county seat is Christiansburg, and Blacksburg is the largest town. Montgomery County is part of the Blacksburg-Christiansburg metropolitan area. It is dominated economically by the presence of Virginia Tech, Virginia&#x27;s third largest public university, which is the county&#x27;s largest employer.

== Board of Supervisors ==
The Montgomery County Board of Supervisors sets the annual budget and tax rates, enacts legislation governing the county and its citizens, sets policies and oversees their implementation. There are seven supervisors; one is elected from each of the seven geographic districts. Terms are four years; three or four seats are up for re-election each odd year.

==History==
Montgomery County was established on December 31, 1776, made from parts of Fincastle County, which was disbanded at this time and split into Montgomery, Washington, and Kentucky counties. Later, Montgomery lost land to form counties which now border it, including some counties which later formed West Virginia.

The county is named for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. The western part of the county is in the New River watershed. Montgomery County is one of the 423 counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and it is identified as part of &quot;Greater Appalachia&quot; by Colin Woodard in his book &quot;American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America&quot;.

==Politics==
Despite being in the Solid South, Montgomery County did not consistently back Democratic candidates in the 20th century, being consistently Republican due to Unionist sentiment in the area during the Civil War, though the presence of a major university in Virginia Tech helped make the county more competitive to the Democratic Party towards the end of that streak. 

It was a bellwether county, backing the national winner in every election from 1980 to 2008. The county backed the losing candidate, by a very narrow margin of 103 votes in 2012. It voted against Republican Donald Trump in all three of his runs.

<text>Montgomery County is a county located in the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, its population was 228,954, making it the seventh-most populous county in Alabama. Its county seat is Montgomery, the state capital. Montgomery County is included in the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Montgomery County was established by dividing Monroe County on December 6, 1816, by the Mississippi Territorial Legislature. It is named for Lemuel P. Montgomery, a young U.S. Army officer killed at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, the final battle of the Creek Indian war, which was waged concurrently with the War of 1812.

The city of Montgomery, which is the county seat, is named for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada.

Over much of the 19th century great wealth was derived from the cotton crop, with the Civil War producing a temporary setback. More lasting trouble came in 1914 with the arrival of the boll weevil, which became very destructive to the cotton harvest from 1915 on. By the 1940s county farms earned more from cattle than cotton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water.

==Counties==


























==Former counties in Arkansas==

===Lovely County===
Created on October 13, 1827, partitioned from Crawford County. The Treaty of Washington, 1828 ceded most of its territory to Indian Territory. Abolished October 17, 1828 with the remaining portion becoming Washington County.

===Miller County===
Created from Hempstead County. Most of its northern portion was in Choctaw Nation (now part of Oklahoma); rest of northern portion was dissolved into Sevier County in 1828. All of its southern portion was in Texas, and was nominally dissolved into Lafayette County in 1838. The present Miller County was created in 1874 from an area that was part of Lafayette County before the former Miller County was dissolved.

<text>Quebec French ( ), also known as Québécois French, is the predominant variety of the French language spoken in Canada. It is the dominant language of the province of Quebec, used in everyday communication, in education, the media, and government.

Canadian French is a common umbrella term to describe all varieties of French used in Canada, including Quebec French. Formerly it was used to refer solely to Quebec French and the closely related dialects spoken in Ontario and Western Canada, in contrast with Acadian French, which is spoken in some areas of eastern Quebec (Gaspé Peninsula), New Brunswick, and in other parts of Atlantic Canada, as well as Métis French, which is found generally across the Prairie provinces.

The term &#x27; is commonly used to refer to Quebec working class French (when considered a [[basilect]]), characterized by certain features often perceived as phased out, &quot;old world&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; in [[standard French]]. , in particular, exhibits strong Norman influences largely owing to Norman immigration during the [[Ancien Régime]]; people from Normandy were perceived as true Catholics and allowed to emigrate to the new world as an example of ideal French settlers. The Acadian French equivalent of&#x27; is called &quot;Chiac&quot;.

== History ==
The origins of Quebec French lie in the 17th- and 18th-century regional varieties (dialects) of early modern French, also known as Classical French, and of other (especially Poitevin dialect, Saintongeais dialect, Norman and Picard) that French colonists brought to New France. Quebec French either evolved from this language base and was shaped by the following influences (arranged according to historical period) or was imported from Paris and other urban centres of France as a koiné, or common language shared by the people speaking it.

=== New France ===
Unlike the language of France in the 17th and 18th centuries, French in New France was fairly well unified. It acquired loan words, especially place names such as &quot;Québec&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;Hochelaga&quot;, and words to describe the flora and fauna such as (cranberry) and (largemouth bass), from First Nations languages.

The importance of the rivers and ocean as the main routes of transportation also left its imprint on Quebec French. Whereas European varieties of French use the verbs and for &quot;to get in&quot; and &quot;to get out&quot; of a vehicle (lit. &quot;to mount&quot; and &quot;to dismount&quot;, as one does with a horse or a carriage), the Québécois variety in its informal register tends to use and , a result of Quebec&#x27;s navigational heritage.

=== British rule ===
With the onset of British rule in 1760, the French of Canada became isolated from that of Europe. This led to a retention of older pronunciations, such as for () and expressions that later died out in France. In 1774, the Quebec Act guaranteed French settlers as British subjects rights to French law, the Roman Catholic faith and the French language to appease them at a moment when the English-speaking colonies to the south were on the verge of revolting in the American Revolution.

=== 1840 to 1960 ===
In the period between the Act of Union of 1840 and 1960, roughly 900,000 French Canadians left Canada to emigrate to the United States to seek employment. The ones that returned, brought with them new words taken from their experiences in the New England textile mills and the northern lumber camps. As a result, Quebec French began to borrow from both Canadian and American English to fill accidental gaps in the lexical fields of government, law, manufacturing, business and trade.

=== 1960 to 1982 ===
From the Quiet Revolution to the passing of the Charter of the French Language, the French language in Quebec saw a period of validation in its varieties associated with the working class while the percentage of literate and university-educated francophones grew. Laws concerning the status of French were passed both on the federal and provincial levels. The was established to play an essential role of support in language planning. Protective laws and distaste towards anglicisms arose at the same time to preserve the integrity of Quebec French, while Metropolitan French on the other hand does not have that same protective attitude and in recent decades has been more influenced by English, causing Quebec French not to borrow recent English loanwords that are now used in Metropolitan French.

== Social perception and language policy ==

=== Mutual intelligibility with other varieties of French ===
There is a continuum of intelligibility between Quebec and European French; the two are most intelligible in their more standardized forms and pose more difficulties in their dialectal forms. If a comparison can be made, the differences between both varieties are analogous to those between
American and
British English even if differences in phonology and prosody for the latter are greater.

Quebec&#x27;s culture has only recently gained exposure in Europe, especially since the Quiet Revolution (). The difference in dialects and culture is large enough that speakers of Quebec French overwhelmingly prefer their own local television dramas or sitcoms to shows from Europe or the United States. Conversely, certain singers from Quebec have become very famous even in France, notably Félix Leclerc, Gilles Vigneault, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Céline Dion, and Garou. Some television series from Quebec such as and are also known in France. The number of such shows from France shown on Quebec television is about the same as the number of British shows on American television even though French news channels like France 24 and a francophone channel based in France, TV5 Québec Canada, are broadcast in Quebec. Nevertheless, Metropolitan French series such as &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and are broadcast and known in Quebec. In certain cases, on French TV, subtitles can be added when barbarisms, rural speech and slang are used, not unlike cases in the US of a number of British programmes being shown with subtitles (notably from Scotland).

== Relation to European French ==
Historically speaking, the closest relative of Quebec French is the 17th and 18th-century koiné of Paris.

Formal Quebec French uses essentially the same orthography and grammar as the French of France, with few exceptions, and exhibits moderate lexical differences. Differences in grammar and lexicon become more marked as language becomes more informal.

While phonetic differences also decrease with greater formality, Quebec and European accents are readily distinguishable in all registers. Over time, European French has exerted a strong influence on Quebec French. The phonological features traditionally distinguishing informal Quebec French and formal European French have gradually acquired varying sociolinguistic status, so that certain traits of Quebec French are perceived neutrally or positively by Quebecers, while others are perceived negatively.

=== Perceptions ===
Sociolinguistic studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s showed that Quebecers generally rated speakers of European French heard in recordings higher than speakers of Quebec French in many positive traits, including expected intelligence, education, ambition, friendliness and physical strength. The researchers were surprised by the greater friendliness rating for Europeans, since one of the primary reasons usually advanced to explain the retention of low-status language varieties is social solidarity with members of one&#x27;s linguistic group. François Labelle cites the efforts at that time by the &quot;to impose a French as standard as possible&quot; as one of the reasons for the negative view Quebecers had of their language variety.

Since the 1970s, the official position on Québécois language has shifted dramatically. An oft-cited turning point was the 1977 declaration of the &quot;Association québécoise des professeurs de français&quot; defining thus the language to be taught in classrooms: &quot;Standard Quebec French [&quot;le français standard d&#x27;ici&quot;, literally, &quot;the Standard French of here&quot;] is the socially favoured variety of French which the majority of Francophone Québécois tend to use in situations of formal communication.&quot;

Ostiguy and Tousignant doubt whether Quebecers today would still have the same negative attitudes towards their own variety of French that they did in the 1970s. They argue that negative social attitudes have focused instead on a subset of the characteristics of Quebec French relative to European French, and particularly some traits of informal Quebec French. Some characteristics of European French are even judged negatively when imitated by Quebecers.

=== Typography ===
Quebec French has some typographical differences from European French. For example, in Quebec French a full non-breaking space is not used before the semicolon, exclamation mark, or question mark. Instead, a thin space (which according to &quot;Le Ramat de la typographie&quot; normally measures a quarter of an em) is used; this thin space can be omitted in word-processing situations where the thin space is assumed to be unavailable, or when careful typography is not required.

=== Spelling and grammar ===
==== Formal language ====
A notable difference in grammar which received considerable attention in France during the 1990s is the feminine form of many professions that traditionally did not have a feminine form. In Quebec, one writes nearly universally or &quot;a researcher&quot;, whereas in France, and, more recently, and are used. Feminine forms in as in are still strongly criticized in France by institutions like the , but are commonly used in Canada and Switzerland.

There are other, sporadic spelling differences. For example, the formerly recommended the spelling for what is in France &quot;tofu&quot;. This recommendation was repealed in 2013. In grammar, the adjective &quot;Inuit&quot; is invariable in France but, according to official recommendations in Quebec, has regular feminine and plural forms.

==== Informal language ====
Grammatical differences between informal spoken Quebec French and the formal language abound. Some of these, such as omission of the negative particle , are also present in the informal language of speakers of standard European French, while other features, such as use of the interrogative particle , are either peculiar to Quebec or Canadian French or restricted to nonstandard varieties of European French.

=== Lexis ===
==== Distinctive features ====
While the overwhelming majority of lexical items in Quebec French exist in other dialects of French, many words and expressions are unique to Quebec, much like some are specific to American and British varieties of English. The differences can be classified into the following five categories. The influences on Quebec French from English and Native American can be reflected in any of these five:
* lexically specific items (), which do not exist in other varieties of French;
* semantic differences (), in which a word has a different meaning in Quebec French than in other French varieties;
* grammatical differences in lexical items (), in which a word has different morpho-syntactic behaviour in Quebec French than in other varieties;
* differences in multi-word or fixed expressions ();
* contextual differences (roughly, ), in which the lexical item has a similar form and meaning in Quebec French as in other varieties, but the context in which the item is used is different.

The following tables give examples of each of the first four categories, along with the Metropolitan French equivalent and an English gloss. Contextual differences, along with individual explanations, are then discussed.

Some Quebec French lexical items have the same general meaning in Metropolitan French but are used in different contexts. English translations are given in parentheses.
* (stop): In Quebec, most stop signs say . Some Quebec stop signs say and older signs use both words. However, in France, all such signs say , which is the standard in Europe.
* , pronounced (condom): In Quebec French, this term has neutral connotations, whereas in Metropolitan French, it is used in more technical contexts. The neutral term in Metropolitan French is .

In addition, Quebec French has its own set of swear words, or , distinct from other varieties of French.

===== Use of anglicisms =====
One characteristic of major sociological importance distinguishing Quebec from European French is the relatively greater number of borrowings from English, especially in the informal spoken language, but that notion is often exaggerated. The Québécois have been found to show a stronger aversion to the use of anglicisms in formal contexts than do European francophones, largely because of what the influence of English on their language is held to reveal about the historically superior position of anglophones in Canadian society. According to Cajolet-Laganière and Martel, out of 4,216 &quot;criticized borrowings from English&quot; in Quebec French that they were able to identify, some 93% have &quot;extremely low frequency&quot; and 60% are obsolete. Despite this, the prevalence of anglicisms in Quebec French has often been exaggerated.

Various anglicisms commonly used in European French informal language are mostly not used by Quebec French speakers. While words such as and are commonly spoken in Europe, Quebec tends to favour French equivalents, namely: and , respectively. As such, the perception of exaggerated anglicism use in Quebec French could be attributed, in part, simply to the fact that the anglicisms used are different, and thus more noticeable by European speakers.

French spoken with a large number of anglicisms may be disparagingly termed &quot;&quot;. According to Chantal Bouchard, &quot;While the language spoken in Quebec did indeed gradually accumulate borrowings from English [between 1850 and 1960], it did not change to such an extent as to justify the extraordinarily negative discourse about it between 1940 and 1960. It is instead in the loss of social position suffered by a large proportion of Francophones since the end of the 19th century that one must seek the principal source of this degrading perception.&quot;

===== Borrowings from Indigenous languages =====

, the Canadian French word for bullfrog, a frog species native to North America, originates from an Iroquois word.

, the word for mosquito, also originates from an aboriginal language, Tupi-guarani, spoken by aboriginals on the northern coasts of Brazil. It is thought that early French colonists adopted this word in the late 1600s after exchanges with explorers returning from South America.

, a synonym for Cranberry, also originates from Iroquois.

===== Additional differences =====
The following are areas in which the lexicon of Quebec French is found to be distinct from those of other varieties of French:
* lexical items formerly common to both France and New France but are today unique to Quebec French (this includes expressions and word forms that have the same form elsewhere in La Francophonie but have a different denotation or connotation);
* borrowings from Amerindian languages, especially place names;
* – Quebec French profanity;
* many loanwords, calques, and other borrowings from English in the 19th and 20th centuries, whether or not such borrowings are considered Standard French;
* starting in the latter half of the 20th century, an enormous store of French neologisms (coinages) and re-introduced words via terminological work by professionals, translators, and the OLF; some of this terminology is &quot;exported&quot; to the rest of la Francophonie;
* feminized job titles and gender-inclusive language;
* morphological processes that have been more productive:
*# suffixes: and 
*# reduplication (as in the international French word ): , etc.
*# reduplication plus : , etc.
*# new words ending in without reduplication: , etc.

==== Recent lexical innovations ====
Some recent Quebec French lexical innovations have spread, at least partially, to other varieties of French, for example:
* &quot;clavardage&quot;, &quot;chat&quot;, a contraction of &quot;clavier&quot; (keyboard) and &quot;bavardage&quot; (chat). Verb: &quot;clavarder&quot;
* &quot;courriel&quot;, &quot;e-mail&quot;, a contraction of &quot;courrier électronique&quot; (electronic mail)
* &quot;pourriel&quot;, &quot;spam e-mail&quot;, is a contraction of &quot;poubelle&quot; (garbage) and &quot;courriel&quot; (email), whose popularity may also be influenced by the word &quot;pourri&quot; (rotten).
* &quot;baladodiffusion&quot; (may be abbreviated to &quot;balado&quot;), &quot;podcasting&quot;, a contraction of &quot;baladeur&quot; (walkman) and &quot;radiodiffusion&quot;.

=== Sociolinguistics ===
On Twitter, supporters of the Quebec separatist party Bloc Québécois used hashtags that align with the syntactic pattern found in hashtags used in French political discourse, rather than adopting the hashtags commonly used by other Canadian parties with similar political positions.

== Phonology ==

For phonological comparisons of Quebec French, Belgian French, Meridional French, and Metropolitan French, see French phonology.

=== Vowels ===

==== Systematic (in all formal speech) ====
* , , and as phonemes distinct from , , and respectively
* , , are lax allophones of , , in closed syllables
* Nasal vowels are similar to the traditional Parisian French: is diphthongized to , is diphthongized to , is fronted to , and is generally pronounced 
* is pronounced in final open syllables (&quot;avocat&quot; /avɔka/ → [avɔkɑ])
* is pronounced before in final closed syllables (&quot;dollar&quot; /dɔlaʁ/ → [dɔlɑːʁ])

==== Systematic (in both informal and formal speech) ====
* Long vowels are diphthongized in final closed syllables (&quot;tête&quot; /tɛːt/ → [tɛɪ̯t] ~ [taɪ̯t], the first one is considered as formal, because the diphthong is weak)
* Standard French is pronounced in final open syllable (&quot;avocat&quot; /avɔka/ → [avɔkɔ]) 

==== Unsystematic (in all informal speech) ====
* (spelled &quot;oi&quot;) is pronounced , or 
* is pronounced 

=== Consonants ===

==== Systematic ====
* and affricated to and before , , , (except in Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Côte-Nord)

===== Unsystematic =====
* Drop of liquids and (written as &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;) in unstressed position with schwa or unstressed intervocalic position
* Trilled &quot;r&quot; - 

=== Sociolinguistic status of selected phonological traits ===
These examples are intended not exhaustive but illustrate the complex influence that European French has had on Quebec French pronunciation and the range of sociolinguistic statuses that individual phonetic variables can possess.
* The most entrenched features of Quebec pronunciation are such that their absence, even in the most formal registers, is considered an indication of foreign origin of the speaker. That is the case, for example, for the affrication of and before , , and . (This particular feature of Quebec French is, however, sometimes avoided in singing.)
* The use of the lax Quebec allophones of , , (in the appropriate phonetic contexts) occurs in all but highly formal styles, and even then, their use predominates. Use of the tense allophones where the lax ones would be expected can be perceived as &quot;pedantic&quot;.
* The Quebec variant of nasal vowels , , and corresponding to the Parisian (traditionally pronounced ), (traditionally pronounced ), (traditionally pronounced ) and (traditionally pronounced ) are not subject to a significant negative sociolinguistic evaluation and are used by most speakers and of educated speakers in all circumstances. However, Parisian variants also appear occasionally in formal speech among a few speakers, especially speakers who were often watching cartoons when they were a child, because the dubbing affected them and it is not considered as a Quebec accent. Some speakers use them in Radio-Canada, but they never have &quot;brin-brun merger&quot; (The preceding discussion applies to stressed syllables. For reasons unrelated to their social standing, some allophones close to the European variants appear frequently in unstressed syllables.)
* To pronounce instead of in such words as &quot;gâteau&quot; clearly predominates in informal speech and, according to Ostiguy and Tousignant, is likely not to be perceived negatively in informal situations. However, sociolinguistic research has shown that not to be the case in formal speech, when the standard is more common. However, many speakers use systematically in all situations, and Ostiguy and Tousignant hypothesize that such speakers tend to be less educated. It must be mentioned that a third vowel , though infrequent, also occurs and is the vowel that has emerged with as a new European standard in the last several decades for words in this category. According to Ostiguy and Tousignant, this pronunciation is seen as &quot;affected&quot;, and Dumas writes that speakers using this pronunciation &quot;run the risk of being accused of snobbery.&quot; Entirely analogous considerations apply to the two pronunciations of such words as &quot;chat&quot;, which can be pronounced or .
* The diphthonged variants of such words as &quot;fête&quot; (e.g. instead of ), are rarely used in formal speech. They have been explicitly and extensively stigmatized and were, according to the official Quebec educational curricula of 1959 and 1969, among the pronunciation habits to be &quot;standardized&quot; in pupils. In informal speech, however, most speakers use generally such forms to some extent, but they are viewed negatively and are more frequent among uneducated speakers. However, many Québécois teachers use the diphthongization.
* Traditional pronunciations such as for &quot;poil&quot; (also , as in France. Words in this category include &quot;avoine&quot;, &quot;(ils) reçoivent,&quot; &quot;noirci,&quot; etc. ) and for &quot;moi&quot; (now usually , as in France; this category consists of &quot;moi,&quot; &quot;toi,&quot; and verb forms such as &quot;(je) bois&quot; and &quot;(on) reçoit&quot; but excludes &quot;québécois&quot; and &quot;toit&quot;, which have had only the pronunciation ), are no longer used by many speakers, and are virtually absent from formal speech. They have long been the object of condemnation. Dumas writes that the pronunciations of words in the &quot;moi&quot; category have &quot;even become the symbol and the scapegoat of bad taste, lack of education, vulgarity, etc., no doubt because they differ quite a bit from the accepted pronunciation, which ends in , [...]&quot; On the other hand, writing in 1987, he considers in words in the &quot;poil&quot; group &quot;the most common pronunciation.&quot;
* One of the most striking changes that has affected Quebec French in recent decades is the displacement of the alveolar trill &quot;r&quot; by the uvular trill &quot;r&quot; , originally from Northern France, and similar acoustically to the Parisian uvular &quot;r&quot; . Historically, the alveolar &quot;r&quot; predominated in western Quebec, including Montreal, and the uvular &quot;r&quot; in eastern Quebec, including Quebec City, with an isogloss near Trois-Rivières. (More precisely, the isogloss runs through Yamachiche and then between Sherbrooke and La Patrie, near the American border. With only a few exceptions, the alveolar variant predominates in Canada outside Quebec.) Elocution teachers and the clergy traditionally favoured the trilled &quot;r&quot;, which was nearly universal in Montreal until the 1950s and was perceived positively. However, massive migration from eastern Quebec beginning in the 1930s with the Great Depression, the participation of soldiers in the Second World War, travel to Europe after the war, and especially the use of the uvular &quot;r&quot; in radio and then television broadcasts all quickly reversed perceptions and favoured the spread of the uvular &quot;r&quot;. The trilled &quot;r&quot; is now rapidly declining. According to Ostiguy and Tousignant, the change occurred within a single generation. The Parisian uvular &quot;r&quot; is also present in Quebec, and its use is positively correlated with socioeconomic status.

== Syntax ==

Like other varieties, Quebec French is characterized by increasingly wide gaps between its formal and informal forms. Notable differences include the generalized use of &quot;on&quot; (informal for &quot;nous&quot;), the use of single negations as opposed to double negations: &quot;J&#x27;ai pas&quot; (informal) vs &quot;Je n&#x27;ai pas&quot; (formal) etc. There are increasing differences between the syntax used in spoken Quebec French and that of other regional dialects of French. However, the characteristic differences of Quebec French syntax are not considered standard despite their high-frequency in everyday, relaxed speech.

One far-reaching difference is the weakening of the syntactic role of the specifiers (both verbal and nominal), which results in many syntactic changes:
* Relative clauses (1) using &quot;que&quot; as an all-purpose relative pronoun, or (2) embedding interrogative pronouns instead of relative pronouns (also found in informal European French):
*# &quot;J&#x27;ai trouvé le document&quot; que j&#x27;ai de besoin. (.) &quot;I found / I&#x27;ve found the document I need.&quot;
*# &quot;Je comprends&quot; qu&#x27;est-ce que &quot;tu veux dire. (Je comprends ce que tu veux dire.)&quot; &quot;I understand what you mean.&quot;
* Omission of the prepositions that collocate with certain verbs:
** &quot;J&#x27;ai un enfant&quot; à m&#x27;occuper. (Standard French: &quot;s&#x27;occuper&quot; de; &quot;J&#x27;ai un enfant dont je dois m&#x27;occuper.&quot;) &quot;I have a child (I need) to take care of.&quot;
* Plural conditioned by semantics:
** &quot;La plupart du monde&quot; sont &quot;tannés des taxes. (La plupart du monde est tanné des taxes.)&quot; &quot;Most people are fed up with taxes.&quot;
* A phenomenon throughout the Francophonie, dropping the &quot;ne&quot; of the double negative is accompanied, in Quebec French, by a change in word order (1), and (2) postcliticisation of direct pronouns (3) along with euphonic insertion of [z] liaisons to avoid vowel hiatus. This word order is also found in non-standard European French.
*# &quot;Donne-moi-le pas. (Ne me le donne pas.)&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t give it to me.&quot;
*# &quot;Dis-moi pas de m&#x27;en aller! (Ne me dis pas de m&#x27;en aller)&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me to go away!&quot;
*# &quot;Donne-moi-z-en pas ! (Ne m&#x27;en donne pas!)&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t give me any!&quot;

Other notable syntactic changes in Quebec French include the following:
* Use of non-standard verbal periphrasis, (many of them archaisms):
** J&#x27;étais pour &quot;te le dire. (J&#x27;allais te le dire. / J&#x27;étais sur le point de te le dire.)&quot; &quot;I was going to/about to tell you about it.&quot; (old European French but still used in e.g. Haiti)
** Avoir su, &quot;j&#x27;aurais... (Si j&#x27;avais su, j&#x27;aurais...)&quot; &quot;Had I known, I would have...&quot;
** Mais que &quot;l&#x27;hiver finisse, je vais partir. (Dès que l&#x27;hiver finira, je partirai.)&quot; &quot;As soon as winter ends, I will leave.&quot;
* Particle &quot;-tu&quot; used (1) to form tag questions, (2) sometimes to express exclamative sentences and (3) at other times it is used with excess, for instance (note that this is common throughout European French via the addition of -t&#x27;y or -tu):
** &quot;C&#x27;est-tu prêt? (Est-ce prêt? / C&#x27;est prêt? / Est-ce que c&#x27;est prêt?)&quot; &quot;Is it ready?&quot;
** &quot;Vous voulez-tu manger? (Vous voulez manger?)&quot; &quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;
** &quot;On a-tu bien mangé! (Qu&#x27;est-ce qu&#x27;on a bien mangé!)&quot; &quot;We ate well, didn&#x27;t we?&quot;
** &quot;T&#x27;as-tu pris tes pilules? (Est-ce que tu as pris tes médicaments?)&quot; &quot;Have you taken your medications?&quot;
** This particle is &quot;-ti&quot; (from Standard French &quot;-t-il&quot;, often rendered as [t͡si]) in most varieties of North American French outside Quebec as well as in European varieties of &quot;français populaire&quot; as already noted by Gaston Paris. It is also found in the non-creole speech on the island of Saint-Barthelemy in the Caribbean.
* Extensive use of litotes (also common in informal European French):
** &quot;C&#x27;est pas chaud! (C&#x27;est frais!)&quot; &quot;It is not all too warm out!&quot;
** &quot;C&#x27;est pas laid pantoute! (Ce n&#x27;est pas laid du tout!)&quot; &quot;Isn&#x27;t this nice!&quot; (literally: &quot;This is not ugly at all.&quot;)
** &quot;Comment vas-tu? - Pas pire, pas pire.&quot; &quot;How are you? - Not bad. Not bad at all&quot;

However, these features are common to all the basilectal varieties of &quot;français populaire&quot; descended from the 17th century koiné of Paris.
* Use of diminutives (also very common in European French):
** &quot;Tu prendrais-tu un p&#x27;tit café? Une p&#x27;tite bière?&quot; &quot;Would you like to have a coffee? A beer?&quot;

== Pronouns ==
* In common with the rest of the Francophonie, there is a shift from &quot;nous&quot; to &quot;on&quot; in all registers. In post-Quiet Revolution Quebec, the use of informal &quot;tu&quot; has become widespread in many situations that had previously called for a semantically singular &quot;vous&quot;. While some schools are trying to re-introduce this use of &quot;vous&quot;, which is absent from most youths&#x27; speech, the shift from &quot;nous&quot; to &quot;on&quot; has not been similarly discouraged.
* The traditional use of &quot;on&quot;, in turn, is usually replaced by different uses of pronouns or paraphrases, like in the rest of the Francophonie. The second person (&quot;tu&quot;, &quot;t&quot;&#x27;) is usually used by speakers when referring to experiences that can happen in one&#x27;s life:
** &quot;Quand t&#x27;es ben tranquille chez vous, à te mêler de tes affaires ...&quot;
* Other paraphrases using &quot;le monde&quot;, &quot;les gens&quot; are more employed when referring to overgeneralisations:
** &quot;Le monde aime pas voyager dans un autobus plein.&quot;
* As in the rest of la Francophonie, the sound [l] is disappearing in &quot;il, ils&quot; among informal registers and rapid speech. More particular to Quebec is the transformation of &quot;elle&quot; to [a], sometimes written &quot;a&quot; or &quot;à&quot; in eye dialect or al [al], and less often , sometimes written &quot;è.&quot; &quot;Elle est&quot; may transform to &quot;&#x27;est,&quot; pronounced .
* Absence of &quot;elles&quot; - For a majority of Quebec French speakers, &quot;elles&quot; is not used for the third person plural pronoun, at least in the nominative case; it is replaced with the subject pronoun &quot;ils&quot; [i] or the stress/tonic pronoun &quot;eux(-autres)&quot;. However, elles is still used in other cases (&quot;ce sont elles qui vont payer le prix&quot;).
* &quot;-autres&quot; In informal registers, the stress/tonic pronouns for the plural subject pronouns have the suffix &quot;–autres&quot;, pronounced and written &quot;–aut’&quot; in eye dialect. &quot;Nous-autres&quot;, &quot;vous-autres&quot;, and &quot;eux-autres&quot;, also found in Louisiana French, are comparable to the Spanish forms &quot;nosotros/as&quot; and &quot;vosotros/as&quot;, though with different usage and meanings.

== Verbs ==
In their syntax and morphology, Quebec French verbs differ very little from the verbs of other regional dialects of French, both formal and informal. The distinctive characteristics of Quebec French verbs are restricted mainly to:
* Regularization
*# In the present indicative, the forms of &quot;aller&quot; (to go) are regularized as in all singular persons: &quot;je vas, tu vas, il/elle va&quot;. Note that in 17th century French, what is today&#x27;s international standard in &quot;je vais&quot; was considered substandard while &quot;je vas&quot; was the prestige form.
*# In the present subjunctive of &quot;aller&quot;, the root is regularized as all- /al/ for all persons. Examples: &quot;que j&#x27;alle, que tu alles, qu&#x27;ils allent&quot;, etc. The majority of French verbs, regardless of dialect or standardization, display the same regularization. They therefore use the same root for both the imperfect and the present subjunctive: &quot;que je finisse&quot; vs. &quot;je finissais&quot;.
*# Colloquially, in &quot;haïr&quot; (to hate), in the present indicative singular forms, the hiatus is found between two different vowels instead of at the onset of the verb&#x27;s first syllable. This results in the forms: &quot;j&#x27;haïs&quot;, &quot;tu haïs&quot;, &quot;il/elle haït&quot;, written with a diaeresis (&quot;tréma&quot;) and all pronounced with two syllables: . The &quot;h&quot; in these forms is silent and does not indicate a hiatus; as a result, &quot;je&quot; elides with &quot;haïs&quot; forming &quot;j&#x27;haïs&quot;. All the other forms, tenses, and moods of &quot;haïr&quot; contain the same hiatus regardless of register. However, in Metropolitan French and in more formal Quebec French, especially in the media, the present indicative singular forms are pronounced as one syllable and written without a diaeresis: &quot;je hais&quot;, &quot;tu hais&quot;, &quot;il/elle hait&quot;.
* Differentiation
*# In the present indicative of both formal and informal Quebec French, &quot;(s&#x27;)asseoir&quot; (to sit/seat) only uses the vowel /wa/ in stressed roots and /e/ in unstressed roots: &quot;je m&#x27;assois, tu t&#x27;assois, il s&#x27;assoit, ils s&#x27;assoient&quot; but &quot;nous nous asseyons, vous vous asseyez&quot;. In Metropolitan French, stressed /wa/ and /je/ are in free variation as are unstressed /wa/ and /e/. Note that in informal Quebec French, &quot;(s&#x27;)asseoir&quot; is often said as &quot;(s&#x27;)assire&quot;.
*# Quebec French has retained the ending for &quot;je/tu/il-elle/ils&quot; in the imperfect (the ending is written as &quot;-ais, -ait, -aient&quot;). In most other dialects, the ending is pronounced, instead, as a neutralized sound between and .
*# Informal &quot;ils jousent&quot; (they play) is sometimes heard for &quot;ils jouent&quot; and is most likely due to an analogy with &quot;ils cousent&quot; (they sew). Because of the stigma attached to &quot;ils jousent,&quot; most people now use the normative &quot;ils jouent&quot;, which is free of stigma.

<text>The Quechan (Quechan: &quot;Kwatsáan&quot; &#x27;those who descended&#x27;), or Yuma, are a Native American tribe who live on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation on the lower Colorado River in Arizona and California just north of the Mexican border. Despite their name, they are not related to the Quechua people of the Andes. Members are enrolled in the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. The federally recognized Quechan tribe&#x27;s main office is located in Winterhaven, California. Its operations and the majority of its reservation land are located in California, United States.

==History==
The historic Yuman-speaking people in this region were skilled warriors and active traders, maintaining exchange networks with the Pima in southern Arizona, New Mexico, and with peoples of the Pacific coast.

The first significant contact of the Quechan with Europeans was with the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza and his party in the winter of 1774. Relations were friendly. On Anza&#x27;s return from his second trip to Alta California in 1776, the chief of the tribe and three of his men journeyed to Mexico City to petition the Viceroy of New Spain for the establishment of a mission. The chief Palma and his three companions were baptized in Mexico City on February 13, 1777. Palma was given the Spanish baptismal name &quot;Salvador Carlos Antonio&quot;.

Once the initial contact had been made, The Quechan people seemed inviting toward Juan Bautista de Anza. He promised them to set up a mission where all people would live together instead of in a hierarchy. Alongside the promise, de Anza gave Palma’s people horses, steel weapons, clothes, and iron as a token of allegiance.

This allegiance would soon sour as the bureaucracy of the Spanish Empire would cause major delays to the construction of the missions. When the Spanish’s first gifts arrived in 1780, they would be more of a bad omen than a sign of friendship as the livestock being herded to them would go and trample most of if not all the Quechan’s crops. That year there was severe lack of rain thus forcing the Quechan to raid another nearby tribe known as the Maricopa.

The following year, two high members of the tribe were arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate a high-ranking officer. One of the natives was placed in stocks to humiliate them and this caused Palma to finally turn his back on the Spanish.

Spanish settlement among the Quechan did not go smoothly; the tribe rebelled from July 17–19, 1781 and killed four priests and thirty soldiers. They also attacked and damaged the Spanish mission settlements of San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuñer and Puerto de Purísima Concepción, killing many. The following year, the Spanish retaliated with military action against the tribe. After 1840, the Quechan people near La Frontera returned to their original ways of religious practice as soon as the mission priests left and no one replaced them.

After the United States annexed the territories after winning the Mexican–American War, it engaged in the Yuma War from 1850 to 1853 in response to a conflict between the Quechan and Jaeger&#x27;s Ferry and the Glanton Gang, after the Quechan had established a rival ferry service on the Colorado River. During which, the historic Fort Yuma was built across the Colorado River from the present day Yuma, Arizona.

== La Sierra de las Pintas ==
The Sierra de las Pintas was a mountain range that most Spanish expeditions would actively avoid. Spanish explorers were able to see the range, but avoided exploring due to the Quechan informing them that it was uninhabitable and had no drinkable water sources.

When the Spanish had the Yumans guide them through the Sierra de las Pintas, they would take the Spanish to an area with little to no water in order to discourage further exploration.

The Spanish later on attempted to explore the mountain range, searching for water in creative ways. Explorers would follow herds of Bighorn Sheep up the mountain or by chance would find small patches of vegetation pointing toward a hidden water source.

== The Yuma Route ==
The Yuma route was a trail that ran from Southern New Mexico and reached Chihuahua and Sonora. The trail branched out even further to reach the Los Angeles Basin, San Diego, Colorado River and the Gila River. This route was well established before the arrival of the Spanish, and used as a trade route amongst the tribes of the areas.

At first, the Spanish used minor portions of the trail. It was not until San Diego and Monterey were established that they needed a more reliable and faster path. The path was first walked by Sebastian Taraval, a Cochimi indigenous who fled from San Gabriel. Sebastian was then followed by Captain Juan Bautista de Anza. Anza was only able to follow Sebastian to the Imperial Valley Kamia village, where he lost Sebastian and was forced to reach the Quechan people on his own.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially (see population of Native California). Alfred L. Kroeber (1925:883) put the 1770 population of the Quechan at 2,500. Jack D. Forbes (1965:341–343) compiled historical estimates and suggested that before they were first contacted, the Quechan had numbered 4,000 or a few more.

Kroeber estimated the population of the Quechan in 1910 as 750. By 1950, there were reported to be just under 1,000 Quechan living on the reservation and more than 1,100 off it (Forbes 1965:343). The 2000 census reported a resident population of 2,376 persons on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. As of 2023, there are about 4,000 active members of the tribe living on or near the reservation.

==Language==

The Quechan language is part of the Yuman language family.

The Quechan tribe, in partnership with linguists, have created a fully detailed language guide. This guide includes sections about their alphabet along with the different words for actions, animals, the body, colors, directions, family and friends, house, money, nature and the environment, numbers, place names, plants, time, and shapes.

==Fort Yuma Native American Reservation==

The Fort Yuma Indian Reservation is a part of the Quechan&#x27;s traditional lands. Established in 1884, the reservation, at , has a land area of in southeastern Imperial County, California, and western Yuma County, Arizona, near the city of Yuma, Arizona. Both the county and city are named for the tribe.

<text>Ferdinand Peroutka (6 February 1895 – 20 April 1978) was a Czech journalist and writer. A prominent political thinker and journalist during the First Czechoslovak Republic, Peroutka was persecuted by the Nazi regime for his democratic convictions and imprisoned at Buchenwald concentration camp. Following the 1948 coup by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, he emigrated to both the United Kingdom and later, the United States.

==Life==
Peroutka was born to a Czech family in Prague in 1895. In 1913 he began his career as a journalist. After World War I, he became an editor-in-chief of a new newspaper &quot;Tribuna&quot; (&quot;Tribune&quot;). Some articles published in &quot;Tribuna&quot; were later incorporated into books &quot;Z deníku žurnalistova&quot; (&quot;Of the Journalist&#x27;s Diary&quot;) and above all &quot;Jací jsme&quot; (&quot;What we are like&quot;) —in this book Peroutka mapped some myths about the Czech nation.

In 1924 Peroutka passed from &quot;Tribuna&quot; to &quot;Lidové noviny&quot; and founded—thanks to Tomáš Masaryk&#x27;s donation—the magazine &quot;Přítomnost&quot; (&quot;The Presence&quot;). As a commentator he became very influential, standing on the position of the &quot;Castle&quot; (group of President Masaryk) and criticizing both communists and the Right represented by the national-democratic party of the first Czechoslovak prime minister Karel Kramář. Peroutka expressed his political and other opinions also in several books: &quot;Boje o dnešek&quot; (&quot;Fights for Today&quot;), &quot;Ano a ne&quot; (&quot;Yes and No&quot;), &quot;Budování státu&quot; (&quot;Building of the State&quot;) and &quot;Osobnost, chaos a zlozvyky&quot; (&quot;Personality, Chaos and Bad Habits&quot;). As a representative of the Czech democratic tradition, Peroutka was arrested after the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and held in the Buchenwald concentration camp until 1945. He was offered freedom on the condition that he would serve as editor of a collaborationist &quot;Přítomnost&quot;; he refused and spent the whole of the war in Buchenwald.

After liberation, Peroutka became editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;Svobodné noviny&quot; and refounded his famous magazine, &quot;Přítomnost&quot;, under the name &quot;Dnešek&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;). The journal became prominent through its critical stance on postwar violence committed on the German minority and hundreds of alleged collaborators. Nonetheless it also fit the general pattern of the time by hosting illusory views of the Communist party underestimating its totalitarian pretensions. Peroutka wrote two dramas: &quot;Oblak a valčík&quot; (&quot;The Cloud and the Waltz&quot;) and &quot;Štastlivec Sula&quot; (&quot;Sula the Happy Man&quot;). Political articles Peroutka issued in the book &quot;Tak nebo tak&quot; (&quot;One Way Or Another&quot;).

In 1945–1946, Peroutka was also a member of the Provisional National Assembly for the Czechoslovak National Social Party. He sat in parliament until the parliamentary elections in 1946. The 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état caused Peroutka to decide to emigrate. In 1951 he became a director of the Czech division of Radio Free Europe. The summa of his democratic life views was issued in 1959 as &quot;Democratic Manifesto&quot;.

Peroutka also became a novelist in exile. He re-wrote his drama to the novel of the same name. The second novel, &quot;Pozdější život Panny&quot; (&quot;The Later Life of the Virgin&quot;), deals with the idea of the rescue of Joan of Arc. Peroutka&#x27;s last drama was named &quot;Kdybych se ještě jednou narodil&quot; (&quot;If I Was Born One More Time&quot;).

<text>A cancellation (or cancel for short; French: ) is a postal marking applied on a postage stamp or postal stationery to deface the stamp and to prevent its reuse. Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes, and colors. Modern cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself. The term &quot;postmark&quot; refers specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, but the term is often used interchangeably with &quot;cancellation&quot; as it may serve that purpose. The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the &quot;obliteration&quot; or [[Killer (philately)|killer]]. Some stamps are issued pre-cancelled with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added. Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. Cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by philatelists, and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.

==History==
The first adhesive postage stamp was the Penny Black, issued in 1840 by Great Britain. The postal authorities recognized there must be a method for preventing reuse of the stamps and simultaneously issued handstamps for use to apply cancellations to the stamps on the envelopes as they passed through the postal system. The cancels were handmade and depicted a Maltese cross design. Initially, the ink used was red, but it was found that this could be cleaned off and the stamps reused, and so after a series of experiments, early in 1841 black cancelling ink was used, which was more permanent. The color of the stamps was also changed to red-brown so as to ensure that the cancellation showed clearly.

Britain soon abandoned the Maltese crosses and in 1844 began to employ cancellations displaying numbers which referred to the location of mailing. A similar scheme was used for British stamps used abroad in its colonies and foreign postal services, with locations being assigned a specific letter followed by a number, such as A01 used in Kingston, Jamaica, or D22 for Venezuela.
Early cancellations were all applied by hand, commonly using hand stamps. Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an &quot;x&quot;. Pen cancellations were used in the United States into the 1880s, and in a sense continue to this day, when a postal clerk notices a stamp has escaped cancellation and marks it with a ball point pen or marker.

In the early period of the issuance of postage stamps in the United States a number of patents were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps. These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle. (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from perfins, a series of small holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an anti-theft device.)

High speed cancellation machines were first used in Boston between 1880–1890 and subsequently throughout the country.

Today, cancellations may either be applied by hand or machine. Hand cancellation is often used when sending unusually shaped mail or formal mail (e.g., wedding invitations) to avoid damage caused by machine cancellation.

Postal meter stamps and similar modern printed to order stamps are not ordinarily cancelled by postal authorities because such stamps bear the date produced and can not readily be re-used.

==Types of cancellations==
* Bullseye cancellation, also called &quot;Socked on the nose&quot; or SOTN, is a stamp collector&#x27;s term for a cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp. Such cancellations are popular with some stamp collectors because of their neatness and the fact that the time, date, and location where the stamp was used may be readily seen. The prevalence of bulls-eye cancellations varies considerably by country and time period.
* Cancelled-to-order. Cancelled-to-order stamps, also known as CTOs, are stamps that have been cancelled by a postal authority, but were never used to transmit mail. CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors. Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s–1990s strictly for revenue. CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum. Some authorities use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time. In some instances, the &quot;cancellations&quot; are actually printed as part of the stamp itself.
* Deferential cancellation is a cancellation designed so as not to deface the image of the ruler or regent on the stamp.
* A duplex cancel includes a postmark as well as the cancellation.
* Fancy cancels. In the second half of the 19th century, many postmasters in the United States and Canada cut their own cancelers from cork or wood in a great variety of designs such as stars, circles, flags, chickens, etc. These are known as fancy cancels and have been heavily studied by philatelists and collectors. One of the most famous is the &quot;kicking mule&quot; used in the 1880s.
* First day of issue are special cancellations with the date the stamp is first issued for sale and include the words &quot;First day of issue.&quot;
* Flag cancellations are a type of machine cancellation incorporating a design of the United States flag with the stripes serving as the &quot;killer&quot;. The first machine flag cancel (preceded by fancy cancels of flags) was used in Boston in November–December 1894.
* Handstamped cancellations are cancellations added by means of a hand stamping device.
* Highway post office cancels refers to cancels added in transit by portable mail-handling equipment for sorting mail in trucks.
* Machine cancellations are automatically added by machines that rapidly process large numbers of envelopes. A 1903 silent film of an operating cancelling machine may be seen here.
* Mute cancel refers to a cancellation that includes no writing and thus &quot;does not speak.&quot;
* Numeral cancels are cancels whereby number were used to identify specific post offices. For the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which started using numerals in 1844, the shape of bars indicate the actual country of use. Numerals were also used in combination with a datestamp in duplex cancellations.
* Pen cancels refer to the use of a writing pen to deface the stamp, and were more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
* Pictorial cancellations include images associated with the commemoration of some event or anniversary. Some people attempt to use stamps relating to the theme of a pictorial cancellation on the envelope. See further below.
* Precancels are stamps that have been issued with printed cancellations on them, typically to mass mailers. Precancels cannot normally be used by the general public.
* Railway post office (R.P.O.) cancels refer to cancellations applied on mail sorted on trains. The first United States cancellation with the word &quot;railroad&quot; dates from 1838. The last Railway Post Office (R.P.O.) operated by the United States closed in 1977.
* Ship cancels were added to stamps that were mailed on or carried on a ship, commonly a steamer ship in the late 19th–early 20th centuries. In French, the cancellation reads &quot;Paquebot&quot;.
* Slogan cancellations contain a slogan, perhaps commemorative or advertising, in the killer box. See further below.

==Pictorial and special cancellations==

The United States Postal Service distinguishes between special cancellations which have a caption publicizing an event, and pictorial cancellations, which contain an image of some sort. Special cancellations are essentially a type of slogan cancellations. The USPS Building Bridges Special Postal Cancellation Series, a unique series that began in 1996, combines both a pictorial drawing and an event slogan in what USPS refers to as a cancellation series, even though it also contains a pictorial element.

In the United States, official pictorial cancellations are almost invariably applied at special &quot;stations&quot;, i.e., post offices existing only for a limited time, usually one day, at special events, although there are frequently other pictorial cancellations that are not officially described as such—they are among what are called special cancellations and are special die-hubs added to machine cancels, which usually contain merely a slogan but sometimes contain a picture.
There are a very few exceptions in which a particular post office uses a pictorial cancellation on all its mail. 

The range of allowable subjects is very broad, and may include a variety of commercial tie-ins, such as to movie characters.

Canada Post uses automated cancellations with computer-printed messaging. In this way, the corporation can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the piece of mail. Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages (&quot;Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel&quot;) and promotional messages (such as Canada Post&#x27;s web address).

Other post offices such as the Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau also create special pictorial cancellations as they did in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas DC-3. A special handstamp was created depicting a Dakota flying &quot;free&quot; and not &quot;boxed in&quot;.

==Collectors==
Generalist stamp collectors usually prefer lightly cancelled stamps which have the postmark on a corner or small portion of the stamp without obscuring the stamp itself, which ordinarily are more valuable than heavily cancelled stamps. In order to get the postal clerk to cancel the stamps lightly, collectors may rubber-stamp or write &quot;philatelic mail&quot; on the envelope.

Cancellations may significantly affect the value of the stamps. Many stamps are rarer, and consequently much more expensive, in unused condition, such as the Penny Black, which in 1999, catalogued for $1,900 mint and $110 used. The reverse is true for some stamps, such as the hyperinflation stamps of Germany, which may be worth many times more if genuinely postally used. Where stamps are much more valuable in used condition than unused, it may be advisable to have such stamps expertised to confirm that the cancellation is genuine and contemporary.

Some stamp collectors are interested in the cancellations themselves, on or off cover, of a particular country or issue, or collect a specific type of cancellation, such as fancy cancels. Birth date cancels are also collected. There have been many published studies of the cancellations of many countries, some of which are listed below. Collectors who are interested in the cancellations themselves prefer bold, readable cancellations. Cancellations also are an integral part of the collection of postal history.

Historically, collectors disliked pen cancels and removed many of them, making the stamp appear unused or to add a fake cancellation. Today, early United States pen cancelled stamps still are worth considerably less than examples with hand stamped cancels.

Collectors generally view modern cancelled-to-order stamps or CTOs as philatelic junk, and they rarely have any significant value. Stamp catalogs commonly state whether their values for used stamps are for CTOs or for postally used examples. For example, the Scott Catalog used value listings for the German Democratic Republic are for CTOs from 1950 through mid-1990, over 2700 stamps.

==Forgeries==

Forgers have not only manufactured stamps for the philatelic market but also added forged cancellations to those stamps. This was especially common in the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when huge numbers of inexpensive stamps were forged for the packet trade.

Forged cancellations have also been applied to genuine stamps if the stamps are worth much more postally used. In addition, if rare cancellations are desired by collectors, those cancellations have also been forged.

Cancellations may also be used to prove that certain philatelic items are genuine. For example, forgers have fabricated many supposedly-valuable postal covers by adding genuine stamps and forged postal markings to pre-stamp covers. A cover can be shown to be genuine if a genuine cancellation &quot;ties&quot; the stamp or stamps to the cover or, in other words, if a genuine cancellation runs continuously over the stamp and adjacent portion of the envelope. However, one still may need to rule out the possibility that the cancellation was added later. Similarly, stamps that were cut in parts and used for a portion of the full value as splits can be shown to have been so used only if a genuine cancel ties the stamp to the cover or piece of cover.

==Cancellation symbols==
The Michel stamp catalog uses a set of symbols for different types of cancellations:
* postmark cancels (used in less precise catalogues for any cancellation)
* pen cancels
* fiscal cancels
* cancelled-to-order
* hole-punch cancels
*Ⓢ special-issue postmarks
*Ⓣ date postmarks

Philatelic dealers and auctioneers may use entirely different sets of symbols.

<doc id="58134" wikidata="Q104162" url="?curid=58134" title="Proterozoic">
<text>The Proterozoic ( ) is the third of the four geologic eons of Earth&#x27;s history, spanning the time interval from 2500 to 538.8Mya, and is the longest eon of Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale. It is preceded by the Archean and followed by the Phanerozoic, and is the most recent part of the Precambrian &quot;supereon&quot;.

The Proterozoic is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. It covers the time from the appearance of free oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to just before the proliferation of complex life on the Earth during the Cambrian Explosion. The name &quot;Proterozoic&quot; combines two words of Greek origin: meaning &quot;former, earlier&quot;, and , meaning &quot;of life&quot;.
Well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; the evolution of eukaryotes via symbiogenesis; several global glaciations, which produced the 300 million years-long Huronian glaciation (during the Siderian and Rhyacian periods of the Paleoproterozoic) and the hypothesized Snowball Earth (during the Cryogenian period in the late Neoproterozoic); and the Ediacaran period (635–538.8 Ma), which was characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms such as sponges, algae, cnidarians, bilaterians and the sessile Ediacaran biota (some of which had evolved sexual reproduction) and provides the first obvious fossil evidence of life on Earth.

==The Proterozoic record==
The geologic record of the Proterozoic Eon is more complete than that for the preceding Archean Eon. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of those rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean rocks, and many are unaltered. Studies of these rocks have shown that the eon continued the massive continental accretion that had begun late in the Archean Eon. The Proterozoic Eon also featured the first definitive supercontinent cycles and mountain building activity (orogeny).

There is evidence that the first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic. The first began shortly after the beginning of the Proterozoic Eon, and evidence of at least four during the Neoproterozoic Era at the end of the Proterozoic Eon, possibly climaxing with the hypothesized Snowball Earth of the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations.

==The accumulation of oxygen==

One of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the accumulation of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Though oxygen is believed to have been released by photosynthesis as far back as the Archean Eon, it could not build up to any significant degree until mineral sinks of unoxidized sulfur and iron had been exhausted. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level. The banded iron formations, which provide most of the world&#x27;s iron ore, are one mark of that mineral sink process. Their accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, after the iron in the oceans had all been oxidized.

Red beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen 2 billion years ago. Such massive iron oxide formations are not found in older rocks. The oxygen buildup was probably due to two factors: Exhaustion of the chemical sinks, and an increase in carbon sequestration, which sequestered organic compounds that would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.

The first surge in atmospheric oxygen at the beginning of the Proterozoic is called the Great Oxygenation Event, or alternately the Oxygen Catastrophe – to reflect the mass extinction of almost all life on Earth, which at the time was virtually all obligate anaerobic. A second, later surge in oxygen concentrations is called the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event, occurred during the Middle and Late Neoproterozoic and drove the rapid evolution of multicellular life towards the end of the era.

==Subduction processes==
The Proterozoic Eon was a very tectonically active period in the Earth&#x27;s history. Oxygen changed the chemistry allowing for extensive geological changes. Volcanism was also extensive resulting in more geologic changes.

The late Archean Eon to Early Proterozoic Eon corresponds to a period of increasing crustal recycling, suggesting subduction. Evidence for this increased subduction activity comes from the abundance of old granites originating mostly after 2.6 Ga.

The occurrence of eclogite (a type of metamorphic rock created by high pressure, &gt; 1 GPa), is explained using a model that incorporates subduction. The lack of eclogites that date to the Archean Eon suggests that conditions at that time did not favor the formation of high grade metamorphism and therefore did not achieve the same levels of subduction as was occurring in the Proterozoic Eon.

As a result of remelting of basaltic oceanic crust due to subduction, the cores of the first continents grew large enough to withstand the crustal recycling processes.

The long-term tectonic stability of those cratons is why we find continental crust ranging up to a few billion years in age. It is believed that 43% of modern continental crust was formed in the Proterozoic, 39% formed in the Archean, and only 18% in the Phanerozoic. Studies by Condie (2000) and Rino et al. (2004) suggest that crust production happened episodically. By isotopically calculating the ages of Proterozoic granitoids it was determined that there were several episodes of rapid increase in continental crust production. The reason for these pulses is unknown, but they seemed to have decreased in magnitude after every period.

==Supercontinent tectonic history==

Evidence of collision and rifting between continents raises the question as to what exactly were the movements of the Archean cratons composing Proterozoic continents. Paleomagnetic and geochronological dating mechanisms have allowed the deciphering of Precambrian Supereon tectonics. It is known that tectonic processes of the Proterozoic Eon resemble greatly the evidence of tectonic activity, such as orogenic belts or ophiolite complexes, we see today. Hence, most geologists would conclude that the Earth was active at that time. It is also commonly accepted that during the Precambrian, the Earth went through several supercontinent breakup and rebuilding cycles (Wilson cycle).

In the late Proterozoic (most recent), the dominant supercontinent was Rodinia (~1000–750 Ma). It consisted of a series of continents attached to a central craton that forms the core of the North American Continent called Laurentia. An example of an orogeny (mountain building processes) associated with the construction of Rodinia is the Grenville orogeny located in Eastern North America. Rodinia formed after the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia and prior to the assemblage of the supercontinent Gondwana (~500 Ma). The defining orogenic event associated with the formation of Gondwana was the collision of Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia forming the Pan-African orogeny.

Columbia was dominant in the early-mid Proterozoic and not much is known about continental assemblages before then. There are a few plausible models that explain tectonics of the early Earth prior to the formation of Columbia, but the current most plausible hypothesis is that prior to Columbia, there were only a few independent cratons scattered around the Earth (not necessarily a supercontinent, like Rodinia or Columbia).

==Life==
The Proterozoic can be roughly divided into seven biostratigraphic zones which correspond to informal time periods. The first was the Labradorian, lasting from 2.0–1.65 Ga. It was followed by the Anabarian, which lasted from 1.65–1.2 Ga and was itself followed by the Turukhanian from 1.2–1.03 Ga. The Turukhanian was succeeded by the Uchuromayan, lasting from 1.03–0.85 Ga, which was in turn succeeded by the Yuzhnouralian, lasting from 0.85–0.63 Ga. The final two zones were the Amadeusian, spanning the first half of the Ediacaran from 0.63–0.55 Ga, and the Belomorian, spanning from 0.55–0.542 Ga.

The emergence of advanced single-celled eukaryotes began after the Oxygen Catastrophe. This may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use, as opposed to cyanobacteria. It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationships between mitochondria (found in nearly all eukaryotes) and chloroplasts (found in plants and some protists only) and their hosts evolved.

By the late Palaeoproterozoic, eukaryotic organisms had become moderately biodiverse. The blossoming of eukaryotes such as acritarchs did not preclude the expansion of cyanobacteria – in fact, stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1.2 billion years ago.

The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic Era, some 2.4 billion years ago; these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis.

The Viridiplantae evolved sometime in the Palaeoproterozoic or Mesoproterozoic, according to molecular data.

Eukaryote fossils from before the Cryogenian are sparse, and there seems to be low and relatively constant rates of species appearance, change, and extinction. This contrasts with the Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods, in which the quantity and variety of speciations, changes, and extinctions exploded.

Classically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic eons was set at the base of the Cambrian Period when the first fossils of animals, including trilobites and archeocyathids, as well as the animal-like &quot;Caveasphaera&quot;, appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, particularly in ones from the Ediacaran, proving that multicellular life had already become widespread tens of millions of years before the Cambrian Explosion in what is known as the Avalon Explosion. Nonetheless, the upper boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian, which is currently placed at 538.8 Ma.

<text>Year 72 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Publicola and Lentulus (or, less frequently, year 682 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 72 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Third Servile War: Spartacus moves with his followers northward to the Po Valley. Roman forces under Lucius Gellius Publicola defeat a group of slaves (30,000 men) led by Crixus near Mount Gargano. He kills two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.
* Summer – Spartacus and his followers defeat the Roman forces under Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus and Gellius, forcing the Roman legions to retreat in disarray. Both consuls are recalled to Rome in disgrace and relieved of their duties.
* Spartacus moves north again, to cross the Alps into Gaul and then to Thracia. Outside Mutina on the plain of the River Po he defeats the Roman forces under Gaius Cassius Longinus, governor of Gallia Cisalpina.
* Autumn – Spartacus and his followers withdraw to the Bruttium peninsula. At one juncture he contemplates attacking Rome – but moves south. The Senate sends Marcus Licinius Crassus against Spartacus.
* Winter – Spartacus decides to camp near Thurii. Marcus Licinius Crassus with 10 Roman legions tries to trap the rebels in the toe of Italy. He builds a trench and a low earth rampart (with a fortified palisade).
* Battle of Cabira: Lucius Lucullus defeats King Mithridates VI and overruns Pontus. Mithridates flees to Armenia, ruled by his son-in-law Tigranes, who refuses to turn his father-in-law in to Lucius Lucullus.
* On the Iberian Peninsula (part of the Roman Republic) rebel leader Quintus Sertorius is assassinated by some of his own lieutenants (lead by Marcus Perperna). Perperna takes command of the rebel army.
* Perperna is defeated by Pompey the Great at the Battle of Osca, ending the Sertorian War in Spain.

==== Europe ====
* The Suebi and other tribes under King Ariovistus invade Gaul.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Crixus, Gaulish gladiator and military leader

<text>Thorin Oakenshield (Thorin II) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Thorin is the leader of the Company of Dwarves who aim to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon. He is the son of Thráin II, grandson of Thrór, and becomes King of Durin&#x27;s Folk during their exile from Erebor. Thorin&#x27;s background is further elaborated in Appendix A of Tolkien&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;.

Commentators have noted that Thorin is Old Norse both in name and character, being surly, illiberal, independent, proud, aristocratic, and like all Dwarves greedy for gold. Tolkien was a Roman Catholic; from a Christian perspective, Thorin exemplifies the deadly sin of avarice, but is able to free himself from it at the time of his death. This deathbed conversion has been compared to the moral transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

Thorin appears in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, in the Rankin/Bass animated version, and in the 1982 game of the same name.

==Appearances==
===&quot;The Hobbit&quot;===

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin, a Dwarf-King in exile and twelve other Dwarves visited Bilbo Baggins at his home in the Shire. The wizard Gandalf had advised Thorin and the other dwarves to hire Bilbo as a burglar to help them steal their treasure back from the dragon Smaug. Smaug had attacked the Dwarves&#x27;s mountain, Erebor (also known as the Lonely Mountain), about 150 years before, and had taken both the mountain and the dwarves&#x27; treasure. Thorin was determined to get the treasure back. He especially wanted the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain, which was an heirloom of the dwarves&#x27; Kingdom.

On their journey, the dwarves and Bilbo were taken captive by a band of trolls; Thorin was the only dwarf not to be taken unawares. After Gandalf rescued the company (letting dawn turn the trolls to stone), they opened the trolls&#x27; lair. Thorin found the Elven blade Orcrist in the trolls&#x27; cache. Later, Thorin used Orcrist to fight goblins in the tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains. While the rest of the company battled the goblins, Bilbo found a magic ring in a tunnel under the Misty Mountains and used it to escape from the creature Gollum and from the goblins. 

When the Dwarves were captured by the Wood-elves of Mirkwood, Thorin insisted that the others not disclose their quest to their captors. Bilbo, invisible with his magic ring, evaded capture and organised the company&#x27;s escape, which they accomplished by floating in barrels out of the Wood-elves&#x27; fastness. When Thorin emerged from his barrel at Lake-town, he marched up to the town&#x27;s leaders and identified himself as King Under the Mountain.

With provisions from Lake-town, Thorin led the company to Erebor. Seeing that Smaug was not there, the Dwarves reclaimed some of the treasure; Thorin gave Bilbo &quot;a small coat of mail&quot; made of &quot;mithril&quot; as the first installment of the payment due for his services. The Dwarves then learnt from the ancient raven Roäc that Smaug had been killed: Bard the Bowman had managed to shoot Smaug as the dragon was in the process of destroying Lake-town. 

Faced with demands from Thranduil the Elvenking and Bard for a fair share of the treasure to be distributed to the Wood-elves and the men of Lake-town, Thorin refused to acknowledge their right to any of the hoard. He fortified the Mountain against his new rivals and sent to his cousin Dáin Ironfoot for reinforcements. Thorin was furious when he discovered that Bilbo had stolen the Arkenstone to use as a bargaining chip, and he sent him from the Mountain. Conflict amongst the dwarves, men, and elves was averted only by an invasion of goblins and wargs, whereupon the Dwarves joined forces with the Wood-elves, the men of Lake-town, and the great eagles in the Battle of Five Armies. 

During the battle, Thorin was mortally wounded, but he made his peace with Bilbo before he died. When Thorin died, he was buried with the Arkenstone. Orcrist was laid upon his tomb. The blade would glow blue if Orcs should approach; thus, they could not take the Mountain by surprise. Thorin was succeeded as leader of Durin&#x27;s Folk by his cousin Dáin.

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;===
Part III of Appendix A in &quot;The Return of the King&quot; gives an overview of the history of Durin&#x27;s Folk and more of Thorin&#x27;s background. When Thorin was 53 (young for a Dwarf), he marched with a mighty dwarf-army against the orcs of Moria. After the battle he led his people to establish a foothold in the Blue Mountains west of the Shire.

===&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;===
&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; elaborates on Thorin&#x27;s reasons for accepting Bilbo into his company. As depicted in the story &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot;, Thorin met with Gandalf in Bree shortly before the quest began. Gandalf persuaded him that stealth, rather than force, was needed to infiltrate Erebor; they would therefore need a burglar. Gandalf feared that Sauron could use Smaug as a weapon, and was concerned that Thorin&#x27;s pride and quick temper would ruin the mission to destroy the dragon. He thought that Bilbo would be a calming influence on Thorin, as well as a genuinely valuable addition to the company. Thorin, who did not think much of Hobbits, reluctantly agreed, calculating that Bilbo&#x27;s presence would be a small price to pay for Gandalf&#x27;s help.

==Origins==
Tolkien adopted Thorin&#x27;s names from the &quot;Dvergatal&quot;, the list of Dwarves, in the Old Norse poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, which is part of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The name &quot;Thorin&quot; (&quot;Þorinn&quot;) appears in stanza 12, where it is used for a dwarf, and the name &quot;Oakenshield&quot; (&quot;Eikinskjaldi&quot;) in stanza 13. The name &quot;Thorin&quot; ultimately derives from that of the Norse god Thor; it means &quot;darer&quot; or &quot;bold one&quot;.
 The names also appear in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

Dwarfs in Germanic folklore are skilled in metalwork, including making weapons, ships, rings and jewellery; they are knowledgeable, strong, and turn to stone in sunlight. They are characterised as having a strong association with gold, mining, wealth, living underneath mountains, and being long-lived, ungrateful, and getting into arguments about payment. The Tolkien critic Tom Shippey suggests that Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;master-text&quot; for his Dwarves was the &quot;Hjaðningavíg&quot;. In that legend, the Dwarves are characterised by revenge, as in &quot;the long and painful vengeance of [Thorin&#x27;s father] Thráin for [Thorin&#x27;s grandfather] Thrór&quot;, and Shippey argues that Tolkien chose these qualities for his Dwarves.

==Interpretations==

Shippey writes that in chapters 6–8 of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien explores &quot;with delight that surly, independence often the distinguishing mark of Old Norse heroes&quot;. The philosophers Gregory Bassham and Eric Bronson contrast the way Tolkien introduces hobbits, as &quot;plain, quiet folks who never do anything unexpected&quot;, with how Thorin would have &quot;introduce[d] himself, with aristocratic titles and songs of ancient lineage. We do not open the book to read of the wrath of Thorin the way we learn of the wrath of Achilles in the opening lines of &quot;The Iliad&quot;.&quot; 

The Tolkien scholar Paul H. Kocher writes that Tolkien characterises Dwarves as having the &quot;cardinal sin of &#x27;possessiveness&#x27;&quot;, seen sharply when Bard the Bowman makes what Bilbo feels is a fair offer for a share of Smaug&#x27;s treasure, and Thorin flatly refuses, his &quot;dwarfish lust for gold fevered by brooding on the dragon&#x27;s hoard&quot;.

The Jesuit John L. Treloar, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, suggests that Tolkien, a Catholic, explores the seven deadly sins in his Middle-earth writings. He states that in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, both Smaug and Thorin exemplify avarice, but respond to it differently. In his view, Smaug is evil and lets avarice destroy him, whereas Thorin, sharing the general weakness of Dwarves for this particular vice, nevertheless has sufficient good will to free himself of it at the time of his death.

Bassham and Bronson compare Thorin&#x27;s deathbed &quot;conversion&quot; from his greed and pride, as he reconciles himself with Bilbo, to Ebenezer Scrooge&#x27;s &quot;big moral transformation&quot; from grumpy miserliness to generosity and cheerfulness in Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In the 1977 animated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin is voiced by Hans Conried.

In the 1985 Soviet television play &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin was played by Anatoly Ravikovich.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (2012–2014), Thorin is portrayed by Richard Armitage. The film adaptation adds to Thorin&#x27;s quest an arch-enemy in the form of the villainous orc leader Azog, as well as a history of enmity with Thranduil, which began with a dispute between his grandfather Thrór and the Elvenking over the White Gems of Lasgalen. In his review, Erik Kain from &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote that Thorin stood out as a remarkable character with shades of dark and light, at once heroic and stubborn to a fault.

In the 1982 game &quot;The Hobbit&quot; Thorin appears as an AI controlled character and one of his seemingly random actions (&quot;Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold&quot;, which occurs when the player does nothing for a while) became quite famous. In the 2003 video game, Thorin is voiced by Clive Revill.

<text>The Cossacks are a predominantly East Slavic Eastern Christian people originating in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of eastern Ukraine and southern Russia. Historically, they were a semi-nomadic and semi-militarized people, who, while under the nominal suzerainty of various Eastern European states at the time, were allowed a great degree of self-governance in exchange for military service. Although numerous linguistic and religious groups came together to form the Cossacks, most of them coalesced and became East Slavic–speaking Orthodox Christians.

The rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russian Empire endowed Cossacks with certain special privileges in return for the military duty to serve in the irregular troops: Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly infantry soldiers, using war wagons, while Don Cossacks were mostly cavalry soldiers. The various Cossack groups were organized along military lines, with large autonomous groups called hosts. Each host had a territory consisting of affiliated villages called stanitsas.

They inhabited sparsely populated areas in the Dnieper, Don, Terek, and Ural river basins, and played an important role in the historical and cultural development of both Ukraine and parts of Russia.

The Cossack way of life persisted via both direct descendants and acquired ideals in other nations into the twentieth century, though the sweeping societal changes of the Russian Revolution disrupted Cossack society as much as any other part of Russia; many Cossacks migrated to other parts of Europe following the establishment of the Soviet Union, while others remained and assimilated into the Communist state. Cohesive Cossack-based units were organized and many fought for both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II.

After World War II, the Soviet Union disbanded the Cossack units within the Soviet Army, leading to the suppression of many Cossack traditions during the rule of Joseph Stalin and his successors. However, during the Perestroika era in the late 1980s, descendants of Cossacks began to revive their national traditions. In 1988, the Soviet Union enacted a law permitting the re-establishment of former Cossack hosts and the formation of new ones. Throughout the 1990s, numerous regional authorities consented to delegate certain local administrative and policing responsibilities to these reconstituted Cossack hosts.

Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack cultural identity across the world even though the majority, especially in the Russian Federation, have little to no connection to the original Cossack people because cultural ideals and legacy changed greatly with time. Cossack organizations operate in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Canada, and the United States.

==Etymology==
Max Vasmer&#x27;s etymological dictionary traces the name to the Turkic word , , in which &quot;cosac&quot; meant &#x27;free man&#x27; but also &#x27;conqueror&#x27;. The ethnonym &quot;Kazakh&quot; is from the same Turkic root.

In written sources, the name is first attested in the &quot;Codex Cumanicus&quot; from the 13th century. In English, &quot;Cossack&quot; is first attested in 1590.

==History==

===Early history===

The origins of the Cossacks are disputed. Originally, the term referred to semi-independent Tatar groups (&quot;qazaq&quot; or &quot;free men&quot;) who inhabited the Pontic–Caspian steppe, north of the Black Sea near the Dnieper River. By the end of the 15th century, the term was also applied to peasants who had fled to the devastated regions along the Dnieper and Don Rivers, where they established their self-governing communities. Until at least the 1630s, these Cossack groups remained ethnically and religiously open to virtually anybody, although the Slavic element predominated. There were several major Cossack hosts in the 16th century: near the Dnieper, Don, Volga and Ural Rivers; the Greben Cossacks in Caucasia; and the Zaporozhian Cossacks, mainly west of the Dnieper.

It is unclear when people other than the Brodnici and Berladnici (which had a Romanian origin with large Slavic influences) began to settle in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Don and the Dnieper after the demise of the Khazars. Their arrival was probably not before the 13th century, when the Mongols broke the power of the Cumans, who had assimilated the previous population on that territory. It is known that new settlers inherited a lifestyle that long pre-dated their presence, including that of the Turkic Cumans and the Circassian Kassaks. In contrast, Slavic settlements in southern Ukraine started to appear relatively early during Cuman rule, with the earliest, such as Oleshky, dating back to the 11th century.

Early &quot;Proto-Cossack&quot; groups are generally reported to have come into existence within what is now Ukraine in the 13th century as the influence of Cumans grew weaker, although some have ascribed their origins to as early as the mid-8th century. Some historians suggest that the Cossack people were of mixed ethnic origin, descending from East Slavs, Turks, Tatars, and others who settled or passed through the vast Steppe. Some Turkologists, however, argue that Cossacks are descendants of the native Cumans of Ukraine, who had lived there long before the Mongol invasion. some other just state that first Cossacks were Turkic origin 
according to Serhii Plokhy first Cossacks were of Turkic rather than Slavic stock.
Christoph Baumer state that predecessor from the thirteenth century on were mainly of Turkic stock, but from the sixteenth century the Cossack were increasingly joined by Slavs such as Russians and Poles, Balto-slavic Lithuanians and people from today&#x27;s Ukraine, thus becoming a Slav-Tatar ethnic hybrid.

As the grand duchies of Moscow and Lithuania grew in power, new political entities appeared in the region. These included Moldavia and the Crimean Khanate. In 1261, Slavic people living in the area between the Dniester and the Volga were mentioned in Ruthenian chronicles. Historical records of the Cossacks before the 16th century are scant, as is the history of the Ukrainian lands in that period.

As early as the 15th century, a few individuals ventured into the Wild Fields, the southern frontier regions of Ukraine separating Poland-Lithuania from the Crimean Khanate. These were short-term expeditions, to acquire the resources of what was a naturally rich and fertile region teeming with cattle, wild animals, and fish. This lifestyle, based on subsistence agriculture, hunting, and either returning home in the winter or settling permanently, came to be known as the Cossack way of life. Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe caused considerable devastation and depopulation in this area. The Tatar raids also played an important role in the development of the Cossacks.

In the 15th century, Cossack society was described as a loose federation of independent communities, which often formed local armies and were entirely independent from neighboring states such as Poland, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and the Crimean Khanate. According to Mykhailo Hrushevsky, the first mention of Cossacks dates back to the 14th century, although the reference was to people who were either Turkic or of undefined origin. Hrushevsky states that the Cossacks may have descended from the long-forgotten Antes, or from groups from the Berlad territory of the Brodnici in present-day Romania, then a part of the Grand Duchy of Halych. There, the Cossacks may have served as self-defence formations, organized to defend against raids conducted by neighbors.

The first international mention of Cossacks was in 1492, when Crimean Khan Meñli I Giray complained to Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon that his Cossack subjects from Kiev and Cherkasy had pillaged a Crimean Tatar ship: the duke ordered his &quot;Ukrainian&quot; (meaning borderland) officials to investigate, execute the guilty, and give their belongings to the khan. Sometime in the 16th century, there appeared the old Ukrainian &quot;Ballad of Cossack Holota&quot;, about a Cossack near Kiliya.

In the 16th century, these Cossack societies merged into two independent territorial organizations, as well as other smaller, still-detached groups:
* The Cossacks of Zaporizhzhia, centered on the lower bends of the Dnieper, in the territory of modern Ukraine, with the fortified capital of Zaporozhian Sich. They were given significant autonomous privileges, operating as an autonomous state (the Zaporozhian Host) within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, by a treaty with Poland in 1649.
*The Don Cossack State, on the River Don. Its capital was initially Razdory, then it was moved to Cherkassk, and later to Novocherkassk.

There are also references to the less well-known Tatar Cossacks, including the Nağaybäklär and Meshchera-speaking Volga Finns, of whom Sary Azman was the first Don ataman. These groups were assimilated by the Don Cossacks, but had their own irregular Bashkir and Meshchera Host up to the end of the 19th century. The Kalmyk and Buryat Cossacks also deserve mention.

=== Later history ===

The Zaporizhian Sich became a vassal polity of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during feudal times. Under increasing pressure from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the mid-17th century the Sich declared an independent Cossack Hetmanate. The Hetmanate was initiated by a rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky against Polish and Catholic domination, known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Afterwards, the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654) brought most of the Cossack state under Russian rule. The Sich, with its lands, became an autonomous region under the Russian protectorate.

The Don Cossack Army, an autonomous military state formation of the Don Cossacks under the citizenship of the Moscow State in the Don region in 1671–1786, began a systematic conquest and colonization of lands to secure the borders on the Volga, the whole of Siberia (see Yermak Timofeyevich), and the Yaik (Ural) and Terek Rivers. Cossack communities had developed along the latter two rivers well before the arrival of the Don Cossacks.

By the 18th century, Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire occupied effective buffer zones on its borders. The expansionist ambitions of the Empire relied on ensuring Cossack loyalty, which caused tension given their traditional exercise of freedom, democracy, self-rule, and independence. Cossacks such as Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin, Ivan Mazepa and Yemelyan Pugachev led major anti-imperial wars and revolutions in the Empire in order to abolish slavery and harsh bureaucracy, and to maintain independence. The Empire responded with executions and tortures, the destruction of the western part of the Don Cossack Host during the Bulavin Rebellion in 1707–1708, the destruction of Baturyn after Mazepa&#x27;s rebellion in 1708, and the formal dissolution of the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Host after Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion in 1775. After the Pugachev rebellion, the Empire renamed the Yaik Host, its capital, the Yaik Cossacks, and the Cossack town of Zimoveyskaya in the Don region to try to encourage the Cossacks to forget the men and their uprisings. It also formally dissolved the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Cossack Host, and destroyed their fortress on the Dnieper (the Sich itself). This may in part have been due to the participation of some Zaporozhian and other Ukrainian exiles in Pugachev&#x27;s rebellion. During his campaign, Pugachev issued manifestos calling for restoration of all borders and freedoms of both the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Lower Dnieper (Nyzovyi in Ukrainian) Cossack Host under the joint protectorate of Russia and the Commonwealth.

By the end of the 18th century, Cossack nations had been transformed into a special military estate (&quot;sosloviye&quot;), &quot;a military class&quot;. The Malorussian Cossacks (the former Registered Cossacks also known as &quot;Town Zaporozhian Host&quot;) were excluded from this transformation, but were promoted to membership of various civil estates or classes (often Russian nobility), including the newly created civil estate of Cossacks. Similar to the knights of medieval Europe in feudal times, or to the tribal Roman auxiliaries, the Cossacks had to obtain their cavalry horses, arms, and supplies for their military service at their own expense, the government providing only firearms and supplies. Lacking horses, the poor served in the Cossack infantry and artillery. In the navy alone, Cossacks served with other peoples as the Russian navy had no Cossack ships and units. Cossack service was considered rigorous.

Cossack forces played an important role in Russia&#x27;s wars of the 18th–20th centuries, including the Great Northern War, the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Crimean War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Caucasus War, many Russo-Persian Wars, many Russo-Turkish Wars, and the First World War. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Tsarist regime used Cossacks extensively to perform police service. Cossacks also served as border guards on national and internal ethnic borders, as had been the case in the Caucasus War.

During the Russian Civil War, Don and Kuban Cossacks were the first people to declare open war against the Bolsheviks. In 1918, Russian Cossacks declared their complete independence, creating two independent states, the Don Republic and the Kuban People&#x27;s Republic, and the revived Hetmanate emerged in Ukraine. Cossack troops formed the effective core of the anti-Bolshevik White Army, and Cossack republics became centers for the anti-Bolshevik White movement. With the victory of the Red Army, Cossack lands were subjected to decossackization and the Holodomor famine. As a result, during the Second World War, their loyalties were divided and both sides had Cossacks fighting in their ranks.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Cossacks made a systematic return to Russia. Many took an active part in post-Soviet conflicts. In the 2002 Russian Census, 140,028 people reported their ethnicity as Cossack. There are Cossack organizations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, and the United States.

== Ukrainian Cossacks ==
===Zaporozhian Cossacks===
The Zaporozhian Cossacks lived on the Pontic–Caspian steppe below the Dnieper Rapids (Ukrainian: &quot;za porohamy&quot;), also known as the Wild Fields. The group became well known, and its numbers increased greatly between the 15th and 17th centuries. The Zaporozhian Cossacks played an important role in European geopolitics, participating in a series of conflicts and alliances with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. The Zaporozhians gained a reputation for their raids against the Ottoman Empire and its vassals, although they also sometimes plundered other neighbors. Their actions increased tension along the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Low-level warfare took place in those territories for most of the period of the Commonwealth (1569–1795).

====Emergence====
Prior to the formation of the Zaporozhian Sich, Cossacks had usually been organized by Ruthenian boyars, or princes of the nobility, especially various Lithuanian starostas. Merchants, peasants, and runaways from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Muscovy, and Moldavia also joined the Cossacks.

The first recorded &quot;sich&quot; prototype was formed by the starosta of Cherkasy and Kaniv, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, who built a fortress on the island of Little Khortytsia on the banks of the Lower Dnieper in 1552. The Zaporozhian Host adopted a lifestyle that combined the ancient Cossack order and habits with those of the Knights Hospitaller.

The Cossack structure arose, in part, in response to the struggle against Tatar raids. Socio-economic developments in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were another important factor in the growth of the Ukrainian Cossacks. During the 16th century, serfdom was imposed because of the favorable conditions for grain sales in Western Europe. This subsequently decreased the locals&#x27; land allotments and freedom of movement. In addition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth government attempted to impose Catholicism, and to Polonize the local Ukrainian population. The basic form of resistance and opposition by the locals and burghers was flight and settlement in the sparsely populated steppe.

====Relations with surrounding states====

The major powers tried to exploit Cossack military power for their own purposes. In the 16th century, with the area of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth extending south, the Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded by the Commonwealth as their subjects. Foreign and internal pressure on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led to the government making concessions to the Zaporozhian Cossacks. King Stephen Báthory granted them certain rights and freedoms in 1578, and they gradually began to create their foreign policy. They did so independently of the government, and often against its interests, as for example with their role in Moldavian affairs, and with the signing of a treaty with Emperor Rudolf II in the 1590s. Registered Cossacks formed a part of the Commonwealth army until 1699.
Around the end of the 16th century, increasing Cossack aggression strained relations between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. Cossacks had begun raiding Ottoman territories during the second part of the 16th century. The Polish government could not control them, but was held responsible as the men were nominally its subjects. In retaliation, Tatars living under Ottoman rule launched raids into the Commonwealth, mostly in the southeast territories. Cossack pirates responded by raiding wealthy trading port-cities in the heart of the Ottoman Empire, as these were just two days away by boat from the mouth of the Dnieper river. In 1615 and 1625, Cossacks razed suburbs of Constantinople, forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace. In 1637, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, joined by the Don Cossacks, captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of Azov, which guarded the Don.

The Zaporizhian Cossacks became particularly strong in the first quarter of the 17th century under the leadership of hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, who launched successful campaigns against the Tatars and Turks. Tsar Boris Godunov had incurred the hatred of Ukrainian Cossacks by ordering the Don Cossacks to drive away from the Don all the Ukrainian Cossacks fleeing the failed uprisings of the 1590s. This contributed to the Ukrainian Cossacks&#x27; willingness to fight against him. In 1604, 2,000 Zaporizhian Cossacks fought on the side of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and their proposal for the Tsar (Dmitri I), against the Muscovite army. By September 1604, Dmitri I had gathered a force of 2,500 men, of whom 1,400 were Cossacks. Two thirds of these &quot;cossacks&quot;, however, were in fact Ukrainian civilians, only 500 being professional Ukrainian Cossacks. On July 4, 1610, 4,000 Ukrainian Cossacks fought in the Battle of Klushino, on the side of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They helped to defeat a combined Muscovite-Swedish army and facilitate the occupation of Moscow from 1610 to 1611, riding into Moscow with Stanisław Żółkiewski.

The final attempt by King Sigismund and Wladyslav to seize the throne of Muscovy was launched on April 6, 1617. Although Wladyslav was the nominal leader, it was Jan Karol Chodkiewicz who commanded the Commonwealth forces. By October, the towns of Dorogobuzh and Vyazma had surrendered. But a defeat, when the counterattack on Moscow by Chodkiewicz failed between Vyasma and Mozhaysk, prompted the Polish-Lithuanian army to retreat. In 1618, Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny continued his campaign against the Tsardom of Russia on behalf of the Cossacks and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Numerous Russian towns were sacked, including Livny and Yelets. In September 1618, with Chodkiewicz, Konashevych-Sahaidachny laid siege to Moscow, but peace was secured.
Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth called for the governments to keep the Cossacks and Tatars in check, but neither enforced the treaties strongly. The Polish forced the Cossacks to burn their boats and stop raiding by sea, but the activity did not cease entirely. During this time, the Habsburg monarchy sometimes covertly hired Cossack raiders against the Ottomans, to ease pressure on their own borders. Many Cossacks and Tatars developed longstanding enmity due to the losses of their raids. The ensuing chaos and cycles of retaliation often turned the entire southeastern Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth border into a low-intensity war zone. It catalyzed escalation of Commonwealth–Ottoman warfare, from the Moldavian Magnate Wars (1593–1617) to the Battle of Cecora (1620), and campaigns in the Polish–Ottoman War of 1633–1634.

====Conflict with Poland====

Cossack numbers increased when the warriors were joined by peasants escaping serfdom in Russia and dependence in the Commonwealth. Attempts by the &quot;szlachta&quot; to turn the Zaporozhian Cossacks into peasants eroded the formerly strong Cossack loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The government constantly rebuffed Cossack ambitions for recognition as equal to the &quot;szlachta&quot;. Plans for transforming the Polish–Lithuanian two-nation Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth made little progress, due to the unpopularity among the Ruthenian &quot;szlachta&quot; of the idea of Ruthenian Cossacks being equal to them and their elite becoming members of the &quot;szlachta&quot;. The Cossacks&#x27; strong historic allegiance to the Eastern Orthodox Church also put them at odds with officials of the Roman Catholic-dominated Commonwealth. Tensions increased when Commonwealth policies turned from relative tolerance to suppression of the Eastern Orthodox Church after the Union of Brest. The Cossacks became strongly anti-Roman Catholic, an attitude that became synonymous with anti-Polish.

After the Ottoman-Polish and Polish-Muscovite warfare ceased, the official Cossack register was again reduced. The registered Cossacks (&quot;reiestrovi kozaky&quot;) were isolated from those who were excluded from the register, and from the Zaporizhian Host. This, together with intensified socioeconomic and national-religious oppression of the other classes in Ukrainian society, led to many Cossack uprisings in the 1630s. The nobility, which had obtained legal ownership of vast expanses of land on the Dnipro from the Polish kings, attempted to impose feudal dependency on the local population. Landowners utilized the locals in war, by raising the Cossack registry in times of hostility, and then radically decreasing it and forcing the Cossacks back into serfdom in times of peace. This institutionalized method of control bred discontent among the Cossacks. By the end of the 16th century, they began to revolt, in the uprisings of Kryshtof Kosynsky (1591–1593), Severyn Nalyvaiko (1594–1596), Hryhorii Loboda (1596), Marko Zhmailo (1625), Taras Fedorovych (1630), Ivan Sulyma (1635), Pavlo Pavliuk and Dmytro Hunia (1637), and Yakiv Ostrianyn and Karpo Skydan (1638). All were brutally suppressed and ended by the Polish government. Cossack rebellions eventually culminated in the Khmelnytsky Uprising, led by the hetman of the Zaporizhian Sich, Bohdan Khmelnytsky.

====Under Russian rule====

The Zaporozhian Sich had its own authorities, its own &quot;Lower&quot; Zaporozhian Host, and its own land.
In 1775, the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Host was destroyed. Later, its high-ranking Cossack leaders were exiled to Siberia, its last chief, Petro Kalnyshevsky, becoming a prisoner of the Solovetsky Islands. Some Cossacks moved to the Danube Delta region, where they established a new sich under Ottoman rule. To prevent further defection of Cossacks, the Russian government restored the special Cossack status of the majority of Zaporozhian Cossacks. This allowed them to unite in the Host of Loyal Zaporozhians, and later to reorganize into other hosts, of which the Black Sea Host was most important. Because of land scarcity resulting from the distribution of Zaporozhian Sich lands among landlords, they eventually moved on to the Kuban region.

The majority of Danubian Sich Cossacks moved first to the Azov region in 1828, and later joined other former Zaporozhian Cossacks in the Kuban region. Groups were generally identified by faith rather than language in that period, and most descendants of Zaporozhian Cossacks in the Kuban region are bilingual, speaking both Russian and Balachka, the local Kuban dialect of central Ukrainian. Their folklore is largely Ukrainian. The predominant view of ethnologists and historians is that its origins lie in the common culture dating back to the Black Sea Cossacks.

===Cossack Hetmanate===
====Formation of the Cossack class in the Hetmanate====
The waning loyalty of the Cossacks, and the &quot;szlachta&#x27;s&quot; arrogance towards them, resulted in several Cossack uprisings against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the early 17th century. Finally, the King&#x27;s adamant refusal to accede to the demand to expand the Cossack Registry prompted the largest and most successful of these: the Khmelnytsky Uprising, that began in 1648. Some Cossacks, including the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; in Ukraine, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, divided the lands of the Ruthenian &quot;szlachta&quot;, and became the Cossack &quot;szlachta&quot;. The uprising was one of a series of catastrophic events for the Commonwealth, known as The Deluge, which greatly weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and set the stage for its disintegration 100 years later.

Influential relatives of the Ruthenian and Lithuanian &quot;szlachta&quot; in Moscow helped to create the Russian–Polish alliance against Khmelnitsky&#x27;s Cossacks, portrayed as rebels against order and against the private property of the Ruthenian Orthodox &quot;szlachta&quot;. Don Cossacks&#x27; raids on Crimea left Khmelnitsky without the aid of his usual Tatar allies. From the Russian perspective, the rebellion ended with the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, in which, in order to overcome the Russian–Polish alliance against them, the Khmelnitsky Cossacks pledged their loyalty to the Russian Tsar. In return, the Tsar guaranteed them his protection; recognized the Cossack &quot;starshyna&quot; (nobility), their property, and their autonomy under his rule; and freed the Cossacks from the Polish sphere of influence and the land claims of the Ruthenian &quot;szlachta&quot;.

Only some of the Ruthenian &quot;szlachta&quot; of the Chernigov region, who had their origins in the Moscow state, saved their lands from division among Cossacks and became part of the Cossack &quot;szlachta&quot;. After this, the Ruthenian &quot;szlachta&quot; refrained from plans to have a Moscow Tsar as king of the Commonwealth, its own Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki later becoming king. The last, ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to rebuild the Polish–Cossack alliance and create a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth was the 1658 Treaty of Hadiach. The treaty was approved by the Polish king and the Sejm, and by some of the Cossack &quot;starshyna&quot;, including hetman Ivan Vyhovsky. The treaty failed, however, because the &quot;starshyna&quot; were divided on the issue, and it had even less support among rank-and-file Cossacks.

====Relations with neighbours====

As a result of the mid–17th century Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Zaporozhian Cossacks briefly established an independent state, which later became the autonomous Cossack Hetmanate (1649–1764). It was placed under the suzerainty of the Russian Tsar from 1667 but was ruled by local hetmans for a century. The principal political problem of the hetmans who followed the Pereyeslav Agreement was defending the autonomy of the Hetmanate from Russian/Muscovite centralism. The hetmans Ivan Vyhovsky, Petro Doroshenko and Ivan Mazepa attempted to resolve this by separating Ukraine from Russia.

Relations between the Hetmanate and their new sovereign began to deteriorate after the autumn of 1656, when the Muscovites, going against the wishes of their Cossack partners, signed an armistice with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in Vilnius. The Cossacks considered the Vilnius agreement a breach of the contract they had entered into at Pereiaslav. For the Muscovite tsar, the Pereiaslav Agreement signified the unconditional submission of his new subjects; the Ukrainian hetman considered it a conditional contract from which one party could withdraw if the other was not upholding its end of the bargain.

The Ukrainian hetman Ivan Vyhovsky, who succeeded Khmelnytsky in 1657, believed the Tsar was not living up to his responsibility. Accordingly, he concluded a treaty with representatives of the Polish king, who agreed to re-admit Cossack Ukraine by reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to create a third constituent, comparable in status to that of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Union of Hadiach provoked a war between the Cossacks and the Muscovites/Russians that began in the fall of 1658.
In June 1659, the two armies met near the town of Konotop. One army comprised Cossacks, Tatars, and Poles, and the other was led by a top Muscovite military commander of the era, Prince Aleksey Trubetskoy. After terrible losses, Trubetskoy was forced to withdraw to the town of Putyvl on the other side of the border. The battle is regarded as one of the Zaporizhian Cossacks&#x27; most impressive victories.

In 1659, Yurii Khmelnytsky was elected hetman of the Zaporizhian Host/Hetmanate, with the endorsement of Moscow and supported by common Cossacks unhappy with the conditions of the Union of Hadiach. In 1660, however, the hetman asked the Polish king for protection, leading to the period of Ukrainian history known as The Ruin.

====Suppression of Cossack autonomy in the Russian Empire====

Historian Gary Dean Peterson writes: &quot;With all this unrest, Ivan Mazepa of the Ukrainian Cossacks was looking for an opportunity to secure independence from Russia and Poland&quot;. In response to Mazepa&#x27;s alliance with Charles XII of Sweden, Peter I ordered the sacking of the then capital of the Hetmanate, Baturyn. The city was burnt and looted, and 11,000 to 14,000 of its inhabitants were killed. The destruction of the Hetmanate&#x27;s capital was a signal to Mazepa and the Hetmanate&#x27;s inhabitants of severe punishment for disloyalty to the Tsar&#x27;s authority. The Zaporizhian Sich at Chortomlyk, which had existed since 1652, was also destroyed by Peter I&#x27;s forces in 1709, in retribution for decision of its otaman Kost Hordiyenko, to ally with Mazepa.

Under Russian rule, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two autonomous republics of the Russian Tsardom: the Cossack Hetmanate, and the more independent Zaporizhia. These organisations gradually lost their autonomy, and were abolished by Catherine II in the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of Little Russia, and Zaporizhia was absorbed into New Russia.

===Black Sea, Azov and Danubian Sich Cossacks===
With the destruction of the Zaporizhian Sich, a number of Ukrainian-speaking Eastern Orthodox Zaporozhian Cossacks fled to the territory under control of the Ottoman Empire. Together with Cossacks of Greater Russian origin, as well as the vast majority of Old Believers and other people from &quot;Greater Russia&quot; (Muscovy), they settled in the area of the Danube river, and founded a new Sich. Many Ukrainian peasants and adventurers later joined the Danubian Sich. While Ukrainian folklore remembers the Danubian Sich, other new siches of Loyal Zaporozhians on the Bug and Dniester rivers did not achieve such fame. Other Cossacks settled on the Tisa river in the Austrian Empire, also forming a new Sich.

During the Cossack sojourn under Turkish rule, a new host was founded that numbered around 12,000 people by the end of 1778. Cossack settlement on the Russian border was approved by the Ottoman Empire after the Cossacks officially vowed to serve the sultan. Yet internal conflict, and the political manoeuvring of the Russian Empire led to splits among the Cossacks. Some of the runaway Cossacks returned to Russia, where the Russian army used them to form new military bodies that also incorporated Greeks, Albanians and Crimean Tatars. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1787–1792, most of these Cossacks were absorbed into the Black Sea Cossack Host together with Loyal Zaporozhians. Most of the remaining Cossacks who had stayed in the Danube Delta returned to Russia in 1828. They settled in the area north of the Azov Sea, becoming known as the Azov Cossacks. The majority of Zaporizhian Cossacks who had remained loyal to Russia despite the destruction of Sich became known as Black Sea Cossacks. Both Azov and Black Sea Cossacks were resettled to colonize the Kuban steppe, a crucial foothold for Russian expansion in the Caucasus. In 1860, more Cossacks were resettled to the North Caucasus, and merged into the Kuban Cossack Host.

== Russian Cossacks ==

The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe, and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.

These people, constantly facing the Tatar warriors on the steppe frontier, received the Turkic name &quot;Cossacks&quot; (&quot;Kazaks&quot;), which was then extended to other free people in Russia. Many Cumans, who had assimilated Khazars, retreated to the Principality of Ryazan (Grand Duchy of Ryazan) after the Mongol invasion. The oldest mention in the annals is of Cossacks of the Russian principality of Ryazan serving the principality in the battle against the Tatars in 1444. In the 16th century, the Cossacks (primarily of Ryazan) were grouped in military and trading communities on the open steppe, and began to migrate into the area of the Don.
Cossacks served as border guards and protectors of towns, forts, settlements, and trading posts. They performed policing functions on the frontiers, and also came to represent an integral part of the Russian army. In the 16th century, to protect the borderland area from Tatar invasions, Cossacks carried out sentry and patrol duties, guarding against Crimean Tatars and nomads of the Nogai Horde in the steppe region.

The most popular weapons of the Cossack cavalrymen were the sabre, or &quot;shashka&quot;, and the long spear.

From the 16th to 19th centuries, Russian Cossacks played a key role in the expansion of the Russian Empire into Siberia (particularly by Yermak Timofeyevich), the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Cossacks also served as guides to most Russian expeditions of civil and military geographers and surveyors, traders, and explorers. In 1648, the Russian Cossack Semyon Dezhnyov discovered a passage between North America and Asia. Cossack units played a role in many wars in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, including the Russo-Turkish Wars, the Russo-Persian Wars, and the annexation of Central Asia.

Western Europeans had a lot of contact with Cossacks during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and had seen Cossack patrols in Berlin. During Napoleon&#x27;s Invasion of Russia, Cossacks were the Russian soldiers most feared by the French troops. Napoleon himself stated, &quot;Cossacks are the best light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.&quot; Cossacks also took part in the partisan war deep inside French-occupied Russian territory, attacking communications and supply lines. These attacks, carried out by Cossacks along with Russian light cavalry and other units, were one of the first developments of guerrilla warfare tactics and, to some extent, special operations as we know them today. Several thousands of Cossacks were commended by Pyotr Bagration during the French invasion of Russia behind Bug.

===Don Cossacks===
The Don Cossack Host (, &quot;Vsevelikoye Voysko Donskoye&quot;) was either an independent or an autonomous democratic republic, located in present-day Southern Russia. It existed from the end of the 16th century until the early 20th century. There are two main theories of the origin of the Don Cossacks. Most respected historians support the migration theory, according to which they were Slavic colonists. The various autochthonous theories popular among the Cossacks themselves do not find confirmation in genetic studies. The gene pool comprises mainly the East Slavic component, with a significant Ukrainian contribution. There is no influence of the peoples of the Caucasus; and the steppe populations, represented by the Nogais, have only limited impact.

The majority of Don Cossacks are either Eastern Orthodox or Christian Old Believers (старообрядцы). Prior to the Russian Civil War, there were numerous religious minorities, including Muslims, Subbotniks, and Jews.

===Kuban Cossacks===
Kuban Cossacks are Cossacks who live in the Kuban region of Russia. Although many Cossack groups came to inhabit the Western North Caucasus, most of the Kuban Cossacks are descendants of the Black Sea Cossack Host (originally the Zaporozhian Cossacks), and the Caucasus Line Cossack Host.

A distinguishing feature is the &quot;Chupryna&quot; or &quot;Oseledets&quot; hairstyle, a roach haircut popular among some Kubanians. This tradition traces back to the Zaporizhian Sich.

===Terek Cossacks===

The Terek Cossack Host was created in 1577 by free Cossacks resettling from the Volga to the Terek River. Local Terek Cossacks joined this host later. In 1792, the host was included in the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, from which it separated again in 1860, with Vladikavkaz as its capital. In 1916, the population of the host was 255,000, within an area of 1.9 million desyatinas.

===Yaik Cossacks===


The Ural Cossack Host was formed from the Ural Cossacks, who had settled along the Ural River. Their alternative name, Yaik Cossacks, comes from the river&#x27;s former name, changed by the government after Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion of 1773–1775. The Ural Cossacks spoke Russian, and identified as having primarily Russian ancestry, but also incorporated many Tatars into their ranks. In 1577, twenty years after Moscow had conquered the Volga from Kazan to Astrakhan, the government sent troops to disperse pirates and raiders along the Volga. Among them was Yermak Timofeyevich. Some escaped to flee southeast to the Ural River, where they joined the Yaik Cossacks. In 1580, they captured Saraichik. By 1591, they were fighting on behalf of the government in Moscow. Over the next century, they were officially recognized by the imperial government.

===Razin and Pugachev Rebellions===
As a largely independent nation, the Cossacks had to defend their liberties and democratic traditions against the ever-expanding Muscovy, succeeded by Russian Empire. Their tendency to act independently of the Tsardom of Russia increased friction. The Tsardom&#x27;s power began to grow in 1613, with the ascension of Mikhail Romanov to the throne following the Time of Troubles. The government began attempting to integrate the Cossacks into the Russian Tsardom by granting elite status and enforcing military service, thus creating divisions among the Cossacks themselves as they fought to retain their traditions. The government&#x27;s efforts to alter their traditional nomadic lifestyle resulted in the Cossacks being involved in nearly all the major disturbances in Russia over 200 years, including the rebellions led by Stepan Razin and Yemelyan Pugachev.

As Russia regained stability, discontent grew within the serf and peasant populations. Under Alexis Romanov, Mikhail&#x27;s son, the Code of 1649 divided the Russian population into distinct and fixed hereditary categories. The Code increased tax revenue for the central government and put an end to nomadism, to stabilize the social order by fixing people on the same land and in the same occupation as their families. Peasants were tied to the land, and townsmen were forced to take on their fathers&#x27; occupations. The increased tax burden fell mainly on the peasants, further widening the gap between the poor and wealthy. Human and material resources became limited as the government organized more military expeditions, putting even greater strain on the peasants. War with Poland and Sweden in 1662 led to a fiscal crisis, and rioting across the country. Taxes, harsh conditions, and the gap between social classes drove peasants and serfs to flee. Many went to the Cossacks, knowing that the Cossacks would accept refugees and free them.

The Cossacks experienced difficulties under Tsar Alexis as more refugees arrived daily. The Tsar gave the Cossacks a subsidy of food, money, and military supplies in return for acting as border defense. These subsidies fluctuated often; a source of conflict between the Cossacks and the government. The war with Poland diverted necessary food and military shipments to the Cossacks as fugitive peasants swelled the population of the Cossack host. The influx of refugees troubled the Cossacks, not only because of the increased demand for food but also because their large number meant the Cossacks could not absorb them into their culture by way of the traditional apprenticeship. Instead of taking these steps for proper assimilation into Cossack society, the runaway peasants spontaneously declared themselves Cossacks and lived alongside the true Cossacks, laboring or working as barge-haulers to earn food.

Divisions among the Cossacks began to emerge as conditions worsened and Mikhail&#x27;s son Alexis took the throne. Older Cossacks began to settle and become prosperous, enjoying privileges earned through obeying and assisting the Muscovite system. The old Cossacks started giving up the traditions and liberties that had been worth dying for, to obtain the pleasures of an elite life. The lawless and restless runaway peasants who called themselves Cossacks looked for adventure and revenge against the nobility that had caused them suffering. These Cossacks did not receive the government subsidies that the old Cossacks enjoyed, and had to work harder and longer for food and money.

====Razin&#x27;s Rebellion====
The divisions between the elite and the lawless led to the formation of a Cossack army, beginning in 1667 under Stenka Razin, and ultimately to the failure of Razin&#x27;s rebellion.

Stenka Razin was born into an elite Cossack family, and had made many diplomatic visits to Moscow before organizing his rebellion. The Cossacks were Razin&#x27;s main supporters, and followed him during his first Persian campaign in 1667, plundering and pillaging Persian cities on the Caspian Sea. They returned in 1669, ill and hungry, tired from fighting, but rich with plundered goods. Russia tried to gain support from the old Cossacks, asking the ataman, or Cossack chieftain, to prevent Razin from following through with his plans. But the ataman was Razin&#x27;s godfather, and was swayed by Razin&#x27;s promise of a share of expedition wealth. His reply was that the elite Cossacks were powerless against the band of rebels. The elite did not see much threat from Razin and his followers either, although they realized he could cause them problems with the Muscovite system if his following developed into a rebellion against the central government.

Razin and his followers began to capture cities at the start of the rebellion, in 1669. They seized the towns of Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan, Saratov, and Samara, implementing democratic rule and releasing peasants from slavery as they went. Razin envisioned a united Cossack republic throughout the southern steppe, in which the towns and villages would operate under the democratic, Cossack style of government. Their sieges often took place in the runaway peasant Cossacks&#x27; old towns, leading them to wreak havoc there and take revenge on their old masters. The elder Cossacks began to see the rebels&#x27; advance as a problem, and in 1671 decided to comply with the government in order to receive more subsidies. On April 14, ataman Yakovlev led elders to destroy the rebel camp. They captured Razin, taking him soon afterward to Moscow to be executed.

Razin&#x27;s rebellion marked the beginning of the end of traditional Cossack practices. In August 1671, Russian envoys administered the oath of allegiance and the Cossacks swore loyalty to the tsar. While they still had internal autonomy, the Cossacks became Russian subjects, a transition that was a dividing point again in Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion.

====Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion====
For the Cossack elite, noble status within the empire came at the price of their old liberties in the 18th century. Advancing agricultural settlement began to force the Cossacks to give up their traditional nomadic ways and adopt new forms of government. The government steadily changed the entire culture of the Cossacks. Peter the Great increased Cossack service obligations, and mobilized their forces to fight in far-off wars. Peter began establishing non-Cossack troops in fortresses along the Yaik River. In 1734, construction of a government fortress at Orenburg gave Cossacks a subordinate role in border defense. When the Yaik Cossacks sent a delegation to Peter with their grievances, Peter stripped the Cossacks of their autonomous status, and subordinated them to the War College rather than the College of Foreign Affairs. This consolidated the Cossacks&#x27; transition from border patrol to military servicemen. Over the next fifty years, the central government responded to Cossack grievances with arrests, floggings, and exiles.

Under Catherine the Great, beginning in 1762, the Russian peasants and Cossacks again faced increased taxation, heavy military conscription, and grain shortages, as before Razin&#x27;s rebellion. Peter III had extended freedom to former church serfs, freeing them from obligations and payments to church authorities, and had freed other peasants from serfdom, but Catherine did not follow through on these reforms. In 1767, the Empress refused to accept grievances directly from the peasantry. Peasants fled once again to the lands of the Cossacks, in particular the Yaik Host, whose people were committed to the old Cossack traditions. The changing government also burdened the Cossacks, extending its reach to reform Cossack traditions. Among ordinary Cossacks, hatred of the elite and central government rose. In 1772, a six–month open rebellion ensued between the Yaik Cossacks and the central government.

Yemelyan Pugachev, a low-status Don Cossack, arrived in the Yaik Host in late 1772. There, he claimed to be Peter III, playing on the Cossack belief that Peter would have been an effective ruler but for his assassination in a plot by his wife, Catherine II. Many Yaik Cossacks believed Pugachev&#x27;s claim, although those closest to him knew the truth. Others, who may have known of it, did not support Catherine II due to her disposal of Peter III, and also spread Pugachev&#x27;s claim to be the late emperor.

The first of three phases of Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion began in September 1773. Most of the rebels&#x27; first prisoners were Cossacks who supported the elite. After a five-month siege of Orenburg, a military college became Pugachev&#x27;s headquarters. Pugachev envisioned a Cossack tsardom, similar to Razin&#x27;s vision of a united Cossack republic. The peasantry across Russia stirred with rumors and listened to the manifestos Pugachev issued. But the rebellion soon came to be seen as an inevitable failure. The Don Cossacks refused to help the final phase of the revolt, knowing that military troops were closely following Pugachev after lifting the siege of Orenburg, and following his flight from defeated Kazan. In September 1774, Pugachev&#x27;s own Cossack lieutenants turned him over to the government troops.

Opposition to centralization of political authority led the Cossacks to participate in Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion. After their defeat, the Cossack elite accepted government reforms, hoping to secure status within the nobility. The ordinary Cossacks had to follow and give up their traditions and liberties.

=== In the Russian Empire ===
Cossack relations with the Tsardom of Russia were varied from the outset. At times they supported Russian military operations, at other times they rebelled against the central power. After one such uprising at the end of the 18th century, Russian forces destroyed the Zaporozhian Host. Many of the Cossacks who had remained loyal to the Russian Monarch and continued their service later moved to the Kuban. Others, choosing to continue a mercenary role, escaped control in the large Danube Delta. The service of the Cossacks in the Napoleonic wars led them to be celebrated as Russian folk heroes, and throughout the 19th century a &quot;powerful myth&quot; was promoted by the government that portrayed the Cossacks as having a special and unique bond to the Emperor. This image as the Cossacks as the ultra-patriotic defenders of not only Russia, but also of the House of Romanov was embraced by many ordinary Cossacks, making them into a force for conservatism.

By the 19th century, the Russian Empire had annexed the territory of the Cossack Hosts, and controlled them by providing privileges for their service such as exemption from taxation and allowing them to own the land they farmed. At this time, the Cossacks served as military forces in many wars conducted by the Russian Empire. Cossacks were considered excellent for scouting and reconnaissance duties, and for ambushes. Their tactics in open battle were generally inferior to those of regular soldiers, such as the Dragoons. In 1840, the Cossack hosts included the Don, Black Sea, Astrakhan, Little Russia, Azov, Danube, Ural, Stavropol, Mesherya, Orenburg, Siberian, Tobolsk, Tomsk, Yeniseisk, Irkutsk, Sabaikal, Yakutsk, and Tartar &quot;voiskos&quot;. In the 1890s, the Ussuri, Semirechensk, and Amur Cossacks were added; the last had a regiment of elite mounted rifles.

Increasingly as the 19th century went on, the Cossacks served as a mounted para-military police force in all of the various provinces of the vast Russian Empire, covering a territory stretching across Eurasia from what is now modern Poland to the banks of the river Amur that formed the Russian-Chinese border. The police forces of the Russian Empire, especially in rural areas, were undermanned owing to the low wages while the officers of the Imperial Russian Army hated having their units deployed to put down domestic unrest, which was viewed as destructive towards morale and possibly a source of mutiny. For the government, deploying Cossacks as a para-military police force was the best solution as the Cossacks were viewed as one of the social groups most loyal to the House of Romanov while their isolation from local populations was felt to make them immune to revolutionary appeals. Traditionally, Cossacks were viewed in Russia as dashing, romantic horsemen with a rebellious and wild aura about them, but their deployment as a mounted police force gave them a &quot;novel&quot; image as a rather violent and thuggish police force fiercely committed to upholding the social order. This change from an irregular cavalry force that fought against the enemies of Russia such as the Ottoman Empire and France to a mounted police force deployed against the subjects of the empire caused much disquiet within the Cossack Hosts as it was contrary to the heroic ethos of frontier warfare that the Cossacks cherished.

In 1879, the Shah of Iran, Nasir al-Din, who had been impressed with the equestrian skills and distinctive uniforms of the Cossacks while on a visit to Russia the previous year, requested that the Emperor Alexander II sent some Cossacks to train a Cossack force for himself. Alexander granted his request and later in 1879 a group of 9 Cossacks led by Kuban Cossack Colonel Aleksey Domantovich arrived in Tehran to train the Persian Cossack Brigade. The shah very much liked the colorful uniforms of the Cossacks and Domantovich devised uniforms for one regiment of the brigade based on the uniforms of the Kuban Cossack Host and another regiment had its uniform based on the Terek Cossack Host. The uniforms of the Cossacks were based on the flamboyant costumes of the peoples of the Caucasus, and what in Russia were viewed as exotic and colorful uniforms were viewed in Iran as a symbol of Russianness. Nasir al-Din, who was widely regarded as a deeply superficial and shallow man, was not interested in having his Cossack Brigade be an effective military force, and for him merely seeing his brigade ride before him while dressed in their brightly colored uniforms was quite enough. Over the shah&#x27;s indifference, Domantovich and his Cossacks worked hard on training the Cossack Brigade, which became the only disciplined unit in the entire Persian Army, and thus of considerable importance in maintaining the shah&#x27;s authority.

By the end of the 19th century, Cossack communities enjoyed a privileged tax-free status in the Russian Empire, although they had a 20-year military service commitment (reduced to 18 years from 1909). They were on active duty for five years, but could fulfill their remaining obligation with the reserves. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Cossacks numbered 4.5 million. They were organized as independent regional hosts, each comprising a number of regiments. The need for the government to call up Cossack men to serve either with the Army or a mounted police force caused many social and economic problems, which compounded by the growing impoverishment the communities of the Hosts.

Treated as a separate and elite community by the Tsar, the Cossacks rewarded his government with strong loyalty. His administration frequently used Cossack units to suppress domestic disorder, especially during the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Imperial Government depended heavily on the perceived reliability of the Cossacks. By the early 20th century, their decentralized communities and semi-feudal military service were coming to be seen as obsolete. The Russian Army Command, which had worked to professionalize its forces, considered the Cossacks less well disciplined, trained, and mounted than the hussars, dragoons, and lancers of the regular cavalry. The Cossack qualities of initiative and rough-riding skills were not always fully appreciated. As a result, Cossack units were frequently broken up into small detachments for use as scouts, messengers, or picturesque escorts.

====Cossacks between 1900 and 1917====
In 1905, the Cossack hosts experienced deep mobilization of their menfolk amid the fighting of the Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria and the outbreak of revolution within the Russian Empire. Like other peoples of the empire, some Cossack stanitsas voiced grievances against the regime by defying mobilization orders, or by making relatively liberal political demands. But these infractions were eclipsed by the prominent role of Cossack detachments in stampeding demonstrators and restoring order in the countryside. Subsequently, the wider population viewed the Cossacks as instruments of reaction. Tsar Nicholas II reinforced this concept by issuing new charters, medals, and bonuses to Cossack units in recognition for their performance during the Revolution of 1905.

In September 1906, reflecting the success of the Cossacks in putting down the Revolution of 1905, &quot;Polkovnik&quot; (Colonel) Vladimir Liakhov was sent to Iran to command the train and lead the Persian Cossack Brigade. Liakhov had led a Cossack squad in putting down the revolution in the Caucasus, and following the outbreak of the Constitutional Revolution in Iran he was sent to Tehran to recognize the Cossack Brigade as a force for power to the shah. The Persian Cossack Brigade had not been paid for months and proved to be dubious loyalty to the House of Qajar during the Constructional revolution while its Russian officers were uncertain what to do with Russia itself in revolution. Liakhov, a vigorous, able, and reactionary officer firmly committed to upholding absolute monarchies whatever in Russia or Iran, transformed the Persian Cossack Brigade into a mounted para-military police force rather than as a combat force. Liakhov was close to the new Shah, Mohammed Ali, who ascended to the Peacock Throne in January 1907, and it was due to the shah&#x27;s patronage that Liakhov transformed the Persian Cossack Brigade into the main bulwark of the Iranian state. In June 1908, Liakhov led the Cossack Brigade in bombarding the &quot;Majlis&quot; (Parliament) while being appointed military governor of Tehran as the shah attempted to do away with the constitution his father had been forced to grant in 1906 Reza Khan, who became the first Iranian to command the Cossack Brigade led the coup d&#x27;état in 1921 and in 1925 deposed the Qajars to found a new dynasty.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Cossacks became a key component in the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Army. The mounted Cossacks made up 38 regiments, plus some infantry battalions and 52 horse artillery batteries. Initially, each Russian cavalry division included a regiment of Cossacks in addition to regular units of hussars, lancers, and dragoons. By 1916, the Cossacks&#x27; wartime strength had expanded to 160 regiments, plus 176 independent sotnias (squadrons) employed as detached units.

The importance of cavalry in the frontlines faded after the opening phase of the war settled into a stalemate. During the remainder of the war, Cossack units were dismounted to fight in trenches, held in reserve to exploit a rare breakthrough, or assigned various duties in the rear. Those duties included rounding up deserters, providing escorts to war prisoners, and razing villages and farms in accordance with Russia&#x27;s scorched earth policy.

==Cossacks after the Russian Revolution==

===February Revolution, 1917 ===

====In Greater Russia====
At the outbreak of the disorder on 8 March 1917 that led to the overthrow of the tsarist regime, approximately 3,200 Cossacks from the Don, Kuban, and Terek Hosts were stationed in Petrograd. Although they comprised only a fraction of the 300,000 troops in the proximity of the Russian capital, their general defection on the second day of unrest (10 March) enthused raucous crowds and stunned the authorities and remaining loyal units.

In the aftermath of the February Revolution, the Cossacks hosts were authorized by the War Ministry of the Russian Provisional Government to overhaul their administrations. Cossack assemblies (known as &quot;krugs&quot; or, in the case of the Kuban Cossacks, a &quot;rada&quot;) were organized at regional level to elect atamans and pass resolutions. At national level, an all-Cossack congress was convened in Petrograd. This congress formed the Union of Cossack Hosts, ostensibly to represent the interests of Cossacks across Russia.

During the course of 1917, the nascent Cossack governments formed by the &quot;krugs&quot; and atamans increasingly challenged the Provisional Government&#x27;s authority in the borderlands. The various Cossack governments themselves faced rivals, in the form of national councils organized by neighboring minorities, and of soviets and &quot;zemstvos&quot; formed by non-Cossack Russians, especially the so-called &quot;outlanders&quot; who had immigrated to Cossack lands.

====In Ukraine====

Similarly to the events in imperial Cossack hosts, a revival of Cossack self-organization also took place in Ukraine, inspired by the traditions of the Zaporozhian Sich and Cossack Hetmanate. In April 1917 a congress in Zvenyhorodka, Kyiv Governorate, established Free Cossacks as a volunteer militia in order &quot;to defend the liberties of the Ukrainian people&quot; and maintain civil order. 

The revived Cossack structure in Ukraine was organized according to the territorial principle, with villages providing companies of volunteers, which were grouped into a kurin (battalion) on the volost level, subordinate to a regiment led by polkovnyk, which was itself part of a &quot;kish&quot; (division) led by an Ottoman. All officers of Free Cossacks were elected, and funds were provided from taxation. Most volunteers the organization were peasants, but industrial workers did also enlist themselves, especially in cities. 

During 1917 the Free Cossack movement spread around Kyiv, Volhynia, Kherson, Poltava and Chernihiv governorates. At the All-Ukrainian Congress of Free Cossacks in Chyhyryn on 16-20 October 1917 Pavlo Skoropadskyi was elected otaman of the movement.

=== Bolshevik uprising and Civil War, 1917–1922 ===

====Cossack autonomies in Don, Kuban and North Caucasus====

Soon after the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd on 7–8 November 1917, most Cossack atamans and their government refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new regime. The Don Cossack ataman, Aleksey Kaledin, went as far as to invite opponents of the Bolsheviks to the Don Host. But the position of many Cossack governments was far from secure, even within the boundaries of their hosts. In some areas, soviets formed by outlanders and soldiers rivaled the Cossack government, and ethnic minorities also tried to acquire a measure of self-rule. Even the Cossack communities themselves were divided, as the atamans tended to represent the interests of prosperous landowners and the officer corps. Poorer Cossacks, and those serving in the army, were susceptible to Bolshevik propaganda promising to spare &quot;toiling Cossacks&quot; from land appropriation.

The unwillingness of rank-and-file Cossacks to vigorously defend the Cossack government enabled the Red Army to occupy the vast majority of Cossack lands by late spring of 1918. But the Bolsheviks&#x27; policy of requisitioning grain and foodstuffs from the countryside to supply Russia&#x27;s starving northern cities quickly fomented revolt among Cossack communities. These Cossack rebels elected new atamans and made common cause with other anticommunist forces, such as the Volunteer Army in South Russia. Subsequently, the Cossack homelands became bases for the White movement during the Russian Civil War.

Throughout the civil war, Cossacks sometimes fought as an independent ally, and other times as an auxiliary, of White armies. In South Russia, the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) under General Anton Denikin relied heavily on conscripts from the Don and Kuban Cossack Hosts to fill their ranks. Through the Cossacks, the White armies acquired experienced, skilled horsemen that the Red Army was unable to match until late in the conflict. But the relationship between Cossack governments and the White leaders was frequently acrimonious. Cossack units were often ill-disciplined, and prone to bouts of looting and violence that caused the peasantry to resent the Whites. In Ukraine, Kuban and Terek Cossack squadrons carried out pogroms against Jews, despite orders from Denikin condemning such activity. Kuban Cossack politicians, wanting a semi-independent state of their own, frequently agitated against the AFSR command. In the Russian Far East, anticommunist Transbaikal and Ussuri Cossacks undermined the rear of Siberia&#x27;s White armies by disrupting traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railway and engaging in acts of banditry that fueled a potent insurgency in that region.

As the Red Army gained the initiative in the civil war during late 1919 and early 1920, Cossack soldiers, their families, and sometimes entire stanitsas retreated with the Whites. Some continued to fight with the Whites in the conflict&#x27;s waning stages in Crimea and the Russian Far East. As many as 80,000–100,000 Cossacks eventually joined the defeated Whites in exile.

Although the Cossacks were sometimes portrayed by Bolsheviks and, later, émigré historians, as a monolithic counterrevolutionary group during the civil war, there were many Cossacks who fought with the Red Army throughout the conflict, known as Red Cossacks. Many poorer Cossack communities also remained receptive to the communist message. In late 1918 and early 1919, widespread desertion and defection among Don, Ural, and Orenburg Cossacks fighting with the Whites produced a military crisis that was exploited by the Red Army in those sectors. After the main White armies were defeated in early 1920, many Cossack soldiers switched their allegiance to the Bolsheviks, and fought with the Red Army against the Poles and in other operations.

On 22 December 1917, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars effectively abolished the Cossack estate by ending their military service requirements and privileges. After the widespread anticommunist rebellions among Cossacks in 1918, the Soviet regime&#x27;s approach hardened in early 1919, when the Red Army occupied Cossack districts in the Urals and northern Don. The Bolsheviks embarked on a policy of &quot;de-Cossackization&quot;, intended to end the Cossack threat to the Soviet regime. This was pursued through resettlement, widespread executions of Cossack veterans from the White armies, and favoring the outlanders within the Cossack hosts. Ultimately, the de-Cossackization campaign led to a renewed rebellion among Cossacks in Soviet-occupied districts and produced a new round of setbacks for the Red Army in 1919.

When the victorious Red Army again occupied Cossack districts in late 1919 and 1920, the Soviet regime did not officially reauthorize the implementation of de-Cossackization. There is, however, disagreement among historians as to the degree of Cossack&#x27;s persecution by the Soviet regime. For example, the Cossack hosts were broken up among new provinces or autonomous republics. Some Cossacks, especially in areas of the former Terek host, were resettled so their lands could be turned over to natives displaced from them during the initial Russian and Cossack colonization of the area. At the local level, the stereotype that Cossacks were inherent counterrevolutionaries likely persisted among some Communist officials, causing them to target, or discriminate against, Cossacks despite orders from Moscow to focus on class enemies among Cossacks rather than the Cossack people in general.

====Ukrainian State====
Until January 1918, the Free Cossacks of Ukraine were subordinate to the Ukrainian General Secretariat of Internal Affairs. With the begin of the Ukrainian-Bolshevik War their units were incorporated into the regular army. However, after a number of battles against the Bolsheviks, Free Cossacks were disarmed in compliance with orders of the German command, whose troops had occupied Ukraine in March-April 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

On 29 April 1918 Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the earlier leader of Free Cossacks, was proclaimed Hetman of Ukraine at a congress of the conservative All-Ukrainian Union of Landowners. This coup was backed by generals of German and Austrian armies which were occupying Ukraine at that time. The previously democratic Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was replaced with the Hetmanate, the Central Rada and the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic were abolished, with all their powers, as well as command over the military, being transferred to Skoropadskyi, and private land ownership was reinstated. Local administration was entrusted to commissioners personally appointed by the hetman. 

To achieve legitimacy among the Ukrainian population, the Skoropadskyi styled his regime as a continuation of Ukrainian Cossack traditions of the 17-18th centuries. The hetman&#x27;s government included representatives of old Cossack nobility (starshyna), most prominently Fedir Lyzohub (head of the Conucil of Ministers) and Dmytro Doroshenko (Minister of Foreign Affairs). Skoropadskyi himself supported the idea of reviving the Cossack class in Ukraine as a privileged social group personally loyal to the hetman. However, his initiative was viewed with skepticism by his ministers, and the law on re-establishment of Cossack administration in Ukraine was adopted only in October 1918, shortly before the hetman&#x27;s resignation, and never realized.

During Skoropadskyi&#x27;s tenure in power the Ukrainian State developed diplomatic ties with Cossack entities in the Kuban and Don region.

=== Cossacks in the Soviet Union, 1922–1945 ===

Rebellions in the former Cossack territories erupted occasionally during the interwar period. In 1920–1921, disgruntlement with continued Soviet grain-requisitioning activities provoked a series of revolts among Cossack and outlander communities in South Russia. The former Cossack territories of South Russia and the Urals also experienced a devastating famine in 1921–1922. In 1932–1933, another famine, known as the Holodomor, devastated Ukraine and some parts of South Russia, causing a population decline of about 20–30%. While urban areas were less affected, the decline was even higher in the rural areas, populated largely by Cossacks. Robert Conquest estimates the number of famine-related deaths in the Northern Caucasus at about one million. Government officials expropriated grain and other produce from rural Cossack families, leaving them to starve and die. Many families were forced from their homes in the severe winter and froze to death. Mikhail Sholokhov&#x27;s letters to Joseph Stalin document the conditions and widespread deaths, as do eyewitness accounts. Besides starvation, the collectivization and dekulakization campaigns of the early 1930s threatened Cossacks with deportation to labor camps, or outright execution by Soviet security organs.

In April 1936, the Soviet regime began to relax its restrictions on Cossacks, allowing them to serve openly in the Red Army. Two existing cavalry divisions were renamed as Cossack divisions, and three new Cossack cavalry divisions were established. Under the new Soviet designation, anyone from the former Cossack territories of the North Caucasus provided they were not Circassians or other ethnic minorities, could claim Cossack status.

In World War II, during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, many Cossacks continued to serve in the Red Army. Some fought as cavalry in the Cossack divisions, such as the 17th Kuban Cossack Cavalry Corps and the famous Lev Dovator Corps, later awarded the honorific designation &quot;guard&quot; in recognition of its performance. Other Cossacks fought as partisans, although the partisan movement did not acquire significant traction during the German occupation of the traditional Cossack homelands in the North Caucasus.

The 4th Guards Cossacks Cavalry Corps took part in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 on Red Square.

=== Anticommunist Cossacks in exile and World War II, 1920–1945 ===

====Russian Cossack emigration====

The Cossack emigration consisted largely of relatively young men who had served, and retreated with, the White armies. Although hostile to communism, the Cossack émigrés remained broadly divided over whether their people should pursue a separatist course to acquire independence or retain their close ties with a future post-Soviet Russia. Many quickly became disillusioned with life abroad. Throughout the 1920s, thousands of exiled Cossacks voluntarily returned to Russia through repatriation efforts sponsored by France, the League of Nations, and even the Soviet Union.

The Cossacks who remained abroad settled primarily in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, France, Xinjiang, and Manchuria. Some managed to create farming communities in Yugoslavia and Manchuria, but most eventually took up employment as laborers in construction, agriculture, or industry. A few showcased their lost culture to foreigners by performing stunts in circuses or serenading audiences in choirs.

Cossacks who were determined to carry on the fight against communism frequently found employment with foreign powers hostile to Soviet Russia. In Manchuria, thousands of Cossacks and White émigrés enlisted in the army of that region&#x27;s warlord, Zhang Zuolin. After Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army occupied Manchuria in 1932, the ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks, Grigory Semyonov, led collaboration efforts between Cossack émigrés and the Japanese military.
In the initial phase of Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, Cossack émigrés were initially barred from political activity or travelling into the occupied Eastern territories. Hitler had no intention of entertaining the political aspirations of the Cossacks, or any minority group, in the USSR. As a result, collaboration between Cossacks and the Wehrmacht began in ad hoc manner through localized agreements between German field commanders and Cossack defectors from the Red Army. Hitler did not officially sanction the recruitment of Cossacks and lift the restrictions imposed on émigrés until the second year of the Nazi-Soviet conflict. During their brief occupation of the North Caucasus region, the Germans actively recruited Cossacks into detachments and local self-defense militias. The Germans even experimented with a self-governing district of Cossack communities in the Kuban region. When the Wehrmacht withdrew from the North Caucasus region in early 1943, tens of thousands of Cossacks retreated with them, either out of conviction or to avoid Soviet reprisals.

In 1943, the Germans formed the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division, under the command of General Helmuth von Pannwitz. While its ranks mostly comprised deserters from the Red Army, many of its officers and NCOs were Cossack émigrés who had received training at one of the cadet schools established by the White Army in Yugoslavia. The division was deployed to occupied Croatia to fight Tito&#x27;s Partisans. There, its performance was generally effective, although at times brutal. In late 1944, the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division was admitted into the Waffen-SS, and enlarged into the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps.

In late 1943, the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories and Wehrmacht headquarters issued a joint proclamation promising the Cossacks independence once their homelands were &quot;liberated&quot; from the Red Army. The Germans followed this up by establishing the Cossack Central Administration, under the leadership of the former Don Cossack ataman, Pyotr Krasnov. Although it had many attributes of a government-in-exile, the Cossack Central Administration lacked any control over foreign policy or the deployment of Cossack troops in the Wehrmacht. In early 1945, Krasnov and his staff joined a group of 20,000–25,000 Cossack refugees and irregulars known as &quot;Cossachi Stan&quot;. This group, then led by Timofey Domanov, had fled the North Caucasus alongside the Germans in 1943 and was moved between Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine, Navahrudak in Belarus, and Tolmezzo, Italy.
In early May 1945, in the closing days of WWII, both Domanov&#x27;s &quot;Cossachi Stan&quot; and Pannwitz&#x27;s XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps retreated into Austria, where they surrendered to the British. Many Cossack accounts collected in the two volume work &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot; by Vyacheslav Naumenko allege that British officers had given them, or their leaders, a guarantee that they would not be forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union, but there is no hard evidence that such a promise was made. At the end of the month, and in early June 1945, the majority of Cossacks from both groups were transferred to Red Army and SMERSH custody at the Soviet demarcation line in Judenburg, Austria. This episode is known as the Betrayal of the Cossacks, and resulted in sentences of hard labour or execution for the majority of the repatriated Cossacks.

====Ukrainian Hetman movement====

After his abdication on 14 December 1918, Ukrainian hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi emigrated to Germany. From there he led the so-called Hetman movement (), which consisted of a number of Ukrainian conservative monarchist organizations from different groups of Ukrainian diaspora. Most prominent of these organizations were the Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists () founded in Vienna by Vyacheslav Lypynskyi and Serhiy Shemet, and the United Hetman Organization () active in Canada and the United States. In his &quot;Letters to Brothers Agrarians&quot;, published in 1926, Lypynskyi elaborated the idea of an independent, classocratic, pan-Ukrainian &quot;toilers&#x27; monarchy&quot; without political parties, ruled by hetman and his dynasty with the help of an agrarian aristocracy and the co-operation of the productive classes. In Canada and the United States the Hetman movement emerged from the pre-WW1 Sich scouting societies and was implicitly supported by the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The movement supported the re-establishment of the Hetman state of Pavlo Skoropadskyi and devoted a lot of energy to military training of Ukrainian emigrés for the future liberation of their homelandgoing as far as to acquire a number of airplanes. In 1940 the Canadian branch of the organization became one of the founders of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. The North American Hetman movement reached the height of its influence around 1937-1938, when it was visited by Danylo Skoropadskyi, the hetman&#x27;s son and successor. However, the organizations lost their influence during WW2 and in the following years due to internal splits and government investigations into their activity.

=== Modern times ===
Following the war, Cossack units, and the cavalry in general, were rendered obsolete and released from the Soviet Army. In the post-war years, many Cossack descendants were thought of as simple peasants, and those who lived in one of the autonomous republics usually gave way to the local minority and migrated elsewhere.
The principal Cossack émigré leader after 1945 was Nikolai Nazarenko, the self-proclaimed president of the World Federation of the Cossack National Liberation Movement of Cossackia, who enjoyed a prominence in New York as the organizer of the annual Captive Nations parade held every July. In 1978, Nazarenko dressed in his Don Cossack uniform led the Captive Days day parade in New York city, and told a journalist: &quot;Cossackia is a nation of 10 million people. In 1923 the Russians officially abolished Cossackia as a nation. Officially, it no longer exists...America should not spend billions supporting the Soviets with trade. We don&#x27;t have to be afraid of the Russian army because half of it is made up of Captive Nations. They can never trust the rank and file&quot;. The journalist Hal McKenzie described Nazarenko as having &quot;cut a striking figure with his white fur cap, calf-length coat with long silver-sheathed dagger and ornamental silver cartridge cases on his chest&quot;. Nazarenko was also the president of Cossack American Republican National Federation, which in turn was part of the National Republican Heritage Groups Council, and he attracted much controversy in the 1980s owing to his wartime career and certain statements he made about Jews. The American journalist Christoper Simpson in his 1988 book &quot;Blowback: America&#x27;s Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War&quot; called Nazarenko a leading Republican activist who made &quot;explicit pro-Nazi, anti-semitic&quot; statements in his speeches.

During the Perestroika era of the Soviet Union of the late 1980s, many descendants of the Cossacks became enthusiastic about reviving their national traditions. In 1988, the Soviet Union passed a law allowing the reestablishment of former hosts and creation of new ones. The ataman of the largest, the Almighty Don Host, was granted Marshal rank and the right to form a new host. Simultaneously, many attempts were made to increase Cossack&#x27;s impact on Russian society, and throughout the 1990s many regional authorities agreed to hand over some local administration and policing duties to the Cossacks.

According to the 2002 Russian Census, 140,028 people self-identified as ethnic Cossacks. Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack identity in post-Soviet Russia and around the world.
In Ukraine the national revival of late 1980s led to the appreciation of Cossack history and culture as symbols of the Ukrainian nation. Cossack symbols and songs were widely used in mass events and demobstrations, particularly during the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1990. A number of Ukrainian Cossack organizations emerged during that time.

Cossacks have taken an active part in many of the conflicts that have taken place since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. These include the War of Transnistria, Georgian–Abkhazian conflict, Georgian–Ossetian conflict, First Nagorno-Karabakh War, 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh war, First Chechen War, Second Chechen War, and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine and both the subsequent War in Donbas and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Culture and organization ==
In early times, an ataman (later called hetman) commanded a Cossack band. He was elected by the Host members at a Cossack &quot;rada,&quot; as were the other important officials: the judge, the scribe, the lesser officials, and the clergy. The ataman&#x27;s symbol of power was a ceremonial mace, a &quot;bulava&quot;. Today, Russian Cossacks are led by atamans, and Ukrainian Cossacks by hetmans.

After the Polish–Russian Treaty of Andrusovo split Ukraine along the Dnieper River in 1667, Ukrainian Cossacks were known as Left-bank and Right-bank Cossacks. The ataman had executive powers, and in wartime was the supreme commander in the field. Legislative power was given to the Band Assembly (&quot;Rada&quot;). The senior officers were called &quot;starshyna&quot;. In the absence of written laws, the Cossacks were governed by the &quot;Cossack Traditions&quot; – the common, unwritten law.

Cossack society and government were heavily militarized. The nation was called a host (&quot;vois&#x27;ko&quot;, or &quot;viys&#x27;ko&quot;, translated as &quot;army&quot;). The people and territories were subdivided into regimental and company districts, and village posts (&quot;polky&quot;, &quot;sotni&quot;, and &quot;stanytsi&quot;). A unit of a Cossack troop could be called a Kurin. Each Cossack settlement, alone or in conjunction with neighboring settlements, formed military units and regiments of light cavalry or, in the case of Siberian Cossacks, mounted infantry. They could respond to a threat on very short notice.

A high regard for education was a tradition among the Cossacks of Ukraine. In 1654, when Macarius III Ibn al-Za&#x27;im, the Patriarch of Antioch, traveled to Moscow through Ukraine, his son, Deacon Paul Allepscius, wrote the following report:
===Groupings===
Russian Cossacks are divided into two broad groups: the Stepnoy (Ru:Степной), those of the Steppes, and the Kavkas (Ru:Кавкас), those of the Caucusus. In 1917 the Caucasians were divided into two hosts, the Kuban and the Terek, while the Steppe were divided into 8 hosts; the Don (the largest), Siberia, Orenburg, Astrakhan, Trans-Baikal, Semiretchi, Amur, and Ussurki voiskos.

=== Settlements ===
Russian Cossacks founded numerous settlements (&quot;stanitsas&quot;) and fortresses along troublesome borders. These included the forts Verny (Almaty, Kazakhstan) in south Central Asia; Grozny in North Caucasus; Fort Alexandrovsk (Fort Shevchenko, Kazakhstan); Krasnovodsk (Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan); Novonikolayevskaya stanitsa (Bautino, Kazakhstan); Blagoveshchensk; and towns and settlements along the Ural, Ishim, Irtysh, Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Amur, Anadyr (Chukotka), and Ussuri Rivers. A group of Albazin Cossacks settled in China as early as 1685.

Cossacks interacted with nearby peoples and exchanged cultural influences (the Terek Cossacks, for example, were heavily influenced by the culture of North Caucasian tribes). They also frequently intermarried with local non-Cossack settlers and local inhabitants, regardless of race or origin, sometimes setting aside religious restrictions. War brides brought from distant lands were also common in Cossack families. General Bogaevsky, a commander in the Russian Volunteer Army, mentions in his 1918 memoir that one of his Cossacks, Sotnik Khoperski, was a native Chinese who had been brought back as a child from Manchuria during the Russian-Japanese War of 1904–1905 and adopted and raised by a Cossack family.

Cossacks initially relied on raiding, herding, fishing and hunting, despising agriculture as lowly. After the defeat of Stenka Razin in 1672, the cossacks began transitioning to agriculture, but this would remain a secondary concern for cossacks until the late 19th century.

===Family life===
Historically, when Cossack men fought in permanent wars far from home, women took over the role of family leaders. Women were also called upon to physically defend their villages and towns from enemy attacks. In some cases, they raided and disarmed neighboring villages composed of other ethnic groups. Leo Tolstoy described such Cossack female chauvinism in his novel, &quot;The Cossacks&quot;. Relations between the sexes within the &quot;stanitsas&quot; were relatively egalitarian. The American historian Thomas Barrett wrote &quot;The history of Cossack women complicates general notions of patriarchy within Russian society&quot;.

When the Malorossian Cossack regiments were disbanded, those Cossacks who were not promoted to nobility, or did not join other estates, were united into a civil Cossack estate. Sergei Korolev&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a leader of the civil estate of the Zaporozhian Sich.

===Popular image===

Cossacks have long appealed to romantics as idealising freedom and resistance to external authority, and their military exploits against their enemies have contributed to this favorable image. For others, Cossacks are a symbol of repression, for their role in suppressing popular uprisings in the Russian Empire, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648–1657, and in pogroms, including those perpetrated by the Terek Cossacks during the Russian revolution and by various Cossack atamans in Ukraine in 1919, among them atamans Zeleny, Hryhoriv, and Semosenko.

Literary reflections of Cossack culture abound in Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish literature, particularly in the works of Nikolai Gogol (&quot;Taras Bulba&quot;), Taras Shevchenko, Mikhail Sholokhov (And Quiet Flows the Don), Henryk Sienkiewicz (&quot;With Fire and Sword&quot;). One of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s first novellas, &quot;The Cossacks&quot;, depicts their autonomy and estrangement from Moscow and from centralized rule. Many of Isaac Babel&#x27;s stories (for instance, those in Red Cavalry) depict Cossack soldiers, and were based on Babel&#x27;s experiences as a war correspondent attached to the 1st Cavalry Army.

Polish Romantic literature also commonly dealt with Cossack themes. Some of the Polish writers of this period (for instance, Michał Czajkowski and Józef Bohdan Zaleski) were known as &quot;Cossacophiles&quot; who wholeheartedly celebrated the Cossack history and lifestyle in their works. Others, such as Henryk Rzewuski and Michał Grabowski, were more critical in their approach.

In the literature of Western Europe, Cossacks appear in Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, and Richard Connell&#x27;s short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;. In many stories by adventure writer Harold Lamb, the main character is a Cossack.

During the Imperial period, Cossacks acquired an image as the ferocious defenders of the antisemitic Russian state. Still, during the Soviet era, Jews were encouraged to admire Cossacks as the antitheses of the &quot;parasitic&quot; and &quot;feeble dwellers of the shtetl.&quot; A number of Yiddish writers, including Khaim Melamud, , , and , presented fictionalized accounts of peaceful Jewish-Cossack coexistence, while efforts were made by the pro-Soviet press to present Khmelnytsky as a heroic figure and Cossacks as liberators from the Nazis.

Historiography interprets Cossackdom in imperial and colonial terms. In Ukraine, where Cossackdom represents historical and cultural heritage, some people have begun attempting to recreate the images of Ukrainian Cossacks. Traditional Ukrainian culture is often tied in with the Cossacks, and the Ukrainian government actively supports these attempts. The traditional Cossack &quot;bulava&quot; serves as a symbol of the Ukrainian presidency, and the island of Khortytsia, the origin and center of the Zaporozhian Sich, has been restored. The video game is a Ukrainian-made game series influenced by Cossack culture.

Cossacks are also mentioned outside Europe. The Japanese anime The Doraemons, part of the larger Doraemon anime series, has a Cossack character, Dora-nichov, who is from Russia.

===Music===
The official military march of Russian Cossacks units is &quot;Cossacks in Berlin&quot;, composed by Dmitry Pokrass and Daniil Pokrass, with lyrics being made by Caesar Solodar. Solodar was present when Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signed the act of surrender to allied forces. That same day, he left for Moscow and by the evening of 9 May, the song was written. The lyrics are as follows:

:English Translation
:On Berlin&#x27;s pavement.
:The horses from Don area were going
:Tossing by its mane
:The rider is singing: &quot;Eh, guys, it is not firstly for us
:To water Cossacks&#x27; horses
:From an alien river&quot;
:Cossacks
:Cossacks
:Our Cossacks are riding to Berlin
:He leads horses at a slow pace
:And sees that the girl, who has a signal flag in her hand
:And who has a nice plait under her sided cap
:Stands at the corner
:Her slender waist is like a rod
:And her eyes look by blue
:She bawls to the Cossack:
:&quot;Do not slow down traffic!&quot;
:Cossacks
:Cossacks
:Our Cossacks are riding to Berlin
:He is glad to stay more long here
:But he caught her angry eye
:And bawled reluctantly
:On riding: &quot;Come at a trot!&quot;
:The cavalry went by dashingly
:And the girl blossomed -
:She presents the tender look which doesn&#x27;t correspond military regulations
:To the Cossack
:Cossacks
:Cossacks
:Our Cossacks are riding to Berlin
:The horseman is riding again
:On Berlin&#x27;s pavement

:About his love to the girl: :&quot;Although I am far from Pacific Don 
:Although I am far from my sweet home
:I met the girl-fellow countryman
:Even in Berlin!&quot;
:Cossacks
:Cossacks,
:Our Cossacks are riding to Berlin

The S. Tvorun arrangement of the Zaporizhian March (known as the &quot;Cossack march&quot;) is one of the main marches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, replacing &quot;Farewell of Slavianka&quot; in 1991 as the official sendoff music for army recruits. The Kuban Cossack Choir is a leading folkloric ensemble that reflects the dances and folklore of the Kuban Cossack.

The second movement of Mily Balakirev&#x27;s Second Symphony is marked &quot;Scherzo alla Cosacca&quot;, which means &quot;scherzo in the style of the Cossacks&quot;.

===Ranks===
The Russian Empire organised its Cossacks into several &quot;voiskos&quot; (hosts), which lived along the Russian border and internal borders between Russian and non-Russian peoples. Each host originally had its own leadership, ranks, regalia, and uniforms. By the late 19th century, ranks were standardized following the example of the Imperial Russian Army. The ranks and insignia were kept after the 1988 law allowing the hosts to reform, and the 2005 law legally recognizing the hosts as a combat service. They are given below as per all military tickets that are standard for the Russian Army.


As with the ranks Polkovnik and General, the Colonel ranks are only stable for small hosts, being given to atamans of regional and district status. The smallest unit, the &quot;stanitsa&quot;, is commanded by a Yesaul. If the region or district lacks any other &quot;stanitsa&quot;s, the rank Polkovnik is applied automatically, but with no stars on the shoulder. As the hosts continue to grow, starless shoulder patches are becoming increasingly rare.

In addition, the supreme ataman of the largest Don Cossack Host is officially titled Marshal, and so wears insignia derived from the Russian/Soviet Marshal ranks, including the diamond Marshal Star. This is because the Don Cossack Supreme Ataman is recognized as the official head of all Cossack armies, including those outside the present Russian borders. He also has the authority to recognize and dissolve new hosts.

=== Uniforms ===

Cossacks were expected to provide their own uniforms. While these were sometimes manufactured in bulk by factories owned by the individual host, families often handed down garments or made them within the household. Accordingly, individual items might vary from those laid down by regulation, or be of obsolete pattern. Each host had distinctive uniform colourings. Similar uniforms are in service today amongst the Cossacks of Russia.

For most hosts, the basic uniform consisted of the standard loose-fitting tunics and wide trousers typical of Russian regular troops from 1881 to 1908, and shown in the two photographs opposite. In marked contrast the two Caucasian hosts (Kuban and Terek) wore the very long, open-fronted, &quot;cherkesska&quot; coats with ornamental cartridge loops and coloured &quot;beshmet&quot;s (waistcoats). These have come to epitomize the popular image of the Cossacks. Most hosts wore fleece hats with coloured cloth tops in full dress, and round caps with or without peaks for ordinary duties. These caps were worn sharply slanted to one side by the rank-and-file of Cossack regiments, over hair trimmed longer than that of ordinary Russian soldiers. The two Caucasian hosts wore high fleece caps on most occasions, together with black felt cloaks (&quot;burke&quot;) in bad weather.

Until 1909, Cossack regiments in summer wore white &quot;gymnasterkas&quot; (blouses) and cap covers of standard Russian army pattern. The shoulder straps and cap bands were in the host colour, as detailed below. From 1910 to 1918, they wore a khaki-grey jacket for field wear. The dress uniform had blue or green breeches with broad, coloured stripes in the host colour, which were often worn with the service jacket.

While most Cossacks served as cavalry, several of the larger hosts had infantry and artillery units. Three regiments of Cossacks formed part of the Imperial Guard, as well as the &quot;Konvoi&quot;—the tsar&#x27;s mounted escort. The Imperial Guard regiments wore tailored, government-issue uniforms, which were colourful and elaborate. For example, the &quot;Konvoi&quot; wore scarlet &quot;cherkesska&quot;s, white &quot;beshmet&quot;s, and red crowns on their fleece hats. The Guard Cossacks of His Majesty and the Ataman&#x27;s Guard Cossacks, both drawn from the Don Host, wore red, and light blue, coats respectively. The Combined Cossack Guard Regiment, comprising representative detachments from each of the remaining hosts, wore red, light blue, crimson, or orange coats, according to squadron.

== Modern-day Cossack identity ==
Ethnic, or &quot;born&quot; (&quot;prirodnye&quot;), Cossacks are those who can trace, or claim to trace, their ancestry to people and families identified as Cossack in the Tsarist era. They tend to be Christian, practicing as Orthodox Christians or Old Believers; though there are growing numbers of Rodnovers, especially among Ukrainian Cossacks.

Others may be initiated as Cossacks, particularly men in military service. Such initiates may be neither ethnic Slavs, nor Christian. Not all agree that such initiates should be considered Cossack. There is no consensus on an initiation rite or rules.

In other cases, individuals may wear Cossack uniform and pass themselves off as Cossack, perhaps because there is a large ethnic Cossack population in the area and the person wants to fit in. Others adopt Cossack clothing in an attempt to take on some of their mythic status. Ethnic Cossacks refer to the re-enactors as &quot;ryazhenye&quot; (ряженые, or &quot;dressed up phonies&quot;).

Because of the lack of consensus on how to define Cossacks, accurate numbers are not available. According to the Russian Census of 2010, 67,573 people identify as ethnic Cossack in Russia. Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack identity in Europe and across the world.

== Organizations ==

=== Americas ===
The Cossack Congress in America unites the Cossack communities of the North American Continent. It has branches in the U.S., Canada, and Colombia.

=== Armenia ===
On April 24, 1999, the founding meeting of the International Armenian-Cossack Friendship and Cooperation Association was held in Yerevan. There is a Separate Cossack District of the Great Don Army operating in Armenia. The organization was established by the decision of the Council of Atamans on December 15, 2015. It is a partner of the Ministry of Defense of Armenia.

=== Azerbaijan ===
The Association of Cossacks of Azerbaijan operates in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The association was established in 1992 and registered with the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan on 16 November 1994, with 1,500 members. Many Cossacks under the association join the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.

=== Belarus ===
There are 3 republican Cossack organizations in Belarus: the All-Belarusian United Cossacks, the All-Belarusian Unified Cossacks and the Belarusian Cossacks, which have existed since the mid-1990s.

==== Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation ====
The Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation are the Cossack paramilitary formation providing public and other services, under the Federal Law of the Russian Federation dated December 5, 2005, No. 154-FZ &quot;On State Service of the Russian Cossacks&quot;.

==== All-Russian Cossack Society ====
The All-Russian Cossack Society () is responsible for the coordination of the activities of all 11 registered Cossack hosts, particularly in the spheres of patriotic education and the continuity of historical Cossack customs and traditions. Both registered and non-registered Cossack organizations can be part of the society. On 4 November 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Kuban Vice Governor and Kuban Cossack Host Ataman Nikolai Doluda as Ataman of the All-Russia Cossack Society. Cossack General Doluda was appointed two years after the atamans and the Cossacks created it in October 2017. The idea was first proposed in 1994. On 27 November 2018, delegates of the Constitutive Assembly voted for the establishment of the society and adopted its official statute. Doluda was then nominated for head of the society, in which he was backed by the Presidential Council on Cossack Affairs.

==Propaganda and stereotypes==
The propaganda machine of Napoleon, a French military and political leader, spread the myth of &quot;English Cossacks&quot;. French propaganda portrayed the inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands as barbarian with non-human bodily functions, who allegedly felt great joy when destroying civilian housing, farmland, and even entire human settlements. This stereotype of Scottish people was later mingled with observations on Russian soldiers fighting on the European continent. In Europe &quot;Cossack&quot; is a titulation for a thief, while Russians have been stereotyped by French authors as exotic.

<text>The Manchurian Candidate is a 1962 American neo-noir psychological political thriller film directed and produced by John Frankenheimer. The screenplay is by George Axelrod, based on the 1959 Richard Condon novel &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. The film&#x27;s leading actors are Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, and Angela Lansbury, with co-stars Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, and James Gregory.

The plot centers on Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw, part of a prominent political family. Shaw is brainwashed by communists after his Army platoon is captured. He returns to civilian life in the United States, where he becomes an unwitting assassin in an international communist conspiracy. The group, which includes representatives of the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union, plans to assassinate the presidential nominee of an American political party, with the death leading to the overthrow of the U.S. government.

The film was released in the United States on October 24, 1962, at the height of U.S.–Soviet hostility during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was widely acclaimed by Western critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Angela Lansbury) and Best Editing. It was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Soviet and Chinese soldiers capture a U.S. Army platoon during the Korean War, taking them to communist China. Three days later, Sergeant Raymond Shaw and Captain Bennett &quot;Ben&quot; Marco return to UN lines. Upon Marco&#x27;s recommendation, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for saving his soldiers&#x27; lives in combat, though two men were killed. Shaw returns to the U.S., where his mother, Eleanor Iselin, exploits his heroism to further the political career of her husband, Senator John Iselin. When asked to describe Shaw, two soldiers in his unit uniformly respond that he is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being they have ever known. In fact, Shaw is a strict, cold, unsympathetic loner hated by his men.

After Marco is promoted to major and assigned to Army Intelligence, he has a recurring nightmare: a hypnotized Shaw blithely murders two soldiers from his platoon before an assembly of communist military leaders to demonstrate their revolutionary brainwashing technique. Marco learns that Allen Melvin, a fellow soldier, has the same nightmare. When Melvin and Marco separately identify identical photos of the two male communist leaders from their dreams, Army Intelligence agrees to investigate.
During captivity, Shaw was programmed as a sleeper agent, who obeys orders to kill and immediately forgets having done so. His heroism is a false memory implanted during the brainwashing. Agents trigger Shaw by suggesting he play solitaire; the queen of diamonds activates him. Meanwhile, Eleanor is masterminding John&#x27;s political ascent with his baseless claims that communists work at the Defense Department. To spite his mother and stepfather, Shaw takes a job at a newspaper published by Holborn Gaines, Iselin&#x27;s harshest critic. Communist agents later have Shaw murder Gaines to confirm that his brainwashing still works.

Chunjin, a North Korean agent who posed as a guide for Shaw&#x27;s platoon, arrives at Shaw&#x27;s apartment asking for work. The unsuspecting Shaw hires him as a valet and cook. Marco recognizes Chunjin when he visits Shaw; he violently attacks him and demands to know what happened during the platoon&#x27;s captivity. After Marco is arrested for assault, Eugenie &quot;Rosie&quot; Cheyney, an attractive young woman he met on the train, posts his bail.

Shaw rekindles a romance with Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan, the Iselins&#x27; chief political foe. Eleanor wants to garner Senator Jordan&#x27;s support for Iselin&#x27;s vice-presidential bid. Unswayed, Jordan insists he will oppose the nomination. After Jocelyn inadvertently triggers Shaw&#x27;s programming by wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume at the Iselins&#x27; party, they elope. Furious at Senator Jordan&#x27;s rebuff, Eleanor—who is Shaw&#x27;s American &quot;operator&quot; (handler)—sends him to kill Senator Jordan at his home. Shaw also kills Jocelyn when she inadvertently happens upon the murder scene. Having no memory of the killing, Shaw is grief-stricken upon learning they are dead.

After discovering the queen of diamonds card&#x27;s role in Shaw&#x27;s conditioning, Marco uses a forced deck to deprogram him, hoping to learn Shaw&#x27;s next assignment. Eleanor primes Shaw to assassinate their party&#x27;s presidential nominee during the convention so that Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the nominee by default. In the uproar, he will seek emergency powers to establish a strict authoritarian regime. Eleanor tells Shaw that she had requested a programmed assassin, never knowing it would be her own son. When taking power, she vows revenge upon her superiors for choosing him.

Disguised as a priest, Shaw enters Madison Square Garden, taking a sniper&#x27;s position in a vacant overhead spotlight booth. Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt, race to the convention to stop Shaw. At the last moment, Shaw aims away from the presidential nominee and instead kills Senator Iselin and Eleanor. When Marco bursts into the booth, Shaw, wearing the Medal of Honor, says he was the only one who could stop his mother and stepfather, then kills himself. Later that evening with Rosie, Marco mourns Shaw&#x27;s death.

==Cast==
==Production==
Sinatra suggested Lucille Ball for the role of Eleanor Iselin, but Frankenheimer, who had worked with Lansbury in &quot;All Fall Down&quot;, insisted that Sinatra watch her performance in that film before a final choice was made. Although Lansbury played Raymond Shaw&#x27;s mother, she was, in fact, only three years older than Laurence Harvey, who played Shaw. An early scene in which Shaw, recently decorated with the Medal of Honor, argues with his parents was filmed in Sinatra&#x27;s own private plane.

Janet Leigh plays Marco&#x27;s love interest. In a short biography of Leigh broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, her daughter, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, reveals that Leigh had been served divorce papers on behalf of her father, actor Tony Curtis, the morning that the scene where Marco and her character first meet on a train was filmed.

In the scene where Marco attempts to deprogram Shaw in a hotel room opposite the convention, Sinatra is at times slightly out of focus. It was a first take, and Sinatra failed to be as effective in subsequent retakes, a common factor in his film performances. In the end, Frankenheimer elected to use the out-of-focus take. Critics subsequently praised him for showing Marco from Shaw&#x27;s distorted point of view.

In the novel, Eleanor Iselin&#x27;s father had sexually abused her as a child. Before the dramatic climax, she uses her son&#x27;s brainwashing to have sex with him. Concerned with the reaction to even a reference to a taboo topic like incest in a mainstream film at that time, the filmmakers instead had Eleanor kiss Shaw on the lips to imply her incestuous attraction to him.

Nearly half the film&#x27;s $2.2 million production budget went to Sinatra&#x27;s salary for his performance.

== Cold War ==
&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; has been called one of the most &quot;iconic&quot; films of the Cold War period, especially in its discussion of &quot;mind-control.&quot; With one of the major plot points being the popular Cold War myth that China was brainwashing US soldiers for communist purposes during the Korean War. Political scientist Michael Rogin further cements the film in this time period by describing it as being &quot;a Kennedy Administration film.&quot; Rogin cites Sinatra&#x27;s character within the film as being a &quot;lonely Kennedy Hero,&quot; who works within the army bureaucracy towards reform.

=== Depiction of communists ===
In the garden scene, pictures of Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin are hung on the wall with a Soviet star in between them and the head of the Manchurian candidates standing beneath the star. This insinuates a collaboration between China and Russia with the goal to manipulate the US for communist world domination. During their demonstration, the communist leaders refer to Raymond as &quot;the mechanism&quot; and &quot;the weapon&quot;, which affirms the idea that communists only see people as gadgets that can be thrown away after their use. The film depicts communists as eager to give up their lives, which are expendable in their eyes anyway, for the cause of universal communism, which is a &quot;less than essential end&quot;.

In &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, communists are not peers, but instead relate to each other within the hierarchy of communist leaders. For example, there are rows of communist leaders who all look down upon the Manchurian Candidates in the garden scene. In addition, Raymond Shaw’s mother only uses those around her, like her son and husband, as pawns in her communist ploy to gain a powerful position through her husband’s candidacy for Vice President of the US. This is juxtaposed with the loving, trusting, and open relationships like those between Shaw and Jocelyn Jordan, and Marco and Cheyney.

=== Conspiracy theories and US mind control ===
&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; uses &quot;science, the conditioned subject, and the moving image&quot; to create a realistic framework for the existence of mind control. Specifically, it plays on the idea of a &quot;covert sphere&quot; of communism within the US, mixing real life events with those out of science fiction. This theme added to the growing suspicion of the US government, redirecting concerns of possible brainwashing toward the homefront. Janja Lalich, a counter-cult sociologist, notes that the term &quot;brainwashing&quot; used by this counterculture movement was first made popular by &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. The ever growing fear that anyone, even a decorated soldier like Raymond Shaw, could be coerced unwittingly by communists contributed to the United States’ expansion of their own mind control experiments. In 1975, a little over ten years after the release of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, the fear of a US-funded mind control scheme would come true with the reveal of Project MKUltra, in which the CIA looked to control human behavior through trauma programming and psychoactive drugs starting in the early 1950s and ending in 1973. According to the CIA, &quot;historians have asserted that creating a &#x27;Manchurian Candidate&#x27; subject through &#x27;mind control&#x27; techniques was a goal of MK-ULTRA and related CIA projects.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Film critic Roger Ebert listed &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, declaring that it is &quot;inventive and frisky, takes enormous chances with the audience, and plays not like a &#x27;classic&#x27;, but as a work as alive and smart as when it was first released&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; holds an approval rating of 97% rating based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 8.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A classic blend of satire and political thriller that was uncomfortably prescient in its own time, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; remains distressingly relevant today.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 94 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Academic response===
Scholars have used &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; as a window into Cold War paranoia. Professor Catherine Canino claimed that the film fulfilled the prophecies of &quot;the imagined loss of cherished American autonomy and free will&quot;. Political scientist Michael Rogin concluded that &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; &quot;aims to reawaken a lethargic nation to a communist menace&quot;. Humanities Center director [Timothy Melley] argued that &quot;&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;″s deepest worry is neither communism nor anticommunism but embattled human autonomy.&quot;

===Awards and honours===
In 1994, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film ranked 67th on the &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies&quot; when that list was first compiled in 1998, but a 2007 revised version excluded it. It was 17th on AFI&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills&quot; lists. In April 2007, Lansbury&#x27;s character was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 25 greatest villains in cinema history.
==Releases==
According to a false rumor, Sinatra removed the film from distribution after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963. According to Michael Schlesinger, who was responsible for the film&#x27;s 1988 reissue by MGM/UA, the film was never removed. Newspaper display ads indicate that after the assassination, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was rereleased less frequently or widely than other 1962 movies, but it was available. The movie played at a Brooklyn cinema in January 1964, and that same month in White Plains, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey. It was televised nationwide on &quot;CBS Thursday Night Movie&quot; on September 16, 1965.

Sinatra&#x27;s representatives acquired rights to the film in 1972 after the initial contract with United Artists expired. The film was rebroadcast on nationwide television in April 1974 on &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;. After a showing at the New York Film Festival in 1987 increased public interest in the film, the studio reacquired the rights and it became again available for theater and video releases.
