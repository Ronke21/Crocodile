<text>Bernoulli&#x27;s principle is a key concept in fluid dynamics that relates pressure, density, speed and height. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle states that an increase in the speed of a parcel of fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in either the pressure or the height above a datum. The principle is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli, who published it in his book &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot; in 1738. Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, it was Leonhard Euler in 1752 who derived Bernoulli&#x27;s equation in its usual form.

Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid is the same at all points that are free of viscous forces. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant. Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid—implying an increase in its kinetic energy—occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its potential energy (including the static pressure) and internal energy. If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and gravitational potential ) is the same everywhere.

Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can also be derived directly from Isaac Newton&#x27;s second Law of Motion. When fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.

Fluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.

Bernoulli&#x27;s principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. thermal radiation) are small and can be neglected. However, the principle can be applied to various types of flow within these bounds, resulting in various forms of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation. The simple form of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is valid for incompressible flows (e.g. most liquid flows and gases moving at low Mach number). More advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher Mach numbers.

== Incompressible flow equation ==

In most flows of liquids, and of gases at low Mach number, the density of a fluid parcel can be considered to be constant, regardless of pressure variations in the flow. Therefore, the fluid can be considered to be incompressible, and these flows are called incompressible flows. Bernoulli performed his experiments on liquids, so his equation in its original form is valid only for incompressible flow.

A common form of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is:
where:
*formula_1 is the fluid flow speed at a point,
*formula_2 is the acceleration due to gravity,
*formula_3 is the elevation of the point above a reference plane, with the positive formula_3-direction pointing upward—so in the direction opposite to the gravitational acceleration,
*formula_5 is the static pressure at the chosen point, and
*formula_6 is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid.

Bernoulli&#x27;s equation and the Bernoulli constant are applicable throughout any region of flow where the energy per unit mass is uniform. Because the energy per unit mass of liquid in a well-mixed reservoir is uniform throughout, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be used to analyze the fluid flow everywhere in that reservoir (including pipes or flow fields that the reservoir feeds) &quot;except&quot; where viscous forces dominate and erode the energy per unit mass.

The following assumptions must be met for this Bernoulli equation to apply:
* the flow must be steady, that is, the flow parameters (velocity, density, etc.) at any point cannot change with time,
* the flow must be incompressible—even though pressure varies, the density must remain constant along a streamline;
* friction by viscous forces must be negligible.

For conservative force fields (not limited to the gravitational field), Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be generalized as:
formula_7
where is the force potential at the point considered. For example, for the Earth&#x27;s gravity .

By multiplying with the fluid density , equation () can be rewritten as:
formula_8
or:
formula_9
where
* is dynamic pressure,
* is the piezometric head or hydraulic head (the sum of the elevation and the pressure head) and
* is the stagnation pressure (the sum of the static pressure and dynamic pressure ).

The constant in the Bernoulli equation can be normalized. A common approach is in terms of total head or energy head :
formula_10

The above equations suggest there is a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli&#x27;s equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids—when the pressure becomes too low—cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.

=== Simplified form ===
In many applications of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation, the change in the term is so small compared with the other terms that it can be ignored. For example, in the case of aircraft in flight, the change in height is so small the term can be omitted. This allows the above equation to be presented in the following simplified form:
formula_11
where is called total pressure, and is &quot; dynamic pressure&quot;. Many authors refer to the pressure as static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure . In &quot;Aerodynamics&quot;, L.J. Clancy writes: &quot;To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures, the actual pressure of the fluid, which is associated not with its motion but with its state, is often referred to as the static pressure, but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure.&quot;

The simplified form of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be summarized in the following memorable word equation:
Every point in a steadily flowing fluid, regardless of the fluid speed at that point, has its own unique static pressure and dynamic pressure . Their sum is defined to be the total pressure . The significance of Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can now be summarized as &quot;total pressure is constant in any region free of viscous forces&quot;. If the fluid flow is brought to rest at some point, this point is called a stagnation point, and at this point the static pressure is equal to the stagnation pressure.

If the fluid flow is irrotational, the total pressure is uniform and Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can be summarized as &quot;total pressure is constant everywhere in the fluid flow&quot;. It is reasonable to assume that irrotational flow exists in any situation where a large body of fluid is flowing past a solid body. Examples are aircraft in flight and ships moving in open bodies of water. However, Bernoulli&#x27;s principle importantly does not apply in the boundary layer such as in flow through long pipes.

=== Unsteady potential flow ===

The Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow is used in the theory of ocean surface waves and acoustics. For an irrotational flow, the flow velocity can be described as the gradient of a velocity potential . In that case, and for a constant density , the momentum equations of the Euler equations can be integrated to:formula_12

which is a Bernoulli equation valid also for unsteady—or time dependent—flows. Here denotes the partial derivative of the velocity potential with respect to time , and is the flow speed. The function depends only on time and not on position in the fluid. As a result, the Bernoulli equation at some moment applies in the whole fluid domain. This is also true for the special case of a steady irrotational flow, in which case and are constants so equation () can be applied in every point of the fluid domain. Further can be made equal to zero by incorporating it into the velocity potential using the transformation:formula_13
resulting in:
formula_14

Note that the relation of the potential to the flow velocity is unaffected by this transformation: .

The Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow also appears to play a central role in Luke&#x27;s variational principle, a variational description of free-surface flows using the Lagrangian mechanics.

== Compressible flow equation ==
Bernoulli developed his principle, with lots of help from his partner, Joshua Hales, from observations on liquids, and Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is valid for ideal fluids: those that are incompressible, irrotational, inviscid, and subjected to conservative forces. It is sometimes valid for the flow of gases: provided that there is no transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. In this case, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation—in its incompressible flow form—cannot be assumed to be valid. However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas (so the simple energy balance is not upset). According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature; however, this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.

It is possible to use the fundamental principles of physics to develop similar equations applicable to compressible fluids. There are numerous equations, each tailored for a particular application, but all are analogous to Bernoulli&#x27;s equation and all rely on nothing more than the fundamental principles of physics such as Newton&#x27;s laws of motion or the first law of thermodynamics.

=== Compressible flow in fluid dynamics ===
For a compressible fluid, with a barotropic equation of state, and under the action of conservative forces,
formula_15
where:
* is the pressure
* is the density and indicates that it is a function of pressure
* is the flow speed
* is the potential associated with the conservative force field, often the gravitational potential

In engineering situations, elevations are generally small compared to the size of the Earth, and the time scales of fluid flow are small enough to consider the equation of state as adiabatic. In this case, the above equation for an ideal gas becomes:
formula_16
where, in addition to the terms listed above:
* is the ratio of the specific heats of the fluid
* is the acceleration due to gravity
* is the elevation of the point above a reference plane

In many applications of compressible flow, changes in elevation are negligible compared to the other terms, so the term can be omitted. A very useful form of the equation is then:
formula_17

where:
* is the total pressure
* is the total density

=== Compressible flow in thermodynamics ===
The most general form of the equation, suitable for use in thermodynamics in case of (quasi) steady flow, is:

formula_18

Here is the enthalpy per unit mass (also known as specific enthalpy), which is also often written as (not to be confused with &quot;head&quot; or &quot;height&quot;).

Note that
formula_19
where is the thermodynamic energy per unit mass, also known as the specific internal energy. So, for constant internal energy formula_20 the equation reduces to the incompressible-flow form.

The constant on the right-hand side is often called the Bernoulli constant and denoted . For steady inviscid adiabatic flow with no additional sources or sinks of energy, is constant along any given streamline. More generally, when may vary along streamlines, it still proves a useful parameter, related to the &quot;head&quot; of the fluid (see below).

When the change in can be ignored, a very useful form of this equation is:
formula_21
where is total enthalpy. For a calorically perfect gas such as an ideal gas, the enthalpy is directly proportional to the temperature, and this leads to the concept of the total (or stagnation) temperature.

When shock waves are present, in a reference frame in which the shock is stationary and the flow is steady, many of the parameters in the Bernoulli equation suffer abrupt changes in passing through the shock. The Bernoulli parameter remains unaffected. An exception to this rule is radiative shocks, which violate the assumptions leading to the Bernoulli equation, namely the lack of additional sinks or sources of energy.

=== Unsteady potential flow ===
For a compressible fluid, with a barotropic equation of state, the unsteady momentum conservation equation
formula_22

With the irrotational assumption, namely, the flow velocity can be described as the gradient of a velocity potential . The unsteady momentum conservation equation becomes
formula_23
which leads to
formula_24

In this case, the above equation for isentropic flow becomes:
formula_25

== Derivations ==
{\mathrm{d}x} \left( \frac{v^2}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

With density constant, the equation of motion can be written as
formula_26
by integrating with respect to 
formula_27
where is a constant, sometimes referred to as the Bernoulli constant. It is not a universal constant, but rather a constant of a particular fluid system. The deduction is: where the speed is large, pressure is low and vice versa.

In the above derivation, no external work–energy principle is invoked. Rather, Bernoulli&#x27;s principle was derived by a simple manipulation of Newton&#x27;s second law.

; Derivation by using conservation of energy
Another way to derive Bernoulli&#x27;s principle for an incompressible flow is by applying conservation of energy. In the form of the work-energy theorem, stating that

Therefore,

The system consists of the volume of fluid, initially between the cross-sections and . In the time interval fluid elements initially at the inflow cross-section move over a distance , while at the outflow cross-section the fluid moves away from cross-section over a distance . The displaced fluid volumes at the inflow and outflow are respectively and . The associated displaced fluid masses are – when is the fluid&#x27;s mass density – equal to density times volume, so and . By mass conservation, these two masses displaced in the time interval have to be equal, and this displaced mass is denoted by :
formula_28

The work done by the forces consists of two parts:
* The &quot;work done by the pressure&quot; acting on the areas and formula_29
* The &quot;work done by gravity&quot;: the gravitational potential energy in the volume is lost, and at the outflow in the volume is gained. So, the change in gravitational potential energy in the time interval is
formula_30
Now, the work by the force of gravity is opposite to the change in potential energy, : while the force of gravity is in the negative -direction, the work—gravity force times change in elevation—will be negative for a positive elevation change , while the corresponding potential energy change is positive. So: formula_31
And therefore the total work done in this time interval is
formula_32
The &quot;increase in kinetic energy&quot; is
formula_33
Putting these together, the work-kinetic energy theorem gives:
formula_34
or
formula_35
After dividing by the mass the result is:
formula_36
or, as stated in the first paragraph:

Further division by produces the following equation. Note that each term can be described in the length dimension (such as meters). This is the head equation derived from Bernoulli&#x27;s principle:

The middle term, , represents the potential energy of the fluid due to its elevation with respect to a reference plane. Now, is called the elevation head and given the designation .

A free falling mass from an elevation (in a vacuum) will reach a speed
formula_37
when arriving at elevation . Or when rearranged as &quot;head&quot;:
formula_38
The term is called the &quot;velocity head&quot;, expressed as a length measurement. It represents the internal energy of the fluid due to its motion.

The hydrostatic pressure &quot;p&quot; is defined as
formula_39
with some reference pressure, or when rearranged as &quot;head&quot;:
formula_40
The term is also called the &quot;pressure head&quot;, expressed as a length measurement. It represents the internal energy of the fluid due to the pressure exerted on the container. The head due to the flow speed and the head due to static pressure combined with the elevation above a reference plane, a simple relationship useful for incompressible fluids using the velocity head, elevation head, and pressure head is obtained.

If Eqn. 1 is multiplied by the density of the fluid, an equation with three pressure terms is obtained:

Note that the pressure of the system is constant in this form of the Bernoulli equation. If the static pressure of the system (the third term) increases, and if the pressure due to elevation (the middle term) is constant, then the dynamic pressure (the first term) must have decreased. In other words, if the speed of a fluid decreases and it is not due to an elevation difference, it must be due to an increase in the static pressure that is resisting the flow.

All three equations are merely simplified versions of an energy balance on a system.

== Applications ==

In modern everyday life there are many observations that can be successfully explained by application of Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, even though no real fluid is entirely inviscid, and a small viscosity often has a large effect on the flow.
*Bernoulli&#x27;s principle can be used to calculate the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow in the vicinity of the foil is known. For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli&#x27;s principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli&#x27;s equations, which were established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight.
*The basis of a carburetor used in many reciprocating engines is a throat in the air flow to create a region of low pressure to draw fuel into the carburetor and mix it thoroughly with the incoming air. The low pressure in the throat can be explained by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, where air in the throat is moving at its fastest speed and therefore it is at its lowest pressure. The carburetor may or may not use the difference between the two static pressures which result from the Venturi effect on the air flow in order to force the fuel to flow, and as a basis a carburetor may use the difference in pressure between the throat and local air pressure in the float bowl, or between the throat and a Pitot tube at the air entry.
*An injector on a steam locomotive or a static boiler. 
*The pitot tube and static port on an aircraft are used to determine the airspeed of the aircraft. These two devices are connected to the airspeed indicator, which determines the dynamic pressure of the airflow past the aircraft. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle is used to calibrate the airspeed indicator so that it displays the indicated airspeed appropriate to the dynamic pressure.
*A De Laval nozzle utilizes Bernoulli&#x27;s principle to create a force by turning pressure energy generated by the combustion of propellants into velocity. This then generates thrust by way of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion.
*The flow speed of a fluid can be measured using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce the diameter of the flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli&#x27;s principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.
*The maximum possible drain rate for a tank with a hole or tap at the base can be calculated directly from Bernoulli&#x27;s equation and is found to be proportional to the square root of the height of the fluid in the tank. This is Torricelli&#x27;s law, which is compatible with Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. Increased viscosity lowers this drain rate; this is reflected in the discharge coefficient, which is a function of the Reynolds number and the shape of the orifice.

*The Bernoulli grip relies on this principle to create a non-contact adhesive force between a surface and the gripper.
*During a cricket match, bowlers continually polish one side of the ball. After some time, one side is quite rough and the other is still smooth. Hence, when the ball is bowled and passes through air, the speed on one side of the ball is faster than on the other, and this results in a pressure difference between the sides; this leads to the ball rotating (&quot;swinging&quot;) while travelling through the air, giving advantage to the bowlers.

== Misconceptions ==
=== Airfoil lift ===
One of the most common erroneous explanations of aerodynamic lift asserts that the air must traverse the upper and lower surfaces of a wing in the same amount of time, implying that since the upper surface presents a longer path the air must be moving over the top of the wing faster than over the bottom. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle is then cited to conclude that the pressure on top of the wing must be lower than on the bottom.

Equal transit time applies to the flow around a body generating no lift, but there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time in cases of bodies generating lift. In fact, theory predicts – and experiments confirm – that the air traverses the top surface of a body experiencing lift in a &quot;shorter&quot; time than it traverses the bottom surface; the explanation based on equal transit time is false. While the equal-time explanation is false, it is not the Bernoulli principle that is false, because this principle is well established; Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is used correctly in common mathematical treatments of aerodynamic lift.

=== Common classroom demonstrations ===
There are several common classroom demonstrations that are sometimes incorrectly explained using Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. One involves holding a piece of paper horizontally so that it droops downward and then blowing over the top of it. As the demonstrator blows over the paper, the paper rises. It is then asserted that this is because &quot;faster moving air has lower pressure&quot;.

One problem with this explanation can be seen by blowing along the bottom of the paper: if the deflection was caused by faster moving air, then the paper should deflect downward; but the paper deflects upward regardless of whether the faster moving air is on the top or the bottom. Another problem is that when the air leaves the demonstrator&#x27;s mouth it has the &quot;same&quot; pressure as the surrounding air; the air does not have lower pressure just because it is moving; in the demonstration, the static pressure of the air leaving the demonstrator&#x27;s mouth is &quot;equal&quot; to the pressure of the surrounding air. A third problem is that it is false to make a connection between the flow on the two sides of the paper using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation since the air above and below are &quot;different&quot; flow fields and Bernoulli&#x27;s principle only applies within a flow field.

As the wording of the principle can change its implications, stating the principle correctly is important. What Bernoulli&#x27;s principle actually says is that within a flow of constant energy, when fluid flows through a region of lower pressure it speeds up and vice versa. Thus, Bernoulli&#x27;s principle concerns itself with &quot;changes&quot; in speed and &quot;changes&quot; in pressure &quot;within&quot; a flow field. It cannot be used to compare different flow fields.

A correct explanation of why the paper rises would observe that the plume follows the curve of the paper and that a curved streamline will develop a pressure gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow, with the lower pressure on the inside of the curve. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle predicts that the decrease in pressure is associated with an increase in speed; in other words, as the air passes over the paper, it speeds up and moves faster than it was moving when it left the demonstrator&#x27;s mouth. But this is not apparent from the demonstration.

Other common classroom demonstrations, such as blowing between two suspended spheres, inflating a large bag, or suspending a ball in an airstream are sometimes explained in a similarly misleading manner by saying &quot;faster moving air has lower pressure&quot;.

<doc id="64221" wikidata="Q837132" url="?curid=64221" title="Biorhythm (pseudoscience)">
<text>The biorhythm theory is the pseudoscientific idea that peoples&#x27; daily lives are significantly affected by rhythmic cycles with periods of exactly 23, 28 and 33 days, typically a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle. The idea was developed by German otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s. The proposal has been independently tested and, consistently, no validity for it has been found.

According to the notion of biorhythms, a person&#x27;s life is influenced by rhythmic biological cycles that affect his or her ability in various domains, such as mental, physical, and emotional activity. These cycles begin at birth and oscillate in a steady (sine wave) fashion throughout life, and by modeling them mathematically, it is suggested that a person&#x27;s level of ability in each of these domains can be predicted from day to day. It is built on the idea that the biofeedback chemical and hormonal secretion functions within the body could show a sinusoidal behavior over time.

Most biorhythm models use three cycles: a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle. These cycles are to be adjusted based on the person&#x27;s personal day clock which may run from 22 hours to 27 hours although 23-25 is the norm. Two ways one can find their personal day clock is to test one&#x27;s grip and body temperature every 15 minutes for a few days or the same time each day for a few months. Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle and was originally described as a &quot;female&quot; cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in synchronization. Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as &quot;critical days&quot; of greater risk or uncertainty.

The numbers from +100% (maximum) to -100% (minimum) indicate where on each cycle the rhythms are on a particular day. In general, a rhythm at 0% is crossing the midpoint and is thought to have no real impact on one&#x27;s life, whereas a rhythm at +100% (at the peak of that cycle) would give one an edge in that area, and a rhythm at -100% (at the bottom of that cycle) would make life more difficult in that area. There is no particular meaning to a day on which one&#x27;s rhythms are all high or all low, except the obvious benefits or hindrances that these rare extremes are thought to have on one&#x27;s life.

In addition to the three popular cycles, various other cycles have been proposed, based on linear combination of the three, or on longer or shorter rhythms.

== Calculation ==
Theories published state the equations for the cycles as:
* physical: formula_1,
* emotional: formula_2,
* intellectual: formula_3,
where formula_4 indicates the number of days since birth. Basic arithmetic shows that the combination of the simpler 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days (or 1 years), while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeats every 21,252 days (or 58.18+ years).

==History==
The 23- and 28-day rhythms used by biorhythmists were first devised in the late 19th century by Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin physician and friend of Sigmund Freud. Fliess believed that he observed regularities at 23- and 28-day intervals in a number of phenomena, including births and deaths. He labeled the 23-day rhythm &quot;male&quot; and the 28-day rhythm &quot;female&quot;, matching the menstrual cycle.

In 1904, Viennese psychology professor Hermann Swoboda came to similar conclusions. Alfred Teltscher, professor of engineering at the University of Innsbruck, developed Swoboda&#x27;s work and suggested that his students&#x27; good and bad days followed a rhythmic pattern; he believed that the brain&#x27;s ability to absorb, mental ability, and alertness ran in 33-day cycles. One of the first academic researchers of biorhythms was Estonian-born Nikolai Pärna, who published a book in German called &quot;Rhythm, Life and Creation&quot; in 1923.

The practice of consulting biorhythms was popularized in the 1970s by a series of books by Bernard Gittelson, including &quot;Biorhythm—A Personal Science&quot;, &quot;Biorhythm Charts of the Famous and Infamous&quot;, and &quot;Biorhythm Sports Forecasting&quot;. Gittelson&#x27;s company, Biorhythm Computers, Inc., made a business selling personal biorhythm charts and calculators, but his ability to predict sporting events was not substantiated.

Charting biorhythms for personal use was popular in the United States during the 1970s; many places (especially video arcades and amusement areas) had a biorhythm machine that provided charts upon entry of date of birth. Biorhythm programs were a common application on personal computers; and in the late 1970s, there were also handheld biorhythm calculators on the market, the &quot;Kosmos 1&quot; and the Casio &quot;Biolator&quot;.

==Critical views==

There have been some three dozen published studies of biorhythm theory, but according to a study by Terence Hines, all of those either supported the null hypothesis that there is no correlation of human experience and the supposed biorhythms beyond what can be explained by coincidence, or, in cases where authors claimed to have evidence for biorhythm theory, methodological and statistical errors invalidated their conclusions. Hines therefore concluded that the theory is not valid.

Supporters continued to defend the theory in spite of the lack of corroborating scientific evidence, leading to the charge that it had become a kind of pseudoscience due to its proponents&#x27; rejection of empirical testing:
The physiologist Gordon Stein in the book &quot;Encyclopedia of Hoaxes&quot; (1993) wrote:Both the theoretical underpinning and the practical scientific verification of biorhythm theory are lacking. Without those, biorhythms became just another pseudoscientific claim that people are willing to accept without required evidence. Those pushing biorhythm calculators and books on a gullible public are guilty of making fraudulent claims. They are hoaxers of the public if they know what they are saying has no factual justification.A 1978 study of the incidence of industrial accidents found neither empirical nor theoretical support for the biorhythm model.

In Underwood Dudley&#x27;s book, &quot;Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought&quot;, he provides an example of a situation in which a magician provides a woman her biorhythm chart that supposedly included the next two years of her life. The women sent letters to the magician describing how accurate the chart was. The magician purposely sent her a biorhythm chart based on a different birthdate. After he explained that he sent the wrong chart to her, he sent her another chart, also having the wrong birthdate. She then said that this new chart was even more accurate than the previous one. This kind of willful credulous belief in vague or inaccurate prognostication derives from motivated reasoning backed up by fallacious acceptance of confirmation bias, post hoc rationalization, and suggestibility.

Wilhelm Fliess &quot;was able to impose his number patterns on virtually everything&quot; and worked to convince others that cycles happen within men and women every 23 and 28 days. Mathematically, Fliess&#x27;s equation, n = 23x +28y is unconstrained as there are infinitely many solutions for x and y, meaning that Fliess and Sigmund Freud (who adopted this idea in the early 1890s) could predict anything they wanted with the combination.

The skeptical evaluations of the various biorhythm proposals led to a number of critiques lambasting the subject published in the 1970s and 1980s. Biorhythm advocates who objected to the takedowns claimed that because circadian rhythms had been empirically verified in many organisms&#x27; sleep cycles, biorhythms were just as plausible. However, unlike biorhythms, which are claimed to have precise and unaltering periods, circadian rhythms are found by observing the cycle itself and the periods are found to vary in length based on biological and environmental factors. Assuming such factors were relevant to biorhythms would result in chaotic cycle combinations that remove any &quot;predictive&quot; features.

=== Additional studies ===
Several controlled, experimental studies found no correlation between the 23, 28 and 33 day cycles and academic performance. These studies include:

==== James (1984) ====
James hypothesized that if biorhythms were rooted in science, then each proposed biorhythm cycle would contribute to task performance. Further, he predicted that each type of biorhythm cycle (i.e., intellectual, physical, and emotional) would be most influential on tasks associated with the corresponding cycle type. For example, he postulated that intellectual biorhythm cycles would be most influential on academic testing performance. In order to test his hypotheses, James observed 368 participants, noting their performance on tasks associated with intellectual, physical, and emotional functioning. Based on data collected from his experimental research, James concluded that there was no relation between subjects&#x27; biorhythmic status (on any of the three cycle types), and their performance on the associated practical tests.

==== Peveto (1980) ====
Peveto examined the proposed relationship between biorhythms and academic performance, specifically in terms of reading ability. Through examination of the data collected, Peveto concluded that there were no significant differences in the academic performance of the students, in regards to reading, during the high, low, or critical positions of neither the physical biorhythm cycle, the emotional biorhythm cycle, nor the intellectual biorhythm cycle. As a result, it was concluded that biorhythm cycles have no effect on the academic performance of students, when academic performance was measured using reading ability.

<doc id="64222" wikidata="Q338948" url="?curid=64222" title="Milo of Croton">
<text>Milo or Milon of Croton () was a famous ancient Greek athlete from the Greek colony of Croton in Magna Graecia.

He was a six-time Olympic victor; once for boys wrestling in 540 BC at the 60th Olympics, and five-time wrestling champion at the 62nd through 66th Olympiads. Milo kept on competing, even well after what would have been considered a normal Olympic athlete&#x27;s prime; by the 67th Olympiad, he would have been over 40 years of age. He also attended many of the Pythian Games.

His historicity is attested by many classical authors, among them Aristotle, Pausanias, Cicero, Herodotus, Vitruvius, Epictetus, and the author of the &quot;Suda&quot;, but there are many legendary stories surrounding him. 

Diodorus Siculus wrote in his history that Milo was a follower of Pythagoras and also that he commanded the Crotonian army which defeated the Sybarites in 511 BC, while wearing his Olympic wreaths and dressed like Heracles in a lion&#x27;s skin and carrying a club.

Hereupon the Sybarites took the field with an army of three hundred thousand men. The Crotonians had but an hundred thousand, which were commanded by Milo the wrestler, who at the first onset put to flight that wing of the army which was opposite to him: for he was of invincible strength, and had courage answerable to his strength, and had been six times victor at the olympic games; when he began his fight, he was crowned with olympic wreaths, wearing (like Hercules) a lion&#x27;s skin and a club; at last he gained an absolute victory, and thereupon was much admired by his countrymen.

Milo&#x27;s death became a popular subject in art in late Italian Renaissance sculpture, continuing to around 1900, allowing the sculptor to show his skill in a dramatic anatomical pose. It was a more compact equivalent of the Roman group of &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot;.

==Feats of strength==
Ancient sources and legends report that he took great pleasure in showing off his strength. He had a number of feats he would perform, such as:
* He would hold his arm out, with fingers outstretched, and challenge people to attempt to bend his little finger.
* He would stand on a greased iron disk and challenge people to push him off of it.
* He would hold a pomegranate in one hand, and challenge others to take it from him. Nobody ever could, and despite him holding the fruit very tightly, it was never damaged.
* He would train in the off years by carrying a newborn calf on his back every day until the Olympics took place. By the time the events were to take place, he was carrying a four-year-old cow on his back. He carried the full-grown cow the length of the stadium, then proceeded to kill, roast, and eat it.

==Death==

Legend has it that such feats were his eventual undoing. His final test of strength came when he was traveling the countryside and met a villager trying to split a stump with hammer and wedges. Milo excitedly asked the man if he could attempt to split the wood with his strength, not using any tools at all. The villager, honored by Milo&#x27;s offer, went off to fetch food while Milo worked. Milo immediately tried to pull the stump apart by inserting his fingers in the crack where the villager had driven the wedges. As he pulled the stump open, the wedges fell out, trapping Milo&#x27;s fingers. Without the wedges there to hold the crack open, when Milo tried, he could not free his fingers from the stump. There he waited for the villager to return with food. Legend then says that Milo met his end when wolves, or a lion, took advantage of his predicament and descended upon him.

<text>Powerlifting is a competitive strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as &quot;odd lifts&quot;, which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually, odd lifts became standardized to the current three.

In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or unequipped (typically referred to as &#x27;classic&#x27; or &#x27;raw&#x27; lifting in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not unequipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and unequipped lifting. Weightlifting belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from unequipped lifting.

Competitions take place across the world. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF.

==History==
===Early history===
The roots of powerlifting are found in traditions of strength training stretching back as far as the ancient Mayan civilizations and ancient Persian times. The idea of powerlifting originated in ancient Greece, as men lifted stones to prove their strength and manhood. The modern sport originated in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1950s. Previously, the weightlifting governing bodies in both countries had recognized various &quot;odd lifts&quot; for competition and record purposes. During the 1950s, Olympic weightlifting declined in the United States, while strength sports gained many new followers. People did not like the Olympic lifts Clean and Press, Snatch and Clean and Jerk. In 1958, the National Weightlifting Committee of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) decided to begin recognizing records for odd lifts. The first national competition was held in September 1964 under the auspices of the York Barbell Company. York Barbell owner Bob Hoffman had been a longtime adversary of the sport, but his company was now making powerlifting equipment to make up for the sales it had lost on Olympic equipment.

During the late 1950s, Hoffman&#x27;s influence on Olympic lifting and his predominately Olympics-focused magazine &quot;Strength and Health&quot; were beginning to come under increasing pressure from Joe Weider&#x27;s organization. In order to combat the growing influence of Weider, Hoffman started another magazine, &quot;Muscular Development&quot;, which would be focused more on bodybuilding and the fast-growing interest in odd lift competitions. The magazine&#x27;s first editor was John Grimek. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, various odd lift events gradually developed into the specific lifts of the bench press, squat, and deadlift, and were lifted in that order. Hoffman became more and more influential in the development of this new lifting sport and organized the Weightlifting Tournament of America in 1964, effectively the first USA National championships. In 1965, the first named USA National Championships were held. During the same period, lifting in Britain also had factions. In the late 1950s, because members of the ruling body (BAWLA, the British Amateur Weight Lifters&#x27; Association) were only interested in the development of Olympic lifting, a breakaway organization called the Society of Amateur Weightlifters had been formed to cater for the interests of lifters who were not particularly interested in Olympic lifting.

Although at that time there were 42 recognized lifts, the &quot;Strength Set&quot; (biceps curl, bench press, and squat) soon became the standard competition lifts, and both organizations held Championships on these lifts (as well as on the Olympic lifts) until 1965. In 1966, the Society of Amateur Weightlifters rejoined BAWLA. The bicep curl was replaced with the deadlift to fall in line with the American lifts. The first British Championship was held in 1966. During the late 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, various international contests were held. At the same time, in early November of each year and to commemorate Hoffman&#x27;s birthday, a prestigious lifting contest was held. In 1971, it was decided to make this event the &quot;World Weightlifting Championships&quot;. The event was held at 10 AM on 6 November 1971, in York, Pennsylvania. Most of the athletes were American lifters, since teams were not formed yet. There were also four British athletes, and one athlete from Jamaica. All of the referees were American. Weights were in pounds. The lifting order was &quot;rising bar&quot;, and the first lift was the bench press. There was no such thing as a bench shirt or squat suit, and various interpretations were held regarding the use and length of knee wraps and weightlifting belts. The IPF rules system did not exist yet, nor had world records been established.

In 1972, the second AAU World Championships were held on 10 and 11 November. There were eight athletes from Great Britain, six from Canada, six from Puerto Rico, three from Zambia, and one from the West Indies. With 67 lifters in total, 47 athletes were Americans. Lifts were measured in pounds, and the bench press was the first lift.

===IPF and after===
The International Powerlifting Federation was formed in November of 1972. The inaugural IPF World Championships was held in York on November of 1973. There were 47 entrants: one Swedish athlete, one Puerto Rican athlete, two Canadian athletes, one West Indian athlete, eight British athletes, and 34 American athletes. 1974 was the first time that teams were selected in advance, as well as the inclusion of the 52 kilogram weight class. In 1975, the World Championships was held outside America for the first time, at the town hall in Birmingham, hosted by Vic Mercer.

The establishment of the IPF in 1973 spurred the establishment of the EPF (European Powerlifting Federation) in May 1977. Since it was closely associated with bodybuilding and women had been competing as bodybuilders for years, powerlifting was opened to them. The first U.S. national championships for women were held in 1978. The IPF added women&#x27;s competition in 1980. In the US, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 required that each Olympic or potential Olympic sport must have its own national governing body by November 1980. As a result, the AAU lost control of every amateur sport. The USPF was founded in 1980 as the new national governing body for American powerlifting. In 1981, the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA), led by Brother Bennett, became the first federation to break away from the USPF, citing the need to implement effective drug testing in the sport. In 1982, drug testing was introduced to the IPF, although the USPF championships that year did not have drug testing.

The IPF&#x27;s push for drug testing was resisted by several American lifters. In 1982, Larry Pacifico and Ernie Frantz founded the American Powerlifting Federation (APF), which advertised its categorical opposition to all drug testing.

In 1984, powerlifting was included into the Paralympic Games for men with spinal cord injuries. At the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, women were invited to participate in powerlifting. Both men and women are allowed to compete in 10 weight classes respectively.

In 1987, the American Powerlifting Association (APA) and World Powerlifting Alliance (WPA) were formed by Scott Taylor. The APA offer both drug tested and untested categories in most of their competitions. As of 2024, the WPA has over 60 affiliate nations.

The USPF failed to conform to IPF demands and was expelled from the international body in 1997, with the ADFPA, now named USA Powerlifting (USAPL), taking its place (now replaced by Powerlifting America). Despite the trend towards federations, each with their own rules and standards of performance, some powerlifters have attempted to bring unity to the sport. For example, 100% RAW promoted unequipped competition and merged with another federation, Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU), in 2013. The Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate (RPS), founded by Gene Rychlak in 2011, was considered a move towards unity, as the RPS breaks the tradition of charging lifters membership fees to a specific federation in addition to entry fees for each competition. Some meet promoters have sought to bring together top lifters from different federations, outside existing federations&#x27; hierarchy of local, regional, national and international meets; a prominent example of this is the Raw Unity Meet (RUM), held annually since 2007.

===Developments in equipment and rules===
As new equipment was developed, it came to distinguish powerlifting federations from one another. Weightlifting belts and knee wraps (originally simple Ace bandages) predated powerlifting, but in 1983 John Inzer invented the first piece of equipment distinct to powerlifters—the bench shirt. Bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits (operating on the same principle) became ubiquitous in powerlifting, but only some federations adopted the latest and most supportive canvas, denim, and multiply polyester designs, while others such as the IPF maintained more restrictive rules on which supportive equipment could be used. The Monolift, a rack in which the bar catchers swing out and eliminate the walkout portion of the squat, was invented by Ray Madden and first used in competition in 1992. This innovation was adopted by some federations and forbidden in others. Other inventions included specialized squat bars and deadlift bars, moving away from the IPF standard of using the same bar for all three lifts.

The rules of powerlifting have also evolved and differentiated. For example, in ADFPA/USAPL competition, the &quot;press&quot; command on the bench press was used, not used, and then used again, following a 2006 IPF motion to reinstate this rule. IPF rules also mandate a &quot;start&quot; command at the beginning of the bench press. Many other federations, for example, the Natural Athlete Strength Association (NASA), have never used the &quot;start&quot; command. As a further example of diversifying rules of performance, in 2011 the Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF) eliminated the &quot;squat&quot; command at the beginning of the squat. Most federations also now allow the sumo deadlift, which the athletes foot position is outside their grip position. Many communities and federations do not class the sumo variation as a technical deadlift. Another rule change into effect from the IPF, is the bench press elbow depth rule, established in 2022 and into effect at the start of 2023. This rule, similar to squat depth, requires the bottom surface of the elbows to be in line with or below the top surface of the shoulder joint.

==Supportive equipment==
In powerlifting, supportive equipment refers to supportive shirts, briefs, suits, and sometimes knee wraps made of materials that store elastic potential energy and thereby assist the three lifts contested in powerlifting. Some federations allow single-ply knee sleeves, and wraps for wrists in raw competition. Straps are also used in deadlift training in case of a weak grip, but are not allowed by any federations in official competitions. A weight lifting belt is the only supportive equipment that is allowed by all federations in raw competition. The use of supportive equipment distinguishes &#x27;equipped&#x27; and &#x27;unequipped&#x27; (also known as &#x27;raw&#x27;) divisions in the sport, and &#x27;equipped&#x27; and &#x27;unequipped&#x27; records in the competition lifts. The wide differences between equipped and unequipped records in the squat and bench press suggest that supportive equipment confers a substantial advantage to lifters in these disciplines. This is less evident in the case of the deadlift, where the lack of an eccentric component to the lift minimizes how much elastic energy can be stored in a supportive suit. Supportive equipment should not be confused with the equipment on which the lifts are performed, such as a bench press bench, or conventional or monolift stand for squat or the barbell and discs. Chalk is commonly used by lifters to dry the hands to reduce blisters, slipping and improve grip strength, as the contents of the chalk is made out of magnesium carbonate. Chalk can also be added to the shoulders for squatting, on the back for bench pressing to reduce sliding, and on the hands to grip the barbell on the bench press and deadlift.

=== Principles of operation ===
Supportive equipment is used to increase the weight lifted in powerlifting exercises. A snug garment is worn over a joint or joints (such as the shoulders or hips). This garment deforms during the downward portion of a bench press or squat, or the descent to the bar in the deadlift, storing elastic potential energy. On the upward portion of each lift, the elastic potential energy is transferred to the barbell as kinetic energy, aiding in the completion of the lift. Some claim that supportive equipment prevents injuries by compressing and stabilizing the joints over which it worn. For example, the bench shirt is claimed to support and protect the shoulders. Critics point out that the greater weights used with supportive equipment and the equipment&#x27;s tendency to change the pattern of the movement may compromise safety, as in the case of the bar moving towards the head during the upward portion of the shirted bench press.

=== Squat suit material and construction ===
Different materials are used in the construction of supportive equipment. Squat suits may be made of varying types of polyester, or of canvas. The latter fabric is less elastic, and therefore considered to provide greater &#x27;stopping power&#x27; at the bottom of the movement but less assistance with the ascent. Bench shirts may be made of polyester or denim, where the denim again provides a less-elastic alternative to the polyester. Knee wraps are made of varying combinations of cotton and elastic. Supportive equipment can be constructed in different ways to suit the lifters&#x27; preferences. A squat suit may be constructed for a wide or a narrow stance; and a bench shirt may be constructed with &#x27;straight&#x27; sleeves (perpendicular to the trunk of the lifter) or sleeves that are angled towards the abdomen. The back of the bench shirt may be closed or open, and the back panel may or may not be of the same material as the front of the shirt. Similarly, &#x27;hybrid&#x27; squat suits can include panels made from canvas and polyester, in an effort to combine the strengths of each material. When two or more panels overlay one another in a piece of supportive equipment, that equipment is described as &#x27;multi-ply&#x27;, in contrast to &#x27;single-ply&#x27; equipment made of one layer of material throughout.

===Raw powerlifting===
Raw powerlifting, also called classic or unequipped powerlifting has been codified in response to the proliferation and advancement of bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits. The 100% RAW federation was founded in 1999; within a decade, many established federations came to recognize &quot;raw&quot; divisions, in addition to their traditional (open) divisions permitting single-ply or multi-ply equipment. United Powerlifting Association (UPA) established a standard for raw powerlifting in 2008, and USAPL held the first Raw Nationals in the same year. Eventually, IPF recognized raw lifting with the sanction of a &quot;Classic Unequipped World Cup&quot; in 2012 and published its own set of standards for raw lifting. By this time, the popularity of raw lifting had surged to the point where raw lifters came to predominate over equipped lifters in local meets.

The use of knee sleeves in unequipped powerlifting has brought about much debate as to whether certain neoprene knee sleeves can assist a lifter during the squat. Some lifters purposely wear knee sleeves that are excessively tight and have been known to use plastic bags and have others to assist them get their knee sleeves on. This led to the IPF mandating that lifters put on their knee sleeves unassisted.

== Equipped powerlifting ==
Equipped lifters compete separately from raw lifters. Equipped athletes will wear a squat suit, knee wraps, a bench shirt, and a deadlift suit.

=== Equipped squats ===
For the squats, a squat suit is used for the event. Squat suits are typically made of an elastic-like material, and a single-ply polyester layer. This allows a competitor to spring out of the bottom of a squat (called &quot;popping out of the hole&quot; in powerlifting circles) by maintaining rigidity, keeping the athlete upright and encouraging their hips to remain parallel with the floor. This allows lifters to lift more weight than would normally be possible without the suit. There are also multi-ply suits giving the lifter more rigidity, like that of a traditional canvas suit, with the same pop as a single-ply suit or briefs but are exponentially harder to use, and are usually reserved for the top lifters. During the squat, lifters also tend to wear knee wraps. Even though knee wraps will be a sub-classification of raw lifting, it will still be worn by equipped lifters. A raw lifter who would squat in knee wraps will have the weight lifted noted as &quot;with wraps&quot; to distinguish from raw lifters using knee sleeves. Knee wraps are made out of similar elastic material as wrist wraps. They are wrapped around the lifters knees tightly. The knee wraps are wrapped in a spiral or diagonal method. The knee wraps build elastic energy during the eccentric part of the squat and once the lifter has hit proper depth the lifter will start the concentric part of the movement releasing this elastic energy and using it to help them move the weight upwards. It gives the lifter more spring, or pop out of the hole of the squat resulting in a heavier and faster squat.

=== Equipped bench press ===
For the bench press, there are single-ply and multi-ply bench shirts that work similarly to a squat suit. It acts as artificial pectoral muscles and shoulder muscles for the lifter. It resists the movement of the bench press by compressing and building elastic energy. When the bar is still and the official gives the command to press the compression and elastic energy of the suit aids in the speed of the lift, and support of the weight that the athlete would not be able to provide without the bench shirt.

=== Equipped deadlift ===
For the deadlift, deadlift suits are used for the event. There are single-ply and multi-ply deadlift suits. The elastic energy is built when the lifter goes down to set up and place their grip on the bar before the deadlift attempt. The deadlift suit aids core and spine stability and can increase the speed off the floor at the beginning of the lift. However, deadlift suits are least likely to carry over additional weight in comparison to equipped squatting and equipped bench pressing.

== Classes and categories ==
Weight classes:

Most powerlifting federations use the following weight classes:

Men: −52 kg, −56 kg, −60 kg, −67.5 kg, −75 kg, −82.5 kg, −90 kg, −100 kg, −110 kg, −125 kg, −140 kg, 140 kg+

Women: −44 kg, −48 kg, −52 kg, −56 kg, −60 kg, −67.5 kg, −75 kg, −82.5 kg, −90 kg, 90 kg+

IPF weight classes:

In 2010, the IPF introduced the following new weight classes effective January 1, 2011:

Men: −53 kg (sub-junior/junior), −59 kg, −66 kg, −74 kg, −83 kg, −93 kg, −105 kg, −120 kg, 120 kg+

Women: −43 kg (sub-junior/junior), 47 kg, −52 kg, −57 kg, −63 kg, −72 kg, −84 kg, 84 kg+

In 2020, the IPF announced the 72 kg weight class would be replaced with the 69 and 76 kg weight class effective January 1, 2021.

Age categories

Age categories are depended on the federation.

The IPF uses the following age categories: sub-junior (14–18), junior (19–23), open (any age), masters 1 (40–49), masters 2 (50–59), masters 3 (60–69), masters 4 (70+).

Age categories are dependent on the year of the participant&#x27;s birth. For example, if an athlete turns 18 years old in July, the athlete is considered an 18-year-old sub-junior throughout the calendar year. Other federations typically break the Masters categories down to 5-year increments, for example, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, etc. Some federations also include a sub-master class from 33 (or 35) to 39.

== Competition ==
A powerlifting competition takes place as follows:
Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each of the squat, bench press, and deadlift, depending on their standing and the organization they are lifting in. The lifter&#x27;s best valid attempt on each lift counts toward the competition total. For each weightclass, the lifter with the highest total wins. In many meets, the lifter with the highest total relative to their weight class also wins. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.
Competitors are judged against other lifters of the same sex, weight class, and age. Comparisons of lifters and scores across different weight classes can also be made using handicapping systems. World federations use the following ones: IPF GL Points, Glossbrenner, Reshel, Outstanding Lifter, Schwartz/Malone, Siff; for the junior age categories, Foster coefficient is mostly used; for the masters age categories, McCulloch or Reshel coefficients are mostly used. Winner of a competition based on an official coefficient used by presiding world federation is called &quot;best lifter&quot;.

== Events ==

In a powerlifting competition, sometimes referred to as standard competition, there are three events: bench press, squat and deadlift. Placing is achieved via combined total. Some variations of this are found at some meets such as &quot;push-pull only&quot; meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after. Single lift meets are often held for the bench press and the deadlift.

At a meet, the events will follow in order: squat, then bench press, and the deadlift will be the final lift of the meet.

== Rules ==
=== Squat ===
There are two types depending on equipment used: conventional stand and monolift stand.

The squat starts with the lifter standing erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the lifter&#x27;s shoulders or traps. A high bar and low bar position can be used. At the referee&#x27;s command, the squat begins. The lifter creates a break in the hips, bends their knees and drops into a squatting position. The lifter then ascends back to an erect position. At the referee&#x27;s command, the bar is returned to the rack and the lift is completed.

After removing the bar from the racks while facing the front of the platform, the lifter may move forward or backward to establish the lifting position. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders with the hands and/or fingers gripping the bar, and the feet flat upon the platform with the knees locked. The lifter shall wait in this position for the head referee&#x27;s signal to rack the weights.

The lifter will be allowed only one commencement signal per attempt. The lifter may be given an additional attempt at the same weight at the head referee&#x27;s discretion if failure in an attempt was due to any error by one or more of the spotters or by misload.

==== Causes for disqualification ====
*Failure to observe the head referee&#x27;s signals at the commencement or completion of a squat.
*Double bouncing at the bottom of the squat.
*Failure to assume an erect position with knees locked at the end of the squat.
*Any downward movement during the squat ascent.
*Movement of the feet laterally, backward or forward that would constitute a step or stumble after given the &#x27;squat&#x27; command and before the &#x27;rack&#x27; command.
*Failure to squat to depth.
*Contact with the bar by the spotters between the referee&#x27;s signals.
*Contact of elbows or upper arms with the legs.
*Any dropping or dumping of the bar.

=== Bench press ===
With the lifter resting on the bench, the lifter takes the loaded bar at arm&#x27;s length. At the discretion of the referee&#x27;s signal, the lifter lowers the bar to the chest. When the bar becomes motionless on the chest, the referee gives a press command. Then the referee will call &#x27;rack&#x27; and the lift is completed as the weight is returned to the rack.

The bench equipment will be placed on the platform with the head facing the front or angled up to 45 degrees. The head referee will be positioned on the head side of the bench press discipline.

To achieve firm footing, a lifter of any height may use discs or blocks to build up the surface of the platform. Whichever method is chosen, the shoes must be in a solid contact with the surface.

A lift off may be used by the discretion of the lifter to arm&#x27;s length. A designated spotter, having provided a centre lift off, must immediately clear the area in front of the head referee. If the personal spotter does not immediately leave the platform area and/or is in any way which impedes the head referees&#x27; responsibilities, the referees may determine that the lift is unacceptable, and be declared &quot;no lift&quot; by the referees and given three red lights.

==== Causes for disqualification ====
*Failure to observe the referee&#x27;s signals at the commencement or completion of the lift.
*Any change in the elected position such as shoulders, glutes, and head after the &#x27;start&#x27; and before the &#x27;rack&#x27; command.
*Allowing the bar to sink into the chest after receiving the referee&#x27;s signal.
*Pronounced uneven extension of the arms during or at the completion of the lift.
*Any downward motion of the bar during the course of being pressed out.
*Contact with the bar by the spotters between the referee&#x27;s signals.
*Any contact of the lifter&#x27;s shoes with the bench or its supports.
*Deliberate contact between the bar and the bar rest uprights during the lift to assist the completion of the press.
*Failure to lower both elbow joints to the level with or below the top surface of both shoulder joints.

=== Deadlift ===
In the deadlift, the lifter may choose a conventional stance or sumo stance. The lifter grasps the loaded bar which is resting on the platform floor. The lifter pulls the weights off the floor and assumes an erect position. The knees must be locked and the shoulders must be back, with the weight held by the lifter&#x27;s hands. At the referee&#x27;s command, the bar will be returned to the floor under the control of the lifter.

The bar must be laid horizontally in front of the lifter&#x27;s feet, gripped with an optional grip in both hands, and lifted until the lifter is standing erect. Any raising of the bar or any deliberate attempt to do so will count as an attempt.

==== Causes for disqualification ====
* Any downward motion of the bar before lockout.
* Failure to stand erect.
* Failure to lock the knees while standing erect.
* Supporting the bar on the thighs during the performance of the lift.
* Movement of the feet laterally, backward or forward that would constitute a step or stumble.
* Lowering the bar before receiving the head referee&#x27;s signal.
* Lowering the bar to the platform without maintaining control with both hands.

== Training ==

=== Weight training ===
Powerlifters practice weight training to improve performance in the three competitive lifts—the squat, bench press and deadlift. Weight training routines used in powerlifting are extremely varied. For example, some methods call for the use of many variations on the contest lifts, while others call for a more limited selection of exercises and an emphasis on mastering the contest lifts through repetition. While many powerlifting routines invoke principles of sports science, such as specific adaptation to imposed demand (SAID principle), there is some controversy around the scientific foundations of particular training methods, as exemplified by the debate over the merits of &quot;speed work&quot; using velocity based training or training to attain maximum acceleration of submaximal weights. Powerlifting training differs from bodybuilding and weightlifting, with less focus on volume and hypertrophy than bodybuilding and less focus on power generation than weightlifting.

Common set &amp; rep schemes are based on a percentage of the lifter&#x27;s 1RM (one rep maximum—meaning the most weight they are capable of lifting one time). For example, 5 sets of 5 reps (5x5) at 75% of the 1RM. Rest periods between sets range from 2–5 minutes based on the lifter&#x27;s ability to recover fully for the next set.

Recent advances in the accessibility of reliable and affordable technology has seen a rise in the popularity of velocity based training as a method to autoregulate daily training loads based on bar speed as a marker of readiness and neural fatigue status. Research has shown this to be effective when used both generally or on an individualized basis, and in some studies a superior programming methodology to percentage systems.

Accessory movements are used to complement the competition lifts. Common accessory movements in powerlifting include bent over row, lunges, good mornings, pull ups and dips.

=== Variable resistance training ===
Variable resistance training relies upon adjusting resistance for stronger and weaker parts of a lift. Any given movement has a strength phase sequence which involves moving through phases where a person is relatively stronger or weaker. This is commonly called a ‘strength curve’ which refers to the graphical representation of these phases. These phases are based upon related anatomical factors such as joint angles, limb length, muscle engagement patterns, muscle strength ratios, etc. Variable resistance training typically involves increasing resistance (usually weight) in the stronger phase and reducing it in the weaker phase. The additional resistance can be added through the use of chains attached to the barbell for a squat in the bottom portion of the squat reduce the overall weight. At the top portion of the squat, the chains are lifted from the floor to increase overall weight. Bands can be used to increase resistance in a similar manner. Alternatively, partial reps with heavier weights can be used in conjunction with full reps with lighter weights. Training both phases accordingly through variable resistance techniques can allow the muscles to strengthen in accordance with a person’s natural strength curve. It avoids a situation where, as a result of training, the weaker phase force potential is disproportionately great in regard to the stronger phase force potential. These benefits can help a lifter to become more explosive and to complete a lift.

=== Aerobic exercise ===
In addition to weight training, powerlifters may pursue other forms of training to improve their performance. Aerobic exercises may be used to improve endurance during drawn-out competitions and support recovery from weight training sessions. This would be more noted as GPP training.

=== Nutrition ===
All though powerlifting nutrition is subjective as there can be differences from person to person, there are general guidelines that athletes typically follow in order to perform optimally that can be applied to a strength sport setting. The primary concern of most diets is caloric intake as sufficient calories are needed to offset the energy expenditure of training allowing for adequate recovery from exercise. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends 40-70 kcals/kg/day for strength athletes who engage in 2-3 hours of intense training 5-6 days per week, compared to the 25–35 kcals/kg/day recommended for the average person engaging in a general fitness program, as regular training causes additional energy expenditure. Additionally, when powerlifters are in the off season, it is recommended that athletes increase their caloric intake in order to meet the recommendations of the ISSN and optimize their training. In addition to caloric intake, macronutrient intake plays a major role in the success of an athlete&#x27;s diet. Protein, carbohydrates, and fats all play different roles in the performance and recovery process. Optimizing protein intake enables a powerlifter to build more muscle and recover properly from intense training sessions. The Journal of Sports Sciences recommends that strength athletes consume 1.6g–1.7g protein/kg/day in servings of 20 grams, 5 to 6 times a day for maximal muscle growth. Sufficient carbohydrate intake allows an athlete to have adequate energy during training and restore any glycogen that is lost throughout their respect exercise. However, it may not be as crucial for powerlifters as it for endurance athletes like runners due to the nature of the sport. For strength athletes, it is recommended to ingest a range of 4g to 7g carbohydrate/kg/day depending on the stage of training. Timing carbohydrate intake around training sessions may benefit powerlifters by giving them more energy throughout their workout. Moreover, fats may help a strength athlete who is struggling to stay energized by providing more energy density, however, there is unclear evidence on the necessity of fats in a powerlifter&#x27;s diet. In addition to nutrition from foods, it is very common for powerlifters to take supplements in their diets. Caffeine and creatine mono-hydrate are two of the most research and common supplements among strength athletes as are proven to have benefits for training and recovery.

== Federations ==
Prominent international federations include:
* 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation
* International Powerlifting Federation (IPF)
* Natural Athlete Strength Association (NASA)
* Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate (RPS)
* USA Powerlifting (USAPL)
* World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation (WDFPF)
* World Powerlifting Alliance (WPA)
* World Powerlifting Congress (WPC)
* Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF)
* Global Powerlifting Committee (GPC)
* Canadian Powerlifting Union (CPU)

Of these federations, the oldest and most prominent is the IPF, which comprises federations from over 100 countries located on six continents.

The IPF is the federation responsible for coordinating participation in the World Games, an international event affiliated with the International Olympic Committee. The IPF has many international affiliates.

Different federations have different rules and different interpretations of these rules, leading to a myriad of variations. Differences arise on the equipment eligible, clothing, drug testing and aspects of allowable technique.

Further, the IPF has suspended entire member nations&#x27; federations, including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Iran, India and Uzbekistan, for repeated violations of the IPF&#x27;s anti-doping policies.

In January 2019, USA Powerlifting (at the time, an affiliate of the IPF) updated their policy to exclude transgender participation, in accordance with IOC guidelines.

On March 1, 2022, the IPF announced that Russia and Belarus has been temporarily banned from competition due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, supporting Russia&#x27;s invasion.

== Rank and classification ==
There are several classifications in powerlifting determining rank. These typically include Elite, Master, Class I, II, III, IV. The Elite standard is considered to be within the top 1% of competing powerlifters. Several standards exist, including the United States Powerlifting Association classifications, the IPF/Powerlifting America, USAPL (single-ply) classifications, the APF (multi-ply) classifications, and the Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU, raw) classifications.

The &quot;Master&quot; classification should not be confused with the Master age division, which refers to athletes who are at least 40 years old.

<text>Darkover is the planet that gives its name to the &quot;Darkover&quot; series of science fiction-fantasy novels and short stories by Marion Zimmer Bradley and others published since 1958. According to the novels, Darkover is the only habitable planet of seven orbiting a fictional red giant star called Cottman.

==The Cottman stellar system==
Bradley describes Cottman&#x27;s Star as a red giant, around which seven planets orbit. Among these, CottmanIV, known to its inhabitants as Darkover, is the only habitable planet. The three inner planets and two outer planets are not habitable. CottmanV is an ice planet that while not toxic to humans, cannot naturally support a self-sustaining human population.

Like Cottman V, Darkover is a planet stuck in a permanent ice age. Only one small equatorial strip of its single small continent is warm enough to support limited agriculture, fishing, and livestock. Similar in size to Earth, Darkover has a lower gravity due to its relative lack of metals; it also has a higher percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. The planet&#x27;s period of rotation is 28 hours. One Darkover year is 389 days long and is thus roughly equal to fifteen Earth months or 1.25 Earth years.

==Darkover weather and geography==
Darkover&#x27;s weather is affected by two major forces:
* A huge mountain range called &quot;The Wall Around the World&quot; reaches a height of 9,000 meters above sea level. This mountain range has the cooling effect of a third pole and has set the angle of Darkover&#x27;s axis of rotation to be more extreme than that of Earth&#x27;s, causing an extreme fluctuation between summer and winter temperatures in its equatorial region.
* Unlike Earth, which has only one natural satellite, Darkover has four moons, each a different color, which affect tidal forces and weather patterns. These are Liriel, Kyrrdis, Idriel, and Mormallor. It is thought that Mormallor may have been a passing asteroid that was captured by Darkover&#x27;s gravity.

The planet is dominated by polar icecaps and glaciers that cover most of its surface. The habitable area, just a few degrees north of the equator, joins the northern polar icecap on its northern and eastern side. Glaciers and impassible mountains (The Wall Around the World) prevent travel outside of the habitable lands. Darkover&#x27;s nominally temperate continental zone, which borders the open water of the planet&#x27;s ocean, is nevertheless subject to severe winter weather, and warm days in summer are rare.

The temperate portion of the continent is dominated by evergreen forests that grow in the mountain foothills. These trees contain a flammable resin which contributes to frequent forest fires during the warmer months. Further, southwest from the forests are Darkover&#x27;s highlands, plains, salt marshes and arable river valleys. On the continent&#x27;s far western side is another mountain range called &quot;The Hellers&quot; and a high elevation cold desert plateau called &quot;The Dry Towns&quot;.

Multiple conflicting attempts to map Darkover exist, including one in &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot; (1975) which Bradley repudiated in a fan newsletter in 1978, saying, &quot;The map in HH was fortunately inaccurate enough to be ignored&quot;. In any event, it does not match the Speakman map that illustrates this article. Thorsten Renk&#x27;s attempt at mapping Darkover based on the descriptions of journeys provided in several of the books (starting with &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; and ending with &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot;) produced a third map that does not match the others. Renk says that Bradley appears to have a mental model when she writes, but not a map in the ordinary sense.

Some cities or locations on the map are associated with the seven Domains: Hastur with the Hasturs; Armida with the Altons; Ardais with the Ardais; Serrais with the Ridenow; and Aldaran with the Aldarans. In &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;, Chapter 3, the Domain of Elhalyn is described as stretching &quot;from the west side of the Lake of Hali to the Sea of Dalereuth&quot;; this is not on the map, nor is the Aillard Domain. Other names on the map are Towers: Hali, where the Tower was destroyed, but its burnt rubble and a small chapel, the &quot;Rhu Fead&quot;, remain; Arilinn; Dalereuth; and Neskaya. Thendara is the location of the Comyn Castle and its Tower, which was destroyed in &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot;, as well as the main Terran spaceport and administrative offices. Another Terran spaceport is at Caer Donn. Nevarsin is a retreat and a center of learning administered by the monks of St. Valentine of the Snows, a monastery founded by Father Valentine following a tragic event in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;. Storn is a castle (located on Storn Heights) and the Storn family was important in &quot;Stormqueen!&quot; and &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;. Shainsa is the chief of the Dry Towns and figures significantly in &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;. The name Neskaya is derived from &quot;New Skye&quot;, the first settlement, near the place where the original colonizing ship crashed.

==Geology==
Darkover&#x27;s metal resources are scarce. Gold and silver are known but not in any quantity, and the most valuable metal is copper. Wealthy women have &quot;butterfly clasps&quot; for their hair made of copper; poorer women make do with something fashioned of leather and wood. Iron is more common, but very valuable because it is used for swords and horseshoes. In &quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, a man locks up his market stall, and the yet unnamed narrator, a Terran woman in Darkovan clothing, thinks he is prosperous, because &quot;he can afford a Terran metal lock&quot;. Since some men carry swords, and most men and many women carry knives, presumably made of iron, this seems to be somewhat contradictory. Perhaps it is the Terran craftsmanship and technology, not the metal, that makes the lock valuable.

In &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, the matrix workers at Ariliin agree to do a geological survey using their powers, to forestall a survey that otherwise would be done by the Terrans. They are to search for &quot;tin, copper, silver, iron, tungsten&quot; and for &quot;fuels, for sulfur, hydrocarbons, chemicals&quot;. The purpose is to prevent Terrans and their &quot;infernal machines&quot; from spreading across Darkover. They succeed in locating mineral deposits and marking them on maps (ironically, maps created using the assistance of Terran surveys), but the effort, at first successful, is abandoned.

The most important mineral on Darkover is the matrix stone or starstone, a jewel that the first colonists discover in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;. It has a deep blue color, and large ones are rare. Its composition is not known by anyone, and in fact it is theorized by some that it is a form of life. This jewel provides a focus and a way to magnify &quot;laran&quot;.

==Native sapient Darkover species==
Bradley&#x27;s fictional world is populated with an intelligent species, the &quot;Chieri&quot;, already ancient and in decline when the human colonists arrive. As the series developed, she introduced three other sapient native species—the Trailmen, the Forge-Folk, and the Catmen—as well as two genetically engineered sapient species—the Cralmac and Kyrri. One additional species is also frequently mentioned, the Ya-men, but Bradley leaves ambiguous the question of whether these creatures are sapient or not.

===Catmen===
The Catmen are the primary antagonists in &quot;The Spell Sword&quot; and feature in a number of the short stories. In &quot;The Spell Sword&quot;, Bradley describes them as carrying short, curved swords, capable of coordinating attacks against the humans, and able to use &quot;laran&quot; and starstones. The Catmen also featured prominently in several of the short stories, including David Heydt&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Big Cat Now&quot; from &quot;Towers of Darkover&quot;; Linda Frankel and Paula Crunk&#x27;s &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; from &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;; and Judith Sampson&#x27;s &quot;To Serve Kihar&quot; from &quot;Domains of Darkover&quot;.

===Chieri===
The &quot;Chieri&quot; are a race of six-fingered, tall, telepathic humanoids who have no permanent gender. Extremely long-lived, with life-spans reaching into the tens of thousands of years, they are described as gray or golden-eyed and with long, silvery-white hair. They will change sexes as the situation warrants for mating purposes. &quot;The World Wreckers&quot; describes the &quot;Chieri&quot; as the last, dying remnants of a space-traveling people whose abilities have dwindled with their fertility and ambition.

&quot;Chieri&quot; and humans are similar biologically and are able to interbreed. These hybrids exhibit some of the &quot;Chieri&quot; characteristics of coloring and physiology. They also have psychic gifts, and their descendants become the &quot;Comyn&quot;. In &quot;Star of Danger&quot;, the &quot;Chieri&quot; who aids Kennard Alton and Larry Montray, tells them that the &quot;Chieri&quot; share common ancestors with the Trailmen and the &quot;Kyrri&quot;, though not with the Terrans.

The Chieri feature prominently in &quot;The World Wreckers&quot;, &quot;The Planet Savers&quot;, &quot;Star of Danger&quot;, and in the long-lived, half-human/half-Chieri characters, Robert Kadarin and Thyra Scott, who appear in &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot; and &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;.

===Cralmac===
The Cralmac are semi-intelligent beings, artificially bred by humans during the Ages of Chaos, from Trailmen altered with human DNA. They usually feature in the Darkovan novels as the servants of &quot;laranzu&#x27;in&quot; working in the towers, with the explanation that theirs is the only touch humans in the hyper-sensitive state of the matrix worker can bear.

The Cralmac feature prominently in Patricia B. Cirone&#x27;s &quot;Victory&#x27;s Cost&quot; from &quot;Towers of Darkover&quot;.

===Forge-Folk===
The Forge-Folk are not particularly well defined, though they are described as about the same height and build as the Trailmen. Walter Breen&#x27;s &quot;The Darkover Concordance&quot; describes them as a cross between humans and non-humans, who speak an ancient variant of the Hellers dialect. They are Darkover&#x27;s primary miners and metalworkers. The Forge Folk worship the Sharra matrix, and appear to be the only creatures on Darkover capable of handling Sharra without causing catastrophe.

The Forge-Folk feature prominently in the conclusion of &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, and are mentioned in several of the Sharra stories.

===Kyrri===
The &quot;Kyrri&quot; are humanoid bipeds with grey or silver fur, simian faces and glowing green (or dark) eyes. Perhaps they are the result of genetic engineering during the Ages of Chaos, or they may be a native species from the pre-history of Darkover. In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Book Two, Chapter 5, Regis Hastur speculates that even tower workers do not know the origins of the &quot;Kyrri&quot;.

&quot;Kyrri&quot; generate a bioelectric field and sometimes give painful but non-lethal electric shocks when excited or threatened. The &quot;Kyrri&quot; appear in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, &quot;Star of Danger&quot;, and &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;, and also in &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, the replacement for the latter book. They are used primarily as servants in the Towers because they can pass through the barriers that non-telepathic humans cannot. In &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, one is a servant in the Alton townhouse in Thendara. Although the &quot;Kyrri&quot; can understand human speech, they do not speak themselves, and in &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot; Regis Hastur wonders how the message he gave one would be delivered.

===Trailmen===
The Trailmen are described as social herbivores who dwell in arboreal communities and live in extended family clans. Unattached females form bands of ronin who wander the forests attacking travelers. These Trailmen-human cause the cross-species transmission of a 48-year cyclic illness known as Trailmen&#x27;s Fever, which is mild in Trailmen and often fatal in humans. The &quot;Chieri&quot; call the Trailmen a word that means &quot;The Little Brothers Who Are Not Wise&quot;.

The Trailmen feature prominently in the novels, &quot;The Planet Savers&quot; and &quot;Star of Danger&quot;, and in Diana L. Paxson&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Place Between&quot;, from &quot;Snows of Darkover&quot;.

===Ya-men===
The Ya-men are a mountain-dwelling bird-like race, of questionable intelligence, who are susceptible to the effects of &quot;ghost winds&quot;.
Though they are mentioned as a background element in many of the books, the Ya-men are a critical plot element in &quot;Two to Conquer&quot;, &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, and Cynthia McQuillin&#x27;s &quot;The Forest&quot; from &quot;The Keeper&#x27;s Price&quot;.

In &quot;A Darkover Retrospective&quot;, Bradley says, &quot;...I have no idea what the Ya-Men were — or are — like. I only know that they are very terrible indeed, with plumes and talons and shrill yelping cries...&quot; This is a conscious decision; she thinks that monsters should not be described in too much detail, lest they lose their horror.

==Humans==
===The Comyn===
Comyn is the term used for aristocratic members of Darkover society who are gifted with the psychic abilities commonly called laran. Comyn women may be referred to as Comynara, especially by commoners.

The Comyn are the surviving laran-gifted families of Darkover who are ruling at the time of recontact with the Terran Empire. It is suggested in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; that they are the descendants of human-chieri pairings, who have learned to use native matrix stones to focus their laran powers. The Comyn, however, have their own mythology, recited in the &quot;Ballad of Hastur and Cassilda&quot;: they are the descendants of Hastur, son of Aldones, Lord of Light, who fell to earth, fell in love with Cassilda, and (perhaps) became mortal. Cassilda bore Hastur seven sons who founded the seven Domains.

Each Comyn family controls part of Darkover&#x27;s landmass, known as a Domain, but strategic inter-marriage and feudal land issues result in fluctuating domain borders. Each Comyn family has a gift — a family-specific laran power, though in reality, not every member of the family has the family gift. Also, a member of a family may have another family&#x27;s gift, in whole or in part. The gifts may skip generations. Of particular note is that twins often have differing amounts of the family gifts. One twin usually has more of the gifts than does the other twin.

Walter Breen cites Christopher Gibson for the observation that comyn is derived from the Gaelic word, comhionnan, meaning equal, and appears to refer to the communal origins of Darkover.

A Comyn family frequently fosters a child from another Comyn family, at least for a few years. This results in a Comyn adult having &quot;foster-brothers&quot; and &quot;foster-sisters&quot;. One example of this is Regis Hastur and Lew Alton. Regis lived at Armida during part of his childhood.

The Comyn families are:
*Hastur of Hastur
**Gift: Living matrix
**Device: A silver tree on a blue background
**Colors: Blue and silver
**Other names associated with this domain: Di Asturien, Syrtis
*Hastur of Elhalyn
**Gift: Ability to see all possible outcomes from every decision or choice. This gift can be very useful if it can be controlled. It awakens in Regis Hastur in &quot;The Planet Savers&quot; and he nearly goes mad.
**Device: A crowned silver tree on a blue background
**Colors: Blue and silver
**The old line of Elhalyn died out, and the Hastur domain divided to re-establish it.
*Alton
**Gift: Ability to force rapport; &quot;command voice&quot; to force a person to obey
**Device: An eagle perched upon a tor
**Colors: Green and black
**Other names associated with this domain: Castamir, Lanart, Leynier
*Ardais 
**Gift: Catalyst telepathy (awakens &quot;laran&quot; that is latent in a person, who may not realize that he has it)
**Device: A hawk
**Colors: Black and silver
**Pronunciation: In &quot;Thendara House&quot;, Jaelle says the name is pronounced &quot;are-dayze&quot;
*Aillard
**Gift: Never mentioned in any of Bradley&#x27;s novels and short stories, except that it manifests only in women. In the &quot;Clingfire&quot; trilogy, it is mentioned that Aillard males capitalized on their recessive Aillard Gift, making them better Keepers in a working circle of telepaths. According to &quot;The Darkover Concordance&quot;, the Aillard gift is extinct.
**Device: Red and grey feathers
**Colors: Red and grey
**Other names associated with this domain: Lindir
**The leadership or rule of this domain runs in the female line.
**Pronunciation: Ale-lard, with a long &quot;A&quot; in the first syllable and the accent on the second.
*Aldaran
**Gift: Ability to see into the future, sometimes to see multiple future possibilities; weather forecasting and ability to change the weather or control winds.
**Device: A two-headed eagle
**Colors: Red and black
**Other names associated with this domain: Darriell, Delleray, Hammerfell, MacAran, Rockraven, Scathfell, Storn
**Notable for: Aldaran is not a formal member of the Comyn Council, because they never ratified the Compact, and were the first domain to interact with the Terrans. In the early Ages of Chaos, Aldaran was responsible for The Cataclysm, the destruction of the original Hali tower using a &quot;laran&quot; weapon that created the heavier-than-air, cloud-filled, Hali Lake.
*Ridenow of Serrais
**Gift: Empathy and the ability to sense and communicate with non-human intelligences
**Colors: Green and gold
**Notable for: During the Ages of Chaos, Serrais was overrun by a Dry Town clan, the Ridenow, who intermarried with the Serrais women (probably against their will). This rejuvenated the strain, and allowed the Serrais gift to survive in the Ridenow bloodline.

===Commoners===
Commoners are the population of Darkover that are not members of a Comyn clan or family. In general, they are portrayed as less educated than the Comyn, hard-working, shrewd and honorable, although some are members of bandit gangs. Some of them are fairly wealthy, owning lands and raising crops or animals, or having successful businesses, such as tailoring and dressmaking, leatherworking and other crafts, milling and cheesemaking, or inn-keeping. They form their own councils and petition the Comyn for changes in policy or for assistance.

In &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, Chapter 9, a group of Darkovans calling themselves the Pan-Darkovan Syndicate meets with Danvan Hastur and the members of the Arilinn Tower, and raises objections to the decision of the Comyn to limit trade and imports from the Terran Empire. Their spokesperson, Valdrin of Carthon, says they want some of the advantages that come with being a part of the Empire. Hastur states that the decision of the Comyn was to preserve the Darkovan way of life and not become another satellite state of the Empire. Valdrin counters that Terran technology needs to be adopted since Darkover&#x27;s matrix technology has been declining and Terran technology can replace it, or Darkover might sink into another Age of Chaos. This is a major plot point, as Arilinn Tower then engages to do a mining survey faster and better than the Terrans.

===The Renunciates===
In the introduction to &quot;Free Amazons of Darkover&quot;, Bradley wrote that her Renunciates have become &quot;the most attractive and controversial of my creations&quot;. The Guild of Oath-Bound Renunciates, called Free Amazons and &quot;com&#x27;hi letzii&quot; in earlier books, are women who have opted out of Darkover&#x27;s traditional gender-based roles, including marriage, obligations to clan, and the expectation of male protection. In later books, &quot;Free Amazons&quot; is considered to be a misnomer and insulting or opprobrious, but the Renunciates themselves are tolerant of those who use &quot;Free Amazons&quot; out of ignorance.

The origins of this guild during the Hundred Kingdoms era are described in &quot;Two to Conquer&quot; as the merger between the Sisterhood of the Sword, a military-mercenary guild, and the Priestesses of Avarra, a cloistered order that offered medical and other care to women, primarily abused women. Towards the end of &quot;Two to Conquer&quot;, Carlina di Asturien comes to believe that the two guilds need to work together for the benefit of all women on Darkover. Bradley acknowledged a Patricia Matthews fan story as the origin of the Sisterhood of the Sword, and described the Priesthood of Avarra as a counterforce.

Bradley noted that most of the fan fiction she received was inspired by the Renunciates, and that she had met individuals who had taken Renunciate-style names or were attempting to live in women&#x27;s communes inspired by the Renunciate guildhouses.

A Renunciate takes an oath, and thereafter is known only by her first name and the name of her mother, with the connecting word &quot;n&#x27;ha&quot;, meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;. The woman who administers the oath is called her &quot;oath-mother&quot;. Magdalene Lorne takes the name Margali n&#x27;ha Ysabet: Margali is a Darkovan version of her Terran name, Magdalene (she is also called Magda), and her mother&#x27;s name was Elizabeth. Camilla, born Elorie Lindir, takes the name Camilla n&#x27;ha Kyria, because her mother was Kyria Aillard. Had she been legitimate or acknowledged as &quot;nedestro&quot;, her name might have been Elorie Hastur.

==Laran==
&quot;Laran&quot; is the Darkovan word for telepathic talent and the talents associated with it: telekinesis, precognition, a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, empathy, teleportation, and others. It is the distinguishing feature of the people of Darkover. Although it appears mostly in Comyn, others may have it. It appears mostly in people who have red hair, and generally manifests itself at the time of puberty. Elorie Ardais, in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, Chapter 7, says, &quot;Everyone alive has some small degree of &quot;laran&quot;&quot;. Damon Ridenow, in &quot;The Spell Sword&quot;, Chapter 6, reflects on the odd fact that Andrew Carr, a Terran, has &quot;laran&quot;, and can telepathically be in touch with Callista when he and Callista&#x27;s twin sister cannot:
In the telepath caste, it was often the accident of possessing &quot;laran&quot;, the specific telepath Gift, which determined how close a relationship would come. Caste, family, social position, all these became irrelevant compared to that one compelling fact; one had, or one did not, that inborn power, and in consequence one was stranger or kinfolk. By that criterion alone, the most important one on Darkover, Andrew Carr was one of them, and the fact that he was an Earthman was a small random fact without any real importance.

Being telepathically connected to another is called being &quot;in rapport&quot;.

Elizabeth Mackintosh, a character in the novel &quot;Rediscovery&quot;, suggests the Darkovan language appears to be derived from old Terran languages. She proposes a genetic basis for the development of laran on Darkover, noting that the original population of the colony derived overwhelmingly from north-west Europe (the Scottish highlands, Ireland and the Basque country) where a belief in supernatural abilities such as the second sight is common, and red hair is common as well.

===Matrix stones===
A matrix jewel or &quot;starstone&quot; provides a focus and a way to magnify &quot;laran&quot;. In &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;, a &quot;chieri&quot; gives one to his human lover so she can call on him if necessary. A matrix stone can be attuned to one person, who will always carry it with him and cannot lose it because he always knows where it is. If it is forcibly removed from him, he may go into shock and die. As related in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, a small matrix stone can be attuned to a person and used as a lock on a box, and only the person to whom the matrix stone is attuned will be able to open the box.

Most persons with &quot;laran&quot; have a matrix stone that they carry in a small bag or pouch made of silk or leather, which are &quot;insulators&quot;. Usually, the pouch is worn around the neck as a pendant.

In general, the larger the stone, the more it can amplify the user&#x27;s &quot;laran&quot;. Matrix stones can be used to power aircraft or make a person invisible (&quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;). Trained matrix mechanics can create a &quot;screen&quot; by placing several jewels within glass in a pattern that they determine on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, depending on the purpose of the screen. This can magnify telepathic powers even more. A screen cannot be managed by a single matrix user. The geological survey conducted &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; is accomplished by making and using such a screen; in &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot; and &quot;Two To Conquer&quot;, a screen is used to teleport a person from another star system.

In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, the Keeper Ashara explains that matrix mechanics, that is, the scientific use of laran amplified by matrix stones, is the first of the non-causal sciences.

===Towers===
The Towers are the centers of the use of &quot;laran&quot; and schools for those who are learning to use their &quot;laran&quot;. A designated person is always on duty (&quot;in the relays&quot;) to exchange news and requests for help telepathically with other Towers. At least once, the Terrans wonder how news travels so fast on Darkover. Towers are, in theory, independent of any caste discrimination or political influence. Each Tower should have a Keeper, a person to direct both Tower policy and the power of the &quot;laran&quot; users when they gather together in rapport to work. The Keeper of Arilinn is considered the second most-powerful person on Darkover, after the Hastur regent.

One who goes to a Tower for training advances through degrees of competence: first Monitor, then levels of Mechanic. Each degree requires an oath to do no harm and not abuse &quot;laran&quot;. First, a trainee learns to set up &quot;barriers&quot; to keep his thoughts from being read against his will, and to keep from &quot;broadcasting&quot; his thoughts and feelings. The next stage of training involves learning how to read one&#x27;s own physiological symptoms such as heartbeat, respiration and body temperature, and (with permission) to read those of others. Once the trainee is proficient at this, he is qualified to &quot;monitor&quot; other &quot;laran&quot; workers to ensure that they are not in danger when working, and takes the Monitor&#x27;s Oath, with the approval of the members of the Tower. A person who is deemed morally or otherwise unfit to work with &quot;laran&quot; will not be allowed to take the oath and will be expelled from the tower without any more training. This apparently happened to Dyan Ardais.

A matrix Mechanic learns to manipulate matter and energy using his laran and matrix stone, and to make and use tools that focus and augment laran. In &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; Jeff Kerwin, just beginning his training as a mechanic, notices that the hinge on a door is beginning to rust, and, taking out his matrix, he stops it. Greater skill is required to perform tasks such as refining metals or causing rain to fight a forest fire. Despite all the things that can be done with &quot;laran&quot;, it is not wise to use it for everything; in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot; Rannirl, a Level 2 Mechanic, repairs a leaky roof at Arilinn by climbing onto the roof with materials and tools.

The highest degree is Keeper, but generally women are trained for this arduous position from a young age. Not many young women want to undergo this. A Keeper is the center of a group of &quot;laran&quot; workers, who accepts the energy (&quot;energons&quot;) that they generate and directs it.

There are several Towers. In &quot;World Wreckers&quot; it is mentioned that there are nine Towers, but only seven Towers are ever named: Arilinn, Comyn Tower, Corandolis, Dalereuth, Hali, Neskaya, and Tramontana. Most of the named towers can be located. Arilinn tower is close to Arilinn town in the Plains of Arilinn across the Venza Hills from Thendara. Comyn tower is in Thendara. Dalereuth Tower is far south at the coast. Hali Tower was north of Thendara at the shore of Lake Hali. Neskaya Tower is in the south-eastern foothills of the Kilghard Hills. Tramontana tower is in the Hellers, about a day or more west of Aldaran. Journeys to Neskaya and Arilinn are described and they appear on the map.

Only the location of Corandolis is never revealed. As the location of the other Towers are known and can be connected with a certain Domain, an educated guess about the location of Corandolis can be made; Elhalyn had Hali right at the lakeshore, Neskaya is less than a day from both Serrais and Armida, Tramontana is close to Caer Donn, Dalereuth is close to Valeron and thus serves Aillard, and both the Comyn Tower and Arilinn would be accessible from the various points of the Hastur Domain. This leaves Ardais alone without access to a Tower, thus it is possible that Corandolis Tower is in the Hellers somewhere beyond Scaravel about a day from Ardais. The location of the remaining two unnamed Towers is unknown.

The importance of the Towers diminished after the Ages of Chaos and by the time the Terrans arrive, there were not enough trained telepaths for all of them to function, and in addition some of the independent Towers did not have a Keeper. Hali Tower was destroyed during the Ages of Chaos. So was Neskaya, but it was rebuilt. Comyn Tower, attached to Comyn Castle in Thendara, was for centuries the home of the Keeper Ashara.

In &quot;The Spell Sword&quot;, Chapter 7, Damon Ridenow realizes that to supervise two untrained telepaths, Andrew Carr and Ellamir Lanart-Alton, he must function as a Keeper. For many years, perhaps not since Varzil the Good, men have not been Keepers. Damon&#x27;s realization leads to the formation of &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot; and eventually, a civil war among the Comyn.

Afterwards, as related in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, there are independent matrix workers, not attached to a Tower or a Domain. They perform various services, such as making the matrix locks described above. However, when Jeff Kerwin, possessing his mother&#x27;s matrix, queries a pair of independent matrix workers about it, they refuse to tell him anything.

===Threshold sickness===
Some Comyn, as they enter puberty and their &quot;laran&quot; begins to awaken, have a bad reaction called &quot;threshold sickness&quot;. Symptoms include headache, disorientation, nausea, fever and a lack of desire for food. This is sometimes blamed on the breeding programs that fixed the &quot;laran&quot; Gifts in the Comyn families during the Ages of Chaos. In a severe case, the person may die. More frequently, the afflicted young man or woman must be confined and treated by an experienced &quot;laran&quot; worker until he or she recovers. Some Comyn have only a slight case of threshold sickness. Others, for example, Cleindori, have had telepathic abilities since they were children and are unaffected.

===The Overworld===
The Overworld is a &quot;laran&quot; representation of the real world. A person with &quot;laran&quot;, especially when using a matrix, can travel at great speeds in the Overworld and communicate as if face-to-face with others who are there. In &quot;The Spell Sword&quot;, Damon Ridenow searches for Callista Leynier, who is missing, in the Overworld, and encounters a part of the Overworld that is blocked off by a powerful &quot;laran&quot; presence. It seems likely that Callista is within the inaccessible area. In &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot; Marguerida Alton destroys the representation of Comyn Tower in the Overworld that Ashara has maintained for hundreds of years to stay alive. Later she learns that she has destroyed the real Comyn Tower, part of Comyn Castle, as well.

In the Overworld, one may see sleepers dreaming or people wandering aimlessly and lost. When Cleindori (Dorilys Aillard) is a child, she joins a matrix circle of her relatives in the Overworld, and after they tell her that she is too young to be doing that, they ask, &quot;How did you get here?&quot; She replies that she has always been able to get here, and that she used to visit her baby sister here before she was born. The Overworld is where people, at least some people, go after death. In Exile&#x27;s Song, Chapter 22, Marguerida Alton visits the Overworld again, and meets her mentor in musical studies, Ivor Davidson, who is deceased. He is listening to &quot;the music of the spheres&quot;.

In &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Damon Ridenow explores &quot;levels&quot; of the Overworld, going back in time to try to discover lost secrets. He calls this &quot;Timesearch&quot;. He encounters Varzil the Good from the distant past, who greets him as a kinsman (they are both Ridenow) and warns him that what he is attempting is dangerous.

===Cherillys&#x27; Law===
This is the first law of matrix mechanics, mentioned in &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Book Two, Chapter 8, and elsewhere. It states that everything in the universe has one and only one exact duplicate, somewhere in space and time, except a matrix stone. Only matrix stones are each wholly unique, and any attempt to duplicate a matrix will destroy it and the attempted duplicate.

===Matrix weapons===
In the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms, matrix workers, using screens to amplify their powers, devised powerful weapons of war. In &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Chapter 6, they are described as &quot;-- fire-forms, and wind-creatures to tear down castles and whole walls, and creatures from other dimensions walking abroad in the land -- &quot;. Other matrix workers defended against these weapons. The Compact banned matrix weapons.

====Clingfire====
Clingfire is a liquid made by matrix workers that when set afire, keeps burning as long as there is some substance to burn. Clingfire will even burn stone. Evidently it is slowly exhausted or used up as it burns, because it does not simply burn all the way to the center of the planet. Arrows may be dipped in clingfire, ignited and shot, or containers of burning clingfire may be dropped from &quot;aircars&quot; (matrix-powered aerial vehicles). An attack of this nature by many aircars on Aldaran Castle in &quot;Stormqueen!&quot; was frustrated by Dorilys Aldaran, the titular stormqueen, who blasts them from the sky with lightning.

A huge clingfire attack destroyed the Hali Tower, which led to the adoption of the Compact, which forbids the use of matrix weapons.

====Bonewater dust====
Bonewater dust is a substance, possibly radioactive, that is used to render a place uninhabitable for years. It is used against places that are especially hated or to deliver a dose of slow poison to an entire army.

====The Spell Sword====
In the novel &quot;The Spell Sword&quot; Damon Ridenow sets a small matrix stone into the hilt of a sword. He realizes that by doing so he may, in theory, be violating The Compact, and that such matrix weapons are banned. He discovers that although he is no use in actual battle, being a poor swordsman, he can use the sword as a weapon in the Overworld, and thereby assist the soldiers &quot;on the ground&quot;. Other swords, with larger matrices, are important weapons that figure in the novels.

====The Sword of Aldones====
In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot; the Sword of Aldones is called the weapon against Sharra. It is kept in the &quot;rhu fead&quot;, a small chapel near the site of the destroyed Tower of Hali, and near the place where the Comyn have funerals and inter their own kind. The &quot;rhu fead&quot; is protected by a barrier that cannot be passed except by Comyn, but the sword itself is behind a barrier that no Comyn can pass. In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Lew Alton, with the help of Ashara and a few others, solves this puzzle. Lew is severely wounded by an attack after the sword is recovered, and is about to die when Regis Hastur arrives, more or less by chance, claims the sword and uses it to heal Lew, to the astonishment of the attending doctors. Lew then asks Regis who he is, and Regis says, &quot;Hastur&quot;. Hastur was the legendary son of Aldones.

====The Sword of Hastur====
This sword is said to be kept in Hastur Castle. It will slay anyone who draws it except in defense of the Hastur Domain.

====Sharra====
Sharra is an ancient matrix weapon. In the &quot;Winds of Darkover&quot; it is simply a large matrix stone, about the size of a child&#x27;s hand. In &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot; it has been set into the hilt of a sword. Sharra is also called the &quot;Form of Fire.&quot; She is worshiped by the Forge-Folk.

Bradley provides multiple explanations for Sharra. In &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;, Sharra is described as a powerful matrix in which an Alton &quot;leronis&quot; had become trapped eons ago. However, in the rewrite of that book, &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Bradley describes Sharra as a portal to another dimension, through which a powerful alien energy is able to gain a foothold on Darkover. Breen describes Sharra as an anthropomorphized matrix weapon, left over from the Ages of Chaos. Desideria Leynier, in &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, uses the Sharra matrix against a group of bandits who have taken over Storn Heights. In &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot;, Marjorie Scott and Lew Alton, drugged and under the influence of Kadarin and Beltran Aldaran, raise the Form of Fire and destroy the Terran spaceport of Caer Donn. The Terrans then finally realize the meaning of the Compact, and its necessity.

In &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, Dan Barron, a Terran, has visions of Storn Heights, brought to him by a &quot;laran&quot; rapport with Brynat Storn. In Chapter 1, he sees Sharra:
In the midst of the flame there was a woman... She was almost inhumanly tall and slender, but girlish; she stood bathed in the flame as if standing carelessly under a waterfall... She looked merry and smiling... And then the girlish, merry face wavered and became supernally beautiful with the beauty of a great goddess burning endlessly in the fire, a kneeling woman bound in golden chains...
Later:
[T]he figure changed, grew, and was, again, the great chained Being, regal, burning, searing her beauty into his heart and brain.

The ancient Keeper of Comyn Tower, Ashara, tries to explain Sharra to Lew Alton, who is, one might say, &quot;possessed&quot; by the Form of Fire after the events in &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot;. Ashara hints that Sharra is actually an extra-dimensional being and the Sharra matrix is used to summon her. She also hints at the reason the matrix was set into a sword:
&quot;What do you think would happen to a person who was killed with such a sword?&quot;
==Culture==
Darkovan culture in the Domains is essentially feudal: the Comyn are the nobility and there is a king of Elhalyn lineage. Rarely, an Elhalyn is crowned king and rules, but usually the actual rule of the Domains is entrusted to the Hasturs, since the Elhalyns are considered &quot;unstable&quot;. Thus there is a Hastur regent and the ranking male of the Elhalyn domain is given respect but no real power. The seven Domains have lesser family names associated with them, as noted above. All other persons are &quot;commoners&quot; and even if they have &quot;laran&quot; they probably have no chance of social advancement, although they may obtain tower training and earn respect.

===Language===
There are two important languages on Darkover: Cahuenga, spoken generally by everyone, and Casta, usually only spoken by the nobility. There are mountain, lowland and regional accents and dialects. Sometimes Bradley attempts to reproduce a dialect with English contractions and spelling. For instance, in &quot;Hawkmistress!&quot;, Part 3, Chapter 5, Romilly, the protagonist, realizes &quot;with horror&quot; that her mountain accent has crept into her speech when she says, &quot;...I&#x27;m nae servant to the lady; if ye&#x27; want her fetched and carried for, me lord, ye&#x27; can even do it yerself&quot;.

There are, in all, nine different languages on Darkover.

Although Darkover is a richly realized and detailed world, the two languages are rarely distinguished in the books. They derive, ultimately, from the two languages spoken by the colonists, as described in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;: Celtic, spoken by the communal colonists, becomes Cahuenga, and Spanish, spoken by the officers and crew of the crashed ship, becomes Casta. The two tongues blend and borrow words from each other. Bradley was not as talented a linguist as Tolkien was, with the ability to invent entire languages and explain their imaginary origins, but the basic vocabulary is quite consistent throughout the books.

For much more information about the languages of Darkover, including a discussion of grammar, examples of translation and lists of words, there is the essay by Thorsten Renk.

===Laws and traditions===
====The Compact====
The Compact forbids any weapon that does not bring its user within reach of the person it is used against. Its intention is to forbid &quot;laran&quot; weapons, which caused much destruction and loss of life in the Ages of Chaos. The Compact is perhaps the most distinctive and important part of Darkovan society. It was conceived by Varzil the Good and adopted by all the Comyn, except the Aldarans. It ended the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms and brought peace. Because the Aldaran Domain never adopted it, they were excluded from the Comyn Council. The Compact also forbids guns, &quot;blasters&quot; and other Terran weapons, which is a plot point in several books. Swords and knives are the weapons allowed by the Compact. Even a bow and arrow is prohibited, although they can be used for hunting.

====Knife exchange ritual====
In &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, Chapter 3, Lerrys, the foster-son of Valdir, Lord Alton, realizes that Dan Barron has some sort of telepathic ability and that he will have &quot;troubles&quot; on their journey into the mountains, since he has visions of Sharra. Dan has no knife, and Lerrys explains:
&quot;By custom and law here -- a knife or any other weapon must never be lent or given, except between sworn friends or kinfolk. To say &#x27;my knife is yours&#x27; is a pledge. It means you will defend the other...&quot;
Lerrys then gives Dan a knife, and says, &quot;It is yours&quot;, instructing Dan to take it and say, &quot;Yours and mine&quot;.

Between Darkovan men, each of whom has a knife, the ritual words are said by both of them in turn as they trade knives. Several times in the books, men exchange knives and from that day forward are &quot;bredin&quot;, notably Regis Hastur and Danilo Syrtis in &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot; and Jeff Kerwin and Rannirl in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;. Renunciates also follow this custom.

===Dress===
In &quot;The Spell Sword&quot;, Andrew Carr arrives at Armida in clothes that are simply no good any more, as Damon Ridenow says. Carr has survived a plane crash and a blizzard with the help of Callista Leynier. Damon obtains the loan of &quot;the hall-steward&#x27;s holiday suit&quot; for Andrew, which is:
&quot;...a shirt and knee-length under-drawers of coarse linen; over which went suedelike breeches, flared somewhat from knee to ankle; a long-sleeved finely embroidered shirt with wide sleeves gathered in at the wrist; and a leather jerkin. There were knitted stockings that tied at the knee, and over them low felt boots lined with fur&quot;. 
That outfit is indoor wear. Outdoor wear is described in &quot;The Winds of Darkover&quot;, when Dan Barron travels on horseback with three Darkovan men:
All three wore loose heavy breeches, falling in flaps over high, carefully-fitted boots, and laced tunic-like shirts in rich, dark colors. Gwynn and Colryn had thick, fur-lined riding-cloaks, and Lerrys a short loose fur jacket with a hood. All three wore short gauntlets, knives in their belts and smaller knives in pockets at the top of their boots; Gwynn had a sword as well, although for riding it was swung across the crupper of his horse. They all had hair cut smoothly below their ears and a variety of amulets and jewelry.

Men generally carry a sword if they can afford one, which is a weapon that complies with the Compact. Comyn families, unless extremely poor, can afford swords, and the male children are trained in sword-play from a young age. Whether they carry a sword or not, men usually carry a knife or two, as described above.

In &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 6, there is a detailed description of the dress of women. Writing of Magdalene Lorne, Bradley says:
She wore the ordinary dress of a woman of Thendara: a long, full skirt of heavy cloth, woven in a tartan pattern, a high-necked and long-sleeved tunic, embroidered at the neck, and ankle-high sandals of thin leather. Her hair was long and dark, coiled low on her neck and fastened with the butterfly-shaped clasp that every woman wore in the Domains. Magda&#x27;s was made of silver, a noblewoman would have worn copper, a poor woman&#x27;s clasp would have been carved of wood or even leather; but no chaste woman exposed her bare neck in public.
After hanging the clothes up, Magda rubs &quot;their folds with an aromatic mix of spices; it was as important to smell right as to look right&quot;. Magda wears a riding-cloak when she undertakes a journey into the Hellers.

Renunciates who provide bodyguard services or lead expeditions generally wear a long knife, which by law and custom (established by Varzil the Good, who gave the Renunciates their charter) is not as long as a sword. Renunciates who are midwives or prepare food, etc. generally do not carry a weapon. Camilla n&#x27;ha Kyria is an exception. Before she became a Renunciate she posed as a man and lived as a mercenary, and she still wears a sword.

Comyn women carry a small dagger for personal protection, or perhaps to use on themselves if they are captured and in danger of rape or some other humiliation.

===Relations between the sexes===
&quot;The Shattered Chain&quot; has much information about sexual mores, traditions and prohibitions on Darkover. Also, repeatedly throughout the series, women&#x27;s thoughts (seldom expressed aloud) are concerned with being &quot;brood mares&quot;; e. g. &quot;I was of no value; the daughters I bore him at risk of my life were of no value; I was nothing but an instrument to give him sons&quot; (Kindra, speaking in &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 2). In &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;, it is made clear to the colonists by the ship&#x27;s officers that for the colony to survive, the women must bear as many children as possible, with as many male partners as possible for genetic diversity. This led to women having an inferior social position to men.

In Comyn society, a formal marriage is &quot;di catenas&quot; (evidently derived from Spanish &quot;de cadenas&quot;, meaning &quot;of chains&quot;). In the ceremony, the married couple submit to locked wrist bracelets that are connected with a chain. Later the chain is removed but the symbolic wrist bracelets traditionally remain. In the Dry Towns, a woman remains chained all her life, but to herself. The &quot;bracelets were connected with a long chain, passed through a metal loop on her belt, so that if the woman moved either hand, the other was drawn up tight against the loop on her waist&quot;.

A less formal marriage is called &quot;a marriage of freemates&quot;. This is the typical form of marriage for lower classes, although the Comyn enter into freemate marriages as well. There may or may not be a ceremony of some kind, such as a feast. Renunciates are forbidden by their oath to enter into any other kind of marriage. This sort of marriage can be ended by mutual agreement, although it is not uncommon for it to last for the lives of the partners. In the Hellers, a freemate marriage may be established by mutual agreement and the sharing of &quot;a bed, a meal, and a fireside&quot;. Lew Alton and Marjorie Scott observe this tradition in &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot;.

The culture of the Comyn tolerates homosexuality in men and women to some extent. The &quot;chieri&quot;, from whom the Comyn are descended, change from male to female, or vice versa, when it is appropriate to the individual. Some of the Comyn are permanently neither male nor female in a physical sense. In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Chapter 9, after Lew Alton meets his young daughter Marguerida, he learns from Rafael Scott that Thyra, Marguerida&#x27;s mother:

was ... like the &quot;chieri&quot;. &quot;Emmasca&quot;; no one was really sure if she was boy or girl. I can remember her like that, when I was very small, but only a little. Then Kadarin came -- and very soon after, she began to wear women&#x27;s clothing and think of herself as a woman... that was when we began to call her Thyra... before that, she had another name.

The sex-changing &quot;chieri&quot; drive the plot of &quot;The World Wreckers&quot; to its conclusion. Bradley needed to deal with the issue of homosexuality to write the book. Bradley claimed that she was the first science fiction author to do this.

Among commoners, male homosexuals are called &quot;embredin&quot; (evidently derived from &quot;bredin&quot;) or &quot;sandal-wearers&quot; (&quot;chaireth&quot;) to mock them or equate them with women.

Female homosexuality is sometimes believed, even by Comyn, to be a characteristic of the Renunciates. In &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 5, Lady Jerana Hastur says:
&quot;...I have always heard that the Free Amazons are eager to find pretty young girls whom they can convert to their unnatural way of life, turning them against marriage and motherhood, making them haters of men and lovers of women&quot;.

This may be an example of Bradley&#x27;s ironic social commentary. Everyone except Jerana Hastur is offended by this speech.

===Various customs and music===
Darkovans celebrate midsummer and midwinter with gift-giving, feasting and dancing. As noted above, Darkover&#x27;s weather has extremes. At Midwinter, travel may be impossible, but at Midsummer, there may be days without snow or rain when it is possible for people to gather together and have a celebration.

A typical midsummer gift from a man to a woman is a basket of fruit and flowers, left anonymously at her door. A midwinter gift, when fruit and flowers are unavailable, may be candy and preserved food. Women sometimes leave gifts for men (especially spouses), and Renunciates give seasonal gifts to one another. Members of a family exchange gifts.

At Comyn Castle in Thendara, there is an elaborate celebration on both holidays with tables of food and drink. There is organized social dancing: ring dances, traditional dances by soloists, and dances with chosen partners.

====Music====
The &quot;ryll&quot; is mentioned many times. It is described as a small harp. It is apparently considered one of the few instruments, maybe the only one, that is suitable for women to play. There are larger harps, a sort of viol, and some wind instruments, but there are no mentions of women playing them.

In &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot;, Chapter 3, Marguerida Alton is shown a &quot;ryll&quot; that (it is later revealed) belonged to her mother, Thyra. This &quot;ryll&quot; is played with &quot;levers&quot;. Music-master Everard can only get a single chord from it, though, and says that none of his students have been able to play it. Marguerida is able to play it and she sings the ballad &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, which Master Everard knows. Marguerida does not know where she learned the song and says that the harp is haunted.

In the same chapter, Marguerida and her teacher observe that the sound holes of stringed Darkovan instruments are star-shaped (later called a &quot;many-pointed star&quot;), and Master Everard is interested to learn that Terrans make them in another shape.

The drone-pipe is apparently similar to the bagpipe, and was used during battles to create a loud noise and frighten the enemy. At the time of &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot; no one on Earth (&quot;Terra&quot;) knows how to play one, but there are still players on Darkover.

Master Everard&#x27;s collection of instruments also includes &quot;fiols&quot; of different sizes, apparently similar to a violin or viola, on which Marguerida plays some Bach and Mozart. He also has a collection of wooden flutes of some kind, and some horns made of metal, which are Terran products. Darkover is poor in metals, and constructing a metal musical instrument would be folly.

In &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Chapter 7, Dom Esteban asks for some music after dinner, and his daughter Callista sings at Andrew Carr&#x27;s request. She takes up a small harp (not stated to be a rryl) and begins:

How came this blood on your right hand&lt;br&gt;Brother, tell me, tell me

... which draws immediate protests from her twin sister Ellemir and Dezi (Desiderio Leynier). Dezi believes himself to be Esteban&#x27;s son, not without reason, and it is considered very bad luck, or a deadly insult, for a woman to sing that song in her brother&#x27;s hearing. Esteban ruthlessly says that no son of his is present and orders Callista to continue.

&lt;poem&gt; We sat at feast, we fought in jest,
 Sister, I vow to thee,
 A berserk&#x27;s rage came in my hand
 And I slew them shamefully.&lt;/poem&gt;

The song is a version of an ancient ballad, known by several names, including &quot;Edward&quot;.

====Dancing====
&quot;Only men laugh, only men dance, only men weep&quot;. - Lew Alton in &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;. Evidently this is a proverbial expression.

Dancing is an important part of Darkovan culture.

In &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot;, Dyan Ardais performs a solo &quot;sword dance&quot; at the Midwinter Ball in Comyn Castle.

In &quot;The World Wreckers&quot;, the &quot;chieri&quot; Keral, to celebrate her (formerly his) new love for David Hamilton, begins an ecstatic dance that draws in all the Telepathic Council; the result is that the plots of the World Wreckers are exposed, a person with telekinetic powers explodes a bomb that is intended to destroy the telepathic Darkovans at the cost of his life, and Andrea Closson, another &quot;chieri&quot; and one of the World Wreckers, vows to repair the damage she has done.

===Religious traditions of Darkover===
On the whole, the inhabitants of Darkover are not particularly religious and do not celebrate any obvious religious rituals. However, all the castles of the Domains, and Comyn Castle as well, have a &quot;chapel&quot; that has seating and murals (or statues) of the gods and goddesses. Also present are murals depicting scenes from &quot;The Ballad of Hastur and Cassilda&quot;. Formal marriages (&quot;di catenas&quot;) may be conducted in the chapel, or a person may retreat to it for solitude and meditation.

Darkovans believe in four deities: Avarra (goddess of birth and death), Evanda (goddess of life and warmth, and hence marriage), Aldones (lord of light), and Zandru (lord of the nine hells). Each of Zandru&#x27;s hells is colder than the one above it, because Darkovans, living on a freezing planet, conceive of a cold hell. Hastur, the mythological progenitor of the Comyn, is supposedly the son of Aldones. In &quot;Thendara House&quot; and &quot;City of Sorcery&quot; Magdalen Lorne hears the &quot;calling of crows&quot;, a sign that Avarra is present.

These entities are believed to have power in the world, but no particular interest in individual persons. However, at least one of them canonically exists: in &quot;The Shadow Matrix&quot;, Evanda is physically present, tends the fire and prepares food at the marriage of Mikhail and Marguerida. In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, when Regis Hastur is fighting Sharra using the Sword of Aldones, a &quot;damnable&quot; face appears in the sky, presumably Aldones himself.

The Forge-Folk worship the &quot;form of fire&quot;, known as &quot;Sharra&quot;, who appears as a fiery, chained, red-haired female figure, a manifestation of the Sharra matrix, or perhaps a being from another dimension. Bradley offers multiple conflicting explanations for Darkover&#x27;s native deities, perhaps deliberately leaving the answers open to interpretation.

Some Darkovans also follow a Terran-originated belief system. These are the &quot;Cristoforos&quot;, whose beliefs derive from the work of a Catholic monk, Father Valentine, who accompanied the original expedition. &quot;Cristoforo&quot; is a corruption of St. Christopher of Centaurus, and the central figure of the belief system is the Bearer of Burdens.

These two belief systems operate side by side. A Darkovan may believe in one or the other, or frequently both, without difficulty.

==Plants==
===Kireseth===
Kireseth is a plant that produces blue bell-like flowers which when covered with pollen appear to be golden. The plants bloom when very warm weather lasts for more than a day or two, a rare weather event on Darkover. The kireseth flowers release large amounts of hallucinatory pollen, creating what is called a &quot;ghost wind.&quot; Humans and animals that inhale the pollen exhibit strange behavior, sexual activity, and violence.

The original colonists had no knowledge of this plant or its effects. The first known ghost wind resulted in a human woman becoming impregnated by a &quot;chieri&quot;, an orgy, and a massacre. Later, the Darkovans learned to distill substances from parts of the kireseth plant to either enhance telepathic ability or inhibit it.

Kireseth is important in the mythology of Darkover; the Blessed Cassilda, ancestor of the Comyn, is depicted in paintings as holding a bouquet of flowering kireseth. In &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Damon Ridenow and his circle fit together the mythological pieces and prove to themselves that a female Keeper need not be a virgin, or even chaste, to act as the center of a telepathic circle, if she uses kireseth. They are seen as rebels, and have to fight a telepathic battle to keep their circle and the &quot;forbidden&quot; tower they have created in the overworld. Their use of kireseth is viewed as blasphemy by many (ironically, since this use is portrayed in religious art) and when Damon&#x27;s daughter, Cleindori (Dorilys Aillard) attempts to use this knowledge as the Keeper of Arilinn, a legitimate tower, she and her followers are hunted and killed. Cleindori means &quot;Golden Bell&quot; and is a nickname connoting her blonde hair with the appearance of the kireseth flower.

===Resin Tree===
The resin tree is found on the slopes of all the mountains surrounding the inhabited parts of Darkover and down into the lowlands. It is apparently a kind of evergreen conifer that forms thick forests. Dry weather and summer storms with lightning create a great danger of these forests catching on fire, which the Darkovans combat in various ways. Small fires are fought by fire crews; no one is exempt from fire duty. Large fires may need to be put out by telepathic weather-workers who create a rainstorm.

===Spicebush===
A &quot;spiky&quot; weed that grows in the desert near the Dry-towns, where nothing else grows. However, in &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 3, it is described as &quot;fluffy&quot;.

===Rhowyn===
A tree with a six-petaled flower (&quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;, chapter 18). It is used as a nickname for the six-membered cells of the Sons of Darkover, a somewhat subversive organization. The name sounds like Rowan but the flower is different.

===Fiberpods===
This plant produces &quot;pods&quot; that after they are soaked in water can be unraveled to produce a useful fiber. There may be several kinds of plants that do this to protect their seeds from the elements. As some colonists discovered in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;, the &quot;chieri&quot; spin these fibers and create cloth from them using a loom. Andrea Closson, in &quot;The World Wreckers&quot;, upon finding a partly unraveled pod, starts to make thread out of it, out of habit.

The Trailmen build their cities from this fiber by stringing it between the trees like a suspension bridge and weaving a floor.

===Herbs and vegetables===
It is clear from &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; that some food plants were brought to Darkover by the colonists. Whether the ones mentioned in the chronologically later books are the same is not clear. Of course, the original stock may have been subject to selection to adapt to a redder sun and colder temperatures. Also, it appears from several of the books that the castles and great houses of the Comyn have greenhouses for the growing of vegetables and herbs. In &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Chapter 7, Damon Ridenow says that plants on Darkover have adapted by evolution to flower in winter, if there are a couple of warm days. He says that &quot;ice-melons&quot; cannot be grown on the plains of Armida: &quot;It&#x27;s too warm -- they&#x27;re a plant of the glaciers&quot;.

However, apples grow in Armida. Damon and Andrew, after eating lunch, plant their apple cores in the ground and Andrew says: &quot;Some day, Damon. our children will eat apples from these trees&quot; (&quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Chapter 7).

Snap-beans are mentioned in &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;, chapter 17, when Domenic volunteers to help in the kitchen of an inn, and he is shown how to &quot;string&quot; them. He is told the cook &quot;fries them with bacon&quot; implying that there are pigs on Darkover.

Sleepweed: supposedly able to put a person into a sleep for ten days, although this may be an exaggeration (&quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;, chapter 16).

Goldenflower: Used to make a tea that eases menstrual cramps (&quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, Chapter 12).

Blackthorn: Used to make a bitter tea that is used to treat altitude sickness (&quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, Chapter 19). Perhaps the same as black thornleaf, used in poultices to treat frostbite by &quot;draw[ing] the blood to the limbs and back to the heart&quot;; also given in tea for frostbite (&quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;, Chapter 6).

===Mushrooms===
Raising mushrooms is common in the hills and mountains. A kind of mushroom grows naturally on dead trees; harvesting requires only a knife and a sack.

==Animals==
It is unclear whether domestic animals are descended from stock brought by the colonists or whether they are domesticated native species. In the alternative, the Darkovans could have obtained them from the Terran Empire after rediscovery. Chickens, cattle and sheep are all mentioned, and pigs can be inferred from bacon.

The presence of Terran-sounding animals such as butterflies and snakes (&quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 3) is unexplained. It is not clear if they are Darkovan analogs of Terran species.

===Horse===
The history of horses on Darkover is ambiguous. In &quot;Hawkmistress!&quot; (during the Ages of Chaos) there is a battle in which the opposing sides charge at each other on horseback. However, in books that are historically later, it is said that horses were unknown until Terrans brought them. The Altons became known for raising them, especially after the Terran Andrew (An&#x27;ndra) Carr married into the family (as depicted in &quot;The Spell Sword&quot; and &quot;The Forbidden Tower&quot;). By the time of &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot; horses are common, and there are also mules.

===Butterfly===
Apparently Darkover has native species of butterflies. They are mentioned both in descriptions of nature and in references to the &quot;butterfly clasp&quot; used by women to hold hair in a way that covers the back of the neck. For a woman to expose the back of her neck is considered indecent.

===Hawks and vultures===
Hawks exist and are domesticated using ancient hawking techniques, which can be enhanced by &quot;laran&quot;. In several of the books, e. g. &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;, people go hawking, and it appears to be a form of recreation common among the Comyn. The hawk &quot;Preciosa&quot; domesticated by Romilly MacAran in &quot;Hawkmistress!&quot; is called a &quot;verrin&quot; hawk. Smaller hawks are said to be more suitable for ladies by a Comyn lord, who says it is &quot;disgraceful&quot; that Romilly is allowed to fly a &quot;verrin&quot; hawk (&quot;Hawkmistress!&quot;, Part 1, Chapter 5). It is not clear how many kinds of hawks there are.

The &quot;kyorebni&quot; is a kind of vulture. The presence of water holes in the Drylands can be inferred by kyorebni circling over them (&quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Chapter 4). A larger species of vulture is called a &quot;sentry-bird&quot; and can be used for aerial surveillance in wartime (&quot;Hawkmistress!&quot;, Parts 2and 3). The &quot;kyorebni&quot; is called a &quot;Lammergeier&quot; in Terran Standard (&quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, Chapter 11).

===Chervine===
The chervine is an animal native to Darkover. It is apparently similar to a deer in its general appearance and has horns, but it has been domesticated and is used for riding and as a pack animal. It is also used for food.

===Rabbithorn===
The rabbithorn is native to Darkover. It is considered to be very good eating, even a delicacy. In &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot; it is mentioned that the inn, The Crowing Cock, keeps them in cages. In &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; the colonists discuss raising them domestically for their fur. Rabbithorn (the plural and singular are the same) may be stuffed and roasted, placed on a platter and served with mushrooms, other vegetables and a savory or sweet sauce. They are also made into a stew.

This animal is never clearly described. It may be partly a joke based on the Jackalope or the Wolpertinger.

===Ice-Rabbit===
The ice-rabbit lives in the mountains and is an important prey of banshees. The ice-rabbit population increases and decreases according to the availability of food. When there are plenty of ice-rabbits, the banshees stay above the snow-line, but when the ice-rabbit population crashes, the banshees start to hunt lower down and are a greater danger to travelers (&quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, Chapter 19).

===Scorpion Ant===
The scorpion ant is an insect-like organism with pincers and a potentially deadly sting that lives in colonies. In &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; a member of an expedition steps on a nest and arouses the inhabitants, leading to his painful and sudden death.

===Banshee===
The banshee is a large, flightless, blind, bird-like predator that lives in the mountains, commonly above the line of permanent snow. It apparently hunts by seeking warmth, and it will attack any warm-blooded animal. It catches its prey by screaming to paralyze it and then disemboweling it with a stroke of one of its clawed feet or by a bite of its huge beak. It is mentioned in nearly all the novels, and a few characters hear its scream, or actually see the banshee and have a narrow escape.

There are several speculations about the banshee&#x27;s paralyzing scream in various books. The scream may be so terrifying that its prey is afraid to move. Alternatively, it has been suggested that banshees have a &quot;laran&quot; that can take over the mind of another and leave him vulnerable.

===Dragon===
The dragon is an extinct, perhaps mythical creature on Darkover. Marion Zimmer Bradley, in the introduction to &quot;Coils&quot; by Patricia Shaw Mathews in the anthology &quot;Red Sun of Darkover&quot;, says that she has &quot;always thought of Darkover as a place of which one might say, &#x27;Here there be dragons&#x27;&quot;. There are two canonical references to the dragon: The &quot;Ballad of the Death of the Last Dragon&quot; as described in &quot;Two To Conquer&quot;, and the proverb, &quot;It is wrong (or &quot;ill done&quot;) to keep a dragon chained to roast your meat&quot;. Various characters speculate on the meaning of this saying:
* It would be dangerous to make a dragon work for you. 
* Something powerful and dangerous should not be used for a trivial purpose.
* It would be right to keep a dragon chained to render him harmless, but a dragon has no use.
* Dragons cannot be chained, at least not for very long.
* Dragons do not exist, and the saying is humorous.

<doc id="64228" wikidata="Q31424" url="?curid=64228" title="Llobregat">
<text>The Llobregat () is the second longest river in Catalonia, Spain, after the Ter. It flows into the Mediterranean south of the city of Barcelona. Its name could have originated in an ancient Latin word meaning &#x27;dark&#x27;, &#x27;muddy&#x27; or &#x27;slippery&#x27;, or simply from its ancient name &quot;Rubricatus&quot;, literally &#x27;red&#x27;.

==Course==

The Llobregat originates at an elevation of in the Serra del Cadí, within the limits of Castellar de n&#x27;Hug municipality, Berguedà comarca. The total length of the river is over .
At Martorell, the Roman Via Augusta crosses the river on the Devil&#x27;s Bridge, which dates from the High Middle Ages in its current form. The C-16 highway is also known as the &#x27;Llobregat Axis&#x27; () for its largest stretch follows the valley of the Llobregat.

The river ends in the Mediterranean Sea forming the Llobregat Delta, in the municipality of El Prat de Llobregat, near Barcelona on the left bank. The delta provided a large extension of fertile land close to the city of Barcelona, but is now largely paved, urbanized and covered by infrastructure such as the Barcelona–El Prat international Airport.

The Llobregat is heavily managed in its lower course and water that was previously lost to the sea is now pumped upstream to increase the natural flow, recharge the river delta wetlands and control seawater incursion.

==Tributaries==
The main tributaries of the Llobregat are:
*Right tributaries:
**Bastareny
**Cardener
**Anoia
*Left tributaries:
**Riera de Merlès

<text>The Ter () is a river in Catalonia, Spain. It rises in the Ulldeter, a glacial cirque in the East Pyrenees, at an approximate elevation of . At heights of around , the nearby peaks bordering the Ulldeter—the Bastiments, the Gra de Fajol, and the Pic de la Dona—supply its headwaters. The river runs through the comarques of Ripollès, Osona, Selva, Gironès, and Baix Empordà, discharging into the Mediterranean Sea at l&#x27;Estartit.

The Ter follows a course of and drains an area of approximately ; its basin is described by a (branching, tree-like) and exorheic drainage pattern. Annually, an average of of water is moved by the river, with an average flow rate of at its mouth. Although its headwaters are in the Pyrenees, the Ter receives significant inflow from rivers in the middle and lower plains. Thus it is susceptible to flooding in both the spring and the autumn.

<text>The Black September Organization (BSO) () was a Palestinian militant organization founded in 1970. Besides other actions, the group was responsible for the assassination of the Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi Tal, and the Munich massacre, in which eleven Israeli athletes and officials were kidnapped and killed, as well as a West German policeman dying, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, their most publicized event. These attacks led to the creation or specialization of permanent counter-terrorism forces in many European countries.

==Origin==

The group&#x27;s name is derived from the Black September conflict which began on 16 September 1970, when King Hussein of Jordan declared military rule in response to &quot;fedayeen&quot; attempting to seize his kingdom – resulting in the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Palestinian fighters from Jordan. The BSO began as a small cell of Fatah men determined to take revenge upon King Hussein and the Jordanian Armed Forces. Recruits from the PFLP, as-Sa&#x27;iqa, and other groups also joined.

Initially, most of its members were dissidents within Fatah who had been close to Abu Ali Iyad, the commander of Fatah forces in northern Jordan who continued to fight the Jordanian Army after the PLO leadership withdrew. He was killed, allegedly through execution, by Jordanian forces on 23 July 1971. It was alleged by them that the Jordanian Prime Minister at the time, Wasfi Tal, was personally responsible for his torture and death.

==Structure of the group==
There is disagreement among historians, journalists, and primary sources about the nature of the BSO and the extent to which it was controlled by Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) faction controlled at the time by Yasser Arafat.

In his book &quot;Stateless&quot;, Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad), Arafat&#x27;s chief of security and a founding member of Fatah, wrote that: &quot;Black September was not a terrorist organization, but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement, at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential. The members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and Fatah or the PLO.&quot;

The denial described in Abu Iyad&#x27;s claim was mutual: according to a 1972 article in the Jordanian newspaper &quot;Ad-Dustour&quot;, Mohammed Daoud Oudeh, also known as Abu Daoud, a BSO operative and former senior PLO member, told Jordanian police: &quot;There is no such organization as Black September. Fatah announces its own operations under this name so that Fatah will not appear as the direct executor of the operation.&quot; A March 1973 document released in 1981 by the U.S. State Department seemed to confirm that Fatah was Black September&#x27;s parent organization.

According to American journalist John K. Cooley, the BSO represented a &quot;total break with the old operational and organizational methods of the &quot;fedayeen&quot;. Its members operated in air-tight cells of four or more men and women. Each cell&#x27;s members were kept purposely ignorant of other cells. Leadership was exercised from outside by intermediaries and &#x27;cut-offs&#x27; &quot;, though there was no centralized leadership.

Cooley writes that many of the cells in Europe and around the world were made up of Palestinians and other Arabs who had lived in their countries of residence as students, teachers, businessmen, and diplomats for many years. Operating without a central leadership, it was a &quot;true collegial direction&quot;. The cell structure and the need-to-know operational philosophy protected the operatives by ensuring that the apprehension or surveillance of one cell would not affect the others. The structure offered plausible deniability to the Fatah leadership, which was careful to distance itself from Black September operations.

Fatah needed Black September, according to historian Benny Morris. He writes that there was a &quot;problem of internal PLO or Fatah cohesion, with extremists constantly demanding greater militancy. The moderates apparently acquiesced in the creation of Black September in order to survive&quot;. As a result of pressure from militants, writes Morris, a Fatah congress in Damascus in August–September 1971 agreed to establish Black September. The new organization was based on Fatah&#x27;s existing special intelligence and security apparatus, and on the PLO offices and representatives in various European capitals, and from very early on, there was cooperation between Black September and the PFLP.

The PLO closed Black September down in September 1973, on the anniversary it was created by the &quot;political calculation that no more good would come of terrorism abroad&quot; according to Morris. In 1974 Arafat ordered the PLO to withdraw from acts of violence outside the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel.

==Munich massacre==

The group was responsible for the 1972 Munich massacre in which 11 Israeli Olympic athletes were murdered, nine of whom were first taken hostage, and the killing of a German police officer, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.

Following the attack, the Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister Golda Meir, launched an assassination campaign and ordered Mossad to assassinate those known to have been involved in the Munich massacre. By 1979, at least one Mossad unit had assassinated eight Black September and PLO members, including Ali Hassan Salameh, nicknamed the &quot;Red Prince&quot;, the wealthy, flamboyant son of an upper-class family, and commander of Force 17, Yasser Arafat&#x27;s personal security squad. Salameh was also behind the 1972 hijacking of Sabena Flight 572 from Vienna to Lod. He was killed by a car bomb in Beirut on 22 January 1979. During a raid in Lebanon in April 1973, Israeli commandos killed three senior members of Black September in Beirut. In July 1973, in what became known as the Lillehammer affair, Ahmed Bouchiki, an innocent Moroccan waiter who was mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh was killed in Norway. Six Israeli operatives were arrested for the murder.

Remarks in 2010 by Abu Daoud, the alleged mastermind of the Munich kidnappings, deny that any of the Palestinians assassinated by Mossad had any relation to the Munich operation, despite the fact that the list includes two of the three surviving members of the kidnap squad arrested at the airport.

==Other attacks==
Other actions attributed to Black September include:
* 28 November 1971: the assassination of Jordan&#x27;s prime minister, Wasfi al-Tal, in retaliation for the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan in 1970–71;
* December 1971: the attempted assassination of Zaid Rifai, Jordan&#x27;s ambassador to London and former chief of the Jordanian royal court;
* 6 February 1972: sabotage of a West German electrical installation and gas plants in Ravenstein and Ommen in the Netherlands and in Hamburg in West Germany;
* 8 May 1972: hijacking of a Belgian aircraft, Sabena Flight 572, flying from Vienna to Lod.
* September and October 1972: dozens of letter bombs were sent from Amsterdam to Israeli diplomatic posts around the world, killing Israeli Agricultural Counsellor Ami Shachori in Britain.
* 23 January 1973: assassination of Mossad officer Baruch Cohen in Madrid.
* 1 March 1973: Attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan: 10 hostages were held at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: &quot;The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.&quot;
* 2 March 1973: 1973 New York bomb plot
* 5 August 1973: two Palestinian militants claiming affiliation with Black September opened fire on a passenger lounge in Athens&#x27; now closed Ellinikon International Airport, killing three and wounding 55. A Lufthansa Boeing 737 was hijacked from Rome in December 1973 to demand that the gunmen be freed from Greek custody.
* 20 October 1981: Black September claimed responsibility for the 1981 Antwerp synagogue bombing in Belgium, which killed three and wounded 106 people.

==In fiction==
The 1977 film &quot;Black Sunday&quot; centers on a fictional Black September plot to attack the Super Bowl. The 2005 film &quot;Munich&quot; depicts the Munich massacre and subsequent Israeli campaign of retaliation.

<doc id="64234" wikidata="Q1781812" url="?curid=64234" title="Concupiscence">
<text>Concupiscence is an ardent longing, typically one that is sensual. In Christianity, concupiscence is the tendency of humans to sin.

There are nine occurrences of in the Douay-Rheims Bible and three occurrences in the &quot;King James Bible&quot;.

==Sensuality==
Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century described two divisions of &quot;sensuality&quot;. The &quot;concupiscible&quot; describes pursuit, avoidance, and instincts. The &quot;irascible&quot; describes competition, aggression, defense, and instincts.

==Augustine==
Involuntary sexual arousal is explained in the &quot;Confessions&quot; of Augustine. He used the term &quot;concupiscence&quot; to refer to sinful lust. He taught that Adam&#x27;s sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or &quot;hurtful desire&quot;, resulting in humanity becoming a (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not &quot;a&quot; being but a bad quality, the privation of good or a wound. In Augustine&#x27;s view (termed &quot;Realism&quot;), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned. Therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit.

The main opposition came from a monk named Pelagius (354–420 or 440). His views became known as Pelagianism.

==Concupiscence in Catholicism==
The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that Adam and Eve were constituted in an original &quot;state of holiness and justice&quot; (CCC 375, 376 398), free from concupiscence (CCC 377). The lower or animal nature in man was subject to the control of reason and the will subject to God. 

As a result of original sin, according to Catholics, human nature has been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to sin and be evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward sin and evil is called &quot;concupiscence&quot; (CCC 405, 418). Baptism, the Catechism teaches, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God. The inclination toward sin and evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520).

The Catholic Church teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself.

==Concupiscence in Methodism==
The Wesleyan–Arminian theology of the Methodist Churches, inclusive of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement, teaches that humans, though being born with original sin, can turn to God as a result of prevenient grace and do good; this prevenient grace convicts humans of the necessity of the new birth, through which he is justified and regenerated. After this, to willfully sin would be to fall from grace, though a person can be restored to fellowship with God through repentance. When the believer is entirely sanctified, their original sin is washed away. Methodist theology firstly distinguishes between original sin and actual sin:
==Islam==
Al-Ghazali in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an Islamic perspective in his book &quot;Kimiya-yi sa&#x27;ādat&quot; (&quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot;), and also mentioned it in &quot;The Deliverer from Error.&quot; In this book, he discusses how to reconcile the concupiscent and the irascible souls, balancing them to achieve happiness.

<text>Pit bull is an umbrella term for several types of dog believed to have descended from bull and terriers. In the United States, the term is usually considered to include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and sometimes the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries, including the United Kingdom, the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed specifically, while the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull. Most pit bull–type dogs descend from the British bull and terrier, a 19th-century dog-fighting type developed from crosses between the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier.

Pit bull–type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets internationally, due to their history in dog fighting, the number of high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, and their proclivity to latch on while biting. Proponents of the type and advocates of regulation have engaged in a highly contentious nature-versus-nurture debate over whether aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to owners&#x27; poor care for and competency to handle the dog or inherent qualities owing to their breeding for fighting purposes. While some studies have argued that pit bull–type dogs are not disproportionately dangerous, offering competing interpretations on dog bite statistics, independent organizations have published statistics based on hospital records showing pit bulls are responsible for more than half of dog bite incidents among all breeds despite comprising only 6% of pet dogs. Some insurance companies will not cover pit bulls (along with Rottweilers and wolf hybrids) because these particular dogs cause a disproportionate rate of bite incidents. Dog bite severity varies by the breed of dog, and studies have found that pit bull–type dogs have both a high rate of reported bites and a high rate of severe injuries, compared to other non–pit bull–type dogs.

Pit bull–type dogs are extensively used in the United States for dog fighting, a practice that has continued despite being outlawed. Several nations and jurisdictions restrict the ownership of pit bull–type dogs through breed-specific legislation. A pro–pit bull lobby exists that spends millions of dollars a year promoting pit bulls as family pets, funding pro-pit bull researchers, and opposing laws that regulate their ownership.

== History ==
The term has been used since at least the early 20th century. It is believed all dogs that are now classified as pit bulls descend from the British bull-and-terrier, which were first imported into North America in the 1870s. The bull-and-terrier was a breed of dog developed in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century for the blood sports of dog fighting and rat baiting. It was created by crossing the ferocious, thickly muscled Old English Bulldog with the agile, lithe, feisty Black and Tan Terrier. The aggressive Old English Bulldog, which was bred for bear and bull baiting, was often also pitted against its own kind in organized dog fights, but it was found that lighter, faster dogs were better suited to dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog. To produce a lighter, faster, more agile dog that retained the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, outcrosses from local terriers were tried, and ultimately found to be successful.

As it was in the UK, dog fighting became a popular pastime in 19th century America and bull-and-terriers were imported to the New World to pursue the blood sport. In the United States, organized dog fights have been progressively outlawed in various states since 1874, culminating in federal legislation criminalizing animal fighting in 2007.

In the 1890s breeders of American pit bull–type dogs attempted to have their dogs recognized by the American Kennel Club, but because of the type&#x27;s association with dogfighting, the club rejected these entreaties. Following this rejection, in 1898 breeders of American Pit Bull Terriers established a rival kennel club, the United Kennel Club. In addition to being a breed registry, the United Kennel Club also regulated dogfights. In the 1930s the American Kennel Club was faced with a dilemma: whilst not wishing to condone dogfighting, there was a desire to recognize a uniquely American dog breed for which over 30 years of breed records existed. The solution was to recognize Pit Bull Terriers under a different name and prohibit these dogs from being used in organized fights, and in 1935 the American Kennel Club recognized Pit Bull Terriers as Staffordshire Terriers.

The name &quot;Staffordshire Bull Terrier&quot; was first used in Britain in 1930 in advertisements for bull-and-terrier-type dogs. Organized dog fighting had been effectively eliminated in the United Kingdom by the Protection of Animals Act 1911, but devotees of the bull-and-terrier type continued to breed these dogs, predominantly in England&#x27;s Black Country. Throughout the early 1930s attempts were made in England to gain recognition for these dogs with The Kennel Club; these efforts were successful in 1935. In order to avoid confusion with the British breed, in 1972 the American Kennel Club changed the name of their American breed to the American Staffordshire Terrier.

Despite criminalisation, illegal fights using pit bull–type dogs have continued to be widespread in the United States. In the 1990s in that country it was estimated 1,500 dogs died annually in organized fights, and by the mid-2000s it was estimated over 40,000 people were involved in the illegal blood sport. Pit bull–type dogs are also used by criminal organizations to guard illegal narcotics, and to intimidate and attack civilians, other criminals and police, the type becoming a status symbol in American gang culture. On the other side of the law, pit bull–type dogs have been used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as drug detection dogs.

There is a lobby of animal rights groups that are spending millions of dollars to try to rebrand pit bulls as family dogs. In efforts to counter negative perceptions about pit bull–type dogs, both the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the New York City Center for Animal Care and Control have unsuccessfully attempted to rename the type.
== Identification ==
Determining whether an individual dog is of a pit bull breed can be necessary for health or legal reasons. Pit bull breeds and their mixes can be prone to certain health issues and proactive care can prevent or mitigate certain issues. Pit bull breeds, pit bull type dogs, and their mixes are legally regulated or banned in many countries. The burden of proof can lie with the dog owner or with the authorities. In Denmark, the police can request that a dog owner provides proof that the dog is not prohibited under the Danish Dog Act. Danish authorities recommend that dog owners make sure they have documentation of their dog&#x27;s origin and breed, especially if their dog has characteristics similar to those prohibited: &quot;Possessors of a dog, which in appearance have some features in common with one or more of the prohibited breeds, are recommended to ensure that they possess documentation of their dog&#x27;s breed.&quot; 

In the United Kingdom it is also a dog owner&#x27;s responsibility to prove that the dog is not one of the prohibited types (dog types bred for fighting) under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 or that the dog has a Certificate of Exemption (grandfather clause). The UK uses Dog Legislation Officers (DLO) which have special training and experience in dog identification. Those officers also provide expert evidence for authorities. 

Methods

There are various ways to identify a pit bull&#x27;s specific breed. It can be proven through registration papers (pedigree) and through testing a dog&#x27;s DNA to validate parentage or it can be determined through testing DNA-based ancestry, through examining a dog&#x27;s traits or the use of artificial intelligence. Which method is suitable depends on the purpose of the identification. While some methods might be good enough to satisfy a dog owner&#x27;s curiosity, not all methods are accepted for legal reasons. For example, France banned pit bull type dogs (category 1) in 1999, but purebred registered American Staffordshire Terriers (category 2) are only restricted, not banned. Therefore only American Staffordshire Terriers registered with Central Canine Society (fr. Société centrale canine) are legally allowed to be in or to re-enter the country. Parental DNA testing of a not-registered purebred dog would not be sufficient under French law to legally transfer such a dog into or through France.

Pure breed identification

Two pit bull breeds, the American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, can be registered at internationally recognized Kennel Clubs, such as the American Kennel Club (AKC), through their respective breed clubs to receive registration papers. Both breeds are also recognized by the Fédération Cynalogique Internationale (FCI), which maintains and publicizes their breed standards. In contrast, the American Pit Bull Terrier, the American Bulldog and the American Bully are not recognized by international Kennel Clubs, though they can be registered at other Kennel Clubs, such as the United Kennel Club (UKC).Through selective breeding, pit bull breeds have developed characteristics that distinguish them from one another, as well as from other dog types in terms of form and function: &quot;[…] the name &quot;Pit Bull&quot; is actually a generic term that applies to the various breeds that share the same ancestry or have a similar appearance. This includes the APBT, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Terrier. Sometimes people even refer to the Bull Terrier, the Miniature Bull Terrier, or the American Bulldog as Pit Bulls. Although enthusiasts of these different breeds can easily tell them apart, to those who are unfamiliar with them many of the breeds appear quite similar.&quot;

An example of distinct traits that a Labrador Retriever and an American Pit Bull Terrier have. This list considers characteristics of a dog&#x27;s form as well as function and typical behavior:

Dog type identification

Breed assessors look at a suspected pit bull&#x27;s physical characteristics like the shape of the head, ears, flews, jowls, teeth, eyes, chest, legs and tail, as well as the characteristics of the dog&#x27;s coat (color, hair length, growth and texture), skin, weight, height and body length to determine if a dog categorizes as a pit bull type dog or not. &quot;Pit bull-type dogs are defined as any dog displaying a majority of physical traits of any one or more of the specific breeds mentioned above [American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, or Staffordshire Bull Terrier], or any dog exhibiting those distinguishing (physical) characteristics that substantially conform to the standards established by American Kennel Club or United Kennel Club&quot;.

Whether the dog type pit bull can be sufficiently defined has been the subject of legal disputes. For example, the claim that the legal phrase &quot;commonly known as a pit bull dog&quot; is unconstitutionally vague has been dismissed by judicial decisions: &quot;...the ownership of a dog &#x27;commonly known as a pit bull dog&#x27; is prima facie evidence of the ownership of a vicious dog, is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness since dogs commonly known as pit bulls possess unique and readily identifiable physical and behavioral traits which are capable of recognition both by dog owners of ordinary intelligence and by enforcement personnel.&quot; The court also found that specific behavioral features distinguish pit bulls from other dogs and therefore can be taken into account when identifying a pit bull: &quot;Furthermore, the dog owner of ordinary intelligence, when determining whether he or she owns a pit bull dog, need not rely solely on the dog&#x27;s physical traits. Rather, the pit bull possesses certain distinctive behavioral features which differentiate it from other dog breeds.&quot;

Challenges of mixed or cross breed identification

Mixed or cross breed identification can be more challenging than pure breed identification and can be supported by testing for genetic markers. However, DNA-based ancestry testing that works with owner-reported databases can be unreliable and the American Kennel Club does not recommend using those. For example, the Manawatū District Council does not accept DNA heritage testing for pit bulls, instead they look at a dog&#x27;s certain physical traits. 

Studies have found that when people involved in dog rescue, adoption, and regulation identify the breed of a dog of mixed parentage, this identification did not always correlate with the DNA analysis of that dog. Mixed-breed dogs are often labeled as pit bulls if they have certain physical characteristics, such as a square-shaped head or bulky body type.

Deliberate mislabeling of pit bulls

In Australia some dog owners give false information regarding the breed of their dog to local authorities, despite this being an offence under the Crimes Act. Inquests after fatal or serious dog attacks showed that pit bull owners registered their dogs under a wide range of other breeds, like the Australian Terrier, to evade their local laws and regulations.

In France, investigations following the dog attack death of Elisa Pilarski led to the discovery that her partner and dog&#x27;s owner had deliberately passed off a purebred American Pit Bull Terrier as a mix of a Whippet and a Patterdale Terrier and imported it into the country illegally. American Pit Bull Terriers are not recognized as a breed in France and are considered a pit bull type, which has been banned in the country since 1999.
== Dog attack and death risk ==
A 2000 joint review project between researchers in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) found the data indicated that Rottweilers and pit bull–type dogs accounted for 67% of human dog bite-related fatalities in the United States between 1997 and 1998, and followed with &quot;It is extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.&quot; Pit bull–type dogs were identified in approximately one-third of dog bite-related fatalities in the United States between 1981 and 1992. The review notes that studies on dog bite-related fatalities which collect information by surveying news reports are subject to potential errors, as some fatal attacks may not have been reported, a study might not find all relevant news reports, and the dog breed might be misidentified. However, after 2000 the CDC stopped tracking dog bites, and in 2001, Julie Gilchrist, a CDC pediatrician and epidemiologist, stated that part of the reason the CDC stopped collecting dog bite data was because &quot;making meaningful analysis [of the data][was] nearly impossible&quot;.

In a 2021 review of 19 retrospective dog bite studies from U.S. Level I trauma centers, pit bulls were found to inflict a higher prevalence and severity of injuries compared with other breeds. A 2020 literature review in &quot;Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&quot; found that from 1971 to 2018 of all pure breed dogs in the United States, pit bull–type breeds were second, behind the German Shepherd, and ahead of Labradors, Chow Chows, and Rottweilers (in that order) for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment. The study found that the proportion of bites caused by German Shepherds decreased by 0.63 percent per year over that time interval while the proportion caused by pit bulls increased by 1.17 percent per year. The pit bull proportion of dog bites increased more slowly in Denver, Colorado, where breed-specific legislation had been in place.

In a 2014 literature review of dog bite studies, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) argues that breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites. According to the AVMA, controlled studies have not identified pit bulls as disproportionately dangerous, but other studies have found that, compared with other dog breeds, pit bulls were more likely to inflict complex injuries, are more likely to attack unprovoked, and are more likely to go off property to do so. Pit bull–type dogs are more frequently identified with cases involving very severe injuries or fatalities than other breeds, but a 2007 study suggested this may relate to the popularity of the breed, noting that sled dogs, such as Siberian Huskies, were involved in a majority of fatal dog attacks in some areas of Canada. Bite statistics by breed are no longer tracked by the CDC, and are discouraged by the AVMA and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

Pit bulls were originally developed from dogs that were bred for bull baiting and dog fighting. Pit bull attacks are often perceived as taking place &quot;without warning&quot;, possibly due to the type&#x27;s fighting heritage, as fighting dogs that do not signal aggression may do better in the ring. However, recent research suggests that this perception may reflect a lack of knowledge of dog body-language, and owners&#x27; over-confidence in their ability to interpret those signs. In fighting with dogs of other breeds, pit bulls, German Shepherds, Great Danes and Rottweilers were often the aggressor, and more than twenty percent of studied Akitas, Jack Russell Terriers and pit bulls displayed serious aggression towards other dogs. Although there may be a connection between breed of dog and aggression towards humans, the difficulty of classifying dog attacks by specific breed after the fact has made this point controversial and debated. Violent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the U.S. government, notably the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as academic veterinary researchers. The interpretation of these studies, breed identification and relevance issues, and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy. Additionally, researchers on both sides of the pit bull debate rarely disclose when they are being funded by lobbyists, leading to a risk that the scientific literature on pit bulls has been influenced by money.

Pit bulls are known for their tenacity and refusal to release a bite, even in the face of great pain. A popular myth mischaracterized pit bulls as having &quot;locking jaws.&quot; The refusal to let go is a behavioral, not physiological trait, and there is no locking mechanism in a pit bull&#x27;s jaws. Pit bull–type dogs, like other terriers, hunting and bull-baiting breeds, can exhibit a bite, hold, and shake behavior and at times refuse to release. Pit bulls also have wide skulls, well-developed facial muscles, and strong jaws, and some research suggests that pit bull bites are particularly serious because they tend to bite deeply and grind their molars into tissue. Breaking an ammonia ampule and holding it up to the dog&#x27;s nose can cause the dog to release its hold.

=== In animal shelters ===
Many people consider pit bulls undesirable, making it harder for animal shelters to adopt them out. Surveys have found that animal shelter workers intentionally misidentify pit bulls to improve their adoption rates, or to avoid euthanizing them in jurisdictions where they are banned. Animal advocates recommend that shelters stop labeling breeds to improve pit bull adoption rates. Pit bulls also have higher rates of unsuccessful adoptions, and are more likely than other kinds of dogs to be returned to a shelter multiple times and eventually euthanized. Whether pit bull adoptions fail more often than other types of dog due to breed behavioral traits, or due to public stigma, is not known, but in general the most common reasons why shelter dog adoptions fail are behavioral problems or incompatibility with the adopter&#x27;s existing pets.

=== Breed-specific legislation ===
Widely reported pit bull attacks have resulted in the enactment of breed-specific legislation (BSL) in several jurisdictions. In two cases, breed-specific bans have been reversed by city councils.

Breed-specific legislation has been largely found to be ineffective at reducing the number of dog attacks. Research has indicated that there is resistance by those who work in the adoption industry, applying a sharper distinction before allowing a dog to be labeled as a pit bull, as well as objections from veterinarians.

Many of the jurisdictions that restrict pit bulls apply their restriction to the modern American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and any other dog that has the substantial physical characteristics and appearance of those breeds, such as the Canadian province of Ontario. Denver, Colorado lifted its longstanding ban on the breed in 2021 following a referendum that voted to repeal the ban.

However, a few jurisdictions, such as Singapore, also classify the modern American Bulldog as a &quot;pit bull–type dog&quot;.

Courts in the United States and Canada have ruled that expert identification, when using published breed standards, is sufficient for the enforcement of breed-specific legislation.

Debates often center on whether apparent aggressive tendencies are the result of poor dog ownership or natural behaviors of the breed.

In England, Wales and Scotland, the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991 prohibits the ownership of American Pit Bull Terriers, along with three other breeds; the Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs. Similar legislation exists in Australia. Under Irish law, American Pit Bull Terriers must be led by someone at least 16 years of age, kept on a short strong lead, be muzzled, and wear a collar bearing the name and address of their owner in public at all times. 

In Germany the importation of pit bulls is banned.

Despite being a banned breed, in 2023 there were 3,316 registered pit bull–type dogs in England and Wales, an increase over the 2,323 that were registered ten years earlier. The dogs are permitted under a system of exemptions that are contingent on owners complying with special rules, such as muzzling them in public and having liability insurance.

Seventeen U.S. States prohibit local governments from enacting breed-specific ordinances: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.

=== Liability insurance ===
Dog owners in the United States can be held legally liable for injuries inflicted or caused by their dogs. In general, owners are considered liable if they were unreasonably careless in handling or restraining the dog, or if they knew beforehand that the dog had a tendency to cause injury (e.g., bite); however, dog owners are automatically considered liable if local laws hold an owner strictly liable for all damage caused by their dog, regardless of carelessness or foreknowledge of a dog&#x27;s tendencies. Homeowners and renters insurance policies typically provide liability coverage from US$100,000–300,000 for injuries inflicted by dogs; however, some insurance companies limit their exposure to dog bite liability claims by putting restrictions on dog owners that they insure. These restrictions include refusing to cover dog bites under the insurance policy, increasing insurance rates for homeowners with specific breeds, requiring owners of specific breeds to take special training or have their dogs pass the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen test, requiring owners to restrict their dogs with muzzles, chains, or enclosures, and refusing to write policies for homeowners or renters who have specific breeds of dogs.

Owners of rental properties may also be held liable if they knew an aggressive dog was living on their property and they did nothing to ensure the safety of other tenants at the property; as a result, many rental properties forbid pit bull–type dogs and any other breeds if the rental property&#x27;s insurance will not cover damage inflicted by that type of dog. The dog breeds most often not covered by insurance companies include pit bull–type dogs, Rottweilers, German Shepherd Dogs, Doberman Pinschers, Akitas (Akita Inu and American Akitas), and Chow Chows.

In 2013, Farmers Insurance notified policyholders in California that it would no longer cover bites by pit bulls, Rottweilers and wolf-dog hybrids. A spokeswoman for Farmers said that those groups account for more than a quarter of the agency&#x27;s dog bite claims.

=== Air carrier restrictions ===

The following table has a sampling of air carrier embargoes on pit bulls.
== Notable pit bulls ==

* Sallie Ann Jarrett, the mascot of the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War.
* Nipper, a mongrel at times referred to as a pit bull, though commonly seen as a non pit bull–type terrier, is the dog in Francis Barraud&#x27;s 1898 painting &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;.
* Sergeant Stubby, a dog of disputed breed who served for the 102nd Infantry, 26th (Yankee) Division during World War I, has been called a pit bull.
* Pete the Pup, a character from the movie series &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, was played by pit bull–type dogs. 
* Twenty-first century dogs include Star, who, while protecting her owner, was shot by police in a video that went viral, and Daddy, dog trainer Cesar Millan&#x27;s right-hand dog, who was known for his mellow temperament and his ability to interact calmly with ill-mannered dogs.

==As a symbol==
Owning dogs like pit bulls and Rottweilers can be seen as a symbol of power or status symbol. Pit bulls have been cultural symbols in &quot;urban ghettos&quot; and a part of hip hop culture. According to the Anti-Defamation League, pit bulls have been adopted as a hate symbol by racist skinheads. The White supremacist group Keystone State Skinheads have used a specific graphic of a pit bull as their logo.

Pit bulls have appeared in American World War I propaganda.

Pit bulls have appeared in the logos of Brown Shoe Company and Lagunitas Brewing Company. The above-mentioned Nipper appeared in a number of logos, including the RCA, the British His Master&#x27;s Voice record label, and the HMV retail chain. 

In 2005, two American lawyers used a pit bull logo and the phone number 1-800-PIT-BULL in a television advertisement to convey that they were &quot;especially fierce litigators&quot;. The Supreme Court of Florida ruled that this use was in breach of Florida Bar advertising rules.

<doc id="64237" wikidata="Q737888" url="?curid=64237" title="Portmeirion">
<text>Portmeirion (; ) is a folly tourist village in Gwynedd, North Wales. It lies on the estuary of the River Dwyryd in the community of Penrhyndeudraeth, from Porthmadog and from Minffordd railway station. Portmeirion was designed and built by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis between 1925 and 1975 in the Baroque style and is now owned by a charitable trust. It has served as the location for numerous films and television shows, most famously as &quot;the Village&quot; in the 1960s television show &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

Many of the buildings within the village are listed by Cadw, the Welsh historic environment service, for their architectural and historical importance, and the gardens are listed, at Grade II*, on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

==History==
Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, Portmeirion&#x27;s architect, denied repeated claims that the design was based on the fishing village of Portofino on the Italian Riviera. He stated only that he wanted to pay tribute to the atmosphere of the Mediterranean. He did, however, draw on a love of the Italian village stating, &quot;How should I not have fallen for Portofino? Indeed, its image remained with me as an almost perfect example of the man-made adornment and use of an exquisite site.&quot; Williams-Ellis designed and constructed the village between 1925 and 1975. He incorporated fragments of demolished buildings, including works by a number of other architects. Portmeirion&#x27;s architectural bricolage and deliberately fanciful nostalgia have been noted as an influence on the development of postmodernism in architecture in the late 20th century.

The main building of the hotel and the cottages &quot;White Horses&quot;, &quot;Mermaid&quot;, and &quot;Salutation&quot; had been a private estate called &quot;Aber Iâ&quot; (), developed in the 1850s on the site of a late 18th-century foundry and boatyard. Williams-Ellis changed the name (which he had interpreted as &quot;frozen mouth&quot;) to &quot;Portmeirion&quot;: &quot;Port-&quot; from its place on the coast; &quot;-meirion&quot; from the county of Merioneth (Meirionydd) in which it was sited. The very minor remains of a mediaeval castle (known variously as Castell Deudraeth, Castell Gwain Goch and Castell Aber Iâ) are in the woods just outside the village, recorded by Gerald of Wales in 1188.

In 1931 Williams-Ellis bought from the estate of his uncle, Sir Osmond Williams, Bt (1849-1927), the Victorian crenellated mansion Castell Deudraeth with the intention of incorporating it into the Portmeirion hotel complex, but the intervention of the war and other problems prevented this. Williams-Ellis had always considered the Castell to be “the largest and most imposing single building on the Portmeirion Estate&quot; and sought ways to incorporate it. Eventually, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund as well as the Wales Tourist Board, his original aims were achieved and Castell Deudraeth was opened by the Welsh opera singer Bryn Terfel as an 11 bedroom hotel and restaurant on 20 August 2001, 23 years after Williams-Ellis&#x27;s death.

The village of Portmeirion has been a source of inspiration for writers and television producers. Noël Coward wrote &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; while staying in the &quot;Fountain 2&quot; (&quot;Upper Fountain&quot;) suite at Portmeirion, though Clough Williams-Ellis, in a television interview, said: &quot;...the Watch House...where Noel Coward wrote that delightful thing of his, Blithe Spirit&quot;. George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells were also early visitors. In 1956 the architect Frank Lloyd Wright came, and other famous guests included Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman. In the late 1950s, Stanley Long, a former RAF photographer, came to create a collectible stereoview series through VistaScreen. The village has many connections to the Beatles. Their manager Brian Epstein was a frequent visitor, along with Paul McCartney, and George Harrison spent his 50th birthday there in 1993. It was while Harrison was in Portmeirion that he filmed interviews for The Beatles Anthology documentary. Musician Jools Holland visited whilst filming for the TV music show &quot;The Tube&quot;, and was so impressed that he had his studio and other buildings at his home in Blackheath built to a design inspired by Portmeirion.

Portmeirion is now owned by a charitable trust, and has always been run as a hotel, which uses most of the buildings as hotel rooms or self-catering cottages, together with shops, a cafe, tea-room, and restaurant. Portmeirion is today a major tourist attraction in North Wales and day visits can be made on payment of an admission charge.

The village was the setting of the inaugural Festival N°6, which took place in September 2012 and featured headline acts Spiritualized, Primal Scream and New Order. The festival then ran each year in September at Portmeirion until 2018, when the festival organisers announced that the festival would be taking an indefinite break.

==Architecture==

Architecture critic Lewis Mumford devoted a large part of a chapter of his 1963 book &quot;The Highway and the City&quot; to Portmeirion, which he called an artful and playful little modern village, designed as a whole and all of a piece ... a fantastic collection of architectural relics and impish modern fantasies. ... As an architect, [Williams-Ellis] is equally at home in the ancient, traditional world of the stark Welsh countryside and the once brave new world of &quot;modern architecture.&quot; But he realized earlier than most of his architectural contemporaries how constricted and desiccated modern forms can become when the architect pays more attention to the mechanical formula or the exploitation of some newly fabricated material than to the visible human results. In a sense, Portmeirion is a gay, deliberately irresponsible reaction against the dull sterilities of so much that passes as modern architecture today. ... [I]t is prompted by [the] impulse ... to reclaim for architecture the freedom of invention — and the possibility of pleasurable fantasy — it had too abjectly surrendered to the cult of the machine.
Mumford referred to the architecture as both romantic and picturesque in Baroque form, &quot;with tongue in cheek.&quot; He described the total effect as &quot;relaxing and often enchanting&quot; with &quot;playful absurdities&quot; that are &quot;delicate and human in touch&quot;, making the village a &quot;happy relief&quot; from the &quot;rigid irrationalities and the calculated follies&quot; of the modern world.

The houses Anchor, Arches, the hotel building, Lady&#x27;s Lodge, the inside of the Pantheon and the vaulted ceiling of Gate House are decorated with murals and frescoes by the Frankfurt-born artist and friend of Clough Williams-Ellis Hans Feibusch.

Portmeirion Town Hall is a grade I listed building, incorporating stonework and the Hercules Hall from the demolished Emral Hall in Flintshire. Many other buildings and structures within the village have their own listings.

=== Chronology of construction ===
==Y Gwyllt (gardens)==
The grounds (&quot;Y Gwyllt&quot;, meaning &#x27;The Wild place&#x27;) contain a collection of rhododendrons and other exotic plants in a wild-garden setting, which was begun before Williams-Ellis&#x27;s time by the previous owner George Henry Caton Haigh and has continued to be developed since Williams-Ellis&#x27;s death.

Y Gwyllt forms an approximately triangular shaped area on the peninsula to the north of the Hotel (the area was formerly the pleasure gardens of Aber Iâ mansion) and stretches down to the coast and the Dwyryd estuary. Its location by the sea means it is frost-free, making it possible to grow rare plants such as camellias and &quot;an outstanding rhododendron collection of the early twentieth century&quot;. The area also contains a Dog Cemetery.

The gardens are designated, at Grade II*, on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

== Filming location ==

Television series and films have shot exterior scenes at Portmeirion, often depicting the village as an exotic European location. These include the 1960 &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode &quot;View from the Villa&quot; starring Patrick McGoohan and the 1976 four-episode &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story titled &quot;The Masque of Mandragora&quot; set in Renaissance Italy. The last episode of &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, the Christmas 1980 episode &quot;Buon Natale&quot;, was filmed partly in Portmeirion. In 2002, some scenes were filmed there for the final episode (at the time) of the TV series &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. Both the CBeebies series &quot;Gigglebiz&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;Captain Adorable&quot; were shot in Portmeirion. The village of Llan-ar-goll-en, which appeared in the Welsh preschool show of the same name on S4C, was also shot there.

Portmeirion has been the location for music videos and concerts. The 1980s Scottish band Altered Images used Portmeirion in their video &quot;See Those Eyes&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees used Portmeirion as a setting in their 1987 recording of &quot;The Passenger&quot; for the &quot;Laughing Prisoner&quot; spoof. This video included various scenes from &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

===&quot;The Prisoner&quot;===
In 1966–1967, Patrick McGoohan returned to Portmeirion to film exteriors for &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, a surreal spy drama in which Portmeirion played a starring role as &quot;The Village&quot;, in which McGoohan&#x27;s retired intelligence agent, known only as &quot;Number 6&quot;, was incarcerated and interrogated, albeit in pleasant surroundings. At Williams-Ellis&#x27; request, Portmeirion was not identified on screen as the filming location until the credits of the final episode of the series, and indeed, Williams-Ellis stated that the levy of an entrance fee was a deliberate ploy to prevent the Village from being spoilt by overcrowding. The show, broadcast on ITV in the UK during the winter of 1967-68 and CBS in the US in the summer of 1968, became a cult classic, and fans continue to visit Portmeirion, which hosts annual &quot;Prisoner&quot; fan conventions.

The building that was used as the lead character&#x27;s home in the series was used as a &quot;Prisoner&quot;-themed souvenir shop. Many of the locations used in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; are virtually unchanged after more than 50 years. A large outdoor chess board was installed in 2016 in homage to its appearance in the series.

Because of its &quot;Prisoner&quot; connection, Portmeirion has been used as the filming location for a number of homages to the series, ranging from comedy skits to an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;The Celts&quot;, which recreated scenes from &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Other instances have included:

*In 1987 Jools Holland starred in a spoof documentary, &quot;The Laughing Prisoner&quot;, with Stephen Fry, Terence Alexander, and Hugh Laurie. Much of it was shot on location in Portmeirion, and it included archive footage of McGoohan.
*Portmeirion, along with the Welsh village of Morfa Bychan, was used as the location for the filming of the Supergrass video &quot;Alright&quot;. The video includes numerous references to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.
*Iron Maiden recorded a song called &quot;The Prisoner&quot; on their album &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1982). In a documentary programme about that album (as part of the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; TV series), lead singer Bruce Dickinson wanders through the avenues of Portmeirion and describes how the song was written and how the band&#x27;s manager obtained permission from Patrick McGoohan to use dialogue from the show in the song&#x27;s introduction.
*The Channel 4 music programme &quot;The Tube&quot; produced videos for XTC&#x27;s songs &quot;The Meeting Place&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul&quot;, both of which were filmed in Portmeirion with the band wearing costumes from &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.
*In Series 12, Episode 13 of &quot;Wheeler Dealers&quot; the finished Caterham 7 is taken to Portmeirion to pay homage to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, which featured the Lotus 7, the predecessor of the Caterham 7.

<doc id="64240" wikidata="Q164535" url="?curid=64240" title="Mobutu Sese Seko">
<text>Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa za Banga ( ; born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu; 14 October 1930 – 7 September 1997), often shortened to Mobutu Sese Seko or Mobutu and also known by his initials MSS, was a Congolese politician and military officer who was the first and only president of Zaire from 1971 to 1997. Previously, Mobutu served as the second president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1965 to 1971. He also served as the fifth chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity from 1967 to 1968. During the Congo Crisis, Mobutu, serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and supported by Belgium and the United States, deposed the democratically elected government of left-wing nationalist Patrice Lumumba in 1960. Mobutu installed a government that arranged for Lumumba&#x27;s execution in 1961, and continued to lead the country&#x27;s armed forces until he took power directly in a second coup in 1965.

To consolidate his power, he established the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal political party in 1967, changed the Congo&#x27;s name to &quot;Zaire&quot; in 1971, and his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu claimed that his political ideology was &quot;neither left nor right, nor even centre&quot;, though nevertheless he developed a regime that was intensely autocratic. He attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence through his program of &quot;national authenticity&quot;. Mobutu was the object of a pervasive cult of personality. During his rule, he amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption, leading some to call his rule a &quot;kleptocracy&quot;. He presided over a period of widespread human rights violations. Under his rule, the nation also suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations.

Mobutu received strong support (military, diplomatic and economic) from the United States, France, and Belgium, given his opposition to communism in Francophone Africa. He also built close ties with the governments of apartheid South Africa, Israel and the Greek junta.

By 1990, economic deterioration and unrest forced Mobutu Sese Seko into a coalition with political opponents and to allow a multiparty system. Although he used his troops to thwart change, his antics did not last long. In May 1997, rebel forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila overran the country and forced him into exile. Already suffering from advanced prostate cancer, he died three months later in Morocco. Mobutu was notorious for corruption and nepotism: estimates of his personal wealth range from $50 million to $5 billion. He was known for extravagances such as shopping trips to Paris via the supersonic Concorde aircraft.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Mobutu, a member of the Ngbandi ethnic group, was born in 1930 in Lisala, Belgian Congo. Mobutu&#x27;s mother, Marie Madeleine Yemo, was a hotel maid who fled to Lisala to escape the harem of a local village chief. There she met and married Albéric Gbemani, a cook for a Belgian judge. Shortly afterward she gave birth to Mobutu. The name &quot;Mobutu&quot; was selected by an uncle.

Gbemani died when Mobutu was eight. Thereafter, he was raised by an uncle and a grandfather.

The Belgian judge&#x27;s wife took a liking to Mobutu and taught him to speak, read, and write fluently in the French language, the official language of the country in the colonial period. His widowed mother Yemo relied on the help of relatives to support her four children, and the family moved often. Mobutu&#x27;s earliest education took place in the capital Léopoldville (now Kinshasa). His mother eventually sent him to an uncle in Coquilhatville (present-day Mbandaka), where he attended the Christian Brothers School, a Catholic-mission boarding school. He excelled in academic subjects and ran the class newspaper. He was also known for his pranks and impish sense of humor.

A classmate recalled that when the Belgian priests, whose first language was Dutch, made an error in French, Mobutu would leap to his feet in class and point out the mistake. In 1949 Mobutu stowed away aboard a boat, traveling downriver to Léopoldville, where he met a girl. The priests found him several weeks later. At the end of the school year, in lieu of being sent to prison, he was ordered to serve seven years in the colonial army, the Force Publique (FP). This was a usual punishment for rebellious students.

===Army service===
Mobutu found discipline in army life, as well as a father figure in Sergeant Louis Bobozo. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare moment. His favorites were the writings of French president Charles de Gaulle, British prime minister Winston Churchill, and Italian Renaissance philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli. After passing a course in accounting, Mobutu began to dabble professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.

=== Early political involvement ===
As a soldier, Mobutu wrote in pseudonym on contemporary politics for &quot;Actualités Africaines&quot; (African News), a magazine set up by a Belgian colonial. In 1956, he quit the army and became a full-time journalist, writing for the Léopoldville daily &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;.

Two years later, he went to Belgium to cover the 1958 World Exposition and stayed to receive training in journalism. By this time, Mobutu had met many of the young Congolese intellectuals who were challenging colonial rule. He became friendly with Patrice Lumumba and joined Lumumba&#x27;s Congolese National Movement (MNC). Mobutu eventually became Lumumba&#x27;s personal aide. Several contemporaries indicate that Belgian intelligence had recruited Mobutu to be an informer to the government.

During the 1960 talks in Brussels on Congolese independence, the US embassy held a reception for the Congolese delegation. Embassy staff were each assigned a list of delegation members to meet, and discussed their impressions afterward. The ambassador noted, &quot;One name kept coming up. But it wasn&#x27;t on anyone&#x27;s list because he wasn&#x27;t an official delegation member, he was Lumumba&#x27;s secretary. But everyone agreed that this was an extremely intelligent man, very young, perhaps immature, but a man with great potential.&quot;

Following the general election, Lumumba was tasked with creating a government. He gave Mobutu the office of Secretary of State to the Presidency. Mobutu held much influence in the final determination of the rest of the government. He lost private access to Lumumba following independence, as the new prime minister grew busy and surrounded by aides and colleagues, leading the two to drift apart.

===Congo Crisis===

On 5 July 1960, soldiers of the Force Publique stationed at Camp Léopold II in Léopoldville, dissatisfied with their all-white leadership and working conditions, mutinied. The revolt spread across the region in the following days. Mobutu assisted other officials in negotiating with the mutineers to secure the release of the officers and their families. On 8 July the full Council of Ministers convened in an extraordinary session under the chairmanship of President Joseph Kasa-Vubu at Camp Léopold II to address the task of Africanising the garrison.

The ministers debated over who would make a suitable army chief of staff. The two main candidates for the post were Minister of Youth and Sports Maurice Mpolo and Mobutu. The former had shown some influence over the mutinying troops, but Kasa-Vubu and the Bakongo ministers feared that he would enact a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; if he were given power. The latter was perceived as calmer and more thoughtful. Lumumba saw Mpolo as courageous, but favored Mobutu&#x27;s prudence. As the discussions continued, the cabinet began to divide according to who they preferred to serve as chief of staff. Lumumba wanted to keep both men in his government and wished to avoid upsetting one of their camps of supporters. In the end Mobutu was given the role and awarded the rank of colonel. The following day government delegations left the capital to oversee the Africanisation of the army; Mobutu was sent to Équateur. While he was there Mpolo acted as ANC Chief of Staff. Mobutu was affronted by this development, and upon his return to the capital he confronted Lumumba in a cabinet meeting, saying, &quot;Either I was unworthy, and you have to dismiss me, or I faithfully accomplished my mission and so I keep my rank and functions.&quot;

The British diplomat Brian Urquhart serving with the United Nations wrote: &quot;When I first met Mobutu in July 1960, he was Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba&#x27;s chief military assistant and had just promoted himself from sergeant to lieutenant-colonel. By comparison with his boss, Mobutu was a pillar of pragmatism and common sense. It was to him that we appealed when our people were arrested by Lumumba&#x27;s hashish-stimulated guards. It was he who would bring up, in a disarmingly casual way, Lumumba&#x27;s most outrageous requests – that the UN should, for example, meet the pay roll of the potentially mutinous Congolese army. In those early days, Mobutu seemed a comparatively sensible young man, one who might even, at least now and then, have the best interests of his newly independent country at heart.&quot;

Encouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Concerned that the United Nations force sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance. He received massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers within six weeks. As this was during the Cold War, the US government feared that the Soviet activity was a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasa-Vubu was encouraged by the US and Belgium to dismiss Lumumba, which he did on 5 September. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasa-Vubu deposed. Parliament refused to recognise the dismissals and urged reconciliation, but no agreement was reached.

Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu each ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers&#x27; salaries, as well as Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu&#x27;s subordinates, all favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On 14 September Mobutu launched a bloodless coup, declaring both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to be &quot;neutralised&quot; and establishing a new government of university graduates, the College of Commissioners-General. Lumumba rejected this action but was forced to retire to his residence, where UN peacekeepers prevented Mobutu&#x27;s soldiers from arresting him. Urquhart recalled that on the day of the coup, Mobutu showed up unannounced at the UN headquarters in Léopoldville and refused to leave, until the radio announced the coup, leading Mobutu to say over and over again &quot;C&#x27;est moi!&quot; (&quot;This is me!&quot;). Recognizing that Mobutu had only gone to the UN headquarters in case the coup should fail, Urquhart ordered him out.

Losing confidence that the international community would support his reinstatement, Lumumba fled in late November to join his supporters in Stanleyville to establish a new government. He was captured by Mobutu&#x27;s troops in early December, and incarcerated at his headquarters in Thysville. However, Mobutu still considered him a threat, and transferred him to the rebelling State of Katanga on 17 January 1961. Lumumba disappeared from public view. It was later discovered that he was executed the same day by the secessionist forces of Moise Tshombe, after Mobutu&#x27;s government turned him over.
On 23 January 1961, Kasa-Vubu promoted Mobutu to major-general. Historian De Witte argues that this was a political action, &quot;aimed to strengthen the army, the president&#x27;s sole support, and Mobutu&#x27;s position within the army&quot;.

In 1964, Pierre Mulele led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two-thirds of the Congo. In response, the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, reconquered the entire territory through 1965.

===Second &quot;coup&quot; and consolidation of power===
Prime Minister Moise Tshombe&#x27;s Congolese National Convention had won a large majority in the March 1965 elections, but Kasa-Vubu appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, Évariste Kimba, as prime minister-designate. However, Parliament twice refused to confirm him. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup on 24 November. He had turned 35 a month earlier.

Under the auspices of a state of exception (&quot;regime d&#x27;exception&quot;), Mobutu assumed sweeping—almost absolute—powers for five years. In his first speech upon taking power, Mobutu told a large crowd at Léopoldville&#x27;s main stadium that, since politicians had brought the Congo to ruin in five years, it would take him at least that long to set things right again, and therefore there would be no more political party activity for five years. On 30 November 1965 Parliament approved a measure which turned over most legislative powers to Mobutu and his cabinet, though it retained the right to review his decrees. In early March 1966 he opened a new session of Parliament by declaring that he was revoking their right of review, and two weeks later his government permanently suspended the body and assumed all of its remaining functions.
Initially, Mobutu&#x27;s government presented itself as apolitical or even anti-political. The word &quot;politician&quot; carried negative connotations, and became almost synonymous with someone who was wicked or corrupt. In 1966 the Corps of Volunteers of the Republic was established, a vanguard movement designed to mobilize popular support behind Mobutu, who was proclaimed the nation&#x27;s &quot;Second National Hero&quot; after Lumumba. Despite the role he played in Lumumba&#x27;s ousting, Mobutu worked to present himself as a successor to Lumumba&#x27;s legacy. One of his key tenets early in his rule was &quot;authentic Congolese nationalism&quot;. In 1966, Mobutu started renaming cities that had European names with more &quot;authentic&quot; African names, and in this way Léopoldville became Kinshasa, Stanleyville became Kisangani and Élisabethville became Lubumbashi.

1967 marked the debut of the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation&#x27;s only legal political party. Among the themes advanced by the MPR in its doctrine, the Manifesto of N&#x27;Sele, were nationalism, revolution, and &quot;authenticity&quot;. Revolution was described as a &quot;truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic&quot;, which called for &quot;the repudiation of both capitalism and communism&quot;. One of the MPR&#x27;s slogans was &quot;Neither left nor right&quot;, to which would be added &quot;nor even center&quot; in later years.

That same year, all trade unions were consolidated into a single union, the National Union of Zairian Workers, and brought under government control. Mobutu intended for the union to serve as an instrument of support for government policy, rather than as an independent group. Independent trade unions were illegal until 1991.
Facing many challenges early in his rule, Mobutu converted much opposition into submission through patronage; those he could not co-opt, he dealt with forcefully. In 1966, four cabinet members were arrested on charges of complicity in an attempted coup, tried by a military tribunal, and publicly executed in an open-air spectacle witnessed by over 50,000 people. Uprisings by former Katangan gendarmeries were crushed, as were the Stanleyville mutinies of 1967 led by white mercenaries. By 1970, nearly all potential threats to his authority had been smashed, and for the most part, law and order was brought to nearly all parts of the country. That year marked the pinnacle of Mobutu&#x27;s legitimacy and power.

In 1970 King Baudouin of Belgium made a highly successful state visit to Kinshasa. That same year presidential and legislative elections were held. Although the constitution allowed for the existence of two parties, the MPR was the only party allowed to nominate candidates. For the presidential election, Mobutu was the only candidate. Voting was not secret; voters chose a green paper if they supported Mobutu&#x27;s candidacy, and a red paper if they opposed his candidacy. Casting a green ballot was deemed a vote for hope, while a red ballot was deemed a vote for chaos. Under the circumstances, the result was inevitable–according to official figures, Mobutu was confirmed in office with near-unanimous support, garnering 10,131,669 votes to only 157 &quot;no&quot; votes. It later emerged that almost 30,500 more votes were cast than the actual number of registered voters. The legislative elections were held in a similar fashion. Voters were presented with a single list from the MPR; according to official figures, an implausible 98.33% of voters voted in favor of the MPR list.

As he consolidated power, Mobutu set up several military forces whose sole purpose was to protect him. These included the Special Presidential Division, Civil Guard and Service for Action, and Military Intelligence (SNIP).

===Authenticity campaign===

Embarking on a campaign of pro-Africa cultural awareness, called &quot;authenticité&quot;, Mobutu began renaming cities that reflected the colonial past, starting on 1 June 1966: Léopoldville became Kinshasa, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Stanleyville became Kisangani. In October 1971, he renamed the country as the Republic of Zaire. He ordered the people to change their European names to African ones, and priests were warned that they would face five years&#x27; imprisonment if they were caught baptizing a Zairian child with a European name. Western attire and ties were banned, and men were forced to wear a Mao-style tunic known as an &quot;abacost&quot; (shorthand for &quot;à bas le costume&quot;, or &quot;down with the suit&quot;). Christmas was moved from December to June because it was more of an &quot;authentic&quot; date.

In 1972, in accordance with his own decree of a year earlier, Mobutu renamed himself &quot;Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga&quot; (meaning &quot;The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.&quot;). Around this time, he eschewed his military uniform in favor of what would become his classic image—the tall, imposing man carrying a walking stick while wearing an abacost, thick-framed glasses, and leopard-skin toque.

In 1974, a new constitution consolidated Mobutu&#x27;s grip on the country. It defined the MPR as the &quot;single institution&quot; in the country. It was officially defined as &quot;the nation politically organized&quot;—in essence, the state was a transmission belt for the party. All citizens automatically became members of the MPR from birth. The constitution stated that the MPR was embodied by the party&#x27;s president, who was elected every seven years at its national convention. At the same time, the party president was automatically nominated as the sole candidate for a seven-year term as president of the republic; he was confirmed in office by a referendum. The document codified the emergency powers Mobutu had exercised since 1965; it vested Mobutu with &quot;plenitude of power exercise&quot;, effectively concentrating all governing power in his hands. Mobutu was reelected three times under this system, each time by implausibly high margins of 98 percent or more. A single list of MPR candidates was returned to the legislature every five years with equally implausible margins; official figures gave the MPR list unanimous or near-unanimous support. At one of those elections, in 1975, formal voting was dispensed with altogether. Instead, the election took place by acclaim; candidates were presented at public locations around the country where they could be applauded.

==One-man rule==

Early in his rule, Mobutu consolidated power by publicly executing political rivals, secessionists, coup plotters, and other threats to his rule. To set an example, many were hanged before large audiences. Such victims included former Prime Minister Évariste Kimba, who, with three cabinet members—Jérôme Anany (Defense Minister), Emmanuel Bamba (Finance Minister), and Alexandre Mahamba (Minister of Mines and Energy)—was tried in May 1966, and sent to the gallows on 30 May, before an audience of 50,000 spectators. The men were executed on charges of being in contact with Colonel Alphonse Bangala and Major Pierre Efomi, for the purpose of planning a coup. Mobutu explained the executions as follows: &quot;One had to strike through a spectacular example, and create the conditions of regime discipline. When a chief takes a decision, he decides – period.&quot;

In 1968, Pierre Mulele, Lumumba&#x27;s Minister of Education and a rebel leader during the 1964 Simba rebellion, was lured out of exile in Brazzaville on the belief that he would receive amnesty. Instead, he was tortured and killed by Mobutu&#x27;s forces. While Mulele was still alive, his eyes were gouged out, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one.

Mobutu later switched to a new tactic, buying off political rivals. He used the slogan &quot;Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer still&quot; to describe his tactic of co-opting political opponents through bribery. A favorite Mobutu tactic was to play &quot;musical chairs&quot;, rotating members of his government, switching the cabinet roster constantly to ensure that no one would pose a threat to his rule. Between November 1965 and April 1997, Mobutu reshuffled his cabinet 60 times. The frequent cabinet reshuffles as intended encouraged insecurity in his ministers, who knew that the mercurial Mobutu would reshuffle his cabinet with no regard for efficiency and competence on the part of his ministers. The frequency that men entered and left the cabinet also encouraged gross corruption because ministers never knew how long they might be in office, thus encouraging them to steal as much as possible while they were in the cabinet. Another tactic was to arrest and sometimes torture dissident members of the government, only to later pardon them and reward them with high office. The Congolese historian Emizet F. Kisangani wrote: &quot;Most public officials knew that regardless of their inefficiency and degree of corruption, they could reenter the government. To hold a government position required neither a sense of management nor a good conscience. On most occasions, effectiveness and a good conscience were major obstacles to political advancement. Mobutu demanded absolute personal allegiance in return for the opportunity to accumulate wealth&quot;. As early as 1970, it was estimated that Mobutu had stolen 60% of the national budget that year, marking him as one of the most corrupt leaders in Africa and the world. Kisangani wrote that Mobutu created a system of institutional corruption that greatly debased public morality by rewarding venality and greed.

In 1972, Mobutu tried unsuccessfully to have himself named president for life. In June 1983, he raised himself to the rank of Marshal; the order was signed by General Likulia Bolongo. Victor Nendaka Bika, in his capacity as Vice-President of the Bureau of the Central Committee, second authority in the land, addressed a speech filled with praise for President Mobutu.

To gain the revenues of Congolese resources, Mobutu initially nationalized foreign-owned firms and forced European investors out of the country. But in many cases he handed the management of these firms to relatives and close associates, who quickly exercised their own corruption and stole the companies&#x27; assets. In 1973–1974, Mobutu launched his &quot;Zairianization&quot; campaign, nationalising foreign owned businesses that were handed over to Zairians. In October 1973, the Arab oil shock ended the &quot;long summer&quot; of prosperity in the West that had begun in 1945, and sent the world economy into its sharpest contraction since the Great Depression. One consequence of the oil shock and the resulting global recession was that the price of copper dropped by 50% over the course of 1974, which proved to be a disaster for Zaire as copper was its most important export. The American historian Thomas Odom wrote because of the collapse in copper prices Zaire went from &quot;prosperity to bankruptcy almost overnight&quot; in 1974. The economic collapse forced Zaire to turn towards the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help it manage its debts which could no longer be serviced. Seeking an alternative source of support as the auditors for the IMF discovered major corruption within the Zairian finances, Mobutu visited China in 1974 and returned wearing a Mao jacket and the new title of &quot;Citoyen Mobutu&quot; (&quot;Citizen Mobutu&quot;). Influenced by the Cultural Revolution, Mobutu shifted to the left and announced his intention to &quot;radicalize the Zairian revolution&quot;. The businesses that Mobutu had just handed over to Zairians were in turn nationalized and placed under state control. At the same time, Mobutu imposed a 50% salary cut to state employees, which led a failed coup attempt against him in June 1975.
By 1977, Mobutu&#x27;s nationalizations had precipitated such an economic slump that Mobutu was forced to try to woo foreign investors back. Katangan rebels based in Angola invaded Zaire that year, in retaliation for Mobutu&#x27;s support for anti-MPLA rebels. France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan paratroopers into the country and repulsed the rebels, ending Shaba I. The rebels attacked Zaire again, in greater numbers, in the Shaba II invasion of 1978. The governments of Belgium and France deployed troops with logistical support from the United States and defeated the rebels again. The poor performance of the Zairian Army during both Shaba invasions, which humiliated Mobutu by forcing him to ask for foreign troops, did not lead to military reforms. However, Mobutu reduced the size of the Army from 51,000 troops in 1978 down to 23,000 troops in 1980. By 1980, it was estimated that about 90% of the Zairian Army were Ngbandi as Mobutu did not trust the other peoples of Zaire to serve in the Army. The most loyal and best of Mobutu&#x27;s units were his bodyguards, the Israeli-trained &quot;Division Spéciale Présidentielle&quot; that was made up exclusively of Ngbandi and was always commanded by one of Mobutu&#x27;s relatives.

Mobutu was re-elected in single-candidate elections in 1977 and 1984. He spent most of his time increasing his personal fortune, which in 1988 was estimated to amount to no less than US$50 million. He held most of it out of the country in Swiss banks (however, a comparatively small $3.4 million was declared found in Swiss banks after he was ousted.). This was almost equivalent to the amount of the country&#x27;s foreign debt at the time. In a speech that he delivered on 20 May 1976 in a football stadium in Kinshasa that was filled with some 70,000 people, Mobutu openly accepted petty corruption, stating: &quot;If you want to steal, steal a little in a nice way, but if you steal too much to become rich overnight, you will be caught&quot;. By 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium.

Mobutu owned a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation&#x27;s roads deteriorated and many of his people starved. The infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and top political and military leaders. Only the Special Presidential Division – on whom his physical safety depended – was paid adequately or regularly. A popular saying that &quot;the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them&quot; expressed this grim reality. The &quot;Forces Armées Zaïroises&quot; (FAZ) suffered from low morale made worse by irregular salaries, dismal living conditions, shortages of supplies and a venal officer corps. The soldiers of the FAZ behaved very much like a brutal occupying force who supported themselves by robbing the civilian population of Zaire. A recurring feature of Mobutu&#x27;s rule were the seemingly endless number of roadblocks put by the FAZ who extorted money from the drivers of any passing automobile or lorries.

Another feature of Mobutu&#x27;s economic mismanagement, directly linked to the way he and his friends siphoned off so much of the country&#x27;s wealth, was rampant inflation. The rapid decline in the real value of salaries strongly encouraged a culture of corruption and dishonesty among public servants of all kinds.

Mobutu was known for his opulent lifestyle. He cruised on the Congo on his yacht &quot;Kamanyola&quot;. In Gbadolite, he erected a palace, the &quot;Versailles of the jungle&quot;. For shopping trips to Paris, he would charter a Concorde from Air France; he had the Gbadolite Airport constructed with a runway long enough to accommodate the Concorde&#x27;s extended take-off and landing requirements. In 1989, Mobutu chartered Concorde aircraft F-BTSD for a 26 June – 5 July trip to give a speech at the United Nations in New York City, then again on 16 July for French bicentennial celebrations in Paris (where he was a guest of President François Mitterrand), and on 19 September for a flight from Paris to Gbadolite, and another nonstop flight from Gbadolite to Marseille with the youth choir of Zaire.

Mobutu&#x27;s rule earned a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s foremost examples of kleptocracy and nepotism. Close relatives and fellow members of the Ngbandi tribe were awarded high positions in the military and government, and he groomed his eldest son, Nyiwa, to succeed him as president; however, Nyiwa died from AIDS in 1994.

Mobutu led one of the most enduring autocracies in Africa and amassed a personal fortune estimated to be over US$50 million by selling his nation&#x27;s rich natural resources while the people lived in poverty. While in office, he formed a totalitarian regime responsible for numerous human rights violations, attempted to purge the country of all Belgian cultural influences, and maintained an anti-communist stance to gain positive international support.
Mobutu was the subject of one of the most pervasive personality cults of the twentieth century. The evening newscast opened with an image of him descending through clouds like a god. His portraits were hung in many public places, and government officials wore lapel pins bearing his portrait. He held such titles as &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot;, &quot;Guide of the Revolution&quot;, &quot;Helmsman&quot;, &quot;Founder&quot;, &quot;Savior of the People&quot;, and &quot;Supreme Combatant&quot;. In the 1996 documentary of the 1974 Foreman–Ali fight in Zaire, dancers receiving the fighters can be heard chanting &quot;Sese Seko, Sese Seko&quot;. At one point, in early 1975, the media were forbidden to refer to anyone other than Mobutu by name; others were referred to only by the positions they held.

Mobutu successfully capitalized on Cold War tensions among European nations and the United States. He gained significant support from the West and its international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund.

===Space program===
In the late 1970s, the West Germany company OTRAG was developing a program to send peaceful satellites into space at lower costs, but a 1954 amendment to the Treaty of Brussels prevented them from developing and launching missiles in Germany. As a result, they paid Mobutu $130 million to develop their program in Zaire. In a 1978 agreement with OTRAG, Mobutu gave the company a 25-year rented plot of land in Zaire. The first rocket, OTRAG-1, was launched on May 18, 1977, while Mobutu watched from a distance. The rocket took off successfully, but shortly afterwards fell and crashed back down to the ground.

By June 6 of 1978, two more rockets had been launched and crashed in Zaire. Nevertheless Mobutu continued to promote the program, stating that 200 Zairians were employed by the project and the country would receive royalties from future rocket sales. Two years after the launch of the first rocket, the Soviet Union alleged that former Nazi scientists were involved with OTRAG, and became convinced that the company was secretly gathering military intelligence. Mobutu succumbed to Soviet pressure, ended the program, and cut ties with OTRAG.

===Foreign policy===
====Relations with Belgium====
Relations between Zaire and Belgium wavered between close intimacy and open hostility during the Mobutu years. More often than not, Belgian decision-makers responded in a lackluster way when Mobutu acted against the interests of Belgium, partly explained by the highly divided Belgian political class. Relations soured early in Mobutu&#x27;s rule over disputes involving the substantial Belgian commercial and industrial holdings in the country, but they warmed soon afterwards. Mobutu and his family were received as personal guests of the Belgian monarch in 1968, and a convention for scientific and technical cooperation was signed that same year. During King Baudouin&#x27;s highly successful visit to Kinshasa in 1970, a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries was signed. However, Mobutu tore up the treaty in 1974 in protest at Belgium&#x27;s refusal to ban an anti-Mobutu book written by left-wing lawyer Jules Chomé. Mobutu&#x27;s &quot;Zairianisation&quot; policy, which expropriated foreign-held businesses and transferred their ownership to Zairians, added to the strain. Mobutu maintained several personal contacts with prominent Belgians. Edmond Leburton, Belgian prime minister between 1973 and 1974, was someone greatly admired by the President. Alfred Cahen, career diplomat and &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; of minister Henri Simonet, became a personal friend of Mobutu when he was a student at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Relations with King Baudouin were mostly cordial, until Mobutu released a bold statement about the Belgian royal family. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens recalled in his memoirs that the palace gates closed completely after Mobutu published a handwritten letter of the King. Because of that, Mobutu was one of only two heads of state who did not receive an invitation to the funeral of Baudouin, the other being Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Next to friendly ties with Belgians residing in Belgium, Mobutu had a number of Belgian advisors at his disposal. Some of them, such as Hugues Leclercq and Colonel Willy Mallants, were interviewed in Thierry Michel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Mobutu, King of Zaire&quot;.

====Relations with France====
As what was then the second most populous French-speaking country in the world (it has subsequently come to have a larger population than France) and the most populous one in sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire was of great strategic interest to France. During the First Republic era, France tended to side with the conservative and federalist forces, as opposed to unitarists such as Lumumba. Shortly after the Katangan secession was successfully crushed, Zaire (then called the Republic of the Congo) signed a treaty of technical and cultural cooperation with France. During the presidency of Charles de Gaulle, diplomatic relations between the two countries gradually grew stronger and closer due to their many shared geopolitical interests. In 1971, Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing paid a visit to Zaire; later, after becoming France&#x27;s president, he would develop a close personal relationship with President Mobutu, and under his leadership, France became one of the Mobutu regime&#x27;s closest and most important foreign allies. During the Shaba invasions, France sided firmly with Mobutu: during the first Shaba invasion, France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops to Zaire, and the rebels were repulsed; a year later, during the second Shaba invasion, France itself (along with Belgium) would send French Foreign Legion paratroopers (2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment) to aid Mobutu.

====Relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China====
Initially, Zaire&#x27;s relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China was no better than its relationship with the Soviet Union. Memories of Chinese aid to Mulele and other Maoist rebels in Kwilu province during the ill-fated Simba Rebellion remained fresh on Mobutu&#x27;s mind. He also opposed seating the PRC at the United Nations. However, by 1972, he began to see the Chinese in a different light, as a counterbalance to both the Soviet Union as well as his intimate ties with the United States, Israel, and South Africa. In November 1972, Mobutu extended diplomatic recognition to the Chinese (as well as East Germany and North Korea). The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met with chairman Mao Zedong and received promises of $100 million in technical aid.

In 1974, Mobutu made a surprise visit to both China and North Korea, during the time he was originally scheduled to visit the Soviet Union. Upon returning home, both his politics and rhetoric became markedly more radical; it was around this time that Mobutu began criticizing Belgium and the United States (the latter for not doing enough, in Mobutu&#x27;s opinion, to combat white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia), introduced the &quot;obligatory civic work&quot; program called &quot;salongo&quot;, and initiated &quot;radicalization&quot; (an extension of 1973&#x27;s &quot;Zairianization&quot; policy). Mobutu even borrowed a title – the Helmsman – from Mao. Incidentally, late 1974 to early 1975 was when his personality cult reached its peak.

China and Zaire shared a common goal in central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the National Liberation Front of Angola (and later, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) in order to prevent their former allies, the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola, who were supported and augmented by Cuban forces, from coming to power. The Cubans, who exercised considerable influence in Africa in support of leftist and anti-imperialist forces, were heavily sponsored by the Soviet Union during the period. In addition to inviting Holden Roberto, the leader of the National Liberation Front of Angola, and his guerrillas to Beijing for training, China provided weapons and money to the rebels. Zaire itself launched an ill-fated, pre-emptive invasion of Angola in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government, but was repulsed by Cuban troops. The expedition was a fiasco with far-reaching repercussions, most notably the Shaba I and Shaba II invasions, both of which China opposed. China sent military aid to Zaire during both invasions, and accused the Soviet Union and Cuba (who were alleged to have supported the Shaban rebels, although this was and remains speculation) of working to de-stabilize central Africa.

====Relations with the Soviet Union====
Mobutu&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union was frosty and tense. A staunch anti-communist, he was not anxious to recognize the Soviets; the USSR had supported—though mostly in words—both Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu&#x27;s democratically elected predecessor, and the Simba rebellion. However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968. Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that year. Mobutu viewed the Soviet presence as advantageous for two reasons: it allowed him to maintain an image of non-alignment, and it provided a convenient scapegoat for problems at home. For example, in 1970, he expelled four Soviet diplomats for carrying out &quot;subversive activities&quot;, and in 1971, twenty Soviet officials were declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; for allegedly instigating student demonstrations at Lovanium University.

Moscow was the only major world capital Mobutu never visited, although he did accept an invitation to do so in 1974. For reasons unknown, he cancelled the visit at the last minute, and toured the People&#x27;s Republic of China and North Korea instead.

Relations cooled further in 1975, when the two countries found themselves on opposing sides in the Angolan Civil War. This had a dramatic effect on Zairian foreign policy for the next decade; bereft of his claim to African leadership (Mobutu was one of the few leaders who refused to recognize the Marxist government of Angola), Mobutu turned increasingly to the US and its allies, adopting pro-American stances on such issues as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Israel&#x27;s position in international organizations.

====Relations with the United States====

For the most part, Zaire enjoyed warm relations with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Relations did cool significantly in 1974–1975 over Mobutu&#x27;s increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy), and plummeted to an all-time low in the summer of 1975, when Mobutu accused the Central Intelligence Agency of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (&quot;in absentia&quot;) a former head of the Central Bank (Albert Ndele). However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu&#x27;s staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule. In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.

Because of Mobutu&#x27;s poor human rights record, the Carter Administration put some distance between itself and the Kinshasa government; even so, Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa. During the first Shaba invasion, the United States played a relatively inconsequential role; its belated intervention consisted of little more than the delivery of non-lethal supplies. But during the second Shaba invasion, the US played a much more active and decisive role by providing transportation and logistical support to the French and Belgian paratroopers that were deployed to aid Mobutu against the rebels. Carter echoed Mobutu&#x27;s (unsubstantiated) charges of Soviet and Cuban aid to the rebels, until it was apparent that no hard evidence existed to verify his claims. In 1980, the US House of Representatives voted to terminate military aid to Zaire, but the US Senate reinstated the funds, in response to pressure from Carter and American business interests in Zaire.

Mobutu enjoyed a very warm relationship with the Reagan Administration, through financial donations. During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Mobutu visited the White House three times, and criticism of Zaire&#x27;s human rights record by the US was effectively muted. During a state visit by Mobutu in 1983, Reagan praised the Zairian strongman as &quot;a voice of good sense and goodwill&quot;.

Mobutu also had a cordial relationship with Reagan&#x27;s successor, George H. W. Bush; he was the first African head of state to visit Bush at the White House. Even so, Mobutu&#x27;s relationship with the US radically changed shortly afterward with the end of the Cold War. With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: &quot;I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. The lesson is that my support for American policy counts for nothing.&quot; In 1993, Mobutu was denied a visa by the US State Department after he sought to visit Washington, D.C.

Mobutu also had friends in America outside Washington. Mobutu was befriended by televangelist Pat Robertson, who promised to try to get the State Department to lift its ban on the African leader.

==Coalition government==
In May 1990, due to the ending of the Cold War and a change in the international political climate, as well as economic problems and domestic unrest, Mobutu agreed to give up the MPR&#x27;s monopoly of power. In early May 1990, students studying at the Lubumbashi campus of the National University of Zaire protested against Mobutu&#x27;s regime, demanding his resignation. On the night of 11 May 1990, electricity was cut off to the campus while a special military unit called &quot;Les Hiboux&quot; (&quot;The Owls&quot;) were sent in, armed with machetes and bayonets. By the dawn of 12 May 1990, at least 290 students had been killed. The massacre led to the nations of the European Economic Community (now the European Union), the United States, and Canada to end all non-humanitarian aid to Zaire, which marked the beginning of the end of Western support for Mobutu.

Mobutu appointed a transitional government that would lead to promised elections but he retained substantial powers. Following the 1991 riots in Kinshasa by unpaid soldiers, Mobutu brought opposition figures into a coalition government, but still connived to retain control of the security services and important ministries. Factional divisions led to the creation of two governments in 1993, one pro- and one anti-Mobutu. The anti-Mobutu government was headed by Laurent Monsengwo and Étienne Tshisekedi of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS).

The economic situation was still dismal, and in 1994 the two groups merged into the High Council of Republic – Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT). Mobutu appointed Kengo Wa Dondo, an advocate of austerity and free-market reforms, as prime minister. During this period, Mobutu was becoming increasingly physically frail and during one of his trips to Europe for medical treatment, ethnic Tutsis captured much of eastern Zaire.

==Overthrow==
The seeds of Mobutu&#x27;s downfall were sown in the Rwandan genocide, when about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by about 200,000 Hutu extremists aided by the Rwandan government in 1994. The genocide ended when the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front seized the whole country, leading hundreds of thousands of Hutus including many of the genocidal killers, to flee into refugee camps in eastern Zaire. Mobutu welcomed the Hutu extremists as personal guests and allowed them to establish military and political bases in the eastern territories, from where they attacked and killed ethnic Tutsis across the border in Rwanda and in Zaire itself, ostensibly to prepare for a renewed offensive back into Rwanda. The new Rwandan government began sending military aid to the Zairian Tutsis in response. The resulting conflict began to destabilize eastern Zaire as a whole.

When Mobutu&#x27;s government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, the ethnic Tutsis in Zaire, known as Banyamulenge, were the focal point of a rebellion. From eastern Zaire, the rebels, aided by foreign government forces under the leadership of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him under Laurent-Désiré Kabila as they marched west toward Kinshasa. Burundi and Angola also supported the growing rebellion, which mushroomed into the First Congo War.

Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was in Switzerland for treatment, and he was unable to coordinate the resistance which crumbled in front of the march. The rebel forces would have completely overrun the country far sooner than it ultimately did if not for the country&#x27;s decrepit infrastructure. In most areas, no paved roads existed; the only vehicle paths were irregularly used dirt roads.

By mid-1997, Kabila&#x27;s forces resumed their advance, and the remains of Mobutu&#x27;s army offered almost no resistance. On 16 May 1997, following failed peace talks held in Pointe-Noire on board the South African Navy ship SAS &quot;Outeniqua&quot; with Kabila and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela (who chaired the talks), Mobutu fled into exile. Kabila&#x27;s forces, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL), proclaimed victory the next day. On 23 May 1997, Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

==Exile and death==
Mobutu went into temporary exile in Togo, until President Gnassingbé Eyadéma insisted that Mobutu leave the country a few days later. From 23 May 1997, he lived mostly in Rabat, Morocco. He died there on 7 September 1997 from prostate cancer at the age of 66. He is interred in an above ground mausoleum at Rabat, in the Christian cemetery known as Cimetière Européen.

In December 2007, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo recommended returning his remains, and interring them in a mausoleum in the DRC, which has not yet taken place. Mobutu remains interred in Morocco.

==Family==
Mobutu was married twice. He married his first wife, Marie-Antoinette Gbiatibwa Gogbe Yetene, in 1955. They had nine children. She died of heart failure on 22 October 1977 in Genolier, Switzerland, at the age of 36. On 1 May 1980, he married his mistress, Bobi Ladawa, on the eve of a visit by Pope John Paul II, thus legitimizing his relationship in the eyes of the Church. Two of his sons from his first marriage died during his lifetime, Nyiwa (d. 16 September 1994) and Konga (d. 1992). Three more died in the years following his death: Kongulu (d. 24 September 1998), Manda (d. 27 November 2004), and Ndokula (d. 4 November 2011). His elder son from his second marriage, Nzanga Mobutu, now the head of the family, finished fourth in the 2006 presidential elections and later served in the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister. Another son of his, Giala, has also served in the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo as both a member of the National Assembly and the Senate. A daughter, Yakpwa (nicknamed Yaki), was briefly married to a Belgian, Pierre Janssen, who later wrote a book that described Mobutu&#x27;s lifestyle in vivid detail.

Altogether, Mobutu had sixteen children:

* With Marie-Antoinette (first wife): Nyiwa, Ngombo, Manda, Konga, Ngawali, Yango, Yakpwa, Kongulu, Ndagbia (9)
* With Bobi Ladawa (second wife): Nzanga, Giala, Toku, Ndokula (4) 
* With Kosia Ngama (mistress and twin sister of his second wife): Yalitho, Tende, Ayessa (3)

On trips across Zaire he appropriated the &quot;droit de cuissage&quot; (right to deflower) as local chiefs offered him virgins; this practice was considered an honor for the virgin&#x27;s family.

==In art and literature==
Mobutu was the subject of the three-part 1999 Belgian documentary &quot;Mobutu, King of Zaire&quot; by Thierry Michel. Mobutu was also featured in the 2000 feature film &quot;Lumumba&quot;, directed by Raoul Peck, which detailed the pre-coup and coup years from the perspective of Lumumba. Mobutu also featured in the 1996 American documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, which centred on the famed Rumble in the Jungle boxing bout between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali for the 1974 heavyweight championship of the world which took place in Kinshasa during Mobutu&#x27;s rule. In the 1978 war adventure film &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, the villain, General Ndofa, described in the film as an extremely corrupt leader of a copper-rich nation in central Africa, was a thinly disguised version of Mobutu.

Mobutu also might be considered as the inspiration behind some of the characters in the works of the poetry of Wole Soyinka, the novel &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; by V. S. Naipaul, and &quot;Anthills of the Savannah&quot; by Chinua Achebe. William Close, father of actress Glenn Close, was once a personal physician to Mobutu and wrote a book focusing on his service in Zaire. Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s 1998 historical novel &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; depicts the events of the Congo Crisis from a fictional standpoint, featuring the role of Mobutu in the crisis. Mobutu was played by the Belgian actor Marc Zinga in the 2011 film &quot;Mister Bob&quot;. The French critic Isabelle Hanne praised Zinga&#x27;s performance as Mobutu, writing he &quot;brilliantly embodies this Shakespearian and bloodthirsty figure.&quot; Mobutu was included as an additional promotional card in the card-driven strategy game &quot;Twilight Struggle&quot;. His card, when played, increases the stability of the country then known as Zaire and increases the influence of the United States over the African nation.

==Legacy==
According to Mobutu&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary: &quot;He built his political longevity on three pillars: violence, cunning, and the use of state funds to buy off enemies. His systematic looting of the national treasury and major industries gave birth to the term &#x27;kleptocracy&#x27; to describe a rule of official corruption that reputedly made him one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest heads of state.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described him as the &quot;archetypal African dictator&quot;.

Mobutu was infamous for amassing the equivalent of millions of US dollars from his country. According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$50–125 million from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$150 million. According to Pierre Janssen, the ex-husband of Mobutu&#x27;s daughter Yaki, Mobutu had no concern for the cost of the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake, and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3 million worth of jewels. Janssen wrote a book describing Mobutu&#x27;s daily routine, which included several daily bottles of wine, retainers flown in from overseas, and lavish meals.

According to Washington Post, Mobutu amassed between US$50-125 million from his country, ranking him as the third-most corrupt leader since 1984 and the most corrupt African leader during the same period. Philip Gourevitch, in &quot;We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families&quot; (1998), wrote:

Mobutu was instrumental in bringing the Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman to Zaire on 30 October 1974. According to the documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, promoter Don King promised each fighter five million dollars (U.S.) for the fight. To this end, King offered the bout to any African country that put up the money to host it, in exchange for recognition. Mobutu was willing to fund the ten million dollar purse and host the bout, in order to gain international recognition and legitimacy in the process. Mobutu gained Zaire and its people considerable publicity in the weeks even before the televised bout, as worldwide attention focused on his country. According to a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: &quot;Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars cost a lot more than ten million (dollars).&quot; On 22 September 1974, Mobutu presented the rebuilt 20 May Stadium, a multi-million-dollar sports project constructed to host the Ali-Foreman boxing card, to the Zaire Ministry of Youth and Sport, and to the people of Zaire.

<doc id="64243" wikidata="Q662893" url="?curid=64243" title="Aquatic ape hypothesis">
<text>The aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH), also referred to as aquatic ape theory (AAT) or the waterside hypothesis of human evolution, postulates that the ancestors of modern humans took a divergent evolutionary pathway from the other great apes by becoming adapted to a more aquatic habitat. While the hypothesis has some popularity with the lay public, it is generally ignored or classified as pseudoscience by anthropologists.

The theory developed before major discoveries of ancient hominin fossils in East Africa. The hypothesis was initially proposed by the English marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the coast and seabed, leading to adaptations that explained distinctive characteristics of modern humans such as functional hairlessness and bipedalism. The popular science writer Elaine Morgan supported this hypothesis in her 1972 book &quot;The Descent of Woman&quot;. In it, she contrasted the theory with zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris&#x27;s theories of sexuality, which she believed to be rooted in sexism. 

Anthropologists do not take the hypothesis seriously: John Langdon characterized it as an &quot;umbrella hypothesis&quot; (a hypothesis that tries to explain many separate traits of humans as a result of a single adaptive pressure) that was not consistent with the fossil record, and said that its claim that it was simpler and therefore more likely to be true than traditional explanations of human evolution was not true. According to anthropologist John Hawkes, the AAH is not consistent with the fossil record. Traits that the hypothesis tries to explain evolved at vastly different times, and distributions of soft tissue the hypothesis alleges are unique to humans are common among other primates.

==History==

In 1942 the German pathologist Max Westenhöfer (1871–1957) discussed various human characteristics (hairlessness, subcutaneous fat, the regression of the olfactory organ, webbed fingers, direction of the body hair etc.) that could have derived from an aquatic past, quoting several other authors who had made similar speculations. As he did not believe human beings were apes, he believed this might have been during the Cretaceous, contrary to what is possible given the geologic and evolutionary biology evidence available at the time. He stated: &quot;The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence.&quot; He later abandoned the concept.

Independently of Westenhöfer&#x27;s writings, the marine biologist Alister Hardy had since 1930 also hypothesized that humans may have had ancestors more aquatic than previously imagined, although his work, unlike Westenhöfer&#x27;s, was rooted in the Darwinian consensus. On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years. After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the British Sub-Aqua Club in Brighton on 5 March 1960. Several national newspapers reported sensational presentations of Hardy&#x27;s ideas, which he countered by explaining them more fully in an article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; on 17 March 1960: &quot;My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shellfish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast.&quot;

The idea was generally ignored by the scientific community after the article was published. Some interest was received, notably from the geographer Carl Sauer whose views on the role of the seashore in human evolution &quot;stimulated tremendous progress in the study of coastal and aquatic adaptations&quot; inside marine archaeology. In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in &quot;The Naked Ape&quot;, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy&#x27;s phrase &quot;more aquatic ape-like ancestors&quot; to the bare &quot;aquatic ape&quot;, commenting that &quot;despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support&quot;.

While traditional descriptions of &#x27;savage&#x27; existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing, and hunting, in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on hunting and gathering as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory, and hunting was the focus of the screenwriter Robert Ardrey&#x27;s 1961 best-seller &quot;African Genesis&quot;. Another screenwriter, Elaine Morgan, responded to this focus in her 1972 &quot;Descent of Woman&quot;, which parodied the conventional picture of &quot;the Tarzanlike figure of the prehominid who came down from the trees, saw a grassland teeming with game, picked up a weapon and became a Mighty Hunter,&quot; and pictured a more peaceful scene of humans by the seashore. She took her lead from a section in Morris&#x27;s 1967 book which referred to the possibility of an &quot;Aquatic Ape&quot; period in evolution, his name for the speculation by the biologist Alister Hardy in 1960. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–&quot;The Aquatic Ape&quot; (1982), &quot;The Scars of Evolution&quot; (1990), &quot;The Descent of the Child&quot; (1994), &quot;The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Naked Darwinist&quot; (2008)–which explored the issues in more detail. Books published on the topic since then have avoided the contentious term &quot;aquatic&quot; and used &quot;waterside&quot; instead.

==The Hardy/Morgan hypothesis==
Hardy&#x27;s hypothesis as outlined in &quot;New Scientist&quot; was:

Hardy argued a number of features of modern humans are characteristic of aquatic adaptations. He pointed to humans&#x27; lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in whales and hippopotamuses, and noted the layer of subcutaneous fat humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans. Additional features cited by Hardy include the location of the trachea in the throat rather than the nasal cavity, the human propensity for front-facing copulation, tears and eccrine sweating, though these claimed pieces of evidence have alternative evolutionary adaptationist explanations that do not invoke an aquatic context. 

The diving reflex is sometimes cited as evidence. This is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals, such as seals, otters and dolphins. It also exists as a lesser response in other animals, including human babies up to 6 months old (see infant swimming). However adult humans generally exhibit a mild response.

Hardy additionally posited that bipedalism evolved first as an aid to before becoming the usual means of human locomotion, and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open shellfish. These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their research programs.

Morgan summed up her take on the hypothesis in 2011:

==Reactions==

The AAH is generally ignored by anthropologists, although it has a following outside academia and conferences on the topic have received celebrity endorsement, for example from David Attenborough. Despite being debunked, it returns periodically, being promoted as recently as 2019.

Academics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic anthropology) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis. Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at Valkenburg, Netherlands, in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the hypothesis and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of the University of Oxford. His summary at the end was:

===Critiques===
The AAH is considered to be a classic example of pseudoscience among the scholarly community, and has been met with significant skepticism. The &quot;Nature&quot; editor and paleontologist Henry Gee has argued that the hypothesis has equivalent merit to creationism, and should be similarly dismissed.

In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an &quot;umbrella hypothesis&quot; and argued that the difficulty of ever disproving such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a parsimonious explanation, it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the null hypothesis that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the &quot;umbrella&quot; nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis. Langdon also objected to Morgan&#x27;s blanket opposition to the &quot;savannah hypothesis&quot; which he took to be the &quot;collective discipline of paleoanthropology&quot;. He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal. In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in soft tissue anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils. After a brief description of the issues under 26 different headings, he produced a summary critique of these with mainly negative judgments. His main conclusion was that the AAH was unlikely ever to be disproved on the basis of comparative anatomy, and that the one body of data that could potentially disprove it was the fossil record.

In a blog post originally published in 2005 and continually updated since, anthropologist John D. Hawks said that anthropologists don&#x27;t accept the AAH for several reasons. Hardy and Morgan situated the alleged aquatic period of human nature in a period of the fossil record that is now known not to contain any aquatic ancestors. The traits the AAH tries to explain actually evolved at wildly different time periods. The AAH claims that the alleged aquatic nature of humanity is responsible for human patterns of hair, fat, and sweat, but actually all of these things are similar in humans to other primates. To the extent they are exceptional in any primate relative to other primates, or in primates relative to other mammals, they are exceptional for well-understood thermodynamic reasons.

Palaeontologist Riley Black concurred with the pseudoscience label, and described the AAH as a &quot;classic case of picking evidence that fits a preconceived conclusion and ignoring everything else&quot;. Physical anthropologist Eugenie Scott has described the aquatic ape hypothesis as an instance of &quot;crank anthropology&quot; akin to other pseudoscientific ideas in anthropology such as alien-human interbreeding and Bigfoot.

In &quot;The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution&quot; (2013), Henry Gee remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain. He nevertheless criticized the AAH because &quot;it&#x27;s always a problem identifying features [such as body fat and hairlessness] that humans have now and inferring that they must have had some adaptive value in the past.&quot; Also &quot;it&#x27;s notoriously hard to infer habits [such as swimming] from anatomical structures&quot;.

Popular support for the AAH has become an embarrassment to some anthropologists, who want to explore the effects of water on human evolution without engaging with the AAH, which they consider &quot;emphasizes adaptations to deep water (or at least underwater) conditions&quot;. Foley and Lahr suggest that &quot;to flirt with anything watery in paleoanthropology can be misinterpreted&quot;, but argue &quot;there is little doubt that throughout our evolution we have made extensive use of terrestrial habitats adjacent to fresh water, since we are, like many other terrestrial mammals, a heavily water-dependent species.&quot; But they allege that &quot;under pressure from the mainstream, AAH supporters tended to flee from the core arguments of Hardy and Morgan towards a more generalized emphasis on fishy things.&quot;

In &quot;The Waterside Ape&quot;, a pair of 2016 BBC Radio documentaries, David Attenborough discussed what he thought was a &quot;move towards mainstream acceptance&quot; for the AAH in the light of new research findings. He interviewed scientists supportive of the idea, including Kathlyn Stewart and Michael Crawford who had published papers in a special issue of the &quot;Journal of Human Evolution&quot; on &quot;The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior&quot;. Responding to the documentaries in a newspaper article, paleoanthropologist Alice Roberts criticized Attenborough&#x27;s promotion of AAH and dismissed the idea as a distraction &quot;from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex&quot;. She argued that AAH had become &quot;a theory of everything&quot; that is simultaneously &quot;too extravagant and too simple&quot;.

Philosopher Daniel Dennett, in his discussion of evolutionary philosophy, commented &quot;During the last few years, when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleoanthropologists and other experts, I have often asked them to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic theory. I haven&#x27;t yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have also wondered the same thing.&quot; He challenged both Elaine Morgan and the scientific establishment in that &quot;Both sides are indulging in adapt[at]ionist Just So stories&quot;. Along the same lines, historian Erika Lorraine Milam noted that independent of Morgan&#x27;s work, certain standard explanations of human development in paleoanthropology have been roundly criticized for lacking evidence, while being based on sexist assumptions. Anatomy lecturer Bruce Charlton gave Morgan&#x27;s book &quot;Scars of Evolution&quot; an enthusiastic review in the British Medical Journal in 1991, calling it &quot;exceptionally well written&quot; and &quot;a good piece of science&quot;.

In 1995, paleoanthropologist Phillip Tobias declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity&#x27;s precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenburg conference were no longer valid. Tobias praised Morgan&#x27;s book &quot;Scars of Evolution&quot; as a &quot;remarkable book&quot;, though he said that he did not agree with all of it. Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man&#x27;s precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of Lamarck, and followed by Darwin, Wallace and Haeckel, well before Raymond Dart used it.

=== Reactions of Hardy and Morgan ===
Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines &quot;Oxford professor says man a sea ape&quot;, causing problems with his Oxford colleagues. As he later said to his ex-pupil Desmond Morris, &quot;Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn&#x27;t a proven fact. And of course we&#x27;re not related to dolphins.&quot;

Elaine Morgan&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Descent of Woman&quot; became an international best-seller, a Book of the Month selection in the United States and was translated into ten languages. The book was praised for its feminism but paleoanthropologists were disappointed with its promotions of the AAH. Morgan removed the feminist critique and left her AAH ideas intact, publishing the book as &quot;The Aquatic Ape&quot; 10 years later, but it did not garner any more positive reaction from scientists.

==Related academic and independent research==

===Wading and bipedalism===
AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking orthograde posture with using fully upright posture. Although it is harder to walk upright with bent knees on land, this difference gradually diminishes as the depth of water increases and is still practical in thigh-high water.

In a critique of the AAH, Henry Gee questioned any link between bipedalism and diet. Gee writes that early humans have been bipedal for 5 million years, but our ancestors&#x27; &quot;fondness for seafood&quot; emerged a mere 200,000 years ago.

===Diet===

Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in &quot;Homo&quot; as early as the Pliocene, but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial. Further, there is no evidence that humans ate fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Supporters argue that the avoidance of taphonomic bias is the problem, as most hominin fossils occur in lake-side environments, and the presence of fish remains is therefore not proof of fish consumption. They also claim that the archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally deficient due to postglacial sea level rise.

In their 1989 book &quot;The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future&quot;, Michael Crawford and David Marsh claimed that omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain:
 Crawford and Marsh opined that the brain size in aquatic mammals is similar to humans, and that other primates and carnivores lost relative brain capacity. Cunnane, Stewart, Crawford, and colleagues published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their &quot;shore-based diet scenario&quot;, acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan&#x27;s thesis as a foundation work of their model. As evidence, they describe health problems in landlocked communities, such as cretinism in the Alps and goitre in parts of Africa due to salt-derived iodine deficiency, and state that inland habitats cannot naturally meet human iodide requirements.

Biologists Caroline Pond and Dick Colby were highly critical, saying that the work provided &quot;no significant new information that would be of interest to biologists&quot; and that its style was &quot;speculative, theoretical and in many places so imprecise as to be misleading.&quot; British palaeontologist Henry Gee, who remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain, nevertheless criticized AAH because inferring aquatic behavior from body fat and hairlessness patterns is an unjustifiable leap.

===Diving behavior and performance===
Professor of animal physiology and experienced scuba and freediver Erika Schagatay researches human diving abilities and oxygen stress. She suggests that such abilities are consistent with selective pressure for underwater foraging during human evolution, and discussed other anatomical traits speculated as diving adaptations by Hardy/Morgan. John Langdon suggested that such traits could be enabled by a human developmental plasticity.

===Childbirth===
&quot;Vernix caseosa&quot;, the thin skin found on newborn babies, is also found on seals, beavers, and otters, but not on other primates. Furthermore, human placentophagy seems to have disappeared at a very early point in the human species, as it was practiced by no known culture; placentophagy is common in primates, but not among seals or dolphins. Notably, placentophagy is also not seen in camels, which like aquatic mammals commonly consume salty substances.

<doc id="64246" wikidata="Q943837" url="?curid=64246" title="R'lyeh">
<text>R&#x27;lyeh is a fictional lost city that was first mentioned in the H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, first published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in February 1928. R&#x27;lyeh is a sunken city in the South Pacific and the prison of the entity called Cthulhu.

==Description==

Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the narrator of one of the tales in the short story, describes the accidental discovery of the city: &quot;a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth&#x27;s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R&#x27;lyeh...loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours&quot;. The short story also asserts the premise that while currently trapped in R&#x27;lyeh, Cthulhu will eventually return, with worshipers often repeating the phrase &quot;Ph&#x27;nglui mglw&#x27;nafh Cthulhu R&#x27;lyeh wgah&#x27;nagl fhtagn&quot;: &quot;In his house at R&#x27;lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming&quot;.

Lovecraft claims R&#x27;lyeh is located at in the southern Pacific Ocean. Writer August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent of Lovecraft, placed R&#x27;lyeh at about . The latter coordinates place the city approximately from the actual island of Pohnpei (Ponape), the location of the fictional &quot;Ponape Scripture&quot;. Both locations are close to the Pacific pole of inaccessibility (), the point in the ocean farthest from any land mass.

== Significance and criticism ==
R&#x27;lyeh is characterized by bizarre architecture likened to non-Euclidean geometry that hampers exploration and escape. At one point, a crew member &quot;climbed interminably along the grotesque stone mouldingthat is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontaland the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast&quot; and at another, a sailor &quot;was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn&#x27;t have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse&quot;. Mathematician Benjamin K.Tippett demonstrates that these observations are consistent with &quot;exploring a bubble of curved spacetime&quot;. Non-Euclidean geometry and Einstein&#x27;s theories feature in several of Lovecraft&#x27;s stories as Weird elements. Critics Paul Halpern and Michael C. Labossiere note that Rather than having science expand its boundaries to include genuine supernatural phenomena through brand new theories, the alleged supernatural phenomena are instead accounted for in scientific terms through existing models of nature. Thus, science is not so much embracing the supernatural as reducing it to a manifestation of the natural. Lovecraft&#x27;s fascinating approach to science and the supernatural is further illustrated by the fact that he reverses the usual technique for ghostly fright. Rather than breaking the laws of science with supernatural means and thus generating fear, he creates a feeling of horror by showing that the common sense views of physics and nature (that is, the old Newtonian views) are the comforting fantasy. In contrast, the counterintuitive &quot;new physics&quot;, the true scientific reality, provides the source of horror.

==Other interpretations==

In Alan Moore&#x27;s Lovecraft-derived comic book mini-series &quot;Neonomicon&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; it is implied, in a fashion suiting a non-Euclidean entity such as Cthulhu, that R&#x27;lyeh and subsequently Cthulhu himself do not yet exist in a physical sense. R&#x27;lyeh and Cthulhu&#x27;s &quot;dead dreaming&quot; are instead a metaphor for the fetal development of Cthulhu in the womb of a female human detective-turned-cultist, impregnated by a male Deep One while held prisoner by his followers. Similarly to the Antichrist, it is stated that Cthulhu&#x27;s inevitable &quot;return&quot; to destroy civilization and liberate mankind from rule of law will begin with his physical birth.

<doc id="64248" wikidata="Q12038" url="?curid=64248" title="Cthulhu">
<text>Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft. It was introduced in his short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, published by the American pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous pop culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in the shape of a green octopus, dragon, and a caricature of human form. It is the namesake of the Lovecraft-inspired Cthulhu Mythos.

==Etymology, spelling, and pronunciation==
Invented by Lovecraft in 1928, the name Cthulhu was probably chosen to echo the word &quot;chthonic&quot; (Ancient Greek &quot;of the earth&quot;), as apparently suggested by Lovecraft himself at the end of his 1923 tale &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;. The chthonic, or earth-dwelling, spirit has precedents in numerous ancient and medieval mythologies, often guarding mines and precious underground treasures, notably in the Germanic dwarfs and the Greek Chalybes, Telchines, or Dactyls.

Lovecraft transcribed the pronunciation of &quot;Cthulhu&quot; as &quot;Khlûl′-hloo&quot;, and said, &quot;the first syllable pronounced gutturally and very thickly. The &#x27;u&#x27; is about like that in &#x27;full&#x27;, and the first syllable is not unlike &#x27;klul&#x27; in sound, hence the &#x27;h&#x27; represents the guttural thickness&quot; yielding something akin to . S. T. Joshi points out, however, that Lovecraft gave different pronunciations on different occasions. According to Lovecraft, this is merely the closest that the human vocal apparatus can come to reproducing the syllables of an alien language. Cthulhu has also been spelled in many other ways, including Tulu, Katulu, and Kutulu.

Long after Lovecraft&#x27;s death, Chaosium stated in the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; role-playing game: &quot;we say it kuh-THOOL-hu&quot; (), even while noting that Lovecraft said it differently. Others use the pronunciation .

==Description==
In &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, H. P. Lovecraft describes a statue of Cthulhu as: &quot;A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.&quot; A carving of Cthulhu is described thusly: &quot;It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings.&quot; 

Johansen in The Call of Cthulhu states that &quot;The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled.&quot; Cthulhu is described again shortly thereafter as a &quot;mountainous monstrosity&quot;. His age is described to be at least &quot;vigintillions of years&quot;. He is also said to have cast spells which preserved the Great Old Ones until their reawakening.

Cthulhu is said to resemble a green octopus, dragon, and a human caricature, hundreds of meters tall, with webbed, human-looking arms and legs and a pair of rudimentary wings on its back. Its head is depicted as similar to the entirety of a gigantic octopus, with an unknown number of tentacles surrounding its supposed mouth.

==Publication history==
The short story that first mentions Cthulhu, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, was published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1928, and established the character as a malevolent entity, hibernating within R&#x27;lyeh, an underwater city in the South Pacific. The imprisoned Cthulhu is apparently the source of constant subconscious anxiety for all mankind, and is also the object of worship, both by many human cults (including some within New Zealand, Greenland, Louisiana, and the Chinese mountains) and by other Lovecraftian monsters (called Deep Ones and Mi-Go). The short story asserts the premise that, while currently trapped, Cthulhu will eventually return. His worshippers chant &quot;&quot;Ph&#x27;nglui mglw&#x27;nafh Cthulhu R&#x27;lyeh wgah&#x27;nagl fhtagn&quot; (&quot;In his house at &quot;R&#x27;lyeh&quot;, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming&quot;).

Lovecraft conceived a detailed genealogy for Cthulhu (published as &quot;Letter 617&quot; in &quot;Selected Letters&quot;) and made the character a central reference in his works. The short story &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1928) refers to Cthulhu, while &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1930) hints that one of his characters knows the creature&#x27;s origins (&quot;I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth.&quot;) The 1931 novella &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; refers to the &quot;star-spawn of Cthulhu&quot;, who warred with another race called the Elder Things before the dawn of man.

August Derleth, a correspondent of Lovecraft&#x27;s, used the creature&#x27;s name to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors, the Cthulhu Mythos. In 1937, Derleth wrote the short story &quot;The Return of Hastur&quot;, and proposed two groups of opposed cosmic entities:

According to Derleth&#x27;s scheme, &quot;Great Cthulhu is one of the Water Elementals&quot; and was engaged in an age-old arch-rivalry with a designated air elemental, Hastur the Unspeakable, described as Cthulhu&#x27;s &quot;half-brother.&quot; Based on this framework, Derleth wrote a series of short stories published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (1944–1952) and collected as &quot;The Trail of Cthulhu&quot;, depicting the struggle of a Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and his associates against Cthulhu and his minions. In addition, Cthulhu is referenced in Derleth&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; published by Arkham House. The novel can also be found in &quot;The Watchers Out of Time and Others&quot;, a collection of stories from Derleth&#x27;s interpretations of Lovecraftian Mythos published by Arkham House in 1974.

Derleth&#x27;s interpretations have been criticized by Lovecraft enthusiast Michel Houellebecq, among others. Houellebecq&#x27;s &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life&quot; (2005) decries Derleth for attempting to reshape Lovecraft&#x27;s strictly amoral continuity into a stereotypical conflict between forces of objective good and evil.

In John Glasby&#x27;s &quot;A Shadow from the Aeons&quot;, Cthulhu is seen by the narrator roaming the riverbank near Dominic Waldron&#x27;s castle, and roaring.

The character&#x27;s influence also extended into gaming literature; games company TSR included an entire chapter on the Cthulhu mythos (including character statistics) in the first printing of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; sourcebook &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (1980). TSR, however, were unaware that Arkham House, which asserted copyright on almost all Lovecraft literature, had already licensed the Cthulhu property to game company Chaosium. Although Chaosium stipulated that TSR could continue to use the material if each future edition featured a published credit to Chaosium, TSR refused and the material was removed from all subsequent editions.

==Influence==
===Politics===
Cthulhu has appeared as a parody candidate in several elections, including the 2010 Polish presidential election and the 2012 and 2016 US presidential elections. The faux campaigns usually satirize voters who claim to vote for the &quot;lesser evil&quot;. &quot;Cthulhu for America&quot; ran during the 2016 American presidential election, drawing comparisons with other satirical presidential candidates such as Vermin Supreme. The organization had a platform that included the legalization of human sacrifice, driving all Americans insane, and an end to peace.

In 2016, the troll account known as &quot;The Dark Lord Cthulhu&quot; submitted an official application to be on the Massachusetts Presidential Ballot. The account also raised over $4000 from fans to fund the campaign through a gofundme.com page. Gofundme removed the campaign page and refunded contributions.

===Science===
Several organisms have been named after Cthulhu, including the California spider &quot;Pimoa cthulhu&quot;, the New Guinea moth &quot;Speiredonia cthulhui&quot;, and &quot;Sollasina cthulhu&quot;, a fossil echinoderm. Two microorganisms that assist in the digestion of wood by termites have been named after Cthulhu and Cthulhu&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot; Cthylla: &quot;Cthulhu macrofasciculumque&quot; and &quot;Cthylla microfasciculumque&quot;.

In 2014, science and technology scholar Donna Haraway gave a talk entitled &quot;Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene: Staying with the Trouble&quot;, in which she proposed the term &quot;Chthulucene&quot; as an alternative for the concept of the Anthropocene era, due to the entangling interconnectedness of all supposedly individual beings. Haraway has denied any indebtedness to Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu, claiming that her &quot;chthulu&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;khthonios&quot;, &quot;of the earth&quot;. However, the Lovecraft character is much closer to her coined term than the Greek root, and her description of its meaning coincides with Lovecraft&#x27;s idea of the apocalyptic, multitentacled threat of Cthulhu to collapse civilization into an endless dark horror: &quot;Chthulucene does not close in on itself; it does not round off; its contact zones are ubiquitous and continuously spin out loopy tendrils.&quot;

In 2015, an elongated, dark region along the equator of Pluto, initially referred to as &quot;the Whale&quot;, was proposed to be named &quot;Cthulhu Region&quot;, by the NASA team responsible for the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission. It was given the informal name Cthulhu Macula, though the feature was later officially named Belton Regio by the International Astronomical Union.

<doc id="64252" wikidata="Q27436" url="?curid=64252" title="Cadillac">
<text>Cadillac Motor Car Division, or simply Cadillac (), is a division of the American automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM) that designs and builds luxury vehicles. Its major markets are the United States, Canada and China. Cadillac models are distributed in 34 additional markets worldwide. Historically, Cadillac automobiles were at the top of the luxury field within the United States, but have been outsold by European luxury brands including BMW and Mercedes since the 2000s. In 2019, Cadillac sold 390,458 vehicles worldwide, a record for the brand.

Cadillac, founded in 1902, is among the first automotive brands in the world, fourth in the United States only to Autocar Company (1897) and fellow GM marques Oldsmobile (1897) and Buick (1899). It was named after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (1658–1730), who founded Detroit, Michigan. The Cadillac crest is based on his coat of arms.

By the time General Motors purchased the company in 1909, Cadillac had already established itself as one of America&#x27;s premier luxury car makers. The complete interchangeability of its precision parts had allowed it to lay the foundation for the modern mass production of automobiles. It was at the forefront of technological advances, introducing full electrical systems, the clashless manual transmission and the steel roof. The brand developed three engines, with its V8 setting the standard for the American automotive industry.

Cadillac had the first U.S. car to win the Royal Automobile Club of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Dewar Trophy by successfully demonstrating the interchangeability of its component parts during a reliability test in 1908; this spawned the firm&#x27;s slogan &quot;Standard of the World&quot;. It won the trophy again in 1912 for incorporating electric starting and lighting in a production automobile.

==History==
===Founding===
Cadillac was formed from the remnants of the Henry Ford Company. After a dispute between Henry Ford and his investors, Ford left the company along with several of his key partners in March 1902. Ford&#x27;s financial backers William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen called in engineer Henry M. Leland of Leland &amp; Faulconer Manufacturing Company to appraise the plant and equipment in preparation for liquidating the company&#x27;s assets. Instead, Leland persuaded the pair to continue manufacturing automobiles using Leland&#x27;s proven single-cylinder engine. A new company called the Cadillac Automobile Company was established on August 22, 1902, converting the Henry Ford Company factory at Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It was named after French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, who had founded Detroit in 1701.

===First automobiles===

Cadillac&#x27;s first automobiles, the Runabout and Tonneau, were completed in October 1902. They were two-seat horseless carriages powered by a single-cylinder engine. They were practically identical to the 1903 Ford Model A. Many sources say the first car rolled out of the factory on October 17; in the book &quot;Henry Leland—Master of Precision&quot;, the date is October 20; another reliable source shows car number three to have been built on October 16. Cadillac displayed the new vehicles at the New York Auto Show in January 1903, where the vehicles impressed the crowds enough to gather over 2,000 firm orders. Cadillac&#x27;s biggest selling point was precision manufacturing, and therefore, reliability; a Cadillac was simply a better-made vehicle than its competitors.

===Notable events: 1906–1912===

The Cadillac Automobile Company merged with Leland &amp; Faulconer Manufacturing, forming The Cadillac Motor Company in 1905. From its earliest years, Cadillac aimed for precision engineering and stylish luxury finishes, causing its cars to be ranked amongst the finest in the United States. Cadillac was the first volume manufacturer of a fully enclosed car, in 1906. Cadillac participated in the 1908 interchangeability test in the United Kingdom, and was awarded the Dewar Trophy for the most important advancement of the year in the automobile industry.

On July 29, 1909, Cadillac was purchased by the General Motors (GM) conglomerate. Cadillac became General Motors&#x27; prestige division, devoted to the production of large luxury vehicles. The Cadillac line was also GM&#x27;s default marque for &quot;commercial chassis&quot; institutional vehicles, such as limousines, ambulances, hearses and funeral home flower cars, the last three of which were custom-built by aftermarket manufacturers. It became positioned at the top of GM&#x27;s vehicle hierarchy, above Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and later, Chevrolet.

In 1912, Cadillac was the first automobile manufacturer to incorporate an electrical system enabling starting, ignition, and lighting.

===Becoming the &quot;Standard of the World&quot; and the Great Depression: 1915–1941===
In 1915, Cadillac introduced a 90-degree flathead V8 engine with at 2400 rpm and of torque, allowing its cars to attain . This was faster than most roads could accommodate at this time. Cadillac pioneered the dual-plane V8 crankshaft in 1918. In 1928 Cadillac introduced the first clashless Synchro-Mesh manual transmission, utilizing constant mesh gears. In 1930 Cadillac implemented the first V-16 engine, with a 45-degree overhead valve, , and , one of the most powerful and quietest engines in the United States. The development and introduction of the V8, V16 and V12 helped to make Cadillac the &quot;Standard of the World&quot;. A later model of the V8 engine, with overhead valves, set the standard for the entire American automotive industry in 1949.

In July 1917, the United States Army needed a dependable staff car and chose the Cadillac Type 55 Touring Model after exhaustive tests on the Mexican border. 2,350 of the cars were supplied for use in France by officers of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I.

General Motors of Canada had built Cadillacs from 1923 until 1936 and LaSalles from 1927 until 1935.

Pre-World War II Cadillacs were well-built, powerful, mass-produced luxury cars aimed at an upper-class market. In the 1930s, Cadillac added cars with V12 and V16 engines to their range, many of which were fitted with custom coach-built bodies.

In the 1920s and 1930s Cadillac and Buick vehicles were popular with longer-distance passenger service operators e.g. the Nairn Transport Company in the Middle East (Baghdad-Damascus) and Newmans Coach Lines in New Zealand.

In 1926, Cadillac recruited automobile stylist Harley Earl in a one-time consulting capacity, but his employment lasted considerably longer: by 1928, Earl was the head of the new Art and Color division and he would ultimately work for GM until he retired, over 30 years later. The first car he designed was the LaSalle, a new, smaller &quot;companion marque&quot; car, named after another French explorer and founder of Detroit, René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. That marque remained in production until 1940.

Cadillac introduced designer-styled bodywork (as opposed to auto-engineered) in 1927. It installed shatter-resistant glass in 1926. Cadillac also introduced the &quot;turret top&quot;, the first all-steel roof on a passenger car. Previously, car roofs had been made out of fabric-covered wood.

The Great Depression sapped the auto industry generally, with the luxury market declining more steeply; between 1928 and 1933, Cadillac sales declined by 84% to 6,736 vehicles. Exacerbating sales performance for the Cadillac brand was a policy, reflective of the times, which discouraged sales to African Americans. Nick Dreystadt, mechanic and national head of Cadillac service, urged a committee—set up to decide whether the Cadillac brand would live on—to revoke that policy. After the policy was eliminated, brand sales increased by 70% in 1934, and Dreystadt was promoted to lead the entire Cadillac Division.

By 1940, Cadillac sales had risen tenfold compared to 1934. In 1936, Dreystadt released the Series 60 as Cadillac&#x27;s entry into the mid-priced vehicle market. It was replaced by the Series 61 in 1939, but a popular model that was derived from it, the Sixty Special, continued through 1993. Another factor helped boost Cadillac growth over the next few years: a revolution in assembly-line technology. In 1934, Henry F. Phillips introduced the Phillips screw and screwdriver to the market. He entered into talks with General Motors and convinced the Cadillac group his new screws would speed assembly times and therefore increase profits. Cadillac was the first automaker to use the Phillips technology, in 1937, which was widely adopted in 1940. For the first time in many years all cars built by the company shared the same basic engine and drivetrain in 1941.

1941 also saw the introduction of optional Hydra-Matic, the first mass-produced fully automatic transmission, offered the previous year on the Oldsmobile.

===After World War II and the Great Depression: 1945–1959===
Postwar Cadillac vehicles innovated many of the styling features that came to be synonymous with the late 1940s and 1950s American automobile. Incorporating many of the ideas of then General Motors styling chief Harley J. Earl, these included tailfins, wraparound windshields, and extensive use of chrome. Tailfins were first added in 1948 and reached their pinnacle in 1959. From 1960 to 1964 they decreased each year until they disappeared in the 1965 model year (remaining vestigially only on the limited production 1965 Series 75 chassis, a carry-over from 1964). Cadillac&#x27;s other distinctive styling attribute was its front-bumper. What had started out after the war as a pair of artillery shell-shaped bumper guards moved higher on the front-end design as the 1950s wore on. Becoming known as Dagmar bumpers for their similarity to the buxom 1950s television personality, they were toned down in 1958 and gone the next year.

1956 saw the introduction of the pillarless four-door hardtop sedan, marketed as the &quot;Sedan de Ville&quot;; a year later the feature appeared in all standard Cadillacs. The fledgling automotive magazine &quot;Motor Trend&quot; awarded its first &quot;&quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year&quot; to Cadillac in 1949 for its innovative overhead valve V8 engine. While the company initially snubbed the honor, it now proudly references its &quot;Car of the Year&quot; wins in publicity material. On November 25, 1949, Cadillac produced its one-millionth car, a 1950 Coupe de Ville. It also set a new sales mark of 100,000 cars, matched in 1950 and 1951. 1949 also saw the introduction with Buick of the first mass-produced hardtop coupe, a closed-body style without a &quot;B&quot; pillar. Marketed as the Coupe de Ville, it would become one of Cadillac&#x27;s most popular models for many years.

In 1951, Cadillac began production of the M41 Walker Bulldog army tank, which saw service in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

In 1953, the &quot;Autronic Eye&quot; was introduced. This feature would automatically dim high-beam headlamps for the safety of oncoming motorists. In 1957, Cadillac attempted to move further upmarket, creating the hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured self-levelling suspension, &quot;memory seat&quot; function, and an all-transistor signal-seeking car radio that was produced by GM&#x27;s Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models. While the car showed Cadillac&#x27;s technological prowess, it sold only 904 units.

===Pinnacles in luxury and dimension: 1960–1976===
The dual-reservoir brake master cylinder, with separate front and rear hydraulic systems, was introduced in 1962, six years ahead of the federal requirement. The first fully automatic heater–air conditioning system also appeared, as did the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission; it would become the GM standard model for several decades. Starting in the late 1960s, Cadillac offered a fiber-optic warning system to alert the driver to failed light bulbs. The use of extensive bright-work on the exterior and interior also decreased each year after 1959. By the 1966 model year, even the rear bumpers ceased to be all chrome—large portions were painted, including the headlight bezels.

In 1966, Cadillac had its best annual sales to that point, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an increase of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. The years 1967 and 1968 saw the introduction of a host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and side marker lights.

The front-wheel drive Eldorado was launched in 1967, setting a new standard for a personal luxury car. Its simple, elegant design was a far cry from the tailfin and chrome of the 1950s. Cadillac&#x27;s success grew against rivals Lincoln and Imperial, which had division sales topping all of Chrysler for the first time in 1970. The new engine that debuted in the 1968 model year, designed for an ultimate capacity potential of , was increased to for the 1970 Eldorado. It was adopted across the model range beginning in 1975. Driver and front passenger airbags (&quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot;) began to be offered on some Cadillac, as well as other Buick and Oldsmobile luxury models, in 1974, however this option was unpopular as was discontinued after the 1976 model year. The pillarless Coupe deVille ended with the 1973 model, while the Sedan deVille remained pillarless through 1976.

The 1970s saw new extremes in vehicle luxury and dimension. The 1972 Fleetwood was some longer in wheelbase and overall, compared to the 1960 Series 75 Fleetwood; the entry-level 1972 Calais was longer than the equivalent 1960 Series 62, on the same wheelbase. Models gained a smoother ride while vehicle weight, standard equipment and engine displacement were all increased. Cadillac experienced record sales in 1973 and again in the late 1970s. In May 1975, the Seville was introduced as a competitor to the growing import luxury car market and was marketed as &quot;international size&quot;.

===Downsizings and new technology-assisted luxury features: 1977–1988===
In 1977, Cadillac&#x27;s D-bodies experienced the same &quot;downsizing&quot; as the rest of GM&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; bodied cars. In 1977, GM significantly downsized their full-sized cars. The Fleetwood Brougham lost its exclusive longer wheelbase and now rode on the same new shorter 121.5&quot; wheelbase as the DeVille. Both Fleetwood and DeVille models were powered by the V8s. This engine was basically a de-bored version of the 472/500 (7.9 L/8.2 L) V8 of previous years.

1977 was Cadillac&#x27;s 75th anniversary and saw the introduction of the downsized DeVille coupes and sedans. The redesigned Fleetwood Brougham was now similar in appearance to the lesser Sedan de Ville. Other than the name, there were only subtle exterior differences between a Fleetwood Brougham and Sedan de Ville. The interior of the Fleetwood was plusher and offered more features as standard. These new cars featured a higher roofline, resulting in a vehicle that was more than nine inches shorter, four inches narrower, and half a ton lighter than the previous year, but with a larger trunk and more headroom and legroom. These were also the first DeVilles to be marketed without fender skirts over the rear wheels. The 500 in3 V8 (which produced 190 horsepower) was replaced for 1977 by a 180-horsepower 425 in3 V8 variant of similar design. The reduction in size and weight was implemented to improve fuel economy and emissions as a result of the United States Federal Government passage of Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations.

For 1977, the lineup included the two-door Coupe de Ville ($9,654) and the four-door Sedan de Ville ($9,864). The $650 d&#x27;Elegance package, an interior dress-up option carried over from the previous generation of DeVilles, continued for both models. Three-sided, wrap-around tail lamps were a 1977 feature only (although they would re-appear in 1987). Coupe de Ville&#x27;s popular &quot;Cabriolet&quot; option, priced at $348, included a rear-half padded vinyl roof covering and opera lamps. An optional electronic fuel-injected version of the standard 7.0-liter powerplant, adding , was available for an additional $647. Sales figures were 138,750 Coupe de Villes and 95,421 Sedan de Villes for an all-time sales record of 234,171 DeVilles sold.

With these downsizings, fuel economy and handling improved. In 1979, Cadillac&#x27;s flagship Eldorado coupe would downsize. The 1980s saw further downsizing of many models including the DeVille, Fleetwood, Eldorado and Seville. Cadillac brought out a dramatic redesign for the Seville in 1980 featuring a bustle-back rear-end styling theme and a move to the same front-wheel-drive chassis as the Eldorado. In 1982, the Cimarron was introduced as the brand&#x27;s first compact car. The Cimarron&#x27;s market failure is one in a series of events throughout the 1980s and 1990s which sullied Cadillac&#x27;s reputation and caused the division&#x27;s share of the US market to fall from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.2% in 1997; it is routinely cited as the nadir of GM&#x27;s product planning. Automotive journalist Dan Neil included the Cimarron in his 2007 list of the &quot;Worst cars of all time&quot;, saying &quot;everything that was wrong, venal, lazy, and mendacious about GM in the 1980s was crystallized in this flagrant insult to the good name and fine customers of Cadillac.&quot; He added that the Cimarron &quot;nearly killed Cadillac and remains its biggest shame&quot;.

For the 1981 model year, the long-running &quot;Standard of the World&quot; slogan was changed to &quot;An American Standard of the World&quot;. For the 1982 model year, the slogan was changed to &quot;Best of All ... It&#x27;s A Cadillac&quot;, which was used until 1986.

Due to a delay in the production of the new front-drive DeVilles (which were now scheduled for release as 1985 models), 1984 was a re-run for the rear-wheel-drive Coupe de Ville ($17,140) and its four-door companion, the popular Sedan de Ville ($17,625). It was also the last time DeVille used the &quot;V&quot; emblem below the Cadillac crest, as 1985 models and on would use the crest and wreath emblem—formerly a Fleetwood and Eldorado exclusive. For 1984, sales figures show a total four-door production of 107,920 units, and an additional 50,840 two-door units (figures include de Ville and Fleetwood models). The new front-drive 1985 Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville arrived in Cadillac showrooms during the spring of 1984, about six months earlier than most new-car introductions, so both the 1984 rear-drive and 1985 front-drive models were selling and being produced (due to separate assembly plants) at the same time for nearly half a year.

1985 saw the new front-wheel-drive DeVille and Fleetwood models released after quality delays prevented a planned 1984 model year introduction. 1986 saw new downsized Eldorado and Seville models. In 1987, the all-new Pininfarina-bodied Allanté roadster came to market featuring the HT-4100 V8 engine. The Sixty Special returned in 1987 as the top owner-driven Cadillac in the front-wheel-drive GM C-body lineup, with a planned production run of just 2,000 cars. The 1987 and 1988 Sixty Specials were unique, custom-crafted automobiles, which featured a five-inch (127 mm) longer wheelbase over the DeVille/Fleetwood on which they were based. Also in 1987, Detroit Assembly on Clark Street in Detroit, where Cadillacs had been made since 1921, was closed.

The 1980s also saw the introduction of new, technology-assisted luxury features. Among these was the return of the memory seat option, not available since the 1958 Eldorado Brougham. 1981 brought standard digital heating and air conditioning controls to all models. In 1982, the High Technology engine was introduced. It was originally scheduled for a 1983 release, later delayed to 1985, with its intended applications being the downsized front-wheel-drive models Cadillac would introduce that year. 1983 saw the introduction of the Delco/Bose stereo system option, a US$895 cassette stereo system available only on the Eldorado and Seville. This Bose system would eventually become available on the DeVille and Fleetwood models on their 1985 FWD editions. The trip computer, available for Eldorado in 1979 and Seville in 1978 and 1979, was replaced in 1981 with the availability of digital instrumentation with some Trip Computer functions being replaced by the new digital heating and air conditioning control panel. Digital instrumentation would become available for the new FWD DeVille and Fleetwood series in 1985.

===New introductions: 1989–1999===

In 1991, Cadillac introduced the Northstar engine, which was a family of high-performance 90° V engines produced by General Motors from 1991 to 2010. Regarded as GM&#x27;s most technically complex engine, the original double overhead cam, four valve per cylinder, aluminum block/aluminum head V8 design was developed by Oldsmobile&#x27;s R&amp;D, but is most associated with Cadillac&#x27;s Northstar series. The related Northstar System was Cadillac&#x27;s trademarked name for a package of performance features introduced in mid-1992 that coupled variable valve timing, road sensing suspension, variable power steering and four-wheel disc brakes to the Division&#x27;s high-output and high-torque Northstar engines.

For 1992, the Seville was redesigned to better compete with luxury performance sedans from Europe and had adopted some styling cues from the 1988 Cadillac Voyage concept car. It also made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list that year. A year later, the Brougham was discontinued and replaced by the all-new rear-wheel-drive 1993 Fleetwood. The previous front-wheel drive Fleetwood was renamed Sixty Special for 1993. That same year, the Coupe deVille was discontinued due to the declining popularity of full-size coupes.

For 1994, the DeVille was redesigned to share the K-body platform with the Seville. The body was redesigned, although the wheelbase remained 113.8 inches—rather than the 111 inches used on the Seville. Production moved to Hamtramck, Michigan.
Also for 1994, all DeVille models included a standard SRS driver-side front airbag, as well as fully digital instrumentation with an integrated message center, which provided important vehicle information and status, current speed, outside temperature and more, with controls mounted to the left of the instrument cluster. Also standard was a dual-zone front HVAC system, with controls located to the right of the instrument cluster, and remote controls on the front passenger door panel. An SRS passenger&#x27;s-side front airbag became standard equipment after a restyling in 1996, which also brought revised exterior styling and new audio systems with TheftLock coded anti-theft technology. In 1995, the high technology engine that had been used in Cadillacs since 1982 was discontinued.

For 1997, the Catera mid-size sedan was introduced as Cadillac&#x27;s new entry-level model. The Catera was a rebadged variant of the Opel Omega B and was manufactured by Opel in Rüsselsheim, Germany. The DeVille was also redesigned that year. The late 1990s saw Cadillac field its first-ever entry in the growing SUV segment. The Escalade, introduced in 1999, was marketed to compete with the Lincoln Navigator and luxury SUVs from various import brands.

===The &quot;Art and Science&quot; era: 2000–present===
In 2000, Cadillac introduced a new design philosophy for the 21st century called &quot;Art and Science&quot;, which it states &quot;incorporates sharp, sheer forms and crisp edges—a form vocabulary that expresses bold, high-technology design and invokes the technology used to design it.&quot; This new design language spread from the original CTS and to the Cadillac XLR roadster. Cadillac&#x27;s model lineup mostly included rear- and all-wheel-drive sedans, roadsters, crossovers and SUVs. The only exceptions were the front-wheel drive compact executive Cadillac BLS (which was not sold in North America) and the Cadillac DTS, neither of which is still in production. The Cadillac BLS was developed by Saab in Trollhättan, Sweden. The BLS was a rebadged variant of the Saab 9-3 and was offered in both sedan and station wagon configurations. In 2005, the Cadillac STS was introduced as the successor to the Cadillac Seville, which beginning in 1988 was available as an upscale performance-oriented &quot;STS&quot; (for Seville touring sedan) version, and comfort-oriented &quot;SLS&quot; (for Seville luxury sedan). The following year, STS received Cadillac&#x27;s then-new Northstar System, including the aluminium DOHC &quot;L37&quot; Northstar V8 engine.

The STS was Cadillac&#x27;s highest-priced sedan, falling in size between the mid-size CTS and full-size DTS. In 2006, the DeVille nameplate was replaced by Cadillac DTS, an abbreviation dating back to 1986, when a &quot;DeVille Touring Sedan&quot; package was first available. The new name brought the DeVille into line with Cadillac&#x27;s Art and Science-era nomenclature, which saw the Seville renamed the STS and the Catera replacement called the CTS. The last DeVille rolled off the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly line on June 23, 2005.

The new second-generation CTS-V performance sedan was introduced in 2009 as a direct competitor to the BMW M5. Powered by a supercharged OHV 6.2 L LSA V8 engine, an automatic version of the CTS-V lapped the Nürburgring in 7:59.32, at the time a record for production sedans. The last DTS rolled off the assembly line at 11:51 a.m. on May 27, 2011. It was replaced by the Cadillac XTS which debuted in 2012 as a 2013 model. The Cadillac ATS compact sedan also debuted in 2012 as a 2013 model and a coupe version of the ATS was added two years later.

In 2016, the Cadillac CT6 was introduced and was the brand&#x27;s first full-size rear-wheel-drive sedan since the discontinuation of the Fleetwood in 1996. In early 2017, Cadillac launched Book By Cadillac, a vehicle subscription service which was initially available in New York City. In November 2017, it was announced that Book by Cadillac would be expanding to Dallas and Los Angeles.

The Cadillac XT6, a new seven-seat luxury mid-size crossover SUV, was introduced on January 12, 2019, at the North American International Auto Show. It went on sale in the third quarter of 2019 as a 2020 model. Other additions to the Cadillac lineup for the 2020 model year included the CT5 mid-size luxury sedan, replacing the CTS, and the CT4 compact sedan which replaced the ATS. Performance &quot;V&quot; versions of the CT4 and CT5 were also added for 2020.

==Motorsports==
Before the outbreak of World War II, Cadillac (like most manufacturers) participated in various motorsports. Many Allard automobiles used Cadillac engines.

In the 1950s, Cadillac (like all American manufacturers at the time) participated in the NASCAR Grand National Series. The brand disappeared from the series by the 1960s.

Cadillac powered the Cadillac Northstar LMP a Le Mans Prototype in the early years of the American Le Mans Series from 2000 to 2002. When the prototype proved unsuccessful, Cadillac withdrew from the series. Cadillac&#x27;s most successful venture into motorsports in recent years has been its use of the CTS-V in the SCCA World Challenge Grand Touring class. Cadillac returned to prototype racing in 2017 with the Cadillac DPi-V.R in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with considerable success.

In 2023, Cadillac entered its Cadillac V-Series.R into the FIA World Endurance Championship and IMSA SportsCar Championship. An official manufacturer entry was entered with Chip Ganassi Racing in both FIA World Endurance Championship and IMSA SportsCar Championship as full season entries. They also provided customer cars to Action Express Racing. It will also enter in 2024.

===Formula One===
On January 5, 2023, Cadillac&#x27;s parent company General Motors announced their intention to enter the Cadillac brand into the Formula One World Championship in conjunction with Andretti Global. Cadillac planned to produce a Formula One engine for Andretti for the 2028 season. However, on January 31, 2024, the Andretti team was denied the entry for and seasons after being approved by the FIA in July 2023. Formula One has still not ruled out letting Andretti and Cadillac enter in 2028, assuming Cadillac&#x27;s engine is ready. On November 25, 2024, Formula One announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with General Motors, allowing them to join the series from the 2026 season.

<doc id="64258" wikidata="Q172843" url="?curid=64258" title="Jacques Villeneuve">
<text>Jacques Joseph Charles Villeneuve (; born 9 April 1971) is a Canadian former racing driver, who competed in IndyCar from 1994 to 1995, and Formula One from to . Villeneuve won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Williams, and won 11 Grands Prix across 11 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Villeneuve won the IndyCar World Series and the Indianapolis 500 in 1995 with Team Green.

Born in Quebec and raised in Monaco, Villeneuve is the son of former Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve and the nephew of racing driver Jacques-Joseph. Aged 17, he began racing under an Andorran license in Italy, progressing to Italian Formula Three a year later. He then moved to the higher-tier Toyota Atlantic Championship, participating in one race during the 1992 season and finishing third overall in the 1993 championship. He began competing in Championship Auto Racing Teams with the Forsythe/Green Racing team in the 1994 season, finishing sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with one victory and earning Rookie of the Year and Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year honours. In the following year with the renamed Team Green, Villeneuve won four races (including the Indianapolis 500) and the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Villeneuve moved to Williams in Formula One for the 1996 season, claiming four Grand Prix victories, and becoming the first rookie runner-up in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship (WDC) after a season-long duel with teammate Damon Hill. His main title challenge for the following season came from Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher, and Villeneuve beat the latter following a controversial collision at the season-ending , becoming the first Canadian World Drivers&#x27; Champion, achieving seven Grand Prix victories. He finished fifth in the 1998 season achieving two podiums and helped Williams finish third in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship behind Ferrari and McLaren. After an unsuccessful with British American Racing (BAR), Villeneuve finished seventh in the WDC in both and with BAR, achieving two podiums in 2001, outscoring his teammates Ricardo Zonta and Olivier Panis. Villeneuve raced in Formula One from to 2006, driving for BAR, Renault, Sauber, and BMW Sauber, but he did not achieve any further success.

Villeneuve left Formula One mid-way through the 2006 season and began competing in various forms of motor racing such as sports car racing, NASCAR, and touring car racing. Though not as successful in these forms of racing, he won the 2008 1000 km of Spa driving for Peugeot. Villeneuve was appointed Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1998. He was voted the winner of both the Lou Marsh Trophy and the Lionel Conacher Award in each of 1995 and 1997. Villeneuve is an inductee of the Canadian Motor Sports Hall of Fame, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, and the FIA Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
On 9 April 1971, Villeneuve was born in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, a small town outside of Montreal in the Canadian province of Quebec. He is the son of snowmobile and future Ferrari racer Gilles Villeneuve and his wife Joann Barthe. Villeneuve has a sister, Melanie, and a half sister Jessica. His uncle, Jacques Sr., whom he was named after also competed in motor racing. Villeneuve spent most of his formative years travelling with the racing fraternity with his parents.

Aged seven in 1978, Villeneuve and his family relocated from Berthierville, Quebec, to the small principality of Monaco on the French Riviera in France&#x27;s south-east coast close to the border with Italy to be nearer to Ferrari&#x27;s headquarters. On the advice of driver Patrick Tambay, Villeneuve was sent to the French-speaking Swiss private boarding Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil by his mother, which he attended from the ages of 12 (1983) to 17 (1988). He excelled in skiing and experimented with BASE jumping, ice hockey, motocross and water skiing. Villeneuve left the school by mutual consent between his mother and the school owners.

==Early racing career==
Villeneuve&#x27;s mother was aware from when he was five that he wanted to race, and he went go-karting with his uncle several times in Canada. In May 1982, his father died in an accident with Jochen Mass during qualifying for the at Circuit Zolder. Jacques became less interested in motor racing after that, fearing the sport&#x27;s dangers. In 1984, he asked his mother if he could do motor racing like his father. Villeneuve&#x27;s mother agreed to let him race on the condition he improved his academic performance in one of his weakest subjects, mathematics. Though his mother preferred him to do a course in aerodynamic or mechanical engineering, she did not discourage her son from pursuing racing. In early September 1985, Villeneuve was invited by a SAGIS employee to race in 100 cc go-kart at Italy&#x27;s Imola Circuit. He impressed the track owners so much that they let him test a 135 cc kart and then a Formula 4 car. In July 1986, his uncle enrolled him in the Jim Russell Racing Driver School in Mont Tremblant, where he passed a three-day course driving a Formula Ford 1600 car from Van Diemen.

In mid-1987, Villeneuve left his family to attend the Spenard-David Racing School in Shannonville, Ontario to hone his abilities under Richard Spenard. Villeneuve did not have the money to pay for the course and his mother would not fund it because she thought Jacques finishing his education was more important. He worked in a mechanics&#x27; training programme allowing students to learn racing in return for garage painting. Aged 17, Villeneuve was invited to make his car racing debut in the Italian Touring Car Championship, driving a Salerno Course-entered Group N Alfa Romeo 33 car for three rounds of the 1988 season. The Canadian and Italian authorities would not grant him a licence since he was a year younger than their minimum age requirement, so he obtained an international racing licence in Andorra with Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs aid. Villeneuve performed poorly in each of the three rounds.

Villeneuve went on to sign a three-year contract to drive a Reynard-Alfa Romeo car for Prema in the Italian Formula Three Championship, a deal that was aided by the squad obtaining sponsorship from the Camel cigarette company. Initially struggling to drive a Formula 3 car, he enrolled at the Magione Driving School. Under Henry Morrogh&#x27;s direction, he gradually developed his character and driving technique. Villeneuve did not qualify five times, failed to finish three of the eleven races, and scored no points. In the 1990 season, he qualified for each of the 12 rounds and scored ten points for 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Villeneuve was considered a title favourite for the 1991 championship. A late-season switch to the Ralt RT35 chassis failed to improve his performance, but he still finished sixth overall with 20 points and 3 podiums. In late 1991, Villeneuve finished eighth in both the Macau Grand Prix and the Formula 3 Fuji Cup.

Dissatisfied with his management in 1991, Villeneuve asked former Beausoleil sports administrator and motor racing promoter Craig Pollock to take over his management three times. For the 1992 season, he wanted to compete in Formula 3000 in Europe with Prema, but did not have the funding to compete with the top teams. Villeneuve accepted an offer to relocate to Japan and drive a Toyota 032F car for the TOM&#x27;S squad in the Japanese Formula 3 Championship in 1992 following advice from Tambay. He felt the Japanese series was almost as good as the Italian one, and he did not want to remain in Europe. Villeneuve was the only driver to receive works support from TOM&#x27;S, and he got driver training. He won three races and finished no lower than sixth nine times, earning second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and 45 points. People in the racing world observed that ten years after his father&#x27;s death, Villeneuve was becoming a well-known racer. In August, Pollock negotiated a contract for Villeneuve to enter the Formula Atlantic street event at Trois-Rivières in the 1992 Atlantic Championship. He finished third in the No. 49 Swift DB4-Toyota car lent by the ComPred team. In addition, he also tested a Group C Toyota that year and was mentored by driver Roland Ratzenberger.

Four months later, Villeneuve accepted an invite to share a TOM&#x27;S-entered Toyota TS010 car with Eddie Irvine and Tom Kristensen at the final round of the 1992 All Japan Sports Prototype Car Endurance Championship at Mine Circuit, finishing fourth. He was fourth at the Macau Grand Prix for TOM&#x27;S. In Trois-Rivières, Villeneuve met crew chief Barry Green who wanted a driver for his new Forsythe-Green Racing squad. He accepted a three-year contract from Green with personal sponsorship from sports marketing arm Player&#x27;s November 1992. He raced the lower-tier 1993 Atlantic Championship which featured more powerful cars with more grip and downforce to become better acquainted with American open-wheel racing before progressing to Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) in 1994. Villeneuve built a close working relationship with aerodynamicist Tony Cicale. Driving the No. 10 Ralt RT40-Toyota car, Villeneuve won five races and finished in the top three four times for third overall and 185 points after a season-long duel with David Empringham and teammate Claude Bourbonnais. He was named the series&#x27; Rookie of the Year, and ended 1993 retiring from the Macau Grand Prix driving a March Racing Ralt 93C-Fiat car.

==CART (1994–1995)==
Villeneuve began participating in CART in the 1994 season for Forsythe-Green Racing, driving the No. 12 Reynard 94I-Ford XB vehicle after Green obtained sponsorship. He debuted at the season-opening Australian FAI Indycar Grand Prix at Surfers Paradise Street Circuit, starting eighth and finishing 17th after colliding with Stefan Johansson. In the season&#x27;s next round, the Valvoline 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, he was involved in a five-car accident which saw him sustain a side collision with Hiro Matsushita before being struck by Dominic Dobson. Qualifying fourth for his first Indianapolis 500, Villeneuve finished second, earning Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year honors as the highest-finishing rookie. Villeneuve finished ninth or higher in six of the next nine rounds, before beating Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi in the close finish to the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America road course in his first CART victory. He placed seventh and third in the final two rounds ending the year with Rookie of the Year honors and was sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 94 points.
Before the 1995 season, Villeneuve rejected offers from fellow CART teams and some Formula One (F1) squads and remained at the renamed Team Green driving the renumbered No. 27 Reynard 95I-Ford XB. Before the season, Villeneuve and his team were concerned, as their car had been unreliable and under-performed in pre-season testing. He won the season-opening Grand Prix of Miami after starting eighth, but he only finished two of the next four races. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500. Though Villeneuve was penalised two laps for overtaking the pace car, he re-took the lead after fellow Canadian Scott Goodyear failed to serve a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for also passing the pace car. Winning just his second Indianapolis 500 start, Villeneuve took the Drivers&#x27; Championship lead. Villeneuve went on to win both the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America and the Grand Prix of Cleveland, also scoring points in all but one of the remaining rounds to clinch the title at the final race in Laguna Seca. He won the championship with 172 points, four victories and six pole positions.

==Formula One career==
===Williams (1996–1998)===
In early 1995, the Williams F1 team and engine supplier Renault became interested in Villeneuve replacing the outgoing David Coulthard. Bernie Ecclestone, F1&#x27;s commercial rights holder, saw this as an opportunity to lure Villeneuve from CART even though Team Green wanted him to remain in America. Technical director Patrick Head and team principal Frank Williams gave Villeneuve a test in a FW17 car at Britain&#x27;s Silverstone Circuit in August 1995. He lapped two seconds slower than driver Damon Hill. Negotiations between Villeneuve&#x27;s representatives in mid-1995 led to Villeneuve signing a contract for 1996 and 1997 with the option for the 1998 season. He was sent by Frank Williams to cover in testing during the six-month pre-season period testing on permanent European racing circuits, and he also prepared by learning the circuits on a simulation computer game.

====1996====
Villeneuve drove the docile FW18 car equipped with a powerful, reliable Renault engine and a better gearbox. Villeneuve built up a rapport with his race engineer Jock Clear and learnt from his teammate Hill. Although not considered a title favourite by the media, he contended for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Hill but never led the standings. Villeneuve&#x27;s debut at the season-opening saw him become the third driver ever to claim pole position on his first start, and despite an oil leak, he finished second. He beat Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher in the three races later for his maiden F1 victory. Villeneuve scored points in eight of the next eleven events and won the , the and the . Entering the season-ending , he had nine fewer points than Hill, requiring him to win the event and for Hill to score no points to claim the title; however, Villeneuve&#x27;s right-rear tyre came off his car, forcing him to retire from the race. He finished runner-up to Hill in the drivers&#x27; standings with 78 points in his maiden season. Villeneuve was the first rookie to achieve four Grand Prix victories in his debut year and the first to finish runner-up overall.

====1997====

Before the 1997 season, Hill moved to the Arrows team, resulting in Villeneuve&#x27;s promotion to lead driver. He was paired with Heinz-Harald Frentzen. He and Schumacher vied for that year&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship and variously shared the title lead. Villeneuve trained extensively and drove an aerodynamically efficient and powerful FW19 car designed around him. He won seven and qualified on pole position eight times in the first 14 races. At the season&#x27;s penultimate race, the , he had a chance to win the championship but was banned for overtaking under yellow flag conditions twice during practice. He was allowed to race under appeal but was disqualified from fifth when the appeal was rejected. Before the season-ending , Villeneuve had 77 points, one fewer than Schumacher, requiring him to finish in the top six and ahead of Schumacher to win the championship. During qualifying, Villeneuve, Schumacher and Frentzen all set the exact same lap time, but Villeneuve started from pole position per F1 regulations because he was the first driver to set the time. Villeneuve and Schumacher were involved in a collision that saw Schumacher careen into a gravel trap, giving the title to Villeneuve. He was the second driver (after Mario Andretti) to win the F1 World Championship, the CART title, and the Indianapolis 500. He was also Canada&#x27;s first F1 World Champion.

====1998====
Villeneuve threatened to leave F1 and return to CART if F1 introduced grooved tyres and narrower cars for the 1998 season. Though these changes were adopted, he remained at Williams with Frentzen. Villeneuve&#x27;s FW20 car had one-year old Mecachrome-branded engines after Renault&#x27;s withdrawal from F1 after the 1997 season, which transpired to be noncompetitive. He scored points at nine with a season-high third at each of the and at the following . During practice for the , he lost control of his car in Eau Rouge corner and crashed backwards into the barrier at approximately . Villeneuve was unhurt. With 21 points, he finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===British American Racing (1999–2003)===

Villeneuve left Williams following the 1998 season. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey, who liked Villeneuve&#x27;s performance and who Villeneuve respected, offered him employment for the 1999 season, but Villeneuve rejected it. He instead signed a contract to drive with the new British American Racing (BAR) team founded by Pollock and British American Tobacco following their late 1997 purchase of the financially struggling Tyrrell team. Villeneuve joined the team because he sought to emulate Schumacher&#x27;s style of basing a team around him and employing highly skilled people to get from the bottom of the running order to the top.

====1999–2000====
Villeneuve was joined at BAR by former McLaren test driver Ricardo Zonta for most of the season and then by Mika Salo for three . His BAR 01 car was efficient and fast but chronically unreliable. He failed to finish each of the first eleven races due to either mechanical trouble or crashing. Villeneuve was only able to finish four Grands Prix with a best finish of eighth at the . Villeneuve qualified a season-high fifth at the and was briefly third in the two events later before retiring. During qualifying for the , he suffered a high-speed crash through Eau Rouge corner, which destroyed his car but left him uninjured. He tallied no points towards the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

For the 2000 season, his BAR 002 car had a more reliable and powerful works Honda engine, and Zonta was again his teammate. Villeneuve finished fourth at the season-opening and scored two more points by placing fifth at the two races later. He also finished fourth at the , the and the . Villeneuve scored points in the final two races by finishing sixth at the and fifth at the . Overall, his performances had improved from 1999 due to a better built and more reliable car. Villeneuve finished the season seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 17 points.

==== 2001–2003 ====

There were rumours of Villeneuve leaving the BAR team after 2000. He talked to Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren about racing with them in the 2001 championship. Villeneuve later admitted McLaren was not an option since his management team got accused of conducting early season publicity and he disliked McLaren&#x27;s corporate methodology. Villeneuve also considered taking a sabbatical, but he ultimately signed a three-year contract extension with BAR in July 2000. He obtained a get-out clause enabling him to leave BAR should they under-perform.

Villeneuve was joined by Olivier Panis, and the 003 car he drove was approximately lighter than the 002 chassis. Villeneuve was cordial with his teammate since they could talk to each other in French, and set himself the goal of winning a race and finishing third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. His car was fairly reliable but lacked rear grip and straight-line speed due to an underpowered Honda engine. At the season-opening , Villeneuve struck the rear of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car, launching him into the air. One of Villeneuve&#x27;s car&#x27;s wheels struck marshal Graham Beveridge, killing him. Villeneuve achieved BAR&#x27;s first two podium results, finishing third at both the and the . He finished the season seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 12 points. Although he scored five fewer points than the year before, Villeneuve qualified higher than Panis eleven times in 2001.

Before the 2002 season Villeneuve remained at BAR. He talked to team principal Flavio Briatore, who offered him a seat at Renault in lieu of Jenson Button but Villeneuve rejected it. Villeneuve ultimately opted to remain at BAR due to pressure from Honda, and he again partnered with Panis. He became uncomfortable when new BAR team principal David Richards publicly mentioned that money spent on Villeneuve&#x27;s high salary could be better used for research and development. The BAR 004 chassis proved to be more unreliable than the year before and slower due to an under-powered Honda engine. He scored four points for 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with a fourth place at the being his season&#x27;s best result. Villeneuve regretted remaining at BAR due to the lack of results, and he was offered a contract to join Team Player&#x27;s in CART for the 2003 championship before returning to BAR for the 2004 and 2005 F1 seasons. The deal was pushed by Richards but not agreed upon because Villeneuve&#x27;s and Pollock&#x27;s financial settlements were too great for team owner Gerald Forsythe to be willing to take on.

Villeneuve decided to remain at BAR for the 2003 season, and was partnered with Button. Villeneuve&#x27;s BAR 005 car had a more powerful but bulky Honda engine. He initially had a poor relationship with Button, not speaking to him and saying that Button &quot;should be in a boy band&quot;. Their relationship did not improve after the season-opening when Villeneuve was due to make a pit stop but drove an additional lap when Button was due to make his, leaving Button stationary behind Villeneuve. Although he blamed it on &quot;radio problems&quot;, Button and Richards hinted their disbelief in his execution. Villeneuve was outperformed by his teammate and retired eight times due to mechanical faults. He finished sixth at both the and the . Before the season-ending , Villeneuve was informed by Richards he was no longer needed. He was replaced by test driver Takuma Sato. He was 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 6 points.

===Renault and Sauber (2004–2006)===
Villeneuve took a sabbatical after BAR released him. He thought of taking up NASCAR as a new challenge, but no teams approached him. After speaking to senior officials from BAR and Williams, Villeneuve believed that they would want to resign him to their respective teams, but neither move occurred. When he realised no competitive team would employ him, he and Pollock met Sauber team owner Peter Sauber in Hinwil in mid-2004. Impressed with Sauber&#x27;s professionalism, he signed a two-year contract the next month to drive for Sauber from the 2005 season and help them attract new sponsors and partners.

Before his tenure at Sauber began, Villeneuve was employed by Briatore to help Renault claim second from BAR in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship by scoring the maximum number of points in the 2004 season&#x27;s final three races following the dismissal of Jarno Trulli for performing poorly. Sauber was comfortable in letting Villeneuve drive for Renault because both teams used Michelin tyres. Driving the R24 car, he finished all three events but under-performed and was lapped each time. Villeneuve scored no points and was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

At Sauber, Villeneuve used a C24 chassis and was teammates with Felipe Massa. A lack of both pre-season testing and money for car development caused Villeneuve to have a difficult handling car. He did not have a good relationship with the team because he was not allowed to give feedback on car setup due to Willy Rampf&#x27;s influence. Villeneuve finished a season-high fourth at the and scored more points in eighth at the and sixth at the . He was 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 9 points.

For the 2006 championship, Villeneuve stayed at the renamed BMW Sauber after BMW purchased the team. Nick Heidfeld was his teammate. The atmosphere within the team made Villeneuve content, and he was happy with BMW&#x27;s involvement. He found the less electronically dependent and less refined aerodynamically F1.06 car more driveable. Team principal Mario Theissen criticised Villeneuve for not achieving decent results, thus failing to please BMW&#x27;s board of directors. Despite retiring three times, he accumulated 7 points from the first 11 races, ranking him 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. At the , Villeneuve sustained muscle pains in an accident exiting a corner. Shortly afterward, Theissen terminated his contract and replaced him with Robert Kubica. He did not want to be part of a shootout between himself and Kubica, and saw his release as a precursor to his future, saying &quot;Screw this, It&#x27;s time to get on with the rest of my life.&quot; Villeneuve twice failed to return to F1, first with Stefan Grand Prix in the 2010 season, then with his team in partnership with Durango for the following year.

==Post Formula One career==

===2007–2010===

Villeneuve explored NASCAR after exiting F1, talking to Roush Racing owner Jack Roush who agreed to help Villeneuve obtain Truck Series experience before progressing to the Busch Series in 2007 on the condition of a sponsorship agreement. Before that, he made his 24 Hours of Le Mans debut with Peugeot in the 2007 edition informing team manager Serge Saulnier that he wanted to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport. Sharing the Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1)-class No. 7 Peugeot 908 HDi FAP car with Marc Gené and Nicolas Minassian, Villeneuve retired after 338 laps with engine injection trouble. He entered into a partnership with Bill Davis Racing (BDR) to enter the 2007 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series&#x27; last seven events in its No. 27 Toyota Tundra in anticipation of racing full-time in 2008. Villeneuve finished outside the top ten in all seven events for 42nd overall with 615 points. That same year, he drove two races in the Nextel Cup Series (the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway and the Checker Auto Parts 500 at Phoenix) in BDR&#x27;s No. 27 Toyota, finishing 21st and 41st respectively.

Villeneuve and Pollock agreed to end their working relationship in early 2008, and Barry Green began managing him. That February, BDR released Villeneuve, who failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 of the renamed Sprint Cup Series after causing a multi-car accident in the Gatorade Duels. Two months later, he raced the final two rounds of the inaugural season of the Middle East and Southeast Asian-based stock car Speedcar Series at the Bahrain International Circuit and the Dubai Autodrome. Villeneuve then won the 2008 1000 km of Spa (part of the Le Mans Series) for Peugeot with Gené and Minassian in his first race victory in 11 years. Although he finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, sharing Peugeot&#x27;s No. 7 LMP1 entry with Gené and Minassian, he was released a month later because Peugeot wanted a French driver. In August, Villeneuve signed a contract to make his Nationwide Series debut driving Braun Racing&#x27;s No. 32 Toyota Camry in the NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Montreal&#x27;s Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, finishing 16th. He also came 16th at the Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez round of Top Race V6 Argentina aboard Oro Racing Team&#x27;s No. 27 Volkswagen Passat TRV6.

Villeneuve returned to the Speedcar Series in the 2008–09 season driving for Durango. Competing in five races, he finished in the top ten three times, scoring seven points for 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. In mid-2009, Villeneuve partook in the Tide 250 at Autodrome Saint-Eustache and the GP3R 100 at Circuit Trois-Rivières of the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series for the Jacombs Racing Team in its No. 7 Ford Fusion, finishing fourth at Trois-Rivieres. For the first and only time, Villeneuve entered the Spa 24 Hours in 2009. He shared Gravity Racing International&#x27;s G2 category No. 118 Mosler MT900R GT3 with Vincent Radermecker, Loris de Sordi and Ho-Pin Tung. The trio failed to finish. He drove the No. 27 Mercedes TRV6 at the Interlagos Circuit and Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez rounds of Top Race V6 Argentina, achieving a best finish of 13th in Buenos Aires. He made one appearance in the 2009 Nationwide Series, finishing fourth at the NAPA Auto Parts 200 in Braun Racing&#x27;s No. 32 car.

In 2010, Villeneuve ran the Nationwide Series road courses at Road America, Watkins Glen and Montreal in Braun Racing&#x27;s No. 32 vehicle. He finished eighth at Watkins Glen before claiming third at Montreal, where he started second. In mid-season, Villeneuve entered the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway finishing 29th in Braun Racing&#x27;s No. 32 car. Villeneuve joined Rod Nash Racing as Paul Dumbrell&#x27;s international co-driver in its No. 55 Ford FG Falcon for the Gold Coast 600 double header in October 2010 and sought advice from driver Marcos Ambrose on touring car racing. He finished 22nd in the first race and fifth in the second. Ford motorsport manager Chris Styring considered Villeneuve for the Bathurst 1000, the L&amp;H 500 and the Gold Coast 600 in the 2011 International V8 Supercars Championship, but Villeneuve&#x27;s financial demands were too great for Ford.

=== 2011–present ===

Villeneuve drove the Road America and Montreal road course races of the 2011 NASCAR Nationwide Series for Penske Racing in its No. 22 Dodge Challenger in lieu of Brad Keselowski. He finished the Road America race third and qualified on pole position for the Montreal event but finished 27th despite leading 29 laps. In August 2011, he joined Shell V-Power Racing for the Stock Car Corrida do Milhão for the 2011 championship of Stock Car Brasil despite concerns about adapting to his car. Driving the No. 27 Peugeot 408, Villeneuve qualified 27th and finished 18th. He was employed by Penske to drive its No. 22 car at the Road America and Montreal road course races in the 2012 NASCAR Nationwide Series. Villeneuve finished sixth at Road America and third at Montreal. During the 2012 International V8 Supercars Championship, he filled in for the injured Greg Murphy for three rounds in Kelly Racing&#x27;s No. 51 Holden Commodore, finishing no higher than 24th. He finished seventh sharing Vita4One&#x27;s No. 34 BMW Z4 GT3 with Jos Verstappen at the City Challenge Baku GT event in October.


When Villeneuve expressed interest in the International V8 Supercars Championship, he was considered for a full-time seat at Kelly Racing in the 2013, but no agreement was reached. For the first and only time, he partook in the Le Mans double header counting towards the 2013 season of the FFSA GT Championship, sharing the No. 27 Sport Garage-entered Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 with Éric Cayrolle. The duo finished 11th in the first race and retired from the next. Midway through the season, Villeneuve was hired by car owner James Finch to drive the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway in the Sprint Cup Series for Phoenix Racing in its No. 51 Chevrolet SS, finishing 41st due to mechanical trouble after 19 laps. Later that year, he finished fifth in the Grand Prix de Trois Rivieres (part of the Canadian Tire Series) in 22 Racing&#x27;s Dodge Challenger.

In 2014, Villeneuve signed to drive an Albatec Racing-prepared Peugeot 208 Supercar part-time in the FIA World Rallycross Championship&#x27;s inaugural season. He chose to do rallycross because he felt it was exciting for both drivers and spectators. In seven races, Villeneuve scored eight points for 37th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. He was released before the season ended due to non-supportive statements he made concerning his team and rallycross. Villeneuve entered the Indianapolis 500 for the first time in 19 years, driving Schmidt Peterson Hamilton Motorsports&#x27; No. 5 Dallara DW12-Honda third car entry. Though he had not planned to return to American open-wheel racing, he changed his mind after the 2012 introduction of a new car and engine formula. He qualified 27th and finished 14th. In August, Villeneuve finished 24th in Jacombs&#x27; No. 7 Dodge at Canadian Tire Series&#x27; Grand Prix de Trois Rivieres.

Villeneuve accepted an invitation to enter 2015 Stock Car Brasil&#x27;s season-opening Autódromo Internacional Ayrton Senna round alongside Zonta in Shell Racing&#x27;s No. 10 Chevrolet Sonic, placing 21st. He signed a contract to replace Heidfeld and partner with Stéphane Sarrazin at Venturi Grand Prix in the 2015–16 season of the all-electric Formula E series. Villeneuve had observed Formula E intently throughout 2014, admiring its bumpy city tracks. Guido Pastor called him to test a car, after which he got selected to drive. Villeneuve finished outside the top ten in the first two races and failed to start the Punta del Este ePrix due to an accident during qualifying. His relationship with Venturi cooled thereafter and they agreed to terminate their working relationship early in January 2016. Villeneuve signed a one-race agreement to return to rallycross in the 2018 season. He drove a Subaru Rally Team USA-entered WRX STi Supercar at the World RX of Canada (part of the Americas Rallycross Championship). He failed to qualify for the final following two accidents sustained during the second semi-final.

For the 2019 season, Villeneuve shared Scuderia Baldini 27&#x27;s GT3 Pro-class No. 27 Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo with Giancarlo Fisichella and Stefano Gai in the Italian GT Championship, finishing fourth at the 3 Hours of Misano and second at the 3 Hours of Vallelunga. He raced as a guest driver at the Ring Knutstorp and Karlskoga Motorstadion rounds of the Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia in a MTech Competition-entered Porsche 911 GT3 Cup car, placing in the top ten in the second race of both rounds. That year, he made his debut in NASCAR Whelen Euro Series in the Elite 1 Division. Villeneuve drove the No. 32 Go Fas Racing Chevrolet, finishing the season eighth in points with 431 scored, two pole positions and seven top-tens. For the 2020 season, he entered that year&#x27;s Whelen Euro Series with FEED Vict Racing, a team owned by him and Patrick Lemarié. Driving four rounds in the No. 5 car, he achieved two top fives for 104 points (21st overall) in the Elite 1 Division. He drove Academy Motorsport&#x27;s No. 5 car in the 2021 Whelen Euro Series, achieving his first two series victories in both races of the season&#x27;s final round at Vallelunga, and scoring 331 points for ninth in the points standings with two wins and four top-ten finishes. He left the series after the season was over to focus on his F1 commentary commitments.

For 2022, Villeneuve returned to the NASCAR Cup Series as a part-time driver of the non-chartered No. 27 Team Hezeberg Ford. He aimed to assist Team Hezeberg in the launch of its Cup Series programme and he consented to assist with their effort in the Daytona 500. Villeneuve qualified for the race as of the fastest of the open non-charter teams; starting from 40th, he finished the race in 22nd after an early-race half-spin and a subsequent collision with Tyler Reddick. In August, he failed to start the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series&#x27; Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières in the No. 7 Dumoulin Competition-prepared Dodge after accepting an offer by Festidrag Développement president Martin D&#x27;Anjou to enter the race.

For 2023, Villeneuve entered the first three rounds of the 2023 FIA World Endurance Championship alongside Tom Dillmann and Esteban Guerrieri in the Floyd Vanwall Racing Team&#x27;s No. 4 non-hybrid Vanwall Vandervell 680-Gibson in the LMH category, although he was noncompetitive and was replaced by Tristan Vautier for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He subsequently withdrew from the team for the rest of the season.

==Non-racing ventures and personal life==

Villeneuve began writing lyrics while he was driving in Japan, and purchased a guitar in 1996. When he became uncertain whether he would remain at Sauber for the 2006 F1 season in November 2005, he elected to rent a professional recording studio in Paris in order to better hear his music. Travelling to England to record with the Tenebrae Choir, Villeneuve recorded nearly every day for a month before stopping to prioritise motor racing. That same year, he released his debut French single, &quot;Accepterais-tu&quot;, and an acoustic rock album &quot;Private Paradise&quot; with 13 songs (nine in French and four in English) in 2007. Six songs each were written by Villeneuve and his friends; he also performed a cover of &quot;Women Come, Women Go&quot; by Gazebo. Villeneuve collaborated with vocalists Steve Smith and Amélie Veille. The album debuted at No. 49 on the Quebec pop charts and received negative media reviews. It sold 233 copies in Quebec and 836 in North America.

Villeneuve was a guest on the 6 June 1995 and 2 June 1998 episodes of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Villeneuve made a cameo appearance as a racing driver in the 2001 film &quot;Driven&quot;. He carried the Olympic torch in Old Montreal during the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay in December 2009. Villeneuve also carried the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony. Villeneuve was employed by Disney France in late 2010, spending two days recording the French voice of David Hobbscap for the 2011 Pixar animated film &quot;Cars 2&quot;. The character was also renamed after him in the French dub. He analysed the and the for the British television channel Sky Sports F1. Since 2013, Villeneuve has commentated for the pay-TV services Sky Sport in Italy and Canal+ in France. He co-designed the Area 27 racing track in Okanagan, British Columbia. Villeneuve became an ambassador of the Williams Formula One team for the season.

Villeneuve was engaged firstly to a Montreal college student named Sandrine Gros D&#x27;Aillon, then to Australian pop singer Dannii Minogue and later American ballerina Ellen Green. Villeneuve&#x27;s first marriage was to Parisian Johanna Martinez in May 2006. They had two children before divorcing in June 2009. In June 2012, he married Brazilian Camila Andrea López Lillo, with whom he has two children. Villeneuve married his third wife, Giulia Marra, at the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

==Tax evasion scandal==
Since January 2017, Revenu Québec has pursued Villeneuve for $1.7 million in unpaid taxes after doing an audit of his business activities from 2010 to 2012. The October 2021 release of the Pandora Papers revealed that he had set up offshore companies in the tax-free jurisdictions of The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands in the 1990s and early 2000s to receive endorsement and income and to avoid paying Canadian income tax. In the fiscal year of 2010, Villeneuve declared $6,431 of personal income, and even claimed a tax-credit for low-income families.

==Public image and personality==
Journalist Gerald Donaldson describes Villeneuve as &quot;engagingly eccentric, opinionated and outspoken&quot; and one who &quot;defied convention and challenged authority, saying exactly what he thought in an era when drivers were expected to express only sweet-talking platitudes.&quot; He was popular with the European press for his reliance to speak his mind in a time of political correctness. He publicly bemoaned F1&#x27;s commercialised and commodified image, the sport&#x27;s structure, focus on cheaper, younger, corporate groomed drivers, and the manufacturing of driver personalities by corporations so as not to impugn their reputation by drivers voicing their thoughts and opinions through the media. Villeneuve frequently dyed his hair in various colours and sported grunge street wear. His behaviour earned him multiple cautions from F1&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), for bringing the series into disrepute. Max Mosley, the association&#x27;s president, commented that Villeneuve&#x27;s controversies would benefit him when he was no longer successful.

Villeneuve&#x27;s decision to be independent as much as possible from media relations to avoid over promotion was endorsed by Pollock. He refused to conduct substantial public relations duties for teams even after BAR attempted to purchase more public relations appearances for him, and he limited his commitments communicating to the press. Journalist Matt Bishop observed that Villeneuve was frequently criticised for refusing to do sponsorship functions and for his self-imposed limiting interactions with the press at , but Bishop noted others appreciated Villeneuve&#x27;s focus on racing and instead of &quot;extraneous commitments&quot;. Villeneuve resisted to join the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA), which he believed would serve only the interests of drivers and not F1&#x27;s. He finally joined in late 2000, feeling his views were being ignored. Villeneuve decided to resign from the GPDA in mid-2006 because he was unhappy that its president, Schumacher, had been deemed to have purposely stopped during qualifying for the .

Villeneuve was voted the winner of the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy in 1996, and both the Lou Marsh Trophy and the Lionel Conacher Award in 1995 and 1997. Villeneuve received the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy for 1997 as the most successful British or Commonwealth driver over the course of a season. In April 1998, he was appointed Officer of the National Order of Quebec but collected the honour at the following year&#x27;s ceremony due to his racing commitments. He was added to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame two months later. In December 2010, Villeneuve was inducted into the athlete category of Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. He was added to both the FIA Hall of Fame and the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame seven and eight years later respectively.

=== Driving ability and racing helmet ===
Journalist Mark Hughes describes Villeneuve&#x27;s driving as &quot;spectacular&quot; and &quot;hard-charging&quot;. Villeneuve frequently went past the edge of the available track to increase his momentum as much as possible. He provided his engineers with suggestions that Maurice Hamilton wrote were &quot;so far from the norm to the point of diametrically opposed to standard practice, sometimes giving the impression of being pursued just for the hell of it.&quot; Villeneuve prefers driving on slick tyres and with no electronic driver aids. He found driver aids difficult and thus ran with less traction control than his teammates since he could not deal with either the anti-lock system on the rear brakes or heavy traction control. This required Villeneuve to modify his driving style and take fewer risks until his exit from F1 in 2006. He switched from wearing spectacles in his helmet to contact lenses in 1994 after his spectacles vibrated slightly on minor bumps in Indianapolis.

Villeneuve based the design of his racing helmet on his father&#x27;s, reportedly drawing it on a doodling pad. He looked at a photograph of his mother wearing a pink, yellow, green and blue V-shaped striped polo shirt at a motor race her husband was competing at, and he used her pencils to produce the design. Villeneuve incorporated an inverted V-style swoosh with varying thickness of colours around the shape on the helmet&#x27;s two sides. He retained a single black line from his first design in the centre to divide the colours without difficulty.

<doc id="64263" wikidata="Q62295" url="?curid=64263" title="St. Albans, Queens">
<text>St. Albans is a residential neighborhood in the southeastern portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bordered by Jamaica to the northwest, Hollis to the north, Queens Village to the northeast, Cambria Heights to the east, Laurelton to the southeast, Springfield Gardens to the south, and South Jamaica to the southwest. St. Albans is centered on the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, about two miles north of John F. Kennedy International Airport.

The small western enclave of Addisleigh Park is a U.S. historic district where many notable African Americans have lived, including Jackie Robinson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Lena Horne, and many jazz musicians such as Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie.

St. Albans is located in Queens Community District 12 and its ZIP Code is 11412. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 113th Precinct. Politically, St. Albans is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 27th and 28th Districts.

==History==

===Early settlement===
Part of a land grant to Dutch settlers from New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1655, the area, like much of Queens, remained farmland and forest for most of the next two centuries.

By the 1800s, the lands of four families—the Remsens, Everitts, Ludlums, and Hendricksons—formed the nucleus of this sprawling farm community in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica. In 1814, when the Village of Jamaica (the first village on Long Island) was incorporated, its (the village&#x27;s) boundaries extended eastward to Freeman&#x27;s Path (now Farmers Boulevard), and south to Lazy Lane (called Central Avenue in 1900, then Foch Boulevard in the 1920s, thus including parts of present-day St. Albans.
In 1852, the old mill pond that is now at the center of Baisley Pond Park was acquired by the Brooklyn waterworks for use as a reservoir.

===Later development===
In 1872, the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Cedarhurst Cut-off was built through the area, but no stop appears on the first timetables. In 1892, an area called Francis Farm was surveyed and developed for housing. There were numerous Francis families farming in the eastern portion of the Town of Jamaica in the 1880s.
Francis Lewis Boulevard (named for a signer of the Declaration of Independence, from Queens), which does not yet appear on maps from 1909, nor in 1910, is now the eastern boundary of St. Albans.

Soon, the first street lights illuminated the crossroads that is now Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. New shops clustered around August Everitt&#x27;s lone store. By July 1, 1898, the St. Albans Long Island Rail Road station opened where the tracks crossed Locust Avenue (now Baisley Boulevard). The station was razed and replaced with the current, grade separated station on October 15, 1935.

In 1899, a year after Queens became part of New York City (and with the Town of Jamaica and the Village of Jamaica thereby dissolved), the new post office for the 600 residents
was named St. Albans, after St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, which itself was named after a Saint Alban, thought to be the first Christian martyred in England. The name had been in use for the area since at least 1894 for the name of the school district,
and the LIRR station was named St. Albans when it opened in 1898. A 1909 map also shows a St Albans Avenue and a St Albans Place in the area.

The site was originally occupied by the St. Albans Golf Course and Country Club, which was completed in 1915. The club brought rich and famous golfers, including baseball star Babe Ruth, and hosted the 1930 Metropolitan Amateur. The Depression forced the golf course owners to try to sell, but plans for private development fell through. The land was seized by the federal government in 1942,
and construction soon began on the St. Albans Naval Hospital, which opened in 1943.
After construction was completed in 1950, the hospital had 3000 beds and contained a network of 76 wards. The hospital was turned over to the Veterans Administration in 1974, reopening as a VA hospital two years later, and more recently evolved into the Veterans Administration St. Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility. A portion of the hospital site became Roy Wilkins Park in the 1980s.

Within St. Albans is the small western enclave of Addisleigh Park, a U.S. historic district that consists of single-family homes built in a variety of styles between the 1910s and 1930s. Though originally intended as a segregated community for white people only, from the late 1930s many notable African Americans have lived there. Today, it remains a predominantly African American &amp; Jamaican enclave that is more upscale than surrounding areas in southeast Queens.

Between 1900 and 1940, the village of Addisleigh Park was developed by a handful of eminent white entrepreneurs including Edwin H. Brown, Gerald C. English, and Alexander Rodman. Restrictive covenants were established to prohibit the sale of any of its properties to blacks. A 1926 &quot;New York Times&quot; article insists, &quot;Addisleigh, together with the St. Albans Golf Club, was laid out under the personal direction of Edwin H. Brown, and carries a land and house restriction of the highest type.&quot; Two lawsuits were filed successfully by white residents who accused their neighbors of breaking the contractual segregation imposed on the neighborhood by its developers. Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the New York Historic Districts Council, says about this backlash, &quot;It was unpleasant, as it was a case of a number of narrow-minded neighbors trying to fight what they saw as an invasion of unwanted people in their area.&quot; Affluent white New York City-based public figures moved into Addisleigh Park to experience the privacy of suburban seclusion. Addisleigh Park boasted well-kept rows of Tudor and Colonial homes. The neighborhood&#x27;s close proximity to Manhattan allowed for quick and frequent commuting. During the Swing Era, Manhattan&#x27;s 52nd Street served as the epicenter of Swing Era live entertainment and musical innovation. For this reason, many successful African American jazz musicians began to recognize Addisleigh Park as the newest suburban haven for wealthy, influential artists.

In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants violated the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, though by that year, Addisleigh Park had already become a haven for world-famous African Americans in jazz and sports. The neighborhood was declared a historic district by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2011.

===Jazz legacy===

Famous stride pianist Fats Waller was the first well-known musician to move into Addisleigh Park at the peak of his career in the late 1930s. Waller had grown up in the Church (his father was a pastor). He subsequently had his home in Addisleigh Park fashioned with a built-in Hammond organ. He died in 1943 from bronchial pneumonia.

In 1937, jazz pianist and bandleader Count Basie moved his orchestra from Kansas City to New York. Count Basie&#x27;s orchestra performed at world-famous Manhattan venues including the Roseland Ballroom, the Savoy Ballroom, and the Woodside Hotel. In 1946, Basie and his wife, Katy, bought a home in Addisleigh Park, where the couple lived until 1973 when it was sold to bandleader/singer/pianist, Robert (Bubber) Johnson.

Singer, film actress, and Civil Rights Activist Lena Horne also moved into the Addisleigh Park neighborhood in the year 1946.
Soon after Horne, jazz trumpeter and bandleader Mercer Ellington, son of jazz great Duke Ellington, moved into Addisleigh Park in 1948. Eight years earlier, he had worked for renowned jazz trumpeter Cootie Williams as his road manager. Cootie Williams bought a home in Addisleigh Park in 1947. While residing in Addisleigh Park, Mercer Ellington employed Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Dorham, and Charles Mingus. Throughout the 1940s, Mercer and his father, Duke Ellington, frequently borrowed musicians from one another&#x27;s ensembles.

Saxophonist Earl Bostic moved to Addisleigh Park in 1948, the same year Bostic&#x27;s sextet hit success with their first single &quot;Temptation&quot;. Bostic was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the early 1930s, he played with Midwestern territory bands before moving to New York City in 1938 to play with Don Redman. Bostic&#x27;s second hit, &quot;Flamingo&quot;, was produced in 1951, while he was still living in Addisleigh Park. In 1956, Bostic and his wife left Addisleigh Park to settle in Los Angeles. Earl Bostic died onstage from a heart attack in Rochester, New York, in 1965.

Bostic&#x27;s neighbors on Murdock Avenue were Ella Fitzgerald and her then-husband, famous bassist and cellist Ray Brown. Fitzgerald owned her Addisleigh Park home from 1949 until 1956. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Fitzgerald had become one of the most recognizable names of wide-release swing music in the United States. She met Brown in 1946 while on tour with Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band. The couple divorced in 1952. Between the years 1949 and 1956, Fitzgerald sang scat with various bebop bands. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush in 1992.

Vicksburg, Mississippi native and famous jazz bassist Milt Hinton moved into Addisleigh Park in 1950. In his younger years, he had lived and worked in Chicago alongside celebrated jazz musicians Art Tatum and Eddie South. He moved to New York City for a job in Cab Calloway&#x27;s orchestra in 1936. Hinton bought a home on 113th Avenue in Addisleigh Park in 1950. He lived in the neighborhood until his death in 2000.

Saxophonist John Coltrane bought a home on Mexico Street in Addisleigh Park in the year 1959. Coltrane had just met tremendous critical success after his collaborations with Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. In January 1960, Coltrane released &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, his first album with Atlantic Records. &quot;Giant Steps&quot; is considered to be the album that catapulted Coltrane into jazz legend.

<doc id="64269" wikidata="Q654907" url="?curid=64269" title="Bristol Aeroplane Company">
<text>The Bristol Aeroplane Company, originally the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, was both one of the first and one of the most important British aviation companies, designing and manufacturing both airframes and aircraft engines. Notable aircraft produced by the company include the &#x27;Boxkite&#x27;, the Bristol Fighter, the Bulldog, the Blenheim, the Beaufighter, and the Britannia, and much of the preliminary work which led to Concorde was carried out by the company. In 1956 its major operations were split into Bristol Aircraft and Bristol Aero Engines. In 1959, Bristol Aircraft merged with several major British aircraft companies to form the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Bristol Aero Engines merged with Armstrong Siddeley to form Bristol Siddeley.

BAC went on to become a founding component of the nationalised British Aerospace, now BAE Systems. Bristol Siddeley was purchased by Rolls-Royce in 1966, who continued to develop and market Bristol-designed engines. The BAC works were in Filton, about north of Bristol city centre. BAE Systems, Airbus, Rolls-Royce, MBDA and GKN still have a presence at the Filton site where the Bristol Aeroplane Company was located.

== History ==
===Foundation===
The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Ltd was founded in February 1910 by Sir George White, chairman of the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company, along with his son Stanley and his brother Samuel, to commercially exploit the fast-growing aviation sector. Sir George met with the American aviation pioneer Wilbur Wright in France in 1909 by chance, during which he became aware of aviation&#x27;s business potential.

Unlike many aviation companies of the era, which were started by enthusiasts with little financial backing, British and Colonial was well funded from its outset. Sir George chose to establish a separate company from the Bristol Tramway Company, as the venture might be seen as too risky by many shareholders, and the new company&#x27;s working capital of £25,000 was subscribed entirely by Sir George, his brother, and his son. The affairs of the two companies were closely connected, and the company&#x27;s first premises were a pair of former tram sheds used for aircraft manufacture at Filton leased from the Bristol Tramway Company. Additionally, key personnel for the new business were recruited from the Bristol Tramway Company, including the chief engineer and works manager, George Challenger.

Flying schools were established at Brooklands, Surrey, which was then the centre of activity for British aviation, where Bristol rented a hangar; and at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain where, in June 1910, a school was established on of land leased from the War Office. By 1914 308 of the 664 Royal Aero Club certificates issued had been earned at the company&#x27;s schools.

===The Bristol Boxkite===


The company&#x27;s initial manufacturing venture was to be a licensed and improved version of an aircraft manufactured in France by société Zodiac, a biplane designed by Gabriel Voisin. This aircraft had been exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon in 1909 and Sir George had been impressed by the quality of its construction. Accordingly, a single example was purchased and shipped to England to be shown at the Aero Show at Olympia in March 1910, and construction of five more begun at the company&#x27;s Filton works. It was then transported to Brooklands for flight trials, where it immediately became apparent that the type had an unsatisfactory wing-section and lacked sufficient power; even though Bristol fitted the aircraft with a new set of wings, it only achieved a single brief hop on 28 May 1910, after which work on the type was abandoned. Since the machine had been sold with a &#x27;guarantee to fly&#x27;, Sir George succeeded in getting 15,000 francs compensation from Zodiac.

After this failure, the company decided to embark upon designing its own aircraft to serve as a successor. Drawings were prepared by George Challenger for an aircraft based on a successful design by Henri Farman whose dimensions had been published in the aeronautical press. These drawings were produced in little over a week, and Sir George promptly authorised the construction of twenty examples. The first aircraft to be completed was taken to Larkhill for flight trials, where it performed its first flight on 20 July 1910, piloted by Maurice Edmonds. The aircraft proved entirely satisfactory during flight tests.

The first batch equipped the two training schools, as well as serving as demonstration machines; the aircraft, which gained the nickname of the Boxkite, went on to become a commercial success, a total of 76 being constructed. Many served in the company&#x27;s flying schools and examples were sold to the War Office as well as a number of foreign governments.

===1911–1914===
Although satisfactory by the standards of the day, the Boxkite was not capable of much further development and work soon was started on two new designs, a small tractor configuration biplane and a monoplane. Both of these were exhibited at the 1911 Aero Show at Olympia but neither was flown successfully. At this time, both Challenger and Low left the company to join the newly established aircraft division of the armament firm Vickers. Their place was taken by Pierre Prier, the former chief instructor at the Blériot flying school at Hendon: he was later joined by Gordon England. In January 1912 Romanian aircraft engineer Henri Coandă was appointed as the company&#x27;s chief designer.

During early 1912 a highly secret separate design office, known as the &quot;X-Department&quot;, was set up to work on Dennistoun Burney&#x27;s ideas for naval aircraft. Frank Barnwell was taken on as the design engineer for this project, and took over as Bristol&#x27;s chief designer when Coandă left the company in October 1914. Barnwell went on to become one of the world&#x27;s foremost aeronautical engineers, and worked for the company until his death in 1938.

The company expanded rapidly, establishing a second factory at the Brislington tramway works; the firm employed a total of 200 people by the outbreak of the First World War.

===First World War===
At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Britain&#x27;s military forces possessed just over a hundred aircraft and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) consisted of only seven squadrons equipped with a miscellany of aircraft types, none of them armed. Official War Office policy was to purchase only aircraft designed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), and Bristol had already built a number of their B.E.2 two-seater reconnaissance aircraft. However, pressure from the pilots of the RFC and Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) led to orders being placed for a new aircraft manufactured by Bristol, known as the Scout.
In 1915, Barnwell returned from France, his skills as pilot being considered to be of much less value than his ability as a designer. At this time Leslie Frise, newly graduated from Bristol University&#x27;s engineering department, was recruited by Barnwell. In 1916, the company&#x27;s founder Sir George died; he was succeeded in managing the company by his son Stanley.

The first project that was worked on by Barnwell after his return, the Bristol T.T.A., was designed in response to a War Office requirement for a two-seat fighter intended to conduct home defence operations against Zeppelin raids. This was not successful but, in 1916, work was started on the Bristol F.2A, which was developed into the highly successful F.2B Fighter, one of the outstanding aircraft of the 1914–18 war and a mainstay of the RAF during the 1920s. More than 5,300 of the type were produced and the Fighter remained in service until 1931.

Another aircraft designed at this time was the Bristol Monoplane Scout. Although popular with pilots, the success of this aircraft was limited by War Office prejudice against monoplanes and only 130 were built. It was considered that its relatively high landing speed of 50 mph made it unsuitable for use under the field conditions of the Western Front, and the type&#x27;s active service was limited to the Near East.

=== Inter-war years ===

By the end of the war, the company employed over 3,000 at its production works, which were split between Filton and Brislington. Its products had always been referred to by the name &#x27;Bristol&#x27; and this was formalized in 1920, when British and Colonial was liquidated and its assets transferred to the Bristol Aeroplane Company, Ltd. During this time the company, acting under pressure from the Air Ministry, bought the aero-engine division of the bankrupt Cosmos Engineering Company, based in the Bristol suburb of Fishponds, to form the nucleus of a new aero-engine operation.

There was already a good working relationship between Bristol Aircraft and Cosmos, the Cosmos Jupiter having been first flown in a prototype Bristol Badger in May 1919. For £15,000 Bristol got the Cosmos design team, headed by Roy Fedden, along with a small number of completed engines and tooling. Although it was to be several years before Bristol showed any profit from the aero engine division, the Jupiter engine eventually proved enormously successful; indeed, during the inter-war period, the aero-engine division was more successful than the parent company and Bristol came to dominate the market for air-cooled radial engines. Apart from providing engines for almost all Bristol&#x27;s aircraft designs, the Jupiter and its successors powered an enormous number of aircraft built by other manufacturers.
Bristol&#x27;s most successful aircraft during this period was the Bristol Bulldog fighter, which formed the mainstay of Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter force between 1930 and 1937, when the Bulldog was retired from front line service. Since the Bulldog had started life as a private venture rather than an Air Ministry-sponsored prototype it could be sold to other countries, and Bulldogs were exported to, among others, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, and Australia.

During this time, Bristol was noted for its preference for steel airframes, using members built up from high-tensile steel strip rolled into flanged sections rather than the light alloys more generally used in aircraft construction. On 15 June 1935, the Bristol Aeroplane Company became a public limited company. By this time, the company had a payroll of 4,200, mostly in the engine factory, and was well positioned to take advantage of the huge re-armament ordered by the British Government in May of that year. Bristol&#x27;s most important contribution to the expansion of the RAF at this time was the Blenheim light bomber.

In August 1938, Frank Barnwell was killed flying a light aircraft of his own design; Barnwell was succeeded as Bristol&#x27;s Chief Designer by Leslie Frise. By the time war broke out in 1939, the Bristol works at Filton were the largest single aircraft manufacturing unit in the world, with a floor area of nearly 25 hectares (2,691,000 square feet).

=== Second World War ===

During the Second World War, Bristol&#x27;s most important aircraft was the Beaufighter heavy two-seat multirole aircraft, a long-range fighter, night fighter, ground attack aircraft and torpedo bomber. The type was used extensively by the RAF, other Commonwealth air forces and by the USAAF. The Beaufighter was derived from the Beaufort torpedo bomber, itself a derivative of the Blenheim.

In 1940, shadow factories were set up at Weston-super-Mare for the production of Beaufighters, and underground at Hawthorn, near Corsham, Wiltshire, for engine manufacture. Construction in the former stone quarry at Hawthorn took longer than expected and little production was achieved before the site closed in 1945. The company&#x27;s war-time headquarters was located in the Royal West of England Academy, Clifton, Bristol.

=== Post-war ===
When the war ended, Bristol set up a separate helicopter division in the Weston-super-Mare factory, under helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner. This facility was taken over by Westland in 1960.

Other post-war projects included Bristol Cars, which used pre-war BMW designs as the basis for the Bristol 400. Vehicle production was conducted at Patchway, Bristol.

The engine developed for the Bristol 400 found its way into many successful motor cars manufactured by other companies, such as Cooper, Frazer Nash and AC and, in and , powered the Bristol 450 sports prototype to class victories in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. In 1953, S.H. Arnolt, a US car dealer who sold British sports cars, commissioned the Bristol Car Division to build a sports car for the US market, called the Arnolt-Bristol. It is estimated that about 177 were built before production ceased in 1958.
In 1960, Sir George White was instrumental in preventing the car division being lost during the wider company&#x27;s merger with BAC. Accordingly, Bristol Cars Limited was formed, and remained within the Filton complex. Sir George retired in 1973 and Tony Crook purchased his share, becoming sole proprietor and managing director. Pre-fabricated buildings, marine craft and plastic and composite materials were also amongst the company&#x27;s early post-war activities; these side-ventures were independently sold off.

Bristol was involved in the post-war renaissance of British civilian aircraft, which was largely inspired by the Brabazon Committee report of 1943–5. In 1949, the Brabazon airliner prototype, at the time one of the largest aircraft in the world, first flew. This project was deemed to be a step in the wrong direction, gaining little interest from military or civilian operators, resulting in the Brabazon being ultimately cancelled in 1953. At the same time as the termination, Bristol decided to focus on development of a large turboprop-powered airliner, known as the Britannia. Capable of traversing transatlantic routes, it proved a commercial success; both it and the Freighter were produced in quantity during the 1950s. However, sales of the Britannia were poor and only 82 were built, primarily due to its protracted development; having been ordered by BOAC on 28 July 1949 and first flown on 16 August 1952, it did not enter service until 1 February 1957. Bristol was also involved in helicopter development, with the Belvedere and Sycamore going into quantity production.

Another post-war activity was missile development, culminating in the production of the Bloodhound anti-aircraft missile. Upon introduction, the Bloodhound was the RAF&#x27;s only long range transportable surface-to-air missile. Bristol Aero Engines produced a range of rocket motors and ramjets for missile propulsion. The guided weapons division eventually became part of Matra BAe Dynamics Alenia (MBDA).
In the late 1950s, the company undertook supersonic transport (SST) project studies, the Type 223, which were later to contribute to Concorde. A research aircraft, the Type 188, was constructed in the 1950s to test the feasibility of stainless steel as a material in a Mach 2.0 airframe. By the time the aircraft flew in 1962, the company was already part of BAC.

In parallel with these supersonic studies, several subsonic designs were schemed in this period, including the Type 200 (a competitor of the Hawker Siddeley Trident) and its derivatives, the Type 201 and Type 205. None of these designs were built.

=== Merger into BAC ===
In 1959, Bristol was forced by Government policy to merge its aircraft interests with English Electric, Hunting Aircraft, and Vickers-Armstrongs to form the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Bristol formed a holding company which held a 20 per cent share of BAC, while English Electric and Vickers held 40 per cent each.

In 1966, the Bristol holding company which held 20 per cent of BAC and 50 per cent of Bristol Siddeley engines was acquired by Rolls-Royce. Bristol also had the following holdings and subsidiary companies at this time:- Bristol Aerojet (50 per cent) – Bristol Aeroplane Co Australia – Bristol DE Mexico SA (78 per cent) – Motores Bristol De Cuba SA – Bristol Aeroplane Co of Canada – Bristol Aero Industries Ltd – Bristol Aeroplane Co USA – Spartan Air Services Ltd (46.5 per cent) – Bristol Aeroplane Co New Zealand – Bristol Aircraft Services Ltd – Bristol Aeroplane Plastics Ltd – SECA (30 per cent) – Short Bros &amp; Harland (15.25 per cent) – SVENSK-ENGELSK Aero Service AB – TABSA (25 per cent) – Westland Aircraft Ltd (10 per cent).

===The Bristol Aeroplane Company of Canada===
The Canadian Bristol group of companies was the largest of the overseas subsidiaries. The group undertook aircraft handling and servicing at Dorval Airport, Montreal. Vancouver Airport was the base for Bristol Aero Engines (Western), Ltd., one of the Canadian company&#x27;s four operating subsidiaries. Work at Vancouver included the overhaul of Pratt and Whitney and Wright engines for the R.C.A.F. and commercial operators. Bristol Aircraft (Western), Ltd (Stevenson Field, Winnipeg) was formerly MacDonald Brothers Aircraft, and was the largest of the subsidiaries and the group&#x27;s only airframe plant. Bristol de Mexico, S.A. de CV. (Central Airport, Mexico City), overhauled piston engines for South American operators. Bristol de Mexico S.A. obtained a license to manufacture Alfred Herbert Ltd machine tools in 1963 and commenced assembling their centre lathes in 1963. They also commenced building their own design of small engine lathes for the Mexican Government to be installed in training schools throughout Mexico. Malcolm Roebuck was hired from Alfred Herbert Ltd along with William Walford Webb Woodward to supervise this project.

=== Nationalisation ===
In 1977, BAC was nationalised, along with Scottish Aviation and Hawker Siddeley, to form British Aerospace (BAe), which later became part of the now-privatised BAE Systems. The Canadian unit was acquired by Rolls-Royce Holdings and sold in 1997 to current owner Magellan Aerospace.

==Archives==
A small number of records from the early history of this company are held within the papers of Sir George White at Bristol Archives (Ref. 35810/GW/T) (online catalogue). Other records at Bristol Record Office include the papers of Lionel Harris, an engineer at the Bristol Aeroplane Company in the 1940s (Ref. 42794) (online catalogue)

== Bristol Engine Company ==

The Bristol Engine Company was originally a separate entity, Cosmos Engineering, formed from the pre-First World War automobile company Brazil-Straker. In 1917, Cosmos was asked to investigate air-cooled radial engines and, under Roy Fedden, produced what became the Cosmos Mercury, a 14-cylinder two-row (helical) radial, which they launched in 1918. This engine saw little use but the simpler nine-cylinder version known as the Bristol Jupiter was clearly a winning design.

With the post-war rapid contraction of military orders, Cosmos Engineering went bankrupt and the Air Ministry let it be known that it would be a good idea if the Bristol Aeroplane Company purchased it. The Jupiter competed with the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar through the 1920s but Bristol put more effort into their design and, by 1929, the Jupiter was clearly superior. In the 1930s, and led by Roy Fedden, the company developed the new Bristol Perseus line of radials based on the sleeve valve principle, which developed into some of the most powerful piston engines in the world and continued to be sold into the 1960s.

In 1956, the division was renamed Bristol Aero Engines and then merged with Armstrong Siddeley in 1958 to form Bristol Siddeley as a counterpart of the airframe-producing company mergers that formed BAC. Bristol retained a 50% share of the new company, with Hawker Siddeley group holding the other 50%. In 1966, Bristol Siddeley was purchased by Rolls-Royce, leaving the latter as the only major aero-engine company in Britain. From 1967, Bristol Siddeley&#x27;s operations became the &quot;Bristol Engine Division&quot; and the &quot;Small Engine Division&quot; of Rolls-Royce, identified separately from Rolls-Royce&#x27;s existing &quot;Aero Engine Division&quot;. A number of Bristol Siddeley engines continued to be developed under Rolls-Royce including the Olympus turbojet – including the joint development Bristol started with Snecma for Concorde – and the Pegasus. The astronomical names favoured by Bristol indicated their heritage in a Rolls-Royce lineup named after British rivers.

== Helicopter Division ==

The Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s Helicopter Division had its roots in 1944, when the helicopter designer Raoul Hafner, released from the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE), came to Bristol along with some members of his team. Under Hafner&#x27;s direction, the division produced two successful designs that were sold in quantity. The first, designated the Type 171, had a shaky start after the wooden rotor blades of the second prototype failed on its first flight in 1949. Nevertheless, the Type 171, called Sycamore in military service, was sold to air forces around the world and 178 were built in total.

After the Type 171, the Bristol Helicopter Division started work on a tandem rotor civil helicopter. The result was the 13-seat Type 173, which made its first flight in Filton in 1952. Five examples were built for evaluation purposes. Although no airlines ordered the Type 173, it led to military designs, of which the Type 192 went into service with the RAF as the Belvedere. First flying in 1958, 26 were built in total.

Pursuing the idea of a civil tandem rotor helicopter, Hafner and his team developed a much larger design, the Type 194. This was in an advanced state of design when the Bristol Helicopter Division was merged, as a result of government influence, with the helicopter interests of other British aircraft manufacturers (Westland, Fairey and Saunders-Roe) to form Westland Helicopters in 1960. When the competing Westland Westminster was cancelled, the management of the combined company allowed development of the Type 194 to continue, but it too failed to find a market.

The Helicopter Division started out at the main Bristol Aeroplane Company site in Filton, but from 1955 it was moved to the Oldmixon factory in Weston-Super-Mare, which had built Blenheims during the War. The factory is now the site of The Helicopter Museum.

==Products==
Bristol did not systematically assign project type numbers until 1923, starting with the Type 90 Berkeley. In that year, they also retrospectively assigned type numbers in chronological order to all projects, built or not, from August 1914 onwards. Thus the Scouts A and B did not get a type number but the Scout C did and was the Type 1. The final Bristol project, numbered Type 225, was an unbuilt 1962 STOL transport. Of these 225 Types, 117 were built. This list does not include the unbuilt &quot;paper aeroplanes&quot;; it does include the pre-August 1914 aircraft.

=== Aircraft turrets ===
Bristol began producing gun turrets with its Bristol Type 120 submission for an Air Ministry specification. The turret was a glazed cupola over a Scarff ring mounted Lewis light machine gun. Although it had to be rotated manually, it provided protection from the slipstream for the air gunner. and similar turrets were fitted to the Bristol Bombay.
The first powered turrets by Bristol used hydraulics. In the B.II nose turret and B.III tail turret, a Vickers K machine gun mounted in a narrow horizontal strip was linked to gunsight. A ram rotated the strip and hence the gun horizontally, the glazing remaining stationary.

The Bristol Type B.1 was more typical of later gun turret designs; the gun elevating through a slot in the glazing which rotated. The Type B.1 had two distinct features; the cupola could be lowered reducing drag and, though the single gun was centrally aligned, the gun cradle could be pivoted independently of the turret. The latter meant that the turret could be turned with sufficient offset that the gunner could fire along the side of the rudder and engage targets directly astern. The Type B.1 was fitted to Bristol Blenheim and Beaufort, and to the Avro Anson and Fairey Battle (with two Browning machine guns) when they were used as gunnery trainers.

The Type B.IV was a lightweight (66 kg) turret designed specifically for the Beaufort mid-upper position with one (B.IV Mk 1) or two (B.IV Mk 1E) Vickers K machine guns

Type X was a two 0.303-in Browning machine gun turret for the Blenheim Mk V.to replace the earlier design.

The Type B.11 was a four gun turret developed in 1940. It was intended for a dorsal position on a Beaufighter but the design was not put into position though it was also considered for the Douglas Boston and de Havilland Mosquito too.

The Type B.12 was another four gun dorsal turret, this time designed for the Bristol Buckingham. A particular requirement was that when not in use, crew could pass through the turret space to reach the bombardier position. It was successfully tested then redesigned to take two 0.5-inch Browning heavy machine guns as the Mark II variant. The Mark IV had two 0.303 guns. 

The B.12 &quot;Mark III&quot; was a test of using electrical rather than hydraulic system to operate the turret; the system proved effective was adopted on the later B.16, B.17, B.18 and B.30 turrets.

A second turret was developed for the Buckingham to cover the rear below the aircraft. It was mounted at the back of the gondola type bomb aimer position under the fuselage and fitted with two Browning machine guns.

The &quot;B.14&quot; designation was used for a four gun remote controlled nose mounting rather than a turret. Another design intended for the Buckingham it was included on the pre-production mockup but not developed further.

<text>Margaret Lenny &quot;Maggie&quot; Simpson
is a fictional character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and the youngest member of the Simpson family. She first appeared on television in the &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot; on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks&#x27; office. She received her first name from Groening&#x27;s youngest sister. After appearing on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox Broadcasting Company which debuted December 17, 1989.

Maggie is the youngest child of Homer and Marge, and the younger sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not yet learned how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short.

Though she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show&#x27;s creator, Matt Groening, and early producer Gábor Csupó. Maggie&#x27;s occasional speaking parts and other vocalizations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars Carol Kane, James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; including video games, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride, commercials and comic books.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age (or if they do, then very slowly), and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and younger sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney&#x27;s Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.

During the earlier seasons of the show, Maggie&#x27;s equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has a penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.

Maggie has performed a number of feats that for her age suggest she is highly intelligent, akin to her sister, and possibly a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer&#x27;s car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, spelled words with her baby blocks, shot Mr. Burns, played Lisa&#x27;s saxophone, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, the rest of the Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie&#x27;s maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of &quot;Itchy and Scratchy&quot;. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot; where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, though whether or not it was intentional is not clear, and in a deliberate manner during &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.

Maggie is usually frightened and exasperated by Homer&#x27;s attempts to bond with her, but has on several occasions stepped in to save Homer&#x27;s life: once from drowning, once from being shot by mobsters, once from being kidnapped by a tow truck driver, and once from being shot by Russ Cargill, head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

==History==

===Character===

====Creation====

Matt Groening conceived Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of James L. Brooks&#x27;s office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and had intended to present an adaptation of his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strip. When he realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require him to rescind publication rights for his life&#x27;s work, Groening decided to go in another direction, and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. The baby of the family was named Maggie after Groening&#x27;s youngest sister. Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987, in the short &quot;Good Night&quot;. In 1989, the shorts were adapted into &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie and the rest of the family remained the main characters on this new show.

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie&#x27;s physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered to even think about girls&#x27; hair styles&quot;. At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he &quot;just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color&quot;.

Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie&#x27;s comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters&#x27; dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.

====Voice====

With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but participates in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie&#x27;s first lines were spoken in &quot;Good Night&quot;, the first short to air on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, after the family falls asleep. On this occasion, Liz Georges provided the voice of Maggie.
Rather than talking, Maggie is well known for producing a characteristic &quot;sucking&quot; sound from her pacifier. This sound effect was originally provided by the show&#x27;s creator Matt Groening, for early episodes of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and also by Gabor Csupo (who was also the animation executive producer, for the first 60 episodes). The sucking noise is heard in all of Maggie&#x27;s appearances to date, and is usually archive audio from either of Groening or Csupo&#x27;s initial recordings (from the show&#x27;s early episodes). Other than her sucking noise, Maggie has been known to make other noises, such as occasional squeals and babbling. In most instances, these vocalisations are provided by either Nancy Cartwright or Yeardley Smith.

Although she had previously spoken in fantasies and dream sequences, such as in &quot;Bart vs. Thanksgiving&quot;, in which she was voiced by an uncredited Carol Kane, Maggie&#x27;s first word spoken in the normal continuity of the series occurred in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;, when she was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor. Although it was only one word (&quot;Daddy&quot;), Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied. James Earl Jones voiced Maggie in &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;. Maggie would later have brief dialogue in &quot;Treehouse of Horror IX&quot;, voiced by Harry Shearer, who used his Kang voice. In earlier episodes, Yeardley Smith did many of Maggie&#x27;s squeaks, cries, laughs and occasional speaking parts, although in the later seasons her parts are done by Nancy Cartwright (including a single word spoken during the end credits of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;). Jodie Foster voiced a Howard Roark-inspired Maggie in the season 20 episode &quot;Four Great Women and a Manicure&quot;. Amy Sedaris voiced Maggie in the season 36 episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, voicing a line that was originally done by Cartwright before being re-cast and re-recorded at the last minute.
==Reception==

Maggie has received both popular and critical acclaim. Nancy Basile at About.com said her favorite Maggie scenes on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are the ones that show her acting more like an adult than a one-year-old. Some of her favorite Maggie scenes include scenes from &quot;Sweet Seymour Skinner&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; and &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot; where Maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy, Baby Gerald, and the one scene from &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie&quot; in which Bart is supposed to babysit Maggie, but she escapes and takes Homer&#x27;s car for a ride. Basile also added that &quot;whether watching &#x27;The Happy Elves&#x27; or falling down, Maggie is the cutest baby in the Simpson family&quot;. Comedian Ricky Gervais named &quot;And Maggie Makes Three&quot; his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where Homer puts up pictures of Maggie over his desk gave him &quot;a lump in the throat thinking about it&quot;. Todd Everett at &quot;Variety&quot; called the scene in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot; where Maggie speaks her first word &quot;quite a heart-melter&quot;.

In 2006, Elizabeth Taylor was named thirteenth on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances&quot; list for her performance as Maggie in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;. James Earl Jones, voice of Maggie in &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;, was named the seventh greatest guest star on the show in the same list. In 2000, Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Merchandising==
Four children&#x27;s books, written by Maggie Groening (after whom Maggie was named) and illustrated by Matt Groening, entitled &quot;Maggie Simpson&#x27;s Book of Animals&quot;, &quot;Maggie Simpson&#x27;s Counting Book&quot;, &quot;Maggie Simpson&#x27;s Book of Colors and Shapes&quot; and &quot;Maggie Simpson&#x27;s Alphabet Book&quot; were released on September 12, 1991. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, jigsaw puzzles, and T-shirts. Maggie was made into an action figure as part of the &quot;World of Springfield&quot; toy line, and was released in the wave one playset &quot;Living Room&quot;, featuring her and Marge in the living room of the Simpsons house. Maggie has appeared in commercials for Burger King, Butterfinger, C.C. Lemon, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Ramada Inn and Subway.

Maggie has appeared in other media relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She is a character in every one of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; video games, including the most recent, &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;. Alongside the television series, Maggie regularly appeared in issues of Simpsons comics, which were published from 1993 until 2018. Maggie also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Maggie and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. In a USPS poll, Maggie&#x27;s stamp was voted the most popular of the five.

== &quot;Maggie Simpson in…&quot; ==
&quot;Maggie Simpson in…&quot; is a series of animated short-films. It currently consists of four films. The movies put Maggie at the center of the story, unlike most episodes of the show itself. All the films retain the theme of the first film – Maggie&#x27;s journey to day care (or in the case of &quot;Playdate with Destiny&quot;, the playground).

Maggie starred in the 3D short-film &quot;The Longest Daycare&quot;, which was shown in theaters before &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot; in 2012.

Maggie also starred in the 3D short-film &quot;Playdate with Destiny&quot;, which was shown in theaters before &quot;Onward&quot; in 2020.

In 2021, a short film called &quot;The Force Awakens from Its Nap&quot; was released to celebrate &quot;Star Wars&quot; Day.

Two years later (in 2023), another short film celebrating &quot;Star Wars&quot; was released, titled &quot;Rogue Not Quite One.&quot; And again later in 2024 with &quot;May the 12th Be with You.&quot;

<doc id="64277" wikidata="Q5846" url="?curid=64277" title="Lisa Simpson">
<text>Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television sitcom series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She is the middle child of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot; on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic &quot;Life in Hell&quot;, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the older Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; for three years, the Simpson family were moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989.

Intelligent, kind, and passionate about the planet and all living things, Lisa Simpson is the second child of Homer and Marge. She is the younger sister of Bart, and the older sister of Maggie, at age 8. Lisa&#x27;s high intellect and left-wing political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age; therefore she is a bit of a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegan, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa&#x27;s character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7, converts to Buddhism in season 13, and becomes a vegan in season 32. A strong liberal and activist for peace, equality, and the environment, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes (e.g. standing against apartheid in South Africa and supporting the Tibetan independence movement) which sets her against most of the people in Springfield. However, she can also be somewhat intolerant of opinions that differ from her own, often refusing to consider alternative perspectives and showing a feeling of self-righteousness. In her free time, Lisa enjoys many hobbies such as reading and playing the baritone saxophone. She has appeared in other media relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; – including video games, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and inspired a line of merchandise.

Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while Nancy Cartwright (who was later cast as the voice for Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith&#x27;s voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. In the &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; shorts, Lisa was something of a &quot;female Bart&quot; who mirrored her brother&#x27;s mischief, but as the series progressed she became a liberal voice of reason which has drawn both praise and criticism from fans of the show. Because of her unusual pointed hairstyle, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult &quot;Simpsons&quot; character to draw.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked her 11th (tied with Bart) on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot;. Her environmentalism has been especially well-received; several episodes featuring her have won Genesis and Environmental Media Awards, including a special &quot;board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award&quot; in 2001. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals included Lisa on their list of the &quot;Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time&quot;. Yeardley Smith won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age. The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Lisa&#x27;s year of birth is given in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot; (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics. The episode &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot; (season 19, 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s. Despite this, Lisa is portrayed as being 8 years old. Lisa is a lover of music, with jazz as her favorite genre; she specifically singles out Miles Davis&#x27;s 1957 album &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; as her favorite album. She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, whom she regards as an idol. Murphy helps pull Lisa out of her depression in &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; (season 1, 1990). She is later deeply saddened by Murphy&#x27;s death in &#x27;Round Springfield&quot; (season 6, 1995).

Lisa has had a few brief relationships with boys, including Ralph Wiggum in &quot;I Love Lisa&quot; (season 4, 1993), Nelson Muntz in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density&quot; (season 8, 1996) and Colin in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007). Bart&#x27;s best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her, but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his feelings, he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection. Her voice actor Yeardley Smith said Muntz would make a good match for Lisa. In 2019, &quot;Simpsons&quot; showrunner Al Jean said he saw Lisa as being &quot;possibly polyamorous&quot; in the future. In the Season 23 episode &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; Lisa is shown holding hands with an unnamed dark-haired woman in a photo, and then shown in a second photo where she is holding hands with two different women at once, suggesting polyamory; she later ends up with Milhouse. However, this episode is non-canon.

Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes. Lisa is often the focus of episodes with &quot;a real moral or philosophical point&quot;, which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because &quot;you really buy her as caring about it.&quot; Lisa&#x27;s political convictions are generally left-wing and liberal and she often contests other&#x27;s views. She is a vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights, universal healthcare, and the Free Tibet movement. In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the Cornish language to get her message across. While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode &quot;She of Little Faith&quot; (season 13, 2001) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path.

==Character==
===Creation===
Matt Groening conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks&#x27;s office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and had intended to present an adaptation of his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strip. When he realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction, hurriedly sketching his version of a dysfunctional family, named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening&#x27;s younger sister, but little else was based on her. In &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; shorts, Lisa displayed none of the intelligence for which she later became known. She was more of a &quot;female Bart&quot; and was originally described as simply the &quot;middle child&quot;, without much personality.

Lisa made her brief debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot;. On December 17th 1989, the shorts were adapted into &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company.

===Design===

The entire Simpson family was designed to be easily recognized in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Lisa&#x27;s physical features are generally unique. In some early episodes, minor background characters occasionally had a similar hairline. However, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline. While designing Lisa, Groening &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered to even think about girls&#x27; hairstyles&quot;. At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white; when designing Lisa and Maggie, he &quot;just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color&quot;.

To draw Lisa&#x27;s head and hair, most of the show&#x27;s animators use what they call the &quot;three-three-two arrangement&quot;. It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the back of her head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it. Several &quot;Simpsons&quot; animators, including Pete Michels and David Silverman, consider Lisa the most difficult &quot;Simpsons&quot; character to draw. Silverman explains that &quot;her head is so abstract&quot; due to her hairstyle.

===Voice===
While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of the &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; cast, the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character&#x27;s bland description—Lisa was described simply as the &quot;middle child&quot;—and read for the role of Bart instead. Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play &quot;Living on Salvation Street&quot;. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her to give it a try. Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: &quot;I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, &#x27;Thanks for coming!&#x27;&quot; Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead.

Smith and the show&#x27;s writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality, and she has developed greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot;, Cartwright wrote: &quot;with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your-eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be but also the kind of child we want &quot;all&quot; children to be. But, at the time, on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality.&quot;

Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, who raises the pitch of her voice slightly for the role. In some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie&#x27;s squeaks and occasional speaking parts, and has voiced other characters on very rare occasions. Usually they are derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in &quot;Last Tap Dance in Springfield&quot; (season 11, 2000) and Lisa, Jr. in &quot;&quot;. (season 11, 2000)

Despite Lisa&#x27;s fame, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind. She said, &quot;it&#x27;s wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognize me solely from my voice.&quot; In a 2009 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; she commented that &quot;It&#x27;s the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has bought me in my life.&quot; Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying &quot;there&#x27;s part of me that feels it wasn&#x27;t even a real Emmy.&quot; The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. &quot;If I had to be associated with one character in fiction,&quot; she said, &quot;I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson.&quot; Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: &quot;Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. Some lines are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, &#x27;No, I wouldn&#x27;t say that.&#x27;&quot; Former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, as able &quot;to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic.&quot;

Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. A pay dispute erupted in 1998, during which Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was soon resolved, and Smith received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors sought an increase to $360,000 per episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned $250,000 per episode. New salary negotiations took place in 2008, and the voice actors currently receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

===Development===

In &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; shorts, Lisa was something of a &quot;female Bart&quot;: equally mischievous but lacking unique traits. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character. She demonstrates her intellect in the 1990 episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; (season one), by helping Bart reveal Sideshow Bob&#x27;s plot to frame Krusty the Clown for armed robbery. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, such as &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; (season one, 1990). The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who wanted to do an emotional episode involving Lisa&#x27;s sadness, to complement the many &quot;jokey episodes&quot; in the first season.

In the seventh-season episode &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot; (1995), Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian, distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice. The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit), who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer David Mirkin, who had recently become a vegetarian himself, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa&#x27;s experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin&#x27;s own experiences. The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney, a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney&#x27;s condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show. In the season 13 episode &quot;She of Little Faith&quot; (2001), Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism.

Lisa plays the baritone saxophone, and some episodes use that as a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, &quot;But she doesn&#x27;t always play a baritone sax because the animators don&#x27;t know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show.&quot; One of the hallmarks of the show&#x27;s opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second-grade level and instead &quot;think of Lisa as a really good player.&quot;

===Personality===
Lisa, despite being a child prodigy, often sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family and other children due to possessing an unusually high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;, an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father&#x27;s roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Like most children her age, she thinks in images rather than words. Episodes often take shots at Lisa&#x27;s idealism. In &quot;Bart Star&quot; (season nine, 1997), Lisa, who is departing from her typically more genuine nature and apparently looking for a new cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is &quot;not really [her] thing&quot;. She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig&#x27;s skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.

Lisa is said to have an IQ of 159, and in &quot;They Saved Lisa&#x27;s Brain&quot; (season ten, 1999) she becomes a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa. Even prior to becoming a Buddhist, Lisa at times is seen meditating. When unable to attend school due to a teachers&#x27; strike in &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot; (season six, 1995), she suffers withdrawal symptoms because of the sudden lack of praise. She even demands that her mother grade her for no obvious reason. In &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, Chris Turner writes that these traits make Lisa more realistic because &quot;No character can aspire to realism without a few all-too-human flaws.&quot;

Although she is wise beyond her years, Lisa has typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. One episode to show this is &quot;See Homer Run&quot; (season seventeen, 2005) where she goes through a developmental condition which causes her to get into trouble at school. In &quot;Lost Our Lisa&quot; (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father. Chris Turner writes in &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; that incidents like this illustrate that &quot;Even when Lisa&#x27;s lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child&#x27;s body.&quot; In &quot;The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D&#x27;oh! of Homer&quot;, Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; along with Bart. He writes, &quot;One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she&#x27;s &#x27;no better [than the rest of us]&#x27;.&quot; Lisa occasionally worries that her family&#x27;s dull habits will rub off on her, such as in &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot; (season nine, 1998) she worries that the &quot;Simpson gene&quot; will make her a dimwit later finding out the gene only goes through the male side.
She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; that &quot;Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit ... but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment.&quot; Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé. In the episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot; (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time. Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa&#x27;s intelligence.

===Sexuality===
Lisa&#x27;s sexuality has become the subject of speculation amongst viewers of the show. Lisa is shown to have heterosexual crushes on Nelson Muntz and Langdon Alger in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density&quot; and &quot;Bart on the Road&quot; respectively. In some episodes Lisa is shown to have a boyfriend, such as Edmund Dracula in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXI&quot; or Colin in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Lisa becomes engaged to, and later almost marries, Hugh Parkfield in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and the episode &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; suggests that Lisa will go on to marry Milhouse Van Houten. However, &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; also show Lisa being in both a monogamous, and later polyamorous, lesbian relationships. 

Although Lisa&#x27;s sexuality has never been confirmed on screen, showrunner Al Jean said in a 2019 interview with &quot;The Metro&quot; that he had always envisaged for Lisa to grow up to become bisexual and polyamorous. In a 2020 interview with the &quot;Stryker &amp; Klein show&quot; on KROQ Radio, Yeardley Smith said that she believed that Lisa was &quot;still exploring her sexuality&quot;. Smith also asked fans to stop speculating on Lisa&#x27;s sexuality, as she was &quot;ultimately an eight-year old girl&quot;.

==Reception==
===Commendations===

Lisa has been a popular character since the show&#x27;s inception. She was listed at number 11 (tied with Bart) in &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time.&quot; She appeared in Comcast&#x27;s list of TV&#x27;s Most Intriguing Characters and was also included in AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. On a less positive note, she was ranked third in AskMen&#x27;s top 10 of the most irritating &#x27;90s cartoon characters. Yeardley Smith has won several awards for voicing Lisa, including a Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Voice-Over Performance&quot; in 1992 for &quot;Lisa the Greek&quot;. Various episodes in which Lisa stars have won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including &quot;Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment&quot; in 1991, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; in 1995 and &quot;HOMR&quot; in 2001. In 2000, Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

Lisa&#x27;s environmentalism has been especially well received. In 2001, Lisa received a special &quot;board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award&quot; at the Environmental Media Awards. &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot; won both an Environmental Media Award for &quot;Best Television Episodic Comedy&quot; and a Genesis Award for &quot;Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment&quot;. Several other episodes that feature Lisa speaking out in favor of animal rights have won Genesis Awards, including &quot;Whacking Day&quot; in 1994, &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot; in 1995, &quot;Million Dollar Abie&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Apocalypse Cow&quot; in 2009.

===Cultural influence===
Jonathan Gray, author of the book &quot;Watching The Simpsons&quot;, feels that Lisa &quot;is probably the best and certainly longest-running feminist character that television has had. She&#x27;s the heart of the show and she quite often questions gender politics.&quot; Christopher Borrelli of &quot;The Toledo Blade&quot; wrote, &quot;Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note – a know-it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world.&quot;

According to PETA, Lisa was one of the first vegetarian characters on primetime television. In 2004 the organization included Lisa on its list of the &quot;Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time&quot;. In 2008, environmentalist website The Daily Green honored Lisa&#x27;s role in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; with one of its inaugural &quot;Heart of Green&quot; awards, which &quot;recognize those who have helped green go mainstream.&quot; They wrote &quot;young Lisa Simpson has inspired a generation to wear their hearts on their sleeves and get educated, and involved, about global issues, from justice to feminism and the environment.&quot; Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa. Lisa&#x27;s well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences. Mario D&#x27;Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at Rollins College in Florida, described Lisa as &quot;open-minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a childlike sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions.&quot;

Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons have had a significant influence on English-language idioms. The dismissive term &quot;meh&quot;—used by Lisa and popularized by the show— entered the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; in 2008. In 1996, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article saying that Lisa was inspiring children, especially young girls, to learn to play the saxophone.

Lisa Simpson was mentioned at the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference when Senator Ted Cruz called the Democratic Party &quot;The Party of Lisa Simpson&quot;, as opposed to the Republican Party being the party of several other family members.

&quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; and &quot;The Monkey Suit&quot; are episodes of The Simpsons that delve into themes of skepticism, religion, and science. These episodes demonstrate the show&#x27;s commitment to encouraging critical thinking and questioning of established beliefs, while also acknowledging the complexities and challenges that arise in such discussions. Despite occasional missteps, The Simpsons has provided a platform for exploring these important topics in an entertaining and thought-provoking manner.

===Merchandising===
Lisa has been included in many &quot;The Simpsons&quot; publications, toys, and other merchandise. &quot;The Lisa Book&quot;, describing Lisa&#x27;s personality and attributes, was released in 2006. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, bobblehead dolls, mugs, and clothing such as slippers, T-shirts, baseball caps, and boxer shorts. Lisa has appeared in commercials for Burger King, C.C. Lemon, Church&#x27;s Chicken, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Ramada Inn, Ritz Crackers, Subway and Butterfinger.

On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Lisa and the four other members of the nuclear Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, went on sale in May 2009.

Lisa has also appeared in other media relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She has appeared in each &quot;Simpsons&quot; video game, including &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;, released in 2007. In addition to the television series, Lisa regularly appeared in issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, which were published from 1993 until 2018. The comics focus on the sweeter, more naïve incarnation from the early seasons. Lisa also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

<text>The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world&#x27;s oldest extant professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) of 1871–1875 (often called simply the &quot;National Association&quot;), the NL is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB&#x27;s other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later and is called the &quot;Junior Circuit&quot;. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. 

The National League survived competition from various other professional baseball leagues during the late 19th century. Most did not last for more than a few seasons, with a handful of teams joining the NL once their leagues folded. The American League declared itself a second major league in 1901, and the AL and NL engaged in a &quot;baseball war&quot; during 1901 and 1902 before agreeing to a &quot;peace pact&quot; that recognized each other as legitimate &quot;major leagues&quot;. As part of this agreement, the leagues agreed to respect player contracts, establish rules about relationships with minor league clubs, and allow their champions to meet in a &quot;World Series&quot; to decide the overall professional baseball championship. National League teams have won 52 of the 120 World Series championships contested from 1903 to 2024.

For decades, Major League baseball clubs only played teams from their own league during the regular season and most of the playoffs, with only their champions facing off in the World Series. This separation gradually caused the leagues to develop slightly different strategies and styles of play. The National League was long considered the more &quot;traditional&quot; league, a reputation most exemplified by the NL&#x27;s more prevalent use of &quot;smallball&quot; tactics and lack of a designated hitter rule, which the AL implemented in 1973. However, with the advent of free agency in the 1970s allowing for more player movement between leagues, and the introduction of regular season interleague play in 1997, the difference in play between the two major leagues has diminished considerably. The NL&#x27;s adoption of the designated hitter rule in , and the expansion of interleague play to 46 games beginning in , has further blurred the lines between leagues. 

Though both leagues agreed to be jointly governed by a commissioner in 1920, they remained separate legal and business entities with their own president and management. This was the case until after the 1999 season, when the National League legally merged with the American League under the auspices of Major League Baseball, which now operates much like other North American professional sports leagues, albeit with two &quot;leagues&quot; instead of &quot;conferences&quot;.

==History==
===Foundation===
By 1875, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP, often referred to as the &quot;National Association&quot;), founded four years earlier, was suffering from a lack of strong authority over clubs, unsupervised scheduling, unstable membership of cities, dominance by one team (the Boston Red Stockings), and an extremely low entry fee ($10) that gave clubs no incentive to abide by league rules when it was inconvenient to them.

William A. Hulbert (1832–1882), a Chicago businessman and an officer of the Chicago White Stockings of 1870–1889, approached several NA clubs with the plans for a professional league for the sport of baseball with a stronger central authority and exclusive territories in larger cities only. Additionally, Hulbert had a problem: five of his star players were threatened with expulsion from the NAPBBP because Hulbert had signed them to his club using what were considered questionable means. Hulbert had a great vested interest in creating his own league, and after recruiting St. Louis privately, four western clubs met in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1876. With Hulbert speaking for the five later in New York City on February 2, 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was established with eight charter members, as follows:
* Chicago (&quot;Chicago White Stockings&quot;) (according to &quot;The Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;″s retroactive naming convention) from the NA (now the Chicago Cubs, not to be confused with the current Chicago White Sox of the American League)
* Athletic Club of Philadelphia (&quot;Philadelphia Athletics&quot;) from the NA (expelled after the 1876 season)
* Boston (&quot;Boston Red Stockings&quot;), the dominant team in the NA (later the Boston Braves, then the Milwaukee Braves, now the Atlanta Braves, not to be confused with the present-day Boston Red Sox of the later American League)
* Hartford (&quot;Hartford Dark Blues&quot;) from the NA (folded after the 1877 season)
* Mutual Club of New York (&quot;New York Mutuals&quot;) from the NA (expelled after the 1876 season)
* St. Louis (&quot;St. Louis Brown Stockings&quot;) from the NA (folded after the 1877 season, having committed to Louisville Stars for 1878)
* Cincinnati (&quot;Cincinnati Reds&quot;), a new franchise (disbanded after the 1879 season)
* Louisville (&quot;Louisville Grays&quot;), a new franchise (folded after the 1877 season when four players were banned for gambling)

The National League&#x27;s formation meant the end of the old National Association after only five seasons, as its remaining clubs shut down or reverted to amateur or minor league status. The only strong club from 1875 excluded in 1876 was a second one in Philadelphia, often called the White Stockings or later Phillies.

The first game in National League history was played on April 22, 1876, at Philadelphia&#x27;s Jefferson Street Grounds, at 25th &amp; Jefferson Streets, between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston baseball club. Boston won the game 6–5.

The new league&#x27;s authority was soon tested after the first season. The Athletic and Mutual clubs fell behind in the standings and refused to make western road trips late in the season, preferring to play games against local non-league competition to recoup some of their financial losses rather than travel extensively incurring more costs. Hulbert reacted to the clubs&#x27; defiance by expelling them, an act which not only shocked baseball followers and the sports world (since New York and Philadelphia were the two most populous cities in the league), but made it clear to clubs that league scheduling commitments, a cornerstone of competitive integrity, were not to be ignored.

The National League operated with only six clubs during 1877 and 1878. Over the next several years, various teams joined and left the struggling league. By 1880, six of the eight charter members had folded. The two remaining original NL franchises, Boston and Chicago, remain still in operation today as the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. When all eight participants for 1881 returned for 1882—the first off-season without turnover in membership—the &quot;circuit&quot; consisted of a zig-zag line connecting the eight cities: Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Troy (near the state capital of Albany, New York), Worcester (Massachusetts), Boston, and Providence.

In 1883, new New York and Philadelphia clubs began National League play. Both teams remain in the NL today, the Phillies in their original city and the New York franchise (later named Giants) now in San Francisco since 1958.

===Competition with other leagues===
The NL encountered its first strong rival organization when the American Association began play in 1882. The AA played in cities where the NL did not have teams, offered Sunday games and alcoholic beverages in locales where permitted, and sold cheaper tickets everywhere (25 cents versus the NL&#x27;s standard 50 cents, a hefty sum for many in 1882). The NL struck back by establishing new clubs in 1883 in AA cities Philadelphia (later called &quot;Phillies&quot;) and New York (the team that would become the Giants).

The National League and the American Association participated in a version of the World Series seven times during their ten-year coexistence. These contests were less organized than the modern Series, lasting as few as three games and as many as fifteen, with two Series (1885 and 1890) ending in disputed ties. The NL won four times and the AA only once, in 1886.

Starting with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1887, the National League began to raid the American Association for franchises to replace NL teams that folded. This undercut the stability of the AA.

Other new leagues that rose to compete with the National League were the Union Association and the Players&#x27; League. The Union Association was established in 1884 and folded after playing only one season, its league champion St. Louis Maroons joining the NL. The Players&#x27; League was established in 1890 by the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the sport&#x27;s first players&#x27; union, which had failed to persuade the NL to modify its labor practices, including a salary cap and a reserve clause that bound players to their teams indefinitely. The NL suffered many defections of star players to the Players&#x27; League, but the P.L. collapsed after one season. The Brooklyn, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York franchises of the NL absorbed their Players&#x27; League counterparts.

===Expansion (1887–1899)===
The labor strike of 1890 hastened the downfall of the American Association. After the 1891 season, the AA disbanded and merged with the NL, which became known legally for the next decade as the &quot;National League and American Association&quot;. The teams now known as the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers (originally Brooklyn) and Pittsburgh Pirates (as well as the now-defunct Cleveland Spiders) had already switched from the AA to the NL prior to 1892. With the merger, the NL absorbed the St. Louis Browns (now known as the St. Louis Cardinals), along with three other teams that did not survive into the 20th century—the Baltimore Orioles (not the current MLB team), Louisville Colonels, and Washington Statesmen.

While four teams that moved from the AA remain in the NL today (Pittsburgh [1887], Cincinnati [1890], Los Angeles [originally Brooklyn; 1890], and St. Louis [1892]), only two original NL franchises (1876) remain in the league: the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves (originally in Boston, and later Milwaukee). The Cubs are the only charter member to play continuously in the same city. The other two pre-1892 teams still in the league are the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants (originally New York), both of which joined in 1883.

The National League became a 12-team circuit with monopoly status for the rest of the decade. The league became embroiled in numerous internal conflicts, not the least of which was a plan supported by some owners (and bitterly opposed by others) to form a &quot;trust&quot;, wherein there would be one common ownership of all twelve teams. The NL used its monopsony power to force a $2,400 ($ today) limit on annual player wages in 1894.

As the 20th century dawned, the NL was in trouble. Conduct among players was poor, and fistfights were a common sight at games. In addition to fighting each other, they fought with the umpires and often filled the air at games with foul language and obscenities. A game between the Orioles and Boston Beaneaters (a precursor to today&#x27;s Atlanta Braves) in 1894 ended up having tragic consequences when players became engaged in a brawl and several boys in the stands of the South End Grounds started a fire. The blaze quickly got out of hand and swept through downtown Boston, destroying or damaging 100 buildings. Team owners argued with each other, and players hated the NL&#x27;s $2,400 salary cap. Many teams also ran into trouble with city governments that forbade recreational activities on Sunday.

Billy Sunday, a prominent outfielder in the 1880s, became so disgusted with the behavior of teammates that he quit playing in 1891 to become one of America&#x27;s most famous evangelical Christian preachers. Most fans appear to have felt the same way, because attendance at games was plummeting by 1900.

===Partnership with the American League===
After eight seasons as a 12-team league, the NL contracted back to eight teams for the 1900 season, eliminating its teams in Baltimore, Cleveland, Louisville (which has never had another major league team since), and Washington. This provided an opportunity for competition. Three of those cities received franchises in the newly christened American League (AL) when the minor Western League changed its name to the AL in 1900, with the approval of the NL, which regarded the AL as a lesser league since they were a party to the National Agreement. The AL declined to renew its National Agreement membership when it expired the next year, and on January 28, 1901, the AL officially declared itself a second major league in competition with the NL. By 1903, the upstart AL had placed new teams in the National League cities of Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, as well as the &quot;abandoned&quot; NL cities Cleveland and Washington (and, temporarily, Baltimore). Only the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates had no AL team in their markets. The AL among other things enforced a strict conduct policy among its players.

The National League at first refused to recognize the new league, but reality set in as talent and money was split between the two leagues, diluting the league and decreasing financial success. After two years of bitter contention, a new version of the National Agreement was signed in 1903. This meant formal acceptance of each league by the other as an equal partner in major-league baseball, mutual respect of player contracts, and an agreement to play a postseason championship—the World Series.

Major League Baseball narrowly averted radical reorganization in November 1920. Dissatisfied with American League President and National Baseball Commission head Ban Johnson, NL owners dissolved the league on November 8 during heated talks on MLB reorganization in the wake of the Black Sox Scandal. Simultaneously, three AL teams also hostile to Johnson (Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees) withdrew from the AL and joined the eight NL teams in forming a new National League; the 12th team would be whichever of the remaining five AL teams loyal to Johnson first chose to join; if none did so an expansion team would have been placed in Detroit, by far the largest one-team city at that time. Four days later, on November 12, both sides met (without Johnson) and agreed to restore the two leagues and replace the ineffective National Commission with a one-man Commissioner in the person of federal Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

The National League circuit remained unchanged from 1900 through 1952. In 1953 the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee; in 1966 they moved again, to Atlanta. In 1958 the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing major league baseball to the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time.

===Divisional reorganization===
The NL remained an eight-team league for over 60 years. (For the eight teams, see Expansion (1887–1899) above, and &quot;Classic Eight&quot; below.) In 1962—facing competition from the proposed Continental League and confronted by the American League&#x27;s unilateral expansion in 1961—the NL expanded by adding the New York Mets and the Houston Colt .45s. The &quot;Colts&quot; were renamed the Houston Astros three years later. In 1969, the league added the San Diego Padres and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), becoming a 12-team league for the first time since 1899.

In 1969, as a result of its expansion to 12 teams, the National League—which for its first 93 years had competed equally in a single grouping—was reorganized into two divisions of six teams (respectively named the National League East and West, although geographically it was more like North and South), with the division champions meeting in the National League Championship Series (an additional round of postseason competition) for the right to advance to the World Series.

In 1993 the league expanded to 14 teams, adding the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins (which became the Miami Marlins shortly after the end of the 2011 season). In 1998, the Arizona Diamondbacks became the league&#x27;s fifteenth franchise, and the Milwaukee Brewers moved from the AL to the NL, giving the NL 16 teams for the next 15 seasons.

In 1994, the league was again reorganized, into three geographical divisions (East, West and Central, all currently with five teams; from 1994 to 1997 the West had one fewer team, and from 1998 to 2012, the Central had one more team). A third postseason round was added at the same time: the three division champions plus a wild card team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) now advance to the preliminary National League Division Series. Due to a players&#x27; strike, however, the postseason was not actually held in 1994.

Before the 1998 season, the American League and the National League each added a fifteenth team. Because of the odd number of teams, only seven games could possibly be scheduled in each league on any given day. Thus, one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day. This would have made it difficult for scheduling, in terms of travel days and the need to end the season before October. In order for MLB officials to continue primarily intraleague play, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams, so the decision was made to move one club from the AL Central to the NL Central. Eventually, Milwaukee agreed (after Kansas City declined) to change leagues; the National League now had 16 teams, the American League 14 with the switch.

Beginning with the 2013 season, the Houston Astros moved from the National League Central to the American League West, which now gave both leagues three divisions of five teams each.

===Designated hitter rule===
Often characterized as being a more &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; league, the National League did not adopt the designated hitter rule until the shortened 2020 season. Only the American League previously adopted the rule in 1973. In theory, this meant that the role of the manager was greater in the National League than in the American League, because the NL manager must take offense into account when making pitching substitutions and vice versa. However, this was disputed by some, such as former Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who claimed that the American League is more difficult because AL managers are required to know exactly when to pull a pitcher, whereas an NL manager merely pulls his pitcher when that spot comes up in the batting order. Overall, there were fewer home runs and runs scored in the National League than in the American, due to the presence of the pitcher in the NL batting order. As the collective bargaining agreement came closer to expiring after the 2021 season, owners expressed their intentions to use the designated hitter in all games starting in 2022. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, rule changes were instituted in both leagues for the 2020 season, which included an abbreviated 60-game schedule, the use of the designated hitter in all games, and expanded rosters.

The National League reverted to its old batting rules during the 2021 season, but starting with the 2022 season, they permanently adopted the designated hitter rule after a new CBA was ratified.

===Permanent interleague play===
For the first 96 years of its coexistence with the American League, National League teams faced their AL counterparts only in exhibition games, the All-Star Game, or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, however, interleague games have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. Prior to the early 2020s – before the universal designated hitter rule was started in both leagues – as part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the DH rule was used only in games where the American League team was the home team.

In 1999, the offices of American League and National League presidents were discontinued and all authority was vested in the Commissioner&#x27;s office. The leagues subsequently appointed &quot;honorary&quot; presidents to carry out ceremonial roles such as the awarding of league championship trophies. Additionally, the distinction between AL and NL umpires was erased, and instead all umpires were unified under MLB control. Following these actions, as well as the institution of interleague play, little remains to differentiate between the two leagues.

By 2011, MLB had changed its policy on interleague play, deciding to schedule interleague games throughout the season rather than only during specially designated periods. This policy would allow each league to have 15 teams, with one team in each league playing an interleague game on any given day. As a condition of the sale of the Astros to Jim Crane in November 2011, the team agreed to move to the American League effective with the 2013 season.

In 2023, National League teams played 46 regular season interleague games against all 15 American League teams, 23 at home and 23 on the road. In 2025, this will be increased to 48 regular season interleague games, 24 at home and 24 on the road.

===Champions===
As of the end of the 2024 season, the Dodgers have won the most NL pennants, with 25. Representing the National League against the American League, the Cardinals have won the most World Series (11) followed by the Giants and Dodgers (8), Pirates (5), and Reds (5). St. Louis also holds the distinction of being the only AA club to defeat an NL club in the 19th-century version of the World Series, having done so against their now-division rival Cubs.

===&quot;Classic Eight&quot;===
The eight-team lineup established in 1900 remained unchanged through 1952. All franchises are still in the league, with five remaining in the same city.
* Boston (nicknamed at various times the &quot;Red Stockings&quot;, &quot;Red Caps&quot;, &quot;Beaneaters&quot; and &quot;Doves&quot;, in 1912 named the Boston Braves, then Milwaukee Braves, now the Atlanta Braves)
* Brooklyn (variously labeled the &quot;Bridegrooms&quot;, &quot;Grooms&quot;, &quot;Superbas&quot;, &quot;Robins&quot;, &quot;Trolley Dodgers&quot;, and &quot;Bums&quot;, later called the Brooklyn Dodgers, now the Los Angeles Dodgers)
* Chicago (at first called by reporters the &quot;White Stockings&quot;, then &quot;Infants&quot;, &quot;Colts&quot;, &quot;Orphans&quot;, &quot;Remnants&quot; and by 1906 the Chicago Cubs)
* Cincinnati Reds (shortened from early &quot;Red Stockings&quot;)
* New York Giants (sometimes &quot;Gothams&quot; and occasionally &quot;Maroons&quot;, now the San Francisco Giants. &quot;Giants&quot; was in general press usage as early as the 1885 season and is probably the oldest consistent nickname in baseball, depending on how one categorizes &quot;Phillies&quot;)
* Philadelphia Phillies (variously &quot;Quakers&quot;, &quot;Nationals&quot; and &quot;Pearls.&quot; Their ultimate name was just a shortening of the conventional plural-form &quot;Philadelphias.&quot;)
* Pittsburgh (founded in Allegheny, a Pittsburgh suburb at the time which has since been annexed by the city, then claimed Pittsburgh as their home city but continued to be referred to as before as &quot;Alleghenys.&quot; After &quot;pirating&quot; a player from the Athletics in the Players League collapse in 1890 were tagged &quot;Pirates&quot; in the press.)
* St. Louis (at various times &quot;Brown Stockings&quot;, &quot;Browns&quot;, &quot;Red Stockings&quot; and &quot;Reds&quot;, and today officially the Cardinals and unofficially &quot;Redbirds&quot;)

===Expansion, relocation, and renaming, 1953–present===

===Current teams===
====National League East====
* Atlanta Braves, the oldest continually operating team in North American sports. Originally from Boston and known as &quot;Beaneaters&quot; and other nicknames, as original nickname faded and became re-associated with Cincinnati (and later with the Boston Red Sox). Adopted name &quot;Braves&quot; in 1912. Moved to Milwaukee (1953) and to Atlanta (1966). Prior to the 1994 realignment, the Braves competed in the West division.
* Miami Marlins, enfranchised 1993 as the Florida Marlins, changed name to Miami Marlins (2012).
* New York Mets, enfranchised 1962.
* Philadelphia Phillies, enfranchised 1883 and adopted the Phillies name officially in 1884. The team is the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in American professional sports history, although the Cubs (who adopted their name after the Phillies&#x27; establishment) are older, as are the Braves, who have moved twice.
* Washington Nationals, enfranchised 1969 as the Montreal Expos. Moved to Washington, D.C. (2005).

====National League Central====

* Chicago Cubs enfranchised 1870 as an independent professional team, chartered into the National Association in 1871, but suspended operations for 1872 and 1873 following the Great Chicago Fire. The team has been continuously active since 1874, making it the oldest continuously active team in its original city in Major League Baseball. It joined the National League as a charter member (1876). Originally called the &quot;Chicago White Stockings&quot; and later the &quot;Chicago Colts&quot; and several other names, the team was first called &quot;Cubs&quot; in 1902.
* Cincinnati Reds enfranchised 1882 in American Association, at first tagged &quot;Red Stockings&quot;, joined National League (1890).
* Milwaukee Brewers enfranchised 1969 as the Seattle Pilots in American League, moved to Milwaukee (1970), transferred to National League (1998).
* Pittsburgh Pirates enfranchised 1882 in American Association, joined National League (1887), dubbed &quot;Pirates&quot; for signing Lou Bierbauer away from the Athletics in 1891.
* St. Louis Cardinals enfranchised 1882 in American Association, labeled &quot;Brown Stockings&quot; or just &quot;Browns&quot;, joined National League (1892), later &quot;Perfectos&quot;, eventually &quot;Cardinals&quot; for their red trim, now often &quot;Redbirds.&quot;

====National League West====

* Arizona Diamondbacks enfranchised 1998
* Colorado Rockies enfranchised 1993
* Los Angeles Dodgers enfranchised 1883 as a minor league team, entered into the American Association as the Brooklyn Atlantics in 1884, soon acquired nickname &quot;Dodgers&quot; (from &quot;trolley dodgers&quot;), joined National League (1890). Also dubbed &quot;Bridegrooms&quot;, &quot;Superbas&quot;, &quot;Robins&quot; and &quot;Bums&quot; at various times, in addition to &quot;Dodgers&quot;. Moved to Los Angeles (1958)
* San Diego Padres enfranchised 1969, sometimes called &quot;Friars&quot; or &quot;Dads&quot;.
* San Francisco Giants enfranchised in New York City 1883, nearly half of its original players were members of the then just disbanded Troy club, nickname &quot;Giants&quot; in widespread use by 1886, moved to San Francisco (1958)

==Timeline==
The first line is the formation of the National League (NL) in 1876, and the second is the transformation of the American League (AL) to a major league in 1901, signifying the beginning of modern baseball. The third line is the beginning of the expansion era in 1961. The fourth line marks the legal merger of the American and National Leagues into a single Major League Baseball in 2000.

World Series championships are shown with a &quot;•&quot;, National League Pennants before the World Series are shown with a &quot;^&quot;, and American League Pennants who lost the World Series are shown with a &quot;#&quot;. No World Series was played in 1904, so the pennant winners for each league are indicated. Due to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, there were no pennant or World Series winners in 1994, so this year is left blank.

* Prior to 1876, only teams from the National Association (NA) that established the NL are shown.
* Between 1876 and 1901, in addition to the NL teams, only American Association (AA) and Union Association (UA) teams that eventually joined the NL are shown.

==Presidents==


===Honorary president===
Following the 1999 season, the American and National Leagues were merged with Major League Baseball, and the leagues ceased to exist as business entities. The role of the league president was eliminated. In 2001, Bill Giles, son of Warren Giles, was named honorary president of the NL. Honorary presidents perform only ceremonial duties such as presenting league championship trophies and representing their respective leagues at All-Star Games.

<text>Lenny is a 1974 American biographical drama film about the comedian Lenny Bruce, starring Dustin Hoffman and directed by Bob Fosse. The screenplay by Julian Barry is based on his play of the same name.

==Plot==
The film jumps between various sections of Bruce&#x27;s life, including scenes of when he was in his prime, and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. We watch as up-and-coming Bruce courts his &quot;Shiksa goddess&quot;, a stripper named Honey. With family responsibilities, Lenny is encouraged to do a &quot;safe&quot; act, but he cannot do it. Constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, Lenny develops a near-messianic complex that fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. Worn out by a lifetime of tilting at establishment windmills, Lenny Bruce dies of a morphine overdose in 1966.

==Cast==
* Dustin Hoffman as Lenny Bruce
* Valerie Perrine as Honey Bruce
* Jan Miner as Sally Marr
* Stanley Beck as Artie Silver
* Rashel Novikoff as Aunt Mema
* Gary Morton as Sherman Hart
* Guy Rennie as Jack Goldman
* Aldo Demeo as Bailiff

==Release==
&quot;Lenny&quot; opened at Cinema I in New York City on November 10, 1974, and grossed a house record $14,981 in its first day.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 32 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Dustin Hoffman inhabits Lenny Bruce with nervy energy in Bob Fosse&#x27;s richly stylized telling of the pioneering comedian&#x27;s career and downfall.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 61 out of 100, based on 9 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

One of the less enthusiastic reviews came from Roger Ebert, stating, &quot;Unless we go in convinced that Lenny Bruce was an important performer, the movie doesn&#x27;t convince us.&quot;

In 2012, British film critic Mark Kermode put Hoffman&#x27;s performance as Lenny Bruce at number eight in a top-ten video of Hoffman&#x27;s best performances.

===Accolades ===


==Home media==
&quot;Lenny&quot; was released on DVD by MGM Home Video April 1, 2003, in a Region 1 widescreen format, and by Twilight Time (under license from MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) as a Region 1 widescreen Blu-ray February 10, 2015.

<text>Abraham Jebediah &quot;Abe&quot; Simpson II, better known as Grampa Simpson, is a recurring character in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He made his first appearance in the episode entitled &quot;Grandpa and the Kids&quot;, a one-minute Simpsons short on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, before the debut of the television show in 1989.

Grampa Simpson is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices his son, Homer Simpson. He is the paternal grandfather of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. In the 1,000th issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Grampa was selected as the &quot;Grandpa for The Perfect TV Family&quot;. Grampa is a World War II veteran and retired farmer who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his long, rambling, often incoherent and irrelevant stories and senility.

==Biography==
Grampa Simpson is the father to Homer Simpson, father-in-law to Marge Simpson and the paternal grandfather to siblings Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Grampa has also fathered two illegitimate children; a daughter named Abbey by a British woman named Edwina while in the United Kingdom during World War II, and Herbert Powell by a carnival prostitute. Grampa has an older brother named Cyrus, who lives in Tahiti and has multiple native wives. He also has a younger brother named Chet, who owns an unsuccessful shrimp company. Other siblings of his include Hubert, Tyrone, Fester, Bill, and Hortense. Grampa was briefly married to Amber, the same woman Homer married on a drinking binge in Las Vegas. Grampa has also been briefly married to Marge&#x27;s sister, Selma Bouvier, and was once romantically linked to Marge&#x27;s mother, Jacqueline Bouvier (his son&#x27;s mother-in-law). Grampa Simpson is also married to Rita LaFleur.

Almost all of Grampa&#x27;s biographical information is supplied by himself and seems to be made up, although this could be likely due to his old age. Many of his stories seem to be wildly inaccurate, often physically or historically impossible, and occasionally inconsistent even with each other, suggesting that Grampa is quite senile. It is unknown where Grampa was born. He claims that he came to America as a boy from the &quot;old country&quot;, but he cannot remember which country it was, although most likely it was the United Kingdom or Ireland. Grampa was raised in New York City with his parents, Orville J. Simpson and Yuma Hickman. He gives his age as 83 in the Season 17 episode &quot;Million Dollar Abie,&quot; while in &quot;Grampy Can Ya Hear Me&quot; (season 29), the family celebrates his 87th birthday, although he is canonically 83. In the Season 25 episode &quot;The Winter of His Content,&quot; Homer states that Grampa&#x27;s father is still alive. Due to the show&#x27;s floating timeline, his age remains the same over the years, and newer episodes still depict him as a World War II veteran.

Grampa is a veteran of World War II, where he served as Master Sergeant of the Flying Hellfish unit which included himself (the Unit Commander, Radio Operator Sheldon Skinner (Seymour Skinner&#x27;s father), Private Fifth Class Arnie Gumble (Barney Gumble&#x27;s father), Asa Phelps, Iggy Wiggum (Clancy Wiggum&#x27;s father), Milton &quot;Oxford&quot; Haas, Etch Westgrin, Griff McDonald, Private Charles Montgomery Burns and Grey Fox. At the very end of the war in Europe, Grampa&#x27;s unit &quot;liberated&quot; a stash of priceless art from surrendering German forces. The Flying Hellfish formed a tontine and buried the art in a trunk at sea. Decades later, Montgomery Burns, the second surviving member of the unit, tried to murder Grampa in order to get the art, prompting Grampa to violate the tontine. When Grampa and Bart retrieved the art from Mr. Burns, the State Department arrived to return the art to its rightful owner. Grampa was a hated wrestler named &quot;Glamorous Godfrey&quot; in the 1950s, revealed in the episode &quot;Gorgeous Grampa&quot;, starring him and Mr. Burns.

Homer&#x27;s mother, Mona Simpson, was married to Grampa for several years. According to &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Fly a Coot&quot;, they met in the 1950s and hooked up on the day Grampa allegedly broke the sound barrier. She became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after seeing Joe Namath&#x27;s hair on television. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab owned by Mr. Burns to deliberately poison everyone in Springfield. To explain this to his then-six-year-old son, Grampa said that Mona died while Homer was at the movies. Grampa has a poor, but sometimes loving relationship with his son, who placed him in a nursing home as soon as he could, despite Grampa selling his house in order to provide Homer with a mortgage. It is recurringly suggested that, while caring, Grampa was a strict disciplinarian who could be very controlling, neglectful, and even emotionally abusive towards Homer when he was growing up and he still had not forgiven him for that. After Mona left Homer at a young age and ran off with a jester, Grampa brought up Homer by himself. In the season four episode, &quot;The Front&quot;, Grampa tells Roger Myers Jr., head of Itchy and Scratchy studios, that he worked as a cranberry silo night watchman for forty years.

The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa. A running gag in the show usually has Grampa in a cameo episode appearance where he wonders where everyone is or wishes to be noticed by the family. One example of this was when the family thought they left something on the plane in the episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, which is revealed to be Grampa. Despite this, Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.

==Character==
===Creation===
Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, wanted to have a character that was &quot;really cranky&quot; and old, and who complained a lot and invented stories to tell to children, so he created Grampa. After naming the main characters after his own family members (except for Bart, an anagram of &quot;brat&quot;, which he substituted for his own name), Groening refused to name Grampa after his grandfather, Abraham Groening. He left it to the writers to choose a name and they ironically chose &quot;Abraham&quot;, although not knowing that it was also the name of Groening&#x27;s grandfather. Grampa first appeared in the Simpsons short &quot;Grandpa and the Kids&quot;, which premiered on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on January 10, 1988. In the short, Grampa tells his grandchildren stories of &quot;the good old days&quot;. When they stop paying attention to him, he feigns his own death to recapture their attention.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer Al Jean commented that Grampa is often the focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said the reason for that is because the staff is trying to illustrate how society mistreats the elderly, &quot;and some of it is because people over 55 never watch our show&quot;. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are &quot;obsessed&quot; with old people. Weinstein commented that they &quot;both love [old people] and seem to really hate them at the same time&quot;. He also said that he &quot;enjoys&quot; writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their &quot;out-datedness&quot;, and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up &quot;old time slang&quot;.

===Voice===
Grampa&#x27;s voice is performed by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta was part of the regular cast of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. The episode &quot;Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy&quot; (season six, 1994) featured many interactions between Grampa and Homer, so Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices for that episode. Castellaneta said it is hard for him to do Grampa&#x27;s voice because it is &quot;wheezy and airy&quot;.

==Reception==
===Commendations===
Nancy Basile of About.com named Grampa the fifth best character of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, calling him a &quot;perfect stereotypical old person&quot;. In the 1000th issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Grampa was selected as the &quot;Grandpa for The Perfect TV Family&quot;. Joe Rhodes of &quot;TV Guide&quot; considered Grampa&#x27;s most memorable line to be &quot;If I&#x27;m not back at the home by nine, they declare me legally dead and collect my insurance.&quot; Dan Castellaneta has won two Primetime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance category for voicing various characters, including Grampa. The first was awarded in 1992 for the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot;, and the second in 2004 for &quot;Today I Am A Clown&quot;. In 2010, Castellaneta was nominated for the award for voicing Grampa and Homer in the episode &quot;Thursdays with Abie&quot;.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer David Mirkin said that one of his favorite jokes on the show is the one where Grampa cycles down the street in high speed and shouts that he feels young again, and is then knocked flying from his bicycle after a doll&#x27;s head flies into the spokes and falls into an open grave. In a review of the Grampa-centric episode &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict said that he is &quot;never terribly interested&quot; in episodes that revolve around Grampa, because he believes Grampa is &quot;great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage.&quot; DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson said in a review of the same episode that Grampa is &quot;always fun&quot; and &quot;it’s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while.&quot;

===Analysis===
Mirkin thinks it is hard to make a &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;tedious&quot; character, such as Grampa, funny. He believes that what ultimately makes Grampa funny is that the things he says are &quot;actually funny&quot; in the context of the boredom and the tedium. Anne-Marie Barry and Chris Yuill, the authors of the book &quot;Understanding the Sociology of Health&quot;, commented that in episodes in which Grampa appears, the comedy content is often generated by Grampa falling asleep at &quot;inopportune&quot; moments or &quot;embarking&quot; on long rambling stories about his youth. &quot;Instances such as these match popular stereotypes that all old people are &#x27;demented&#x27; and in poor health,&quot; they wrote.

Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan wrote in &quot;The Psychology of The Simpsons&quot; that Grampa has the least amount of &quot;power&quot; in the Simpson family, and that he is treated as little more than a child and is often ignored. The family frequently laughs at his &quot;failing&quot; memory and his &quot;ineffectual&quot; attempts to get what he wants. They added that Grampa is left behind, forgotten, and rarely invited to spend time with the family. The authors commented that he is &quot;not without influence, but he certainly does not play the traditional grandfather role in the family hierarchy.&quot;

Brown and Logan also wrote that Grampa had a considerable influence in the formation of Homer&#x27;s character, and that flashbacks in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; show what an &quot;angry&quot;, &quot;critical&quot; father he was to Homer. &quot;He yelled, used corporal punishment, and constantly belittled Homer&#x27;s attempts to have fun, date, and excel at various activities,&quot; they added. The authors said that Homer tries &quot;in vain&quot; to repair his relationship with Grampa and continuously seeks for his approval, but Grampa continues to be &quot;as critical as ever&quot;. However, in some episodes, he does show a loving side to Homer. Such as the episode &quot;Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy&quot;, he and Homer watch the farm burn, or the episode &quot;To Cur with Love&quot;, where he does everything to protect Homer&#x27;s dog from Mr Burns in a flashback. In his book &quot;Understanding the Psychology of Diversity&quot;, author Bruce Evan Blaine wrote that Grampa is typically portrayed as a &quot;doddering&quot;, &quot;senile&quot;, and &quot;dependent&quot; person who is a &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;often disposable figure&quot; in his son&#x27;s life.

==Merchandising==
Playmates Toys created two Grampa Simpson action figures for the World of Springfield series. The first, released in May 2000, depicts Grampa in his usual appearance. The second, &quot;Sunday Grampa&quot;, was released in June 2002, and depicts Grampa in his Sunday church clothes. Alongside the television series, Grampa regularly appears in issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, which were first published on November 29, 1993. The final issue was published on October 17, 2018.

Grampa also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

In 2015, Grampa appeared as a non-playable character in the toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. In game, he only appears in the Simpsons levels and all his voice lines are archive audio from Dan Castellaneta.

<doc id="64300" wikidata="Q5480" url="?curid=64300" title="Bart Simpson">
<text>Bartholomew Jo-Jo &quot;Bart&quot; Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; who is part of the Simpson family. Bart made his television debut in the short &quot;Good Night&quot; on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks&#x27;s office. Initially called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip &quot;Life in Hell&quot;, Groening developed a new set of characters. Unlike the other Simpson family members, who were named after Groening&#x27;s relatives, Bart&#x27;s name is an anagram of &quot;brat&quot;. After two years on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, the Simpson family received their own series, which premiered on Fox on December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; except &quot;Four Great Women and a Manicure&quot;.

At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge Simpson and the brother of Lisa and Maggie. Known for his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority, Bart&#x27;s most iconic traits include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence, prank calls to Moe&#x27;s Tavern, and catchphrases like &quot;Eat my shorts&quot;, &quot;¡Ay, caramba!&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, man!&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?&quot;. Bart has also appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″-related media, including video games, the film version of the series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride, commercials, comic books, and an extensive line of merchandise. Nancy Cartwright, Bart&#x27;s voice actor, intended to audition for the role of Lisa, and Yeardley Smith auditioned for Bart. Smith&#x27;s voice was deemed too high-pitched for a boy, while Cartwright found Lisa less appealing as a character and opted to try out for Bart—a role she felt better suited her. 

Bart was the show&#x27;s protagonist during its first two seasons, ensuing &quot;Bartmania&quot;, which spawned Bart-themed merchandise touting his rebellious persona and pride in underachieving. Those traits were criticized by parents and educators, who viewed him as a negative influence on children. By the third season, Homer became the show&#x27;s figurehead character and the series shifted its focus to the family as a whole, although Bart remains a breakout character. He is considered one of the most iconic fictional television characters of the 1990s, and has been described as an American cultural icon. &quot;Time&quot; named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named him Entertainer of the Year in 1990. Cartwright has received accolades for her portrayal of Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995. In 2000, Bart and the rest of the Simpson family were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; ==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; employs a floating timeline, where characters either do not age or age minimally. As such, the show is always presumed to take place in the present year. At ten years old, Bartholomew, best known by his short-form name Bart, is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge Simpson; he has two younger sisters, Lisa and Maggie. In several episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, events have been tied to specific times, though these timelines are sometimes contradicted in later episodes. In &quot;I Married Marge&quot; (season three, 1991), Bart&#x27;s birth is placed in the early 1980s. In &quot;Simpsorama&quot; (season 26, 2014), Bart states his birthday as February 23, while &quot;The Bart Book&quot; by series creator Matt Groening lists it as April 1. In &quot;Bart&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (season 36, 2024), Bart, in a hypothetical series finale, celebrates his eleventh birthday, much to his dismay, as he has always identified as being ten years old.

Bart lived with his parents in Springfield&#x27;s Lower East Side before the family purchased their first home. When Lisa was born, Bart initially felt jealous of the attention she received but soon warmed to her when her first word turned out to be &quot;Bart&quot;. Bart&#x27;s first day of school occurred in the early 1990s. Initially excited, his enthusiasm was quickly crushed by an indifferent teacher, prompting Marge to worry about him. During recess, Bart befriended Milhouse and began entertaining classmates with gestures and rude jokes. Principal Skinner warned Bart, &quot;You&#x27;ve just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life! Now, what do you say?&quot; Bart replied, &quot;Eat my shorts&quot;. However, the episode &quot;That 90&#x27;s Show&quot; (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of this timeline, revealing that Homer and Marge were childless during the early 1990s.

Bart&#x27;s hobbies include skateboarding, watching television—particularly &quot;The Krusty the Clown Show&quot; and its segment &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot;—reading comic books, especially &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, playing video games, and causing general mischief. His favorite movies are &quot;Jaws&quot; and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, while his favorite board games include &quot;Hippo in the House&quot;, &quot;The Game of Lent&quot;, and &quot;Citizenship&quot;. Throughout the series, Bart has been a student at Springfield Elementary School, where he is part of Edna Krabappel&#x27;s fourth-grade class. Although too young for full-time work, Bart has taken on several part-time jobs over the years. He works as a bartender at Fat Tony&#x27;s social club in &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; (season three, 1991); as Krusty the Clown&#x27;s assistant in &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot; (season five, 1994); as a doorman in Springfield&#x27;s burlesque house, the Maison Derrière, in &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; (season eight, 1996); and briefly owns his own factory in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; (season eight, 1997).

==Character==

=== Creation ===

Matt Groening conceived Bart and the rest of the Simpson family in 1987 while waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks&#x27;s office. Groening was invited to pitch a series of animated shorts for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and initially planned to adapt his comic strip, &quot;Life in Hell&quot;. Realizing that adapting the strip would require him to relinquish publication rights, he decided to create something new. Groening sketched a concept for a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his family. For the rebellious son, he chose &quot;Bart&quot;, an anagram of &quot;brat&quot;, instead of his own name because he felt that &quot;Matt&quot; would not &quot;go over well in a pitch meeting&quot;. Bart&#x27;s middle initial &quot;J&quot; is an homage to the animated characters Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, who were named after creator Jay Ward. Although numerous interpretations of his middle initial have been given, Groening said that Bart&#x27;s full middle name is &quot;Jo-Jo&quot;, which was chosen by Cartwright during a recording session.

According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, Bart was conceived as &quot;a much milder, troubled youth given to existential angst who talks to himself&quot;; the character was changed due to Nancy Cartwright&#x27;s voice acting. Groening has credited numerous sources as inspirations for Bart&#x27;s character. His older brother, Mark Groening, influenced Bart&#x27;s rebellious attitude. Mark introduced him to a variety of comics, including &quot;Mad&quot; (when it was still a comic), &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, and &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;; all were sources of inspiration for Matt. Bart was envisioned as an exaggerated version of a typical misbehaving child, combining the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Groening described Bart as &quot;what would happen if the son of Eddie Haskell [from &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;] got his own show&quot;. He was disappointed with the premise of &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, which inspired him to create a character who was genuinely mischievous. Bart first appeared with the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot;. On December 17, 1989, the shorts were developed into &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company, where Bart and the Simpson family became the central characters.

===Design===

The Simpson family was designed to be easily recognizable in silhouette. The characters were initially crudely drawn because Groening submitted rough sketches to the animators, expecting them to refine the designs, but they simply traced over his drawings. Bart&#x27;s early design, featured in the first shorts, included hair with spikes of varying length; this was later standardized to nine spikes of equal length. Groening primarily worked in black-and-white at the time and, without considering the eventual use of color, designed Bart&#x27;s spikes to look like an extension of his head. This design feature is not replicated in other characters, although some background characters in the first few seasons shared his spiky hairline.

Bart&#x27;s head was described by director Mark Kirkland as a basic rectangular shape resembling a coffee can. Homer&#x27;s head is also rectangular, with a dome on top, while spheres define the heads of Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. In the season-seven (1995) episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot;, Bart, alongside Homer, was first rendered as a three-dimensional character in the episode&#x27;s &quot;Homer3&quot; segment. The computer animation was by Pacific Data Images. Designing Bart&#x27;s 3D model, the animators did not know how they would depict his hair; realizing that vinyl Bart dolls were in production, they purchased one to use as a model.

=== Voice ===

Bart&#x27;s voice is provided by Nancy Cartwright, who also voices several other child characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; who include Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Kearney Zzyzwicz. After Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner were cast as Homer and Marge due to their roles on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, the producers held auditions for Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith initially auditioned for Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila felt that her voice was too high-pitched. Smith recalled, &quot;I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart, and they said, &#x27;Thanks for coming!. She was subsequently cast as Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Cartwright auditioned for Lisa. Discovering that Lisa was described only as the &quot;middle child&quot;, with little personality at the time, she became interested in Bart, who was characterized as &quot;devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever&quot;. Groening allowed her to audition for Bart, and offered her the role immediately after hearing her read. Cartwright is the only one of the six primary &quot;Simpsons&quot; cast members who had formal voice-acting training before joining the show.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Cartwright&#x27;s speaking voice has &quot;no obvious traces of Bart&quot;. The voice she uses for Bart came naturally to her, since she had incorporated elements of it on shows like &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, and &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;. Cartwright described Bart&#x27;s voice as easy to create: &quot;Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty&quot;. She typically records five or six takes of each line for variety, allowing producers more options to work with. Even in flashforward episodes, Cartwright continues to voice Bart; in the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (season six, 1995), Bart&#x27;s voice was electronically pitched lower to reflect his age. Despite Bart&#x27;s fame, Cartwright is seldom recognized in public. When she is recognized and asked to use Bart&#x27;s voice in front of children, she declines because it &quot;freaks [them] out&quot;. During the first season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Fox Network barred Cartwright from interviews to avoid the revelation that Bart was voiced by a woman.

Cartwright was paid US$30,000 per episode for her work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; until 1998. A pay dispute arose that year, during which Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors and began preparing for new casting. The conflict was resolved, and Cartwright&#x27;s salary increased to $125,000 per episode. The voice cast pushed for higher wages in 2004, seeking $360,000 per episode. The dispute was soon settled, and Cartwright&#x27;s pay was increased to $250,000 per episode. In 2008, further negotiations increased the cast&#x27;s salaries to about $400,000 per episode. Fox demanded production-cost reductions in 2011, threatening to cancel the series if costs were not cut. In response, Cartwright and the other main cast members agreed to a 30-percent pay reduction which lowering their per-episode earnings to just over $300,000. Cartwright was paid $315,000 per episode by 2016, which, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, made her one of the highest-paid voice actors.

=== Hallmarks ===
In the opening sequence of many episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is shown writing lines on a chalkboard. This scene, known as the &quot;chalkboard gag&quot;, varies by episode. The messages often include political humor, such as &quot;The First Amendment does not cover burping&quot;, pop culture references like &quot;I can&#x27;t see dead people&quot;, and meta-commentary such as &quot;I am not a 32-year-old woman&quot; or &quot;Nobody reads these anymore&quot;. The animators create the gags quickly, and they sometimes reflect current events. In the episode &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; (season four, 1992), the chalkboard gag read &quot;I will not defame New Orleans&quot;; it was an apology for a controversial song in the previous week&#x27;s episode, &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, which described the city as a &quot;home of pirates, drunks, and whores&quot;.

An early hallmark of Bart&#x27;s character was his prank calls to Moe&#x27;s Tavern, where he would ask owner Moe Szyslak for a fictitious person with a gag name. Moe would try to find the person, eventually realizing it was a prank and (unaware that Bart was the caller) responding with angry threats. The calls were inspired by the Tube Bar recordings, a series of prank calls to bar owner Louis &quot;Red&quot; Deutsch (whose profane reactions influenced Moe&#x27;s violent temperament). The calls first appeared in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; (season one, 1990), the third episode to air. It became increasingly difficult for the writers to create new fake names and Moe&#x27;s responses, leading to the pranks being phased out as a regular feature by the fourth season; however, they have occasionally resurfaced in later episodes.

The catchphrase &quot;Eat my shorts&quot; originated as an ad-lib by Cartwright during one of the show&#x27;s early table readings, inspired by an incident during her high-school years. While performing with the marching band at Fairmont High School, the group chanted &quot;Eat my shorts&quot; instead of their usual cheer (&quot;Fairmont West! Fairmont West!&quot;) The phrase may also refer to &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), in which John Bender says it to Principal Vernon. Bart&#x27;s other notable catchphrases include &quot;¡Ay, caramba!&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow!&quot;. The former was inspired by a Portuguese flamenco dancer; the latter, popularized during the 1950s, originated from the British phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t have kittens&quot;. Both were prominently featured on merchandise such as T-shirts during the show&#x27;s early seasons. Another catchphrase, &quot;Cowabunga&quot;, was borrowed from Chief Thunderthud of &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot;.
Bart frequently appears nude in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, often by mooning. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007), he skateboards nude. Although various objects obscure his genitalia throughout the scene, his penis is briefly visible. This scene was among the first created for the film, but producers were initially concerned that it might result in an R rating. However, the Motion Picture Association of America ultimately rated the film PG-13 for &quot;irreverent humor throughout&quot;. The scene was later recognized by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of 30 Unforgettable Nude Scenes.

=== Personality ===
Bart&#x27;s disregard for authority has been compared to America&#x27;s founding fathers, and been described as a modern fusion of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. In his book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, Chris Turner characterizes Bart as a nihilist who has the philosophical view that life lacks inherent meaning, purpose, or value. Bart&#x27;s rebellious nature makes him disruptive at Springfield Elementary School, where he identifies as an underachiever. He frequently clashes with his teacher, Ms. Krabappel, and Principal Skinner. Bart acknowledges his poor performance at school: &quot;I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I&#x27;m happy about it?&quot; His mental processes are often illogical and absurd; he once believed that if he reincarnated as a butterfly, he could burn the school down without suspicion, imagining he could hold a gas can as a butterfly. Bart thinks that writing his name in wet cement will leave people wondering how he did it in hardened cement. &quot;Brother&#x27;s Little Helper&quot; (season eleven, 1999) reveals that Bart has attention deficit disorder. His intelligence may be impacted by the hereditary &quot;Simpson gene&quot;, which affects males in his family. Despite his misbehavior and selfishness, he has moments of integrity and compassion and occasionally helps Ms. Krabappel and Principal Skinner.

Bart&#x27;s mischievous nature and Homer&#x27;s often-negligent, incompetent behavior create a turbulent, volatile, and abusive relationship between them. Bart frequently calls Homer by his first name rather than &quot;Dad&quot;, and Homer often refers to him dismissively as &quot;the boy&quot;. Homer&#x27;s short temper leads to cartoonishly-violent outbursts, such as impulsively strangling Bart. Marge is the more caring, understanding and nurturing parent, although she acknowledges that Bart is &quot;a handful&quot; and is often embarrassed by his antics. In the episode &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot; (season seven, 1995), Marge struggles with adjusting her parenting style after Bart is caught shoplifting; she becomes more distant to avoid over-mothering, which causes Bart to feel guilty and try to make amends. Despite his rebellious attitude, Bart occasionally endures humiliation to please his mother. Marge frequently defends him, understanding his complexity. She describes him as her &quot;special little guy&quot;, saying, &quot;I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he&#x27;s like inside. He&#x27;s got a spark. It&#x27;s not a bad thing[...] of course, it makes him do bad things&quot;.

Bart shares sibling rivalry with his younger sister, Lisa. Although they often disagree—sometimes physically—they have a deep bond and care for one another. Bart often apologizes when he goes too far and recognizes Lisa&#x27;s superior intellect, frequently seeking her advice about problems. He is a popular &quot;&quot; at school, and has many friends; his closest is Milhouse Van Houten. His influence on Milhouse is often negative, leading them into mischief. In &quot;Homer Defined&quot; (season three, 1991), Milhouse&#x27;s mother forbids him from playing with Bart due to his bad influence; Bart is unfazed until he realizes how much he values their friendship, and Marge convinces Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider.

Bart is a fan of the children&#x27;s television host Krusty the Clown, and has stated that his &quot;whole life on Krusty&#x27;s teachings&quot;; his room is filled with Krusty merchandise. Bart helps Krusty a number of times, thwarting Sideshow Bob&#x27;s attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;, and helping Krusty relaunch his career with a comeback special in &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;. Bart&#x27;s initial confrontation with Sideshow Bob in &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; sparks a long-term rivalry. The writers developed Bob as an intelligent, obsessive antagonist, inspired by the dynamic between Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

== Reception ==
=== Bartmania ===
Bart became one of television&#x27;s most popular characters in 1990, sparking a cultural phenomenon known as &quot;Bartmania&quot;. He became the most prominent &quot;Simpsons&quot; character on merchandise, particularly T-shirts; during the early 1990s, millions of Bart-themed T-shirts were sold. Bart&#x27;s rebellious persona led some American public schools to ban T-shirts with sayings such as &quot;I&#x27;m Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?&quot; and &quot;Underachiever (and proud of it, man!)&quot;. A T-shirt with that caption is in the National Museum of American History. The popularity of &quot;Simpsons&quot; merchandise was a commercial success, generating $2 billion in revenue in its first 14 months of sales. Bart&#x27;s appeal also inspired a thriving black market for counterfeit merchandise, particularly T-shirts. The items featured Bart with various slogans and redesigns, including &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Bart&quot;, &quot;Air Simpson Bart&quot;, and &quot;RastaBart&quot;. Although Groening generally tolerated bootleg merchandise, he objected to a series of &quot;Nazi Bart&quot; shirts with Bart in Nazi uniforms or as a white power skinhead. 20th Century Fox sued the creator of the offensive designs, who agreed to cease production.
Bart was described as &quot;television&#x27;s king of 1990&quot;, &quot;television&#x27;s brightest new star&quot;, and an &quot;undiminished smash&quot;. He was one of the most popular write-in candidates in the 1990 United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections, second in a number of areas only to Mickey Mouse among fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart debuted as one of the giant helium-filled balloons for which the parade is known. This was noted in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart vs. Thanksgiving&quot;, which aired the day of the parade, where Homer tells Bart: &quot;If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you turn the parade into a farce!&quot;. Behind and unbeknownst to Homer, the television briefly shows a Bart Simpson balloon.

The album &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; was released in September 1990. It peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The first single from the album was the pop rap song &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Bryan Loren, a friend of Michael Jackson (who provided backing vocals on the track). Jackson was a fan of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (especially Bart), and had called the producers offering to write Bart a single and make a guest appearance on the show. Jackson guest-starred in the episode &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot; (season three, 1991) with the pseudonym John Jay Smith. Although &quot;Do the Bartman&quot; was never released as a single in the United States, it was successful in the United Kingdom; it was the number-one song from February 16 to March 9, 1991, and was the year&#x27;s fifth-best-selling song. It sold half a million copies, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on February 1, 1991.

=== Cultural influence, reception, and commendations ===
Bart has been described as one of the most iconic television characters of the 1990s, and is considered an American cultural icon. In 1990, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named him Entertainer of the Year, writing that &quot;Bart has proved to be a rebel who&#x27;s also a good kid, a terror who&#x27;s easily terrorized, and a flake who astonishes us, and himself, with serious displays of fortitude&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; included Bart on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, the only fictional character on the list. He had appeared previously on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; December 31, 1990, issue. In 1996, Bart was named 48th on TV Guide&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time&quot;. In 2002, he and Lisa were ranked eleventh on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list. In 2022, &quot;Paste&quot; writers ranked Bart the 26th-greatest cartoon character of all time.

From entertainment critics, Bart has received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Dan Peeke praised him as the &quot;best main character&quot; in 2020, calling him &quot;relatable&quot; and saying that &quot;everyone can relate to at least some element of his personality&quot;. In a 2024 review, Darryn King of &quot;Vulture&quot; called Bart a &quot;back-talking, trouble-making, prank-calling, cherry-bomb-detonating, and, yes, graffiti-tagging cartoon creation, who was at the time fast becoming a cultural icon&quot;. A 2023 &quot;Collider&quot; review said that the episode &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;&quot; was a &quot;turning point for the show, showing that Bart could be more than just a punchline while paving the way for future episodes that fleshed out his character&quot;. According to Erma Bombeck, &quot;Kids need to know that somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull off all the things they can only fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live&quot;. In 2003, a survey of parents in the United Kingdom ranked Bart the most influential fictional character for children under age twelve.
Cartwright has received a number of awards for her performance. At the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1992 she received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her portrayal of Bart in the season-three episode &quot;Separate Vocations&quot;, sharing the award with five other voice actors from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Episodes featuring Bart have been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, including &quot;Radio Bart&quot; in 1992, &quot;Future-Drama&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; in 1997. Cartwright received an Annie Award for Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995 for her work as Bart. In 2000, Bart and the rest of the Simpson family were recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

=== Negative influence on children ===
Bart&#x27;s rebellious nature, often accompanied by a lack of consequences for his actions, led some parents, educators, and conservative groups to view him as a negative influence on children. Critics said that Bart&#x27;s behavior made him a poor role model, with Robert Bianco of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; describing him as a character who &quot;outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he&#x27;s the child we wish we&#x27;d been, and fear our children will become&quot;. Educators expressed concern that Bart&#x27;s &quot;underachiever and proud of it&quot; attitude and disdain for education posed a &quot;threat to learning&quot;, and others called him &quot;egotistical, aggressive, and mean-spirited&quot;. In response to criticism, producer James L. Brooks defended the character: &quot;I&#x27;m very wary of television where everybody is supposed to be a role model. You don&#x27;t run across that many role models in real life. Why should television be full of them?&quot;

U.S. drug czar William Bennett visited a Pittsburgh drug treatment center in 1990 and saw a poster of Bart. Bennett said, &quot;You guys aren&#x27;t watching &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, are you? That&#x27;s not going to help you any&quot;. Bennett later apologized, saying that he was &quot;just kidding&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ll sit down with the little spike head. We&#x27;ll straighten this thing out.&quot; Bill Cosby called Bart a poor role model in a 1991 interview, describing him as &quot;angry, confused, [and] frustrated&quot;. Groening responded, &quot;That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring and does things that others just wished they dare do&quot;. U.S. president George H. W. Bush said in 1992, &quot;We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons&quot;. The show&#x27;s writers then produced a short segment that aired three days later (before a rerun of &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;), in which Bart says: &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re just like the Waltons. We&#x27;re praying for an end to the Depression, too.&quot;

=== Merchandising ===
In addition to T-shirts, Bart has been featured in a variety of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;-related merchandise which includes dolls, napkins, air fresheners, cups, chewing gum, beach towels, sleeping bags, snow boots, rubber sponge balls, license-plate frames, scratch paper, laminated magnets, and handheld pinball games. Two books have been published about the character: &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Bart Book&quot; (2004, both primarily by Groening). &quot;The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D&#x27;oh! of Homer&quot; (2001) contains a chapter analyzing Bart&#x27;s character and comparing him to the &quot;Nietzschean ideal&quot;. Bart has appeared in media related to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He is featured in most of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; video games, such as &quot;Bart vs. the World&quot; (1991), &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Escape from Camp Deadly&quot; (1991), &quot;Bart vs. the Space Mutants&quot; (1991), &quot;Bart&#x27;s House of Weirdness&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; (2007). Bart was a recurring character in the Bongo Comics-distributed &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, which debuted in November 1993 and was published until October 2018. He headlined his eponymous comic-book series, which was distributed by Bongo Comics from 2000 to 2016. Bart plays a role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride, a motion-simulator ride launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood. On December 9, 2024, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; hosted an animated &quot;Simpsons&quot; version of the Cincinnati Bengals-Dallas Cowboys game which paralleled the events on the field.

Bart and other &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters appeared in television commercials for Nestlé&#x27;s Butterfinger candy bars from 1988 to 2001, using the slogan &quot;Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!&quot;. Groening later noted that the success of the Butterfinger commercials played a significant role in Fox&#x27;s decision to greenlight the half-hour series. Bart has also appeared in commercials for the fast-food Burger King chain. In 2001, Kellogg&#x27;s introduced the limited-edition Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch cereal. Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O before the launch of the half-hour series, suggesting a commercial in which Bart would sing &quot;J-E-L-L-O&quot; and burp the letter &quot;O&quot;. He believed that kids would try to mimic it, but the idea was rejected. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service introduced a series of five 44-cent stamps commemorating Bart and the other members of the Simpson family. The stamps were the first since &quot;Sesame Street&quot; which were issued while their show was still in production. Designed by Groening, they became available for purchase on May 7, 2009.
