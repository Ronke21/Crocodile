<doc id="59892" wikidata="Q392108" url="?curid=59892" title="List of highest-grossing films">
<text>Films generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.

Traditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with eleven films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, &quot;&quot;, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the &quot;Avengers&quot; comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; properties, while films based on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; from DC Comics have generally performed well. &quot;Star Wars&quot; is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by &quot;Avatar&quot;, which is an original work. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as &quot;Frozen&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Zootopia&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (along with its computer-animated remake), as well as its Pixar division, of which &quot;Inside Out 2&quot;, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, China&#x27;s &quot;Ne Zha 2&quot; (the highest-grossing animated film), and the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot; series have met with the most success.

While inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; franchises, &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today&#x27;s standards, but no longer compete numerically against today&#x27;s top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.

== Highest-grossing films ==

With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, &quot;Avatar&quot; is proclaimed to be the &quot;highest-grossing&quot; film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film&#x27;s earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. &quot;Titanic&quot; earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for &quot;Avatar&quot;, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights also substantially add to a film&#x27;s earnings and, as of 2010, a film often earned the equivalent of as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top of pay-per-view revenues; &quot;Titanic&quot; earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.

When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this pales in comparison to the $8 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: &quot;The Lion King&quot; also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot;—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar had another huge hit with &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.

On this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with &quot;Avatar&quot; ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.






== Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation ==

Because of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.

Another complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is &quot;Avatar&quot;, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change and the growth of international markets also have an effect on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children&#x27;s tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.

The measuring system for gauging a film&#x27;s success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box-office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a &quot;top film of all time&quot;, so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.

Despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the &quot;Guinness&quot; estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: &quot;Guinness&quot; had &quot;Avatar&quot; in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw &quot;Titanic&quot; in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices.






== High-grossing films by year ==

Audience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (American Civil War), &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;The Big Parade&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (World War II) in 1946. &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, &quot;The Robe&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot; all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot; in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box-office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.

Steven Spielberg (1975, 1981, 1982, 1989 and 1993) and Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) tie as the most represented directors on the chart with five films apiece occupying the annual top spot. William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are each represented by four films, whilst D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, and 1989 as well. The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski, and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).

Because of release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film&#x27;s first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.

== Timeline of highest-grossing films ==
At least eleven films have held the record of &#x27;highest-grossing film&#x27; since &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; assumed the top spot in 1915. Both &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; overtook &quot;E.T.&quot;, and Cameron emulated the feat when &quot;Avatar&quot; broke the record set by &quot;Titanic&quot;. When it took over the top spot in 2019, &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before &quot;Avatar&quot; reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.

Some sources claim that &quot;The Big Parade&quot; superseded &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which in turn was quickly usurped by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Exact figures are not known for &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by &quot;Variety&quot; in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, &quot;Variety&quot; still had &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; ahead of &quot;The Big Parade&quot; ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although it would have been the highest-grossing &#x27;talkie&#x27;, displacing &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925&#x27;s &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; ($9,386,000) if &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point &quot;Variety&quot; estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; itself may have been briefly overtaken by &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; may also have captured the record from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.

Another film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film&#x27;s release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box-office receipts for the film.

&quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;E.T.&quot;, and &quot;Avatar&quot; all increased their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for &quot;Star Wars&quot; includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for &quot;E.T.&quot; incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002. The total for &quot;Avatar&quot;&#x27;s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run) along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and &quot;Jaws&quot; was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Titanic&quot; have all increased their earnings with further releases, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.



== Highest-grossing franchises and film series ==

Prior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1 billion at the box office: &quot;James Bond&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Since the turn of the century, that number has increased to over a hundred. This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but it is also due to Hollywood&#x27;s adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition such as being based on a well-known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as &quot;pre-sold&quot; films within the industry.

A franchise is typically defined to be at least two works derived from a common intellectual property. Traditionally, the work has a tautological relationship with the property, but this is not a prerequisite. An enduring staple of the franchise model is the concept of the &quot;crossover&quot;, which can be defined as &quot;a story in which characters or concepts from two or more discrete texts or series of texts meet&quot;. A consequence of a crossover is that an intellectual property may be utilized by more than one franchise. For example, &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; belongs to not only the Batman and Superman franchises, but also to the DC Extended Universe, which is a &quot;shared universe&quot;. A shared universe is a particular type of crossover where a number of characters from a wide range of fictional works wind up sharing a fictional world. The most successful shared universe in the medium of film is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a crossover between multiple superhero properties owned by Marvel Comics. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is also the highest-grossing franchise, amassing over $31 billion at the box office.

The &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films are the highest-grossing series based on a single property, earning over $11 billion at the box office (although the Eon &quot;James Bond&quot; films have earned over $19 billion in total when adjusted to current prices). The Marvel Cinematic Universe has had the most films gross over $1 billion, with eleven. The four &quot;Avengers&quot; films, the two &quot;Frozen&quot; films, and the two &quot;Avatar&quot; films are the only franchises where each installment has grossed over $1 billion, although the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Black Panther&quot; and &quot;Inside Out&quot; series have averaged over $1 billion per film.

<doc id="59893" wikidata="Q132515" url="?curid=59893" title="1950 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 1950 FIFA World Cup was the 4th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football championship for senior men&#x27;s national teams. It was held in Brazil from 24 June to 16 July 1950. It was the first World Cup tournament in over twelve years, as the 1942 and 1946 World Cups were cancelled due to World War II. Italy, the two-time defending champions, were eliminated in the first round for the first time in history. Uruguay, who had won the inaugural competition in 1930, defeated the host nation, Brazil, in the deciding match of the four-team group of the final round, causing what is sometimes known as one of the biggest upsets in sports history, occasionally called the Maracanaço. This was the only tournament not decided by a one-match final. It was also the inaugural tournament where the trophy was referred to as the Jules Rimet Cup, to mark the 25th anniversary of Jules Rimet&#x27;s presidency of FIFA.

==Host selection==

Because of World War II, the World Cup had not been staged since 1938; the planned World Cups of 1942 and 1946 were both cancelled. After the war, FIFA were keen to resurrect the competition as soon as possible, and they began making plans for a World Cup tournament to take place. In the aftermath of the war, much of Europe lay in ruins. As a result, FIFA had difficulties finding a country interested in hosting the event, since many governments believed that their scarce resources ought to be devoted to more urgent priorities than a sporting tournament.

The World Cup was at risk of not being held for sheer lack of interest from the international community, until Brazil presented a bid at the 1946 FIFA Congress, offering to host the event on condition that the tournament take place in 1950 rather than the originally proposed year of 1949. Brazil and Germany had been the leading bidders to host the cancelled 1942 World Cup; since both the 1934 and 1938 tournaments had been held in Europe, football historians generally agree that the 1942 event would most likely have been awarded to a South American host country. Brazil&#x27;s new bid was very similar to the mooted 1942 bid and was quickly accepted.

==Qualification==

Having secured a host nation, FIFA would dedicate some time to persuading countries to send their national teams to compete.
Italy was of particular interest as the long-standing defending champions, having won the two previous tournaments in 1934 and 1938; however, Italy&#x27;s national team was weakened severely as most of its starting line-up perished in the Superga air disaster one year before the start of the tournament. The Italians were eventually persuaded to attend, and travelled by boat rather than by plane.

Brazil (the host country) and Italy (the defending champion) qualified automatically, leaving 14 places remaining. Of these, seven were allocated to Europe, six to the Americas, and one to Asia.

===Former Axis powers===
Both Germany (still occupied and partitioned) and Japan (still occupied) were unable to participate. The Japan Football Association (suspended for failure to pay dues in 1945) and the German Football Association (disbanded in 1945 and reorganised in January 1950) were not readmitted to FIFA until September 1950, while the Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR in East Germany was not admitted to FIFA until 1952. The French-occupied Saarland had been accepted by FIFA two weeks before the World Cup. This is the most recent World Cup finals not to feature Germany in it.

===United Kingdom nations===
The &quot;Home&quot; nations were invited to take part, having rejoined FIFA four years earlier, after 17 years of self-imposed exile. It was decided to use the 1949–50 British Home Championship as a qualifying group, with the top two teams qualifying. England finished first and Scotland second.

===Teams refusing to participate===
A number of teams refused to participate in the qualifying tournament, including most nations behind the Iron Curtain, such as the Soviet Union, 1934 finalists Czechoslovakia, and 1938 finalists Hungary. Ultimately, Yugoslavia was the only Eastern European nation to take part in the tournament.

===Withdrawals during qualification===
Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru in South America withdrew after the qualifying draw, in Argentina&#x27;s case because of a dispute with the Brazilian Football Confederation. This meant that Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay qualified from South America by default. In Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Burma all withdrew, leaving India to qualify by default. In Europe, Austria withdrew, claiming its team was too inexperienced. Belgium also withdrew from the qualification tournament. These withdrawals meant that Switzerland and Turkey qualified without having to play their final round of matches.

===Qualified teams and withdrawals after qualification===
The following 16 teams originally qualified for the final tournament:
Asia (0)
* (withdrew)
Africa (0)
* None qualified

North, Central America and Caribbean (2)
*
South America (5)
* (hosts)
*
* (1930 champions)

Europe (6)
* (debut)
* (1934 &amp; 1938 champions)
* (withdrew)
*
* (withdrew)


Before the qualification competition, George Graham, chairman of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), had said that Scotland would only travel to Brazil as winners of the Home Championship (England, by contrast, had committed to attending, even if they finished in second place). After Scotland ended up in second place behind England, the Scottish captain George Young, encouraged by England captain Billy Wright, pleaded with the SFA to change its mind and accept the place in Brazil; however, Graham refused to change his position and so Scotland withdrew from the tournament.

Turkey also withdrew, citing financial conditions that included the cost of travelling to South America. FIFA invited Portugal, Republic of Ireland and France, who had been eliminated in qualifying, to fill the gaps left by Scotland and Turkey. Portugal and Republic of Ireland refused, but France initially accepted and was entered into the draw.

===Draw and withdrawals after the draw===
The draw, held in Rio on 22 May 1950, allocated the fifteen remaining teams into four groups:
After the draw, the Indian football association, All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided against going to the World Cup, citing travel costs (although FIFA had agreed to bear a major part of the travel expenses), lack of practice time, team selection issues, and valuing the Olympics over the FIFA World Cup. Although FIFA had imposed a rule banning barefoot play following the 1948 Summer Olympics, where India had played barefoot, the Indian captain at the time, Sailen Manna, claimed that this was not part of the AIFF&#x27;s decision. According to Indian sports journalist Jaydeep Basu, India did not participate because the AIFF did not have confidence in its players.

France also withdrew, citing the amount of travel that would be required between the venues of the Group 4 matches. There was not enough time to invite further replacement teams or to reorganise the groups, so the tournament featured only thirteen teams, with just three nations in Group 3 and two nations in Group 4. France&#x27;s withdrawal, coupled with Belgium&#x27;s before qualifying and Romania&#x27;s elimination, meant that Brazil had become the only team to have played in every World Cup from its inauguration in 1930 to date, a mark that has persisted to the present day.

Of the thirteen teams that competed, only one, England, was making its debut. Several of the teams from the Americas teams were competing for the first time since the inaugural 1930 tournament – this included undefeated Uruguay, as well as Mexico, Chile, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Yugoslavia was also making its first appearance since 1930. Spain and the United States qualified for the first time since 1934. This would be the United States&#x27; last appearance at the World Cup finals until 1990, and Bolivia&#x27;s last until 1994.

==Format==
A new playing format was proposed by the Brazilian organisers of the tournament to maximise matches and ticket sales since the stadium and infrastructure were so costly. The 13 teams were divided into four first-round groups (or &quot;pools&quot; as they were then called) of four teams, with the winner of each group advancing to a final group stage, playing in round-robin format to determine the cup winner. A straight knockout tournament, as had been used in 1934 and 1938, would have featured only sixteen games (including the third-place playoff), while the proposed two rounds of the group format would guarantee thirty games, and thus more ticket revenue. In addition, this format would guarantee each team at least three games, and thus provide more incentive for European teams to make the journey to South America and compete. FIFA originally resisted this proposal, but reconsidered when Brazil threatened to back out of hosting the tournament if this format was not used.

In each group, teams were awarded 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw. Had there been a tie on points for first place in a group, a playoff would have been held to determine the group winner.

The entire tournament was arranged in such a way that the four first-round groups had no geographical basis. Hence, several teams were obliged to cover large distances to complete their programme, although Brazil was allowed to play two of its three group matches in Rio de Janeiro while its other group game was held in the relatively nearby city of São Paulo.

==Summary==

A combined Great Britain team had recently beaten the rest of Europe 6–1 in an exhibition match and England went into the competition as one of the favourites; however, they went crashing out after a shock 1–0 defeat by the United States and a 1–0 defeat by Spain. Italy, the defending champions, lost their unbeaten record at the World Cup finals with a 3–2 defeat by Sweden in its opening match and failed to progress to the second round.

The final match in Group 1 between Switzerland and Mexico was the second time a national team did not play in their own kit, the first being 1934 match between Austria and Germany when both teams arrived with white kits, and the Austrians borrowed blue kits from club side Napoli. Both teams arrived with only their red kits, so the Brazilian Football Confederation tossed a coin, with Mexico thus earning the right to play in their own kit, a right they waived as a friendly gesture, allowing the Swiss to wear their own kit while Mexico changed. The local team that lent their shirts was Esporte Clube Cruzeiro from Porto Alegre. The shirts had vertical blue and white stripes.
The final group stage involved the teams that had won their groups: Brazil, Spain, Sweden and 1930 FIFA World Cup champions Uruguay, who were making their first World Cup appearance since winning the inaugural tournament. The World Cup winner would be the team that finished on top of this group. The final group&#x27;s six matches were shared between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil played all its final group matches at the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio while the games that did not involve the host nation were played in São Paulo.

Brazil won their first two matches with a 7–1 thrashing of Sweden and 6–1 rout of Spain, putting them on top of the group with one game left to play against Uruguay; in second and only a point behind. Brazil had scored 23 goals in the tournament and only conceded four, and so were strong favourites. The two teams had played three matches against each other in the Copa Río Branco, played in Brazil two months previously, with one match won by Uruguay 4–3 and two by Brazil (2–1 and 1–0), who won the tournament. Thus the difference in quality between the teams was not excessive; unlike Spain and Sweden the Uruguayans were used to the challenges in the big South American stadiums.

On 16 July, before a huge home crowd of 199,954 (some estimated as 205,000) in the Estádio do Maracanã, the host nation only had to draw against Uruguay and the trophy would be theirs. After such crushing victories over Spain and Sweden, it looked certain they would take the title, and the home nation duly went ahead in the second minute of the second half, thanks to a goal from Friaça. However, Uruguay equalised and then, with just over 11 minutes left to play, went ahead 2–1 when Alcides Ghiggia squeaked a goal past Moacyr Barbosa, so Uruguay was crowned World Cup champions for a second time. This stunning defeat surprised Brazil to the point of shock and is known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot; (&quot;Maracanã blow&quot;). Barbosa was blamed for the defeat, for which he suffered for the rest of his life as the match became part of Brazilian Tragedy. In 2000, shortly before his death, he said in an interview:&quot;The maximum punishment in Brazil is 30 years&#x27; imprisonment, but I have been paying, for something I am not even responsible for, by now, for 50 years.&quot;The average attendance of nearly 61,000 per game, aided greatly by eight matches (including five featuring hosts Brazil) held in the newly built Maracanã, set a record that would not be broken until 1994. Not counting the Maracanã matches, the average attendance was a still-impressive 37,500; however, the only venues that saw crowds comparable to or greater than those in recent World Cups were the Maracanã and São Paulo. Other venues saw considerably smaller crowds.

Antonio Carbajal from Mexico was the last living player from this World Cup, he died in 2023.

==Venues==
Six venues in six cities around Brazil hosted the 22 matches played for this tournament. The Maracanã in the then-capital of Rio de Janeiro hosted eight matches, including all but one of the host&#x27;s matches, including the &quot;Maracanazo&quot; match in the second round-robin group that decided the winners of the tournament. The Pacaembu stadium in São Paulo hosted six matches; these two stadiums in São Paulo and Rio were the only venues that hosted the second round-robin matches. The Estádio Sete de Setembro in Belo Horizonte hosted three matches, the Durival de Britto stadium in Curitiba and the Eucaliptos stadium in Porto Alegre each hosted two matches, and the Ilha do Retiro stadium in far-away Recife only hosted one match. In order to present itself as a modern country, Brazil invested a today&#x27;s equivalent of 290 million US-Dollars into new stadiums. The newly built Maracanã cost around 275 million US-Dollars alone.

<text>William &quot;Willie&quot; D. Davenport (June 8, 1943 – June 17, 2002) was an American sprint runner.

== Biography ==
He attended Howland High School and college at Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Davenport took part in his first Olympics in 1964, but injured his thigh and was eliminated in the semifinals. He competed in the 110 m hurdles at the 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics, winning a gold medal in 1968 and a bronze in 1976, and finishing fourth in 1972. In 1980 he took part in the Winter Olympics as a runner for the American bobsleigh team. Because of the boycott, and the quirk of participating in the Winter Olympics, he was the only U.S. track and field athlete to participate in the 1980 Olympics. In Mexico City in 1968, he reached the final and won, later saying, &quot;From the first step, the gun, I knew I had won the race.&quot; In 1972 he finished fourth, and in his third consecutive Olympic 110 m hurdles final, in 1976, he won a bronze medal.

Davenport was a member of the Southern Jaguars football team in college, and immediately departed the 1968 Olympics after winning the gold to join the team for the final games. He was drafted by the New Orleans Saints as a wide receiver in the sixth round (138th overall) of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft, but a misunderstanding about his college eligibility prompted the Saints to withdraw the selection. When it turned out he was allowed to play, the San Diego Chargers picked him in the 16th round (408th overall) but he and the team could not agree to a contract. The Saints drafted him again in 1970 in the 12th round (296th overall) as a defensive back, though he did not join them either.

At his last Olympics in 1980, Davenport was a bobsleigh runner, ending up 12th in the four-man competition. Davenport&#x27;s other achievements include five national championships in the 60 yard hurdles indoor event. By participating in the 1980 bobsleigh competition, he became one of the first two African Americans to compete in the bobsled in the Winter Olympics. Jeff Gadley, a decathlete from State University of New York at Plattsburgh, competed internationally in the four-man bobsled for the US the year before the Lake Placid Olympics, then Davenport joined Gadley&#x27;s team right before the 1980 Olympics. Davenport drew much media attention, but was not the first.

In 1985, Davenport competed at the Masters Outdoor World Championship in Rome.

Davenport died of a heart attack at age 59 at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport on June 17, 2002. He was a U.S. Army private at the time of his first Olympic participation and a colonel in the United States Army National Guard at the time of his death.

==Legacy==

In 1977 he was inducted into the Mt. SAC Relays Hall of Fame, and in 1982 into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

<text>Degaga &quot;Mamo&quot; Wolde (; 12 June 1932 – 26 May 2002) was an Ethiopian long distance runner who competed in track, cross-country, and road running events. He was the winner of the marathon at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Degaga was born on 12 June 1932 in Ada&#x27;a to an Oromo family. His younger brother, Demissie Wolde (b. 8 March 1937), also became an international distance running star.

In 1951, Degaga moved to Addis Ababa.

==Athletics career==
At his first Olympic appearance in 1956, Degaga competed in the 800 m, 1,500 m and the 4x400 relay.

He did not compete in the 1960 Summer Olympics, when Abebe Bikila became the first Ethiopian to win a gold medal. Degaga claimed his absence was due to the government&#x27;s desire to send him on a peacekeeping mission to the Congo during the Congo Crisis. According to him, in the government&#x27;s ensuing conflict with the Ethiopian Olympic Committee, who wanted him to compete, he did not get sent to either event. However, athlete Said Moussa Osman, who represented Ethiopia in the 800 m at the 1960 Olympics, stated that Degaga lost at the trials and did not make it to the team.

Beginning in the 1960s, Degaga&#x27;s focus changed from middle distance races to long distances. He made Ethiopia&#x27;s first mark at international cross-country races when he took the International Juan Muguerza in Elgoibar, Spain, winning in 1963 and 1964, and at the Cross de San Donostin in San Sebastian, Spain, in the same years. He placed fourth in the 10,000 m at the 1964 Summer Olympics, which was won by Billy Mills of the United States in one of the biggest upsets in the history of Olympic competition. Demissie also became a marathon runner.

Both brothers competed in Tokyo, in the 1964 Olympic marathon. On 3 August 1964, in the Ethiopian Olympic trials, a race held at 8,000 feet, Degaga qualified by running 2:16:19.2, just 4/10ths of a second behind Abebe Bikela, with Demissie finishing 2:19:30, for 3rd place. Although Degaga dropped out early, Demessie, after being among the leaders for much of the 1964 Olympic race, finished tenth in 2:21:25.2. On 21 April 1965, as part of the opening ceremonies for the second season of the 1964/1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Abebe and Degaga participated in an exclusive ceremonial half marathon. They ran from the Arsenal in Central Park at 64th Street &amp; Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to the Singer Bowl at the fair. They carried with them a parchment scroll with greetings from Haile Selassie. In 1967, he repeated his wins in San Sebastian and Elgiobar, and won again at the latter event in 1968.

In the 1968 Summer Olympics, Degaga became the second Ethiopian to win gold in the marathon. Earlier in the same Olympics, he had won the silver medal in the 10,000 m. At the age of 40, Degaga won his third Olympic medal placing third in 2:15:08 at the 1972 Olympic marathon, while Demissie placed 18th in 2:20:44.0. Degaga also won the marathon race in the 1973 All-Africa Games. He blamed his Olympic third place showing in 1972 on ill-fitting shoes forced on him by Ethiopian officials. He became only the second person in Olympic history (Bikila was the first) to medal in successive Olympic marathons. Both medalists who finished ahead of Degaga, Frank Shorter from the U.S.A., and Belgium&#x27;s Karel Lismont would repeat Degaga&#x27;s feat in 1976 as they finished second and third behind East Germany&#x27;s Waldemar Cierpinski. Cierpinski repeated his win in 1980. Since Cierpnski, Erick Wainaina finished third in Atlanta in 1996 and second in Sydney in 2000, and Eliud Kipchoge won in Rio in 2016 and in Tokyo in 2021. Degaga also won the marathon race in the 1973 All-Africa Games.

==Military career==
In 1951, Degaga joined the Imperial Guard. He later served as a peacekeeper in Korea from 1953 to 1955.

==Arrest==
In 1993, Degaga was arrested on the accusation that he participated in a Red Terror execution during the regime of the dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. He argued that although he was present at the killing, he was not a direct participant. The IOC campaigned the Ethiopian government for his release. In early 2002 he was convicted and sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Therefore, he was released because he had spent nine years in detention already waiting for his trial.

==Death==
On 26 May 2002, Degaga died of liver cancer at age 69, just a few months after his release. He had been married twice and had three children; a son, Samuel, with his first wife, and two children, Addis Alem and Tabor, with his second wife. Degaga is interred in Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church Cemetery in Addis Ababa.

<text>Chatham ( ) is a town within the Medway unitary authority in the ceremonial county of Kent, England. The town forms a conurbation with neighbouring towns Gillingham, Rochester, Strood and Rainham. In 2020 it had a population of 80,596.

The town developed around Chatham Dockyard and several army barracks, together with 19th-century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. The Corps of Royal Engineers is still based in Chatham at Brompton Barracks.

The dockyard closed in 1984, but the remaining naval buildings are an attraction for a flourishing tourist industry. Following closure, part of the site was developed as a commercial port, other parts were redeveloped for business and residential use, and part was used as the Chatham Historic Dockyard museum. Its attractions include the submarine .

The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping centre.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Chatham&quot; is first attested in a charter of 880 (surviving in a twelfth-century manuscript); it appears again in a charter of 975 as &quot;Cætham&quot;, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ceteham&quot;. The first element of the name comes from the Common Brittonic word that survives in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). The second element is the Old English word (&quot;settlement&quot;). At the point when the current name was coined, then, it meant &quot;settlement at Chat&quot;. The Old English term for the settlement&#x27;s inhabitants is also reconstructable from a twelfth-century copy of a charter of 995, as *.

==History==
The A2 road passes by Chatham along the line of the ancient Celtic route. It was paved by the Romans, and named Watling Street by the Anglo-Saxons. Among archaeological finds here have been the remains of a Roman-era cemetery.

Chatham was long a small village on the banks of the river. By the 16th century, warships were being moored at Jillingham water (Gillingham), because of its strategic sheltered location between London and the Continent. It was established as a Royal Dockyard by Queen Elizabeth I in 1568, and most of the dockyard lies within Gillingham. Initially a refitting base, it became a shipbuilding yard; from then until the late 19th century, further expansion of the yard took place. In its time, many thousands of men were employed at the dockyard, and many hundreds of vessels were launched there, including &quot;HMS Victory,&quot; which was built there in the 1760s. After World War I, many submarines were also built in Chatham Dockyard.
In addition to Chatham Dockyard, defensive fortifications were built to protect it from attack. Upnor Castle had been built in 1567, but had proved ineffectual; the Dutch raid on the Medway in 1667 showed that more defences were required. The fortifications, which became more elaborate as the threat of invasion grew, were begun in 1756 as a complex across the neck of the peninsula formed by the bend in the River Medway, and included Fort Amherst. The threat of a land-based attack from the south during the 19th century led to the construction of more forts.

The second phase of fort-building (1806-19) included Fort Pitt (later used as a hospital and the site of the first Army Medical School). The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom ordered, &quot;inter alia&quot;, a third outer ring of forts: these included Fort Luton, Fort Bridgewoods, and Fort Borstal.

These fortifications required military personnel to man them and Army Barracks to house those men. These included Kitchener Barracks (c 1750-80), the Royal Marine Barracks (c 1780), Brompton Artillery Barracks (1806) and Melville Barracks (opened 1820 as a Naval Hospital, RM Barracks from 1905). HMS Collingwood and HMS Pembroke were both Naval Barracks.

In response to the huge manpower needs, the village of Chatham and other nearby villages and towns grew commensurately. Trams, and later buses, linked those places to bring in the workforce. The area between the High Street and Luton village illustrates part of that growth, with its many streets of Victorian terraces.

The importance of Chatham Dockyard gradually declined as Britain&#x27;s naval resources were reduced or moved to other locations, and eventually, on 31 March 1984, it shut. The dockyard buildings were preserved as the historic site Chatham Historic Dockyard (operated by Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust), which was under consideration as a World Heritage Site the site is being used for other purposes. Part of the St Mary&#x27;s Island section is now used as a marina, and the remainder is being developed for housing, commercial and other uses, branded as &quot;Chatham Maritime&quot;.

==Governance==
Chatham lost its independence as a borough under the Local Government Act 1972, by which, on 1 April 1974, it became part of the Borough of Medway, a non-metropolitan district of the county of Kent; under subsequent renaming the borough became the Borough of Rochester-upon-Medway (1979); and, from 1982, the City of Rochester-upon-Medway. Under the most recent change, in 1998, and with the addition of the Borough of Gillingham, the Borough of Medway became a unitary authority area, administratively separate from Kent. It remains part of the county of Kent for ceremonial purposes.

Medway Council has recently moved its main administration building to Gun Wharf, the site of the earliest part of the dockyard, a former Lloyd&#x27;s office building. It was built between 1976 and 1978 and is Grade II listed.

Chatham is part of the parliamentary constituency of Chatham and Aylesford. Before 1997, Chatham had been included in the constituencies of Mid Kent, Rochester and Chatham and Chatham.

Chatham has proven to be a marginal parliamentary seat. Since 1945, the members of parliament for Chatham have been as follows:

==Geography==



Chatham is situated where the lower part of the dip slope of the North Downs meets the River Medway which at this point is flowing in a south–north direction. This gives the right bank, where the town stands, considerable advantages from the point of view of river use. Compared with opposite bank, the river is fast-flowing and deep; the illustration (1), an early print of the settlement, is taken from the point where Fort Pitt now stands. The town lies below at river level, curving round to occupy a south-easterly trending valley (The Brook), in which lies the High Street. Beyond the Chatham Dockyard was marshy land, now called St Mary&#x27;s Island, and has several new developments of housing estates. The New Road crosses the scene below the vantage point of the illustration.

Illustration (2) is taken from the opposite side of the valley: the Pentagon Shopping Centre is to the right, with the building on the ridge left of centre, Fort Pitt and Rochester lies beyond that ridge; and Frindsbury is on the rising ground in the right distance.

The valley continues southeastwards as the Luton Valley, in which is the erstwhile village of that name; and Capstone Valley. The &quot;Darland Banks&quot;, the northern slopes of the Luton Valley above these valleys, are unimproved chalk grassland. The photograph (3), taken from the Banks and looking south, shows the village in the centre, with the rows of Victorian terraced housing, which unusually follow the contour lines. The opposite slopes are the ‘&#x27;Daisy Banks&#x27;’ and ‘&#x27;Coney Banks&#x27;’, along which some of the defensive forts were built (including Fort Luton, in the trees to the left)

Until the start of the 20th century, most of the south part of the borough was entirely rural, with a number of farms and large tracts of woodland. The beginning of what is now Walderslade was when a speculative builder began to build the core of the village in &quot;Walderslade Bottoms&quot;.

==Demography==
Chatham became a market town in its own right in the 19th century, and a municipal borough in 1890. By 1831 its population had reached more than 16,000. By 1961 it had reached 48,800.

==Economy==
The closure of the Royal Navy Dockyard on 31 March 1984 had the effect of changing the employment statistics of the town. About 7,000 people lost their jobs. The unemployment rate went up to 23.5%. From early April 1984 to December 1985, and onwards, the Medway Towns began to have an increase in alcohol and drug-related, antisocial behaviour, which many residents then realized had largely been caused by the closure of the Royal Navy Dockyard on 31 March 1984, and the resulting mass redundancies. There has been a concerted effort to revitalise the Thames Gateway area and one of the largest employers in Chatham is now Vanquis Bank Ltd, a subsidiary of Vanquis Banking Group.

==Landmarks==
The Chatham Naval Memorial commemorates the 18,500 officers, ranks and ratings of the Royal Navy who were lost or buried at sea in World War I and World War II. The Chatham Naval Memorial was constructed from March 1924 to October 1924. The addition of the obelisk and Portland stone plaque walls and surroundings were constructed between June 1952 to October 1952. It stands on the Great Lines, the escarpment ridge between Chatham and Gillingham.

The Grade II listed building Chatham Town Hall was built in January 1900; it stands in The Brook, and is of a unique architectural design. With Chatham being part of the Medway Towns, it took on a new role as the Medway Arts Centre on 20 April 1987, with the promotional motto &quot;Putting The Arts Back into The Medway&quot;. There were many events held within the Medway Arts Centre, including stage plays, themed nights and snooker tournaments. Likewise during May 1990, the Medway Arts Centre organised a large parade, composed of dancers, musicians, artists and sculptors, who stood upon theatrical lorry floats. The vehicles were initially parked up next to the entrance into the Theatre Royal Cafe, a popular restaurant in the Chatham Town Hall, on Whiffens Avenue, and then started to travel along Military Road in Chatham, and onward to Rochester, Strood and Frindsbury, where sweets, chocolate, posters, badges, plastic hats, leaflets, stickers and T-shirts were handed out to the crowds, to promote the Medway Arts Centre. On 28 April 1997, the Medway Arts Centre became the &quot;Brook Theatre&quot;. 

The Pentagon Shopping Centre stands in Chatham Town Centre and serviced the Pentagon Bus Station that was closed on 30 September 2011. Chatham Waterfront bus station opened in October 2011, replacing the previous Pentagon Bus Station in Chatham, which was opened in October 1970, before the Pentagon Shopping Centre was opened in June 1975. The Pentagon Bus Station was considered an unwelcoming environment for passengers. This was because of the diesel fumes from the buses, coaches and minibuses, and because the waiting areas would sometimes become very crowded as customers from D &amp; A Toys, Bejam and C&amp;A would also emerge from those shops and others, as they regularly used the upstairs shops. escalators and stairs in the Pentagon Shopping Centre, to get on board the green buses, coaches and minibuses that were managed by Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services.

==Transport==

The Medway, apart from Chatham Dockyard, has always had an important role in communication: historically it provided a means for the transport of goods to and from the interior of Kent. Stone, timber and iron from the Weald for shipbuilding and agricultural produce were among the cargoes. Sun Pier in Chatham was one of many such along the river. By 1740, barges of forty tons could navigate as far upstream as Tonbridge. Today its use is confined to tourist traffic; apart from the marina, there are many yacht moorings on the river itself.

The position of the road network in Chatham began with the building of the Roman Road (Watling Street, which passed through the town. Turnpike trusts were established locally, so that the length from Chatham to Canterbury was turnpiked in 1730; and the Chatham to Maidstone road (now the A230) was also turnpiked before 1750. The High Street was bypassed in 1769, by the &quot;New Road&quot; (see illustration (1)) leading from the top of Star Hill Rochester, to the bottom of Chatham Hill at Luton Arches. This also became inadequate for the London cross-channel traffic and the &quot;Medway Towns Bypass&quot;, the M2 motorway, was constructed to divert through traffic south of the Medway Towns.

Chatham is the hub of the Medway Towns. This fact means that the existing roadway system has always proved inadequate for the amount of traffic it has to handle, and various schemes have been tried by Rochester-Upon-Medway City Council, to alleviate the congestion. The High Street itself is traffic free, so all traffic on Best Street and Railway Street has to skirt around it. The basic west–east routes are The Brook to the north and New Road to the south, but the additional problems caused by the situation of the Pentagon Bus Station meant that conflicting traffic flows were the result, from 1975 and onward. From April 1986 and onward until October 1987, the town centre remodelling of Chatham began, and Railway Street was realigned into becoming part of an inner ring road, that became a one-way system. This redevelopment included the demolition of the House of Holland department store in January 1987, and the construction of the &quot;Sir John Hawkins Flyover&quot; in Chatham, that was opened in February 1989, so the traffic could be carried from south to north over the High Street.

In September 2006, the one-way system was abandoned and two-way traffic reintroduced on most of the ring-road system. Further work on the road system commenced early in 2009, and as of early 2010, the demolition of the &quot;Sir John Hawkins Flyover&quot; has been completed. It was replaced by a street-level, buses only, road coupled with repositioning of the bus station. The new Waterfront bus station opened in October 2011.

Chatham railway station, opened in 1858, serves both the North Kent and the Chatham Main Lines, and is the interchange between the two lines. It lies in the valley between the Fort Pitt and the Chatham Tunnels. There are three trains an hour to London Victoria, two trains an hour to London Charing Cross, two trains an hour to Luton (via London Bridge, St Pancras and Luton Airport Parkway) and two services an hour to St Pancras via High Speed 1. The former services run to Dover and Ramsgate; the Charing Cross services terminate at Gillingham and the High Speed services terminate at Faversham.

Part of the industrial railway in what is now Chatham Historic Dockyard is still in operation, run by the North Kent Industrial Locomotive Society for the Dockyard Trustees.

Buses are operated by Arriva Southern Counties and Nu-Venture to various destinations. They serve other towns in Medway including Gillingham, Grain, Strood and Rochester and also to other towns in Kent including Maidstone, Gravesend, Blue Bell Hill and Sittingbourne. There is also an express bus via Strood and Rochester and A2 to Bluewater in Greenhithe.

==Religion==
In the 19th century the ecclesiastical parish of Chatham included Luton and Brompton and also Chatham Intra (land on the river that was administered by the City of Rochester).
Chatham&#x27;s parish church, St Marys, which stood on Dock Road, was rebuilt in 1788. St John&#x27;s was a Waterloo church built in 1821 by Robert Smirke, and restructured in 1869 by Gordon Macdonald Hills; it ceased being an active church in 1964, and is currently used as an art project. St Paul&#x27;s New Road was built in 1854; declared redundant in 1974, it has been demolished. St Peter&#x27;s Troy Town was built in 1860. Christchurch Luton was built in 1843, replaced in 1884. The Royal Dockyard Church (1806) was declared redundant in 1981.

St Michael&#x27;s is a Roman Catholic Church, that was built in 1863. There is a Unitarian Chapel built in 1861.

Chatham is reputed to be the home of the first Baptist Chapel in North Kent, the Zion Baptist Chapel in Clover Street. The first known pastor was Edward Morecock who settled there in 1663. During the time of Oliver Cromwell Edward Morecock had been a sea-captain and had been injured in battle. His knowledge of the River Medway is reputed to have preserved him from persecution in the reign of King Charles II. A second Baptist chapel was founded about 1702. The Ebenezer Chapel dates from 1662.

Chatham Memorial Synagogue was built by Simon Magnus in 1867 on the Chatham end of Rochester High Street in Rochester.

==Popular culture==
On a cultural level, Chatham gave birth to several creative movements in literature, art and music. In the period from October 1977 until March 1982 the Medway Delta Sound emerged. The term was coined as a joke by the Chatham-born writer, painter and musician Billy Childish after the Medway-based record label of Russ Wilkins, Empire Records, used the phrase &quot;From The Medway Delta&quot;. Several Medway Delta bands gained international recognition, including The Milkshakes, The Prisoners (see also James Taylor Quartet) and The Dentists.

Out of the Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design (KIAD), now the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) came the band known as Wang Chung. The vocalist and guitarist with Wang Chung, Jeremy Ryder, who is better known as Jack Hues attended KIAD. Alongside such individuals was Alan Denman, who became a well established lecturer at KIAD, and who founded The Flying Circuits in April 1984, which became an urban theatre movement in the Medway Towns. Many students from KIAD played various acting roles within The Flying Circuits, in Chatham, Gillingham and London. The scenes performed by The Flying Circuits were entirely based upon excerpts from the Electronic Town, a screenplay written by Alan Denman from January 1984 to October 1984, which concerned a futuristic science fiction dystopia. Alan Denman also helped to form The Medway Poets with Billy Childish, Robert Earl, Bill Lewis, Sexton Ming and Charles Thomson. The Medway Poets met regularly at the York Tavern &amp; Railway Inn, in Ordnance Street, Chatham, from 1974 to 1985, near KIAD at Fort Pitt in Rochester, and Chatham railway station. Chatham has always had a strong musical and creative arts heritage that has remained centred on local groups, many of whom were also part of the KIAD. Charles Thomson and Billy Childish went on to create the artistic movement known as Stuckism in 1999.

There was a resurgence in the live music scene in February 2001, with an initial focus on the Tap &#x27;N&#x27; Tin venue at 24 Railway Street in Chatham. The essence of the original greatness of the Medway Delta Sound was revived by music and poetry evenings promoted by David Wise&#x27;s Urban Fox Press, which also published several books by Medway poets and artists. In 2008. the independent arts organisation Medway Eyes was founded, specialising in music and photography. It had promoted several arts exhibitions and gigs at The Barge, at 63 Layfield Road, in Gillingham (now closed) and the Nag&#x27;s Head at 292 Rochester High Street, but disbanded in 2013.

The Medway Poets were formed in August 1975 and disbanded in March 1982 having performed at the Kent Literature Festival and many others in South East England and on TV and Radio. They became a significant influence to writers in Chatham and elsewhere in the Medway Towns. From the core of this group the anti conceptual/pro painting movement of Remodernism came into being.

Recent Medway artists of note include Kid Harpoon, Crybaby Special and The Monsters, Red Light, Underground Heroes, Tyrannosaurus Alan, Pete Molinari, Lupen Crook, Brigadier Ambrose, Stuart Turner and Theatre Royal.

The term &#x27;Chav&#x27;, research suggests, does not derive from the name of Chatham (&quot;Chatham Average&quot;), but is derived from the Romany word for &#x27;Youngster&#x27;. Before the Chatham Dockyard was closed down on 31 March 1984, the cultural idea of the Chav did not exist in the Medway Towns.

<doc id="59906" wikidata="Q489097" url="?curid=59906" title="Ernst &amp; Young">
<text>Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited, trading as EY, is a British multinational professional services partnership. EY is one of the largest professional services networks in the world. Along with Deloitte, KPMG and PwC, it is one of the Big Four accounting firms. It primarily provides assurance, tax, information technology services (including managed services in areas like Cybersecurity, Cloud, Digital Transformation and AI), consulting, and advisory services to its clients.

EY operates as a network of member firms which are structured as separate legal entities in a partnership, which has 395,442 employees in over 700 offices in more than 150 countries. The firm&#x27;s current partnership was formed in 1989 by a merger of two accounting firms: Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. It was named Ernst &amp; Young until a rebranding campaign officially changed its name to EY in 2013, although this initialism was already used informally prior to its sanctioning adoption.

In 2023, EY was the seventh-largest privately owned organization in the United States, and EY has for 25 years been continuously ranked on &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For, longer than any other accounting firm. The firm has, however, repeatedly come under scrutiny for systemic issues in their training, hiring, and work culture.

== History ==
=== Early history and mergers ===
EY resulted from several mergers of ancestor firms over the last century and a half, the oldest of which was founded in 1849, in England, as Harding &amp; Pullein. That same year, this firm was joined by an accountant named Frederick Whinney, who, a decade later, became a partner. After his son joined the firm, it was later renamed Whinney, Smith &amp; Whinney, in 1894.

In 1903, the firm Ernst &amp; Ernst was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, by Alwin C. Ernst, and his brother, Theodore Ernst. In 1906, Arthur Young &amp; Co. was set up by a Scottish accountant, Arthur Young, in Chicago. Starting in 1924, these two American firms became allied with prominent British firms; Young with Broads Paterson &amp; Co.; and Ernst with the aforementioned Whinney Smith &amp; Whinney. The latter of these two mergers spawned Anglo-American partnership Ernst &amp; Whinney in 1979, then the fourth largest accountancy firm in the world.

A decade later, in 1989, Ernst &amp; Whinney merged with the fifth largest firm globally at the time, Arthur Young &amp; Co., to create Ernst &amp; Young.

=== Later developments ===

In October 1997, Ernst &amp; Young announced plans to merge its global practices with professional services network KPMG, to create the largest professional services organization in the world. The announcement came on the heels of an announced merger between Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand only a month earlier. These plans were soon abandoned in February 1998, due to several factors ranging from client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems, and the anticipated difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures. The merger between Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, however, went ahead as planned, creating PwC.

Ernst &amp; Young expanded its consulting practice heavily during the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and various members of the investment community, began to raise concerns about a potential conflict of interests. This conflict would be brought about by firms offering both consulting and auditing services simultaneously to overlapping clients, a common practice among the &quot;Big Five&quot;. In May 2000, Ernst &amp; Young was the first of those firms to fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company Capgemini for $11 billion, creating the new company Capgemini Ernst &amp; Young, which was later renamed back to Capgemini.

=== Recent history, re-branding and expansion ===

In 2002, Ernst &amp; Young serviced a large chunk of the clients previously working with Arthur Andersen after their downfall in connection with the Enron scandal, although it did not engage with any new Arthur Andersen clients from the United Kingdom, China, or the Netherlands. Four years later, Ernst &amp; Young became the only member of the Big Four to have two member firms in the United States, with the inclusion of Mitchell &amp; Titus, LLP in 2006, the largest minority-owned accounting firm in the United States. Mitchell &amp; Titus ended its membership in the EY network effective October 30, 2015.

In April 2009, Reuters reported that Ernst &amp; Young, spurred by the global economic downturn, had launched a cost-saving initiative encouraging its staff in China to take 40 days of low-pay leave between the summer of 2009 and the summer of 2010. Those who participated got a prorated salary equal to 20% of a regular salary, plus the benefits of a full-time employee. The initiative applied to employees in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, where the firm&#x27;s employees numbered 8,500 in total. In 2010, Ernst &amp; Young acquired Terco, the Brazilian member firm of Grant Thornton.
In 2013, the firm officially changed its brand from Ernst &amp; Young to EY, and christened the accompanying tagline: &quot;Building a better working world&quot;.

Also in 2013, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church hired EY to help review Vatican City State&#x27;s finances and help &quot;verify and consult&quot; the institution&#x27;s administration, including the museums, post office and tax-free department store. EY expanded further and acquired all of KPMG Denmark&#x27;s operations including its 150 partners, 1,500 employees and 21 offices.

In 2014, EY acquired global strategy consulting firm The Parthenon Group, gaining 350 consultants in its then-Transaction Advisory Services practice so that it could provide in-house strategy consulting services to its clients. The business unit has since been rebranded as EY-Parthenon and is one of the most selective strategy consultancies worldwide.

In 2015, EY opened its first global Security Operations Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala in India, and coincidentally invested $20 million over 5 years to combat the increasing threat of cybercrimes.

In 2017 EY announced it was opening an executive support center in Tucson, Arizona, US, creating 125 new jobs. That same year, the company opened a Digital Security Operations Center, located in Muscat, Oman, to cover the EMEIA region as part of a $10 million investment.

In 2018, EY opened a $4.4 million professional services center in Louisville, Kentucky, US, creating 125 new jobs, and announced it would open an IT / tech hub in Nashville, TN, US, creating 600 regional jobs.

In November 2022, it was announced EY had acquired the Sydney-headquartered data and analytics specialists, Bridge Business Consulting.

===Project Everest===

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in May 2022 that the firm might split its accounting and advisory divisions into two new, separate businesses. The plan, referred to internally as &quot;Project Everest&quot; would involve the consulting business completing an initial public offering, the proceeds of which would be used to compensate partners at the new, separate auditing company. The firm&#x27;s debt has proven to be an internal obstacle to the split. The debt is mostly owed to former partners of EY, taking the form of what the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; characterized as &quot;effectively an unfunded pension plan&quot;. Would-be partners of the new accounting firm have expressed reservations as their descendant firm, the smaller of the new organizations, would presumably absorb most of the debt. On 5 September 2022, the firm announced that partners would vote on whether to split EY into two businesses. EY&#x27;s member firms in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Israel stated that they would not split. Rival firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have said they do not intend to imitate EY.

In March 2023, Julie Boland, head of EY US, stated in a webcast that the split would be temporarily paused amid internal debate over the proportioning of its tax service line among the proposed consulting and assurance spinoffs.

The firm cancelled Project Everest as the US portion of the firm withdrew its support for the split in April 2023. Preparing and planning for the split cost EY $600 million.

== Global structure ==
The firm is organized geographically into three areas: Europe, Middle East, India and Africa; the Americas; and Asia-Pacific.

In 2018, the company underwent a transformation of some of its region borders, primarily the union of its CIS region (operating in the former Soviet Union) and the CEE region (Eastern Europe) to create the CESA block.

==Services==
Over the course of its operations, EY has transformed its business model and diversified its pool of offered services. Over the course of the last decade EY has substantially altered its business approach to offer a more comprehensive scope of services. This is mainly attributed to an intensified competition in the existing market of professional services, and competition in new markets: investment banking and strategic consultancy. According to the latest published data, the company has the following four main service lines:
* Assurance: comprises Financial Audit, Financial Accounting Advisory Services, CCaSS (Climate Change and Sustainability services) and Forensic &amp; Integrity Services.
* Tax: Transfer Pricing, International Tax Services, Business Tax Compliance, Global Trade, Indirect Tax, Tax Accounting &amp; Risk Advisory Services, Tax Technology and Transformation, Transaction Tax.
* Consulting: comprises three sub-service lines – Business Consulting, Technology Consulting, and People Advisory Services.
* Strategy and Transactions (SaT): deals with companies&#x27; capital transformation – including Valuation, Modelling, and Economics (VME); Transactions Due Diligence; Real Estate Advisory; M&amp;A; Turnaround &amp; Restructuring (financial and operational); Corporate Finance.
* People Advisory Services: HR, immigration, workforce mobility programs
* Core Business Services: business development, marketing, legal, risk management

== Accounting scandals ==
===Audit practices===
EY has been involved in many accounting scandals: Bank of Credit and Commerce International (1991), Informix Corporation (1996), Sybase (1997), Cendant (1998), One.Tel (2001), AOL (2002), HealthSouth Corporation (2003), Chiquita Brands International (2004), Lehman Brothers (2010), Sino-Forest Corporation (2011), Olympus Corporation (2011), Stagecoach Group (2017), Wirecard (2020), Luckin Coffee (2020) and NMC Health (2020).

In 2004, Ernst &amp; Young was punished for forming a lucrative business arrangement with one of its audit clients, PeopleSoft, thus creating a conflict of interest. As a result, the firm was barred by the SEC from accepting any new publicly traded companies as audit clients for six months.

In April 2004, Equitable Life, a UK life assurance company, sued EY after nearly collapsing but abandoned the case in September 2005. EY described the case as &quot;a scandalous waste of time, money and resources for all concerned.&quot;

In 2009, EY, the former auditors of Sons of Gwalia, agreed to a $125m settlement over their role in the gold miner&#x27;s collapse in 2004. Ferrier Hodgson, the company&#x27;s administrator, had claimed EY was negligent over the accounting of gold and dollar hedging contracts. However, EY said that the proposed settlement was not an admission of any liability.

Following allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that EY had committed accounting fraud in its work auditing the books of Bally Total Fitness, EY reached two settlements in 2008, including a fine of $8.5 million.

EY Hong Kong resigned from the audit of Standard Water on when it emerged that although EY Hong Kong had signed off the audit, it had been effectively outsourced to the affiliate in mainland China, which had received 99.98% of the fee. This was important because shareholders have less confidence in mainland auditors and because audit papers on the mainland are subject to state secrecy laws and can be withheld from outside regulators. EY&#x27;s quality and risk management leader (Greater China) even testified in the Court of First Instance that he was not sure whether there was a formal agreement covering the relationship between the two EY entities. The court case in 2013 came as US regulators were taking an interest in similar cases of accounting fraud in mainland China.

In September 2016, the US securities regulatory SEC fined EY US US$9.3 million for failures, including an auditor&#x27;s romantic involvement with a client. Another partner on the team who was auditing a different public company became romantically involved with its chief accounting officer.

In October 2016, EY settled with the SEC because they were unable to detect financial statement fraud that was committed by the Weatherford tax department. Weatherford misstated their financial statements by manipulating the income tax line item in their financials. EY was Weatherford&#x27;s independent auditors when the fraud was perpetrated.

In October 2016, Mozilla stopped accepting WebTrust audits from Ernst &amp; Young Hong Kong due to their failure &quot;to detect multiple issues they should have detected&quot; during their audits of WoSign.

In February 2017, in response to questions regarding misissued certificates, Symantec stated they would no longer accept WebTrust audits from E&amp;Y Korea and E&amp;Y Brazil due to deficiencies in these audits.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in 2019, EY had audited WeWork the office-space company that &quot;nearly collapsed after fumbling a planned initial public offering&quot;.

In April 2020, a former partner and whistleblower was awarded $10.8 million for ethical misconduct by EY in a Dubai gold audit by the high court in London. EY appealed the decision, but then dropped the appeal in March 2021.

In 2020, EY failed to uncover $2 billion that was missing at Wirecard AG, a German fintech payment processing company. This resulted in a lawsuit filed against EY in June 2020. An investigation by the Bundestag revealed in April 2021 that EY&#x27;s audits of defunct payments group Wirecard suffered from serious shortcomings over a period of years.

EY also failed to identify $300 million in &quot;fabricated sales&quot; in their 2020 audit of the coffee chain Luckin Coffee and $5 billion in &quot;undisclosed debt&quot; at NMC Health and Finablr.

In August 2021, EY US agreed to pay US$10 million as part of a settlement with the SEC related to charges of auditor independence misconduct perpetrated by several of its partners to secure Sealed Air as a client.

In August 2021, UK accounting regulatory Financial Reporting Council (FRC) fined EY UK £3.5 million (US$4.8 million) for failing to challenge financial statements in its 2017 audit of UK transport company, Stagecoach Group. In addition, the auditing engagement partner Mark Harvey was sanctioned and fined £100,000. EY&#x27;s fine was subsequently cut to £2.2 million for admitting to the failings, with Harvey&#x27;s fine reduced to £70,000 for the same reason.

In December 2021, EY filed a criminal complaint against unknown persons with Munich prosecutors relating to the alleged leak of a classified German parliamentary report relating to its role in the collapse of payments firm, Wirecard, to the German newspaper, Handelsblatt.

In April 2022 the administrators of NMC Health filed a $2.5 billion lawsuit against EY, alleging negligence during its work on NMC&#x27;s accounts spanning a seven-year period.

In 2023, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reported on four EY Canada audits conducted in 2022 and found that half had &quot;multiple deficiencies&quot;.

In April 2023, the German Abschlussprüferaufsichtstelle (APAS) (the federal watchdog, responsible for the oversight on auditors) assessed, that EY has committed violations of duty on its Wirecard mandate and prohibited the company for two years to accept new audit mandates for companies at the German stock exchange.

In December 2024, a lawsuit was filed against EY accusing it of assisting the UAE-based Brooge Petroleum and Gas Investment Company FZE in defrauding investors during a 2019 special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. It alleges that Brooge fabricated financial data through fake invoices, customers and affiliated parties and forged 30-80% of its revenues between 2018 and 2020. EY allegedly supported Brooge’s scheme by “issuing unqualified audit opinions”. The lawsuit was filed by a group of Boorge Energy shareholders, who accused EY of fraud and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs were seeking damages, interest, and legal fees. 

===Exam cheating by audit professionals===

In June 2022, the SEC fined the firm US$100 million &quot;for cheating by its audit professionals on exams required to obtain and maintain Certified Public Accountant (CPA) licenses, and for withholding evidence of this misconduct from the SEC&#x27;s Enforcement Division during the Division&#x27;s investigation of the matter&quot;. EY admitted &quot;the facts underlying the SEC’s charges&quot; and the penalty is a record imposed on a US audit firm. The Canadian Public Accountability Board has announced that it will investigate whether EY&#x27;s Canadian arm was involved in similar practices.

=== Investment banking ===
In 2009, in the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy, EY was criticised by politicians and the shareholders of Anglo Irish Bank for failing to detect large loans to Seán FitzPatrick, its chairman, during its audits. The Irish Government had to subsequently take full ownership of the Bank at a cost of €28 billion. The Irish Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board appointed John Purcell to investigate. EY said it &quot;fundamentally disagrees with the decision to initiate a formal disciplinary process&quot; and that &quot;there has been no adverse finding made against EY in respect of the audit of Anglo Irish Bank.&quot;

In 2009, EY agreed to pay US$200m out of court to settle a negligence claim by the liquidators of Akai Holdings. Separately the firm was accused of falsifying and doctoring documents it presented to defend against the negligence claim by Akai&#x27;s liquidators. In a separate lawsuit, a former EY senior partner from 1984 to 1991, Cristopher Ho, and his listed company, Grande Holdings, paid over US$100m to Akai creditors to settle Akai&#x27;s liquidators&#x27; claim that Ho conspired with Ting of stripping assets from Akai. Police raided the Hong Kong office and arrested an EY partner who had been an audit manager on the Akai account from December 1997, although audit documents had been doctored dating back to 1994. Akai was said to be the firm&#x27;s largest client for most of the 1990s from Hong Kong.
The EY partner for the Akai account between 1991 and 1999, David Sun Tak-kei, faced no charges and went on to become co-managing partner for EY China. A few months later EY settled a similar claim of up to HK$300m from the liquidators of Moulin Global Eyecare, an audit client of the Hong Kong affiliate between 2002 and 2004. The liquidators described the Moulin accounts as a &quot;morass of &quot;.

The Valukas Report issued in 2010 charged that Lehman Brothers engaged in a practice known as repo 105 and that EY, Lehman&#x27;s auditor, was aware of it. EY was accused of professional malpractice regarding the lack of disclosure of Lehman&#x27;s repo 105 practice in Lehman&#x27;s public filings. New York prosecutors announced in 2010 that they have sued the firm. David Goldfarb, a Lehman CFO who concocted the repo 105 balance sheet window dressing technique was a former senior partner of EY. EY said that its last audit of Lehman Brothers was for the fiscal year ending 30 November 2007 and that Lehman&#x27;s financial statements were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In March 2015, EY settled Lehman-related lawsuits with municipalities in New Jersey and California.

In 2014, tax arrangements negotiated by EY for The Walt Disney Company, Koch Industries, Skype, and other multinational corporations became public in the so-called &quot;Luxembourg Leaks&quot;. The disclosure of these and other tax arrangements led to controversial discussions about tax avoidance.

In 2015, EY&#x27;s member firm in Japan, Ernst &amp; Young ShinNihon, was fined () for failing to spot irregularities since 2008 while auditing its client Toshiba, which was Japan&#x27;s worst accounting scandal in years. The firm was also suspended from taking up new business for three months. An official from Japan&#x27;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) described that &quot;there was a grave breach of duty&quot;. The firm&#x27;s CEO and chairman, Koichi Hanabusa stepped down the following month to take responsibility and monthly salaries for 19 employees were cut from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In an unusual move, the FSA publicly named seven accountants involved in the audit who were accused of failing to exercise due caution and signing off on false financial documents. The FSA also said the &quot;firm’s operations were deeply improper&quot;. ShinNihon, at the time, was Japan&#x27;s biggest accounting firm, with 3,500 certified accountants and 4,000 clients. ShinNihon audited about 960 listed companies in Japan, the most among the Big Four, as reported in 2015. ShinNihon had audited Toshiba for over 60 years and the firm had around 70 staff serving Toshiba before the accounting scandal broke.

In 2017, Ernst &amp; Young Baltic, member of the EY network, was accused of using the emission assumptions of highly polluting EURO II trucks (manufactured before 2001) to falsely increase the socio-economic benefits of the new railway for the period 2026–2055 by 3 billion euros in the Rail Baltica Cost-Benefit Analysis. The total mistakes amounted to more than 4 billion euros and constituted 20% of the total socio-economic benefit of the Rail Baltica. Correction of the mistakes made the project unfeasible. EY has refused to provide any comments to the media regarding the public accusations.

== Controversies ==
=== Sexist training program ===
In October 2019, &quot;HuffPost&quot; broke a story about a New Jersey &quot;Power-Presence-Purpose&quot; training seminar purportedly to empower female employees, but which was, as characterized by &quot;HuffPost&quot;, &quot;full of out of touch advice&quot;. Women were told to concentrate on their appearance, not to show too much skin, and not to speak too much. One participant said it was basically a &quot;women bashing&quot; exercise. &quot;You have to offer your thoughts in a benign way...You have to be the perfect Stepford wife... It felt like they were being turned into someone who is super-smiley, who never confronts anyone&quot; she said. In 2021, EY agreed to pay the state of New Jersey $100,000 and set up a $500,000 scholarship following its investigation of the program to resolve claims EY broke state law against discrimination.

=== Working rights ===
In April 2021, EY&#x27;s second-year auditor staff in their Barcelona office sent an email to their line managers to complain about the long hours that they had to work, which were sometimes reaching 84 working hours per week.

===Elizabeth Broderick &amp; Co. Culture Review===

In July 2023, an independent culture review by the former Australian sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick was released after being commissioned by EY following the suicide of an auditor in the Sydney office in August 2022. Over 4,500 participants from the Australian and New Zealand EY offices participated through online surveys, interviews, written submissions, and group listening sessions. The report revealed that 15% of EY employees have experienced instances of either bullying, sexual harassment, or racism. The report also detailed the long working hours, with approximately two in five employees considering quitting due to long work hours and 46% of respondents reporting that their health has been negatively affected due to the long hours. The culture review revealed that over 31% of EY employees worked over 51 hours per week routinely, and 11% of EY employees working over 61 hours per week routinely.

In April 2024, EY apologized for its workplace culture and said it has started a &quot;time-owed-in-lieu pilot&quot; and is &quot;making strong progress&quot; on other report recommendations.

===Death of Anna Sebastian Perayil ===

Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old chartered accountant, died in July 2024, four months after starting work at the Pune, India, EY office. Her family alleged that her death was due to stress caused by overwork, presenteeism and exhaustion. Her death led to nationwide outrage and debate on toxic work culture in India.

Shobha Karandlaje, the Minister of State for the Ministry of Labour and Employment, said in a post on X that her ministry has officially taken up the complaint. Other political leaders like the Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar, have expressed sadness and support for a probe.

== Sponsorships ==
Ernst &amp; Young is involved in many sponsorships, including its &quot;World Entrepreneur of the Year Award&quot; program, held in over 60 countries.

The awards are an annual award program sponsored by Ernst &amp; Young in recognition of entrepreneurship. 
Founded in 1986 in Milwaukee as a single award, the program now runs in all 50 U.S. states and in more than 60 countries.

At the country and territory levels, programs begin with nomination of entrepreneurs who demonstrate specific criteria. The award may be given to multiple individuals per year. For example, in the U.S. and other countries, there are multiple regional and category winners, spanning fields such as for retail and consumer products, technology, family business, energy, chemical and mining, food products and services, real estate, hospitality, and construction, financial services, digital media, and transformational ventures. However, in each country, only one company and its leader(s) are recognized as the overall award recipient.

Since 1986, over 10,000 founders, CEOs, and business leaders have received awards,

<doc id="59908" wikidata="Q200942" url="?curid=59908" title="Swindon">
<text>Swindon () is a town in Wiltshire, England. At the time of the 2021 Census the population of the built-up area was 183,638, making it the largest settlement in the county. Located in South West England, Swindon lies on the M4 corridor, 71 miles (114km) to the west of London and 36 miles (57 km) to the east of Bristol. The Cotswolds lie just to the town&#x27;s north and the North Wessex Downs to its south.

Recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Suindune&quot;, the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1843 transformed it from a small market town of 2,500 into a thriving railway hub that would become one of the largest railway engineering complexes in the world at its peak. This brought with it pioneering amenities such as the UK&#x27;s first lending library and a &#x27;cradle-to-grave&#x27; healthcare centre that was later used as a blueprint for the NHS. Swindon&#x27;s railway heritage can be primarily seen today with the grade 2 listed Railway Village and STEAM Museum. The McArthurGlen Designer Outlet is housed in the renovated former works and the Brunel Shopping Centre is one of several places in Swindon that bear the name of the famous engineer generally acknowledged with bringing the railways to the town.

Despite the subsequent decline and closure of its railway works, Swindon was one of the fastest growing towns in Europe post-war as its economy diversified, attracting large international companies, who made use of its burgeoning population and strategic transport links.

Major venues in the town include the Wyvern Theatre and the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. Lydiard Park has hosted festivals such as BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend, while the Swindon Mela, an all-day celebration of South Indian arts and culture, attracts up to 10,000 visitors a year. The ancient Ridgeway, known as Britain&#x27;s oldest road, runs a few miles to Swindon&#x27;s south, with Avebury, the largest megalithic stone circle in the world, and Uffington White Horse, Britain&#x27;s oldest white horse figure, also nearby. Wiltshire&#x27;s only professional football club Swindon Town F.C., have played in the Premier League in the 1993/94 season and won a major trophy, securing a famous giant-killing victory over Arsenal in the 1969 League Cup final. They currently play in League Two at the 15,000-seat County Ground in the town centre. Other sports in the town include Swindon Wildcats Ice Hockey and five-time British speedway champions the Swindon Robins.

==History==

===Early history===
The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Swindon sat in a defensible position atop a limestone hill. It is referred to in the 1086 Domesday Book as Suindune, believed to be derived from the Old English words &quot;swine&quot; and &quot;dun&quot; meaning &quot;pig hill&quot; or possibly Sweyn&#x27;s hill, Sweyn being a Scandinavian name akin to Sven and English swain, meaning a young man.

Swindon is recorded in the Domesday Book as a manor in the hundred of Blagrove, Wiltshire. It was one of the larger manors, recorded as having 27 households and a rent value of £10 14s, which was divided among five landlords. Before the Battle of Hastings the Swindon estate was owned by an Anglo-Saxon thane called Leofgeat. After the Norman Conquest, Swindon was split into five holdings: the largest was held between Miles Crispin and Odin the Chamberlain, and the second by Wadard, a knight in the service of Odo of Bayeux, brother of the king. The manors of Westlecot, Walcot, Rodbourne, Moredon and Stratton are also listed; all are now part of Swindon.

The Goddard family were lord of the manor from the 16th century for many generations, living at the manor house, sometimes known as The Lawn.

Swindon was a small market town, mainly for barter trade, until roughly 1848. This original market area is on top of the hill in central Swindon, now known as Old Town.

The Industrial Revolution was responsible for an acceleration of Swindon&#x27;s growth. Construction of the Wilts and Berks Canal in 1810 and the North Wilts Canal in 1819 brought trade to the area, and Swindon&#x27;s population started to grow.

===Railway town===

Between 1841 and 1842, Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Swindon Works was built for the repair and maintenance of locomotives on the Great Western Railway (GWR). The GWR built a small railway village to house some of its workers. The Steam Railway Museum and English Heritage, including the English Heritage Archive, now occupy part of the old works. In the village were the GWR Medical Fund Clinic at Park House and its hospital, both on Faringdon Road, and the 1892 health centre in Milton Road, which housed clinics, a pharmacy, laundries, baths, Victorian Turkish baths and swimming pools, was almost opposite.

From 1871, GWR workers had a small amount deducted from their weekly pay and put into a healthcare fund; GWR doctors could prescribe them or their family members medicines or send them for medical treatment. In 1878 the fund began providing artificial limbs made by craftsmen from the carriage and wagon works, and nine years later opened its first dental surgery. In his first few months in post, the dentist extracted more than 2,000 teeth. From the opening in 1892 of the health centre, a doctor could also prescribe a haircut or even a bath. The cradle-to-grave extent of this service was later used as a blueprint for the NHS.

The Mechanics&#x27; Institute, formed in 1844, moved into a building that looked rather like a church and included a covered market, on 1 May 1855. The New Swindon Improvement Company, a co-operative, raised the funds for this programme of self-improvement and paid the GWR £40 a year for its new home on a site at the heart of the railway village. It was a groundbreaking organisation that transformed the railway&#x27;s workforce into some of the country&#x27;s best-educated manual workers.

The Mechanics&#x27; Institute had the UK&#x27;s first lending library, and a range of improving lectures, access to a theatre and various other activities, such as ambulance classes and xylophone lessons. A former institute secretary formed the New Swindon Co-operative Society in 1853 which, after a schism in the society&#x27;s membership, spawned the New Swindon Industrial Society, which ran a retail business from a stall in the market at the institute. The institute also nurtured pioneering trades unionists and encouraged local democracy.

When tuberculosis hit the new town, the Mechanics&#x27; Institute persuaded the industrial pioneers of North Wiltshire to agree that the railway&#x27;s former employees should continue to receive medical attention from the doctors of the GWR Medical Society Fund, which the institute had played a role in establishing and funding.

Swindon&#x27;s &#x27;other&#x27; railway, the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway, merged with the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway to form the Midland &amp; South Western Junction Railway, which set out to join the London &amp; South Western Railway with the Midland Railway at Cheltenham. The Swindon, Marlborough &amp; Andover had planned to tunnel under the hill on which Swindon&#x27;s Old Town stands but the money ran out and the railway ran into Swindon Town railway station, off Devizes Road in the Old Town, skirting the new town to the west, intersecting with the GWR at Rushey Platt and heading north for Cirencester, Cheltenham and the LMS, whose &#x27;Midland Red&#x27; livery the M&amp;SWJR adopted.

During the second half of the 19th century, Swindon New Town grew around the main line between London and Bristol. In 1900, the original market town, Old Swindon, merged with its new neighbour at the bottom of the hill to become a single town.

On 1 July 1923, the GWR took over the largely single-track M&amp;SWJR and the line northwards from Swindon Town was diverted to Swindon Junction station, leaving the Town station with only the line south to Andover and Salisbury. The last passenger trains on what had been the SM&amp;A ran on 10 September 1961, 80 years after the railway&#x27;s first stretch opened.

During the first half of the 20th century, the railway works was the town&#x27;s largest employer and one of the biggest in the country, employing more than 14,500 workers. Alfred Williams (1877–1930) wrote about his life as a hammerman at the works.

The works&#x27; decline started in 1960, when it rolled out &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the last steam engine to be built in the UK. The works lost its locomotive building role and took on rolling stock maintenance for British Rail. In the late 1970s, much of the works closed and the rest followed in 1986.

The community centre in the railway village was originally the barrack accommodation for railway employees of the GWR. The building became the Railway Museum in the 1960s, until the opening of the STEAM Museum in the 2000s.

===Modern period===
The Second World War saw an influx of new industries as part of the war effort; Vickers-Armstrong making aircraft at Stratton, and Plessey at Cheney Manor producing electrical components. By 1960, Plessey had become Swindon&#x27;s biggest employer, with a predominantly female workforce.

David Murray John, Swindon&#x27;s town clerk from 1938 to 1974, is seen as a pioneering figure in Swindon&#x27;s post-war regeneration: his last act before retirement was to sign the contract for Swindon&#x27;s tallest building, which is now named after him. Murray John&#x27;s successor was David Maxwell Kent, appointed by the Swindon/Highworth Joint Committee in 1973: he had worked closely with Murray John and continued similar policies for a further twenty years. The Greater London Council withdrew from the Town Development Agreement and the local council continued the development on its own.

There was the problem of the Western Development and of Lydiard Park being in the new North Wiltshire district, but this was resolved by a boundary change to take in part of North Wiltshire. Another factor limiting local decision-taking was the continuing role of Wiltshire County Council in the administration of Swindon. Together with like-minded councils, a campaign was launched to bring an updated form of county borough status to Swindon. This was successful in 1997 with the formation of Swindon Borough Council, covering the areas of the former Thamesdown and the former Highworth Rural District Council.

In February 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Swindon as one of &quot;The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain&quot;. Only Warrington had a lower ratio of house prices to household income in 2007, with the average household income in Swindon among the highest in the country.

In October 2008, Swindon Council made a controversial move to ban fixed point speed cameras. The move was branded as reckless by some, but by November 2008 Portsmouth, Walsall, and Birmingham councils were also considering the move.

In 2001, construction began on Priory Vale, the third and final instalment in Swindon&#x27;s &#x27;Northern Expansion&#x27; project, which began with Abbey Meads and continued at St Andrew&#x27;s Ridge. In 2002, the New Swindon Company was formed with the remit of regenerating the town centre, to improve Swindon&#x27;s regional status. The main areas targeted were Union Square, The Promenade, The Hub, Swindon Central, North Star Village, The Campus, and the Public Realm.

In August 2019, a secondary school in the town was at the centre of a &#x27;county lines&#x27; drug supply investigation by Wiltshire Police, with 40 pupils suspected of being involved in the supply of cannabis and cocaine, and girls as young as 14 being coerced into sexual activity in exchange for drugs.

==Governance==


The local council was created in 1974 as the Borough of Thamesdown, out of the areas of Swindon Borough and Highworth Rural District. It was not initially called Swindon, because the borough covers a larger area than the town; it was renamed as the Borough of Swindon in 1997. The borough became a unitary authority on 1 April 1997, following a review by the Local Government Commission for England. The town is therefore no longer under the auspices of Wiltshire Council.

Council elections are held in three out of every four years, with one-third of the seats up for election in each of those years; beginning in 2026, the whole council will be elected every four years. Labour gained control of the council from the Conservatives at the 2023 election, and increased their majority in 2024.

Swindon is represented in the national parliament by two MPs. Heidi Alexander (Labour) was elected for the Swindon South seat in July 2024 with a 16% swing from the Conservatives. Will Stone, also Labour, represents Swindon North – which covers the whole of the north of the borough, including Blunsdon and Highworth – after a 19% swing at the same election. Prior to 1997 there was a single seat for Swindon, although much of what is now in Swindon was then part of the Devizes seat.

==Geography==
Swindon is a town in northeast Wiltshire, west-northwest of Reading and the same distance east-northeast of Bristol &#x27;as the crow flies&#x27;. The town is also southwest of Oxford, south-southeast of Birmingham, west of London and east of Cardiff. Swindon town centre is also equidistant from the county boundaries of Berkshire and Gloucestershire, both being away. The border with Oxfordshire is slightly closer, being around away.

Swindon is within a landlocked county and is a considerable distance from any coastline. The nearest section of coast on the English Channel is near Christchurch, due south. Meanwhile, the eastern limit of the Bristol Channel, just north of Weston-super-mare, lies to the west.

The landscape is dominated by the chalk hills of the Wiltshire Downs to the south and east. The Old Town stands on a hill of Purbeck and Portland stone; this was quarried from Roman times until the 1950s. The area that was known as New Swindon is made up of mostly Kimmeridge clay with outcrops of Corrallian clay in the areas of Penhill and Pinehurst. Oxford clay makes up the rest of the borough. The River Ray rises at Wroughton and forms much of the borough&#x27;s western boundary, joining the Thames which defines the northern boundary, and the source of which is located in nearby Kemble, Gloucestershire. The River Cole and its tributaries flow northeastward from the town and form the northeastern boundary.

* Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Swindon include Coate Water, Great Quarry, Haydon Meadow, Okus Quarry and Old Town Railway Cutting

===Climate===
Swindon has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), like the vast majority of the British Isles, with cool winters and warm summers. The nearest official weather station is RAF Lyneham, about west southwest of Swindon town centre. The weather station&#x27;s elevation is in a rural setting, compared to the typical encountered around Swindon town centre, so is likely marginally cooler throughout the year.

The absolute maximum is , recorded during August 1990. In an average year the warmest day should reach and 10.3 days should register a temperature of or above.

The absolute minimum is , recorded in January 1982, and in an average year 45.2 nights of air frost can be expected.

Sunshine, at 1,565 hours a year, is typical for inland parts of Southern England, although significantly higher than most areas further north.

Annual rainfall averages slightly under per year, with 123 days reporting over of rain.

== Demographics ==
The 2011 census recorded a population of 209,156 people in the Swindon unitary authority area (including the town&#x27;s urban area, Highworth, and other nearby parishes), with a 50/50 balance of males and females. By mid-2019, the estimated population of the unitary authority area was 222,193.

In 2011, 57.5% of Swindonians identified themselves as Christians, a reduction from 70% in 2001. This was followed by those of no religion (31%), Muslims (1.7%), Sikhs (0.6%), Hindus (1.2%), other (0.5%) and Judaism (0.1%).

As of 2021, 46.6% of Swindonians identify themselves as Christians. This is followed by those of no religion (40.5%), Muslims (2.7%), Sikhs (0.6%), Hindus (2.5%), other (0.6%) and Judaism (0.1%).

In 2015, Public Health England found that 70.4% of the population was either overweight or obese with a BMI greater than 25.

In 2011, the area of the town was and there were .

In 2011, 16.7% of the population of Swindon were non-White British compared with 15.4% in the surrounding borough. There was also little difference between the percentages of Black and Asian residents. Swindon is one of the most ethnically diverse towns in South West England: 4.6% of the population registered themselves as &#x27;Other White&#x27; and 2.5% of the population was either mixed race or of another ethnicity.

There are several definitions of the town for statistical purposes. The smallest extent is the former unparished area, now covered by the parishes of West Swindon, Central Swindon North, South Swindon, and Nythe, Eldene and Liden; thus it omits suburbs to the east and north, namely the parishes of Covingham, Stratton St Margaret and Haydon Wick. At the 2011 census, the population of the unparished area was 122,642. The 2011 census also recognised a Built Up Area Subdivision with a population of 182,441.

At the 2021 census, the only area covering most of the town was the Built Up Area, which had a population of 183,638. Excluded from this were the parts of Wichelstowe lying in Wroughton parish, the whole of Stratton St Margaret parish, and northern parts of St Andrews parish.

===St Helena community===
By 2018, Swindon had a concentration of people originating from Saint Helena.

===Polish community===
After the end of World War II, Polish refugees were temporarily housed in barracks at RAF Fairford, about to the north. Around 1950, some settled in Scotland and others in Swindon rather than stay in the barracks or hostels they were offered.

The 2001 UK Census found that most of the Polish-born people had stayed or returned after serving with British forces during World War II. Swindon and Nottingham were parts of this settlement. Data from that census showed that 566 Swindonians were Polish-born. Notes to those data read: &quot;The Polish Resettlement Act of 1947, which was designed to provide help and support to people who wished to settle here, covered about 190,000 people ... at the time Britain did not recognise many of the professional [qualifications] gained overseas ... [but] many did find work after the war; some went down the mines, some worked on the land or in steelworks. Housing was more of a problem and many Poles were forced to live in barracks previously used for POWs ... The first generation took pains to ensure that their children grew up with a strong sense of Polish identity&quot;.

NHS planners devising services for senior citizens estimated in 1994 that 5% of Swindon&#x27;s population were not &#x27;ethnically British&#x27;, and most of those were culturally Polish.

The town&#x27;s Polish ex-servicemen&#x27;s club, which had run a football team for 45 years, closed in 2012. Barman Jerzy Trojan blamed the decline of both club and team on the children and grandchildren of the original refugees losing their Polish identity.

===Goan community===
Swindon has a large community of Goan people. Estimates for the total number of Goans in Swindon range from 8,000 to 25,000; in 1999 there were estimated to be only 40 Goan people in the town. In 2013, Swindon was reported to have the highest concentration of Goans anywhere in the world outside of Goa.

The Goan population is concentrated in Swindon&#x27;s New Town area, around Manchester Road. Most of the Goan community are Goan Catholics and have Portuguese nationality due to their ancestry in Portuguese Goa. The Catholic community is served by Holy Rood Catholic Church in the town centre and St Peter&#x27;s Church in West Swindon, and supported by the Goan Chaplaincy. Services are regularly carried out in Konkani. The Anglican St Luke&#x27;s Church also carries out Mass in Konkani, believed to be the only Mass regularly carried out in this language in the Church of England.

The Goa Swindon Association supports members of the community. It is involved in promoting and introducing Goan culture, such as &quot;tiatrs&quot; (Konkani theatre), the annual Goan Summer Festival, and Konkani musical shows, among others.

Among the notable Goans based in Swindon is Imtiyaz Shaikh, who has served as Mayor of Swindon since 2024. He is a former two-term Eastcott councillor on Swindon Borough Council.

==Places of worship==
There are numerous places of worship in Swindon, some of which are listed buildings. Until 1845, the only church in Swindon was the Holy Rood Church, a Grade II listed building. That year, St Mark&#x27;s Church was built. In 1851, Christ Church was built. Later in the year, the first Roman Catholic chapel was opened in the town and was also named Holy Rood. In 1866, Cambria Baptist Chapel was built. In the 1880s, Bath Road Methodist Chapel was built. In 1885, St Barnabas Church was built followed by the Baptists Tabernacle (1886–1978). In 1907, St Augustine&#x27;s Church in Even Swindon was built. Various churches and places of worship were built in the town by other denominations and faiths. Pattern Church was launched on Christmas 2018, on the site of the former Pattern Store.

==Economy==

 Major employers in the town include BMW/Mini (formerly Pressed Steel Fisher) in Stratton, Dolby Labs, international engineering consultancy firm Halcrow, and retailer W H Smith&#x27;s distribution centre and headquarters. Electronics company Intel, insurance and financial services companies such as Nationwide Building Society and Zurich Financial Services, the energy companies RWE Generation UK plc and Npower (a company of the Innogy group), the fleet management company Arval, pharmaceutical companies such as Canada&#x27;s Patheon and the United States–based Catalent Pharma Solutions and French medical supplies manufacturer Vygon (UK) have their UK divisions headquartered in the town. 

Swindon also has the head office of the National Trust and the head office of the UK Space Agency. Other employers include all of the national Research Councils, the British Computer Society, and TE Connectivity.

From 1985 to 2021, Japanese car manufacturer Honda had its sole UK plant at South Marston, just outside Swindon. In March 2021, it was announced that logistics firm Panattoni would move to the former Honda site.

Swindon was for a time a centre of excellence for 3G and 4G mobile telecommunications research and development for Motorola, Lucent Technologies (later Alcatel-Lucent), Nokia Siemens Networks and Cisco. The factory built in 1998 for Motorola&#x27;s GSM division at Groundwell, north Swindon, has been described as &quot;striking and futuristic&quot;.

==Transport==
===Railway===

Swindon is an important railway town. Swindon railway station opened in 1842 as &quot;Swindon Junction&quot; and, until 1895, every train stopped for at least ten minutes to change locomotives. As a result, the station hosted the first recorded railway refreshment rooms.

The station is served by frequent inter-city trains to London Paddington eastbound, and westbound to , and , along the Great Western Main Line and Golden Valley line. There is also a local service to , via the Wessex Main Line. All services at Swindon are operated by Great Western Railway.

On 8 October 2019, GWR posted a modern speed record when an Intercity Express Train took 44 minutes to travel from Swindon to London Paddington.

===Road===

Located at the junction of two Roman roads, the town has developed into a transport hub over the centuries. It is accessed by two junctions (15 and 16) on the M4 motorway.

The town&#x27;s Magic Roundabout, at the junction of five roads, contains five mini-roundabouts and has a contra-rotational hub at its centre. It is built on the site of Swindon Wharf on the abandoned Wilts &amp; Berks Canal, near the County Ground. The official name was &quot;County Islands&quot;, although it was known colloquially as the &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot; and the official name was changed to match its nickname.

===Bus and coach===

Swindon bus operators are Swindon&#x27;s Bus Company (formerly Thamesdown) and Stagecoach West. Key routes link the town with Cheltenham, Chippenham, Cirencester, Devizes and Trowbridge. National Express coaches use the bus station in the town centre.

Stagecoach&#x27;s former bus depot on Eastcott Road was approved for development as a housing site in 2018.

===Cycling===

National Cycle Network Route 45 runs through the town.

==Tourism and recreation==
===Events===

Annual events in Swindon include:
* The Swindon Festival of Literature, held over two weeks in May.

The &quot;Societas Physicae Experimentalis&quot; (Experimental Physics Society) was one of the oldest research societies in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and in Central and Eastern Europe.

==History==
Already in 1670, the physician Israel Conradi (1634–1715) had tried to organize a scientific society in the city, without success. Several others tried after him, until Daniel Gralath (1708–1767) finally succeeded. His father-in-law was Jacob Theodor Klein (1685–1759), a city secretary and also a very distinguished scientist, nicknamed &quot;Gedanensium Plinius&quot;.
At the end of 1742, Gralath had gathered a group of learned men for his purpose, an &quot;Experimental Physics Society&quot; (Societas Physicae Experimentalis), one of the oldest research societies of its type. The first organizing meeting took place on 7 November 1742, the first scientific meeting was called on 2 January 1743. The aim of the Society was to practice and popularize science, among others through weekly public demonstrations of the most interesting experiments in physics. Often the effects of electricity were studied, with the help of the Leyden jar. Since 1746 these took place in the Great Hall of the Green Gate. Gralath also became a councilman and, in 1763, mayor of Danzig. The Society was also supported by Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski.

Known members were Nathanael Matthaeus von Wolf, Michael Christoph Hanow, Gottfried Lengnich, Johann Jacob Mascov, who wrote the &quot;Geschichte der Teutschen&quot;, also Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit and the prince-bishop Adam Stanisław Grabowski.

The sessions of the Society were also attended by many famous persons of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth like Great Lithuanian Hetman Michał Kazimierz &quot;Rybeńko&quot; Radziwiłł, August Fryderyk Moszyński, Joachim Chreptowicz.

After the annexation of the city by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland and during the Napoleonic Wars, the organization fell into such decline that in 1812 it was proposed to dissolve it, however, several members decided to continue its activity.

In 1840 Alexander von Humboldt accompanied Prussian King Frederick William IV on the way to Königsberg, and Humboldt received an honorary membership in the Society. Later, the society offered Humboldt stipends. The collections of the Society were displayed in the West-Prussian Provincial Museum located at the Green Gate.

In 1845 the society was located in a Renaissance-era building at the Motława, an arm of the Vistula River. The new seat housed research facilities, a small museum and a library, and was decorated with portraits of former prominent members of the organization, as well as a portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus, and a bust of Johannes Hevelius received as a gift from Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski in the 18th century. In 1866, an astronomical observatory was placed in its tower.

After 200 years of existence, the society ceased to exist in 1936. The building and many priceless valuables were destroyed during the Soviet offensive in 1945, two years after the 200th anniversary.

The building at the Motława river was rebuilt after the war. It houses an Archaeological Museum today.

<text>Erysimum, or wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the cabbage family, Brassicaceae. It includes more than 150 species, both popular garden plants and many wild forms. &quot;Erysimum&quot; is characterised by star-shaped and/or two-sided) trichomes growing from the stem, with yellow, red, pink or orange flowers and multiseeded seed pods.

==Morphology==
Wallflowers are annuals, herbaceous perennials or sub-shrubs. The perennial species are short-lived and in cultivation treated as biennials. Most species have stems erect, with a covering of bifid hairs, usually 25 ± 53cm × 2–3mm in size. The leaves are narrow and fixed. The lower leaves are broad and round with backwardly directed lobes, 50–80mm × 0.5–3mm. Stem leaves are linear, entire, growing whitish with 2-fid hairs; 21–43mm × 1.5–2mm. Flower clusters grow at intervals on short equal stalks along the stem, with bright yellow to red or pink bilateral flowers. Flowering occurs during spring and summer. One species, &quot;Erysimum semperflorens&quot;, native to Morocco and Algeria, has white flowers. The flowering part of the stem ranges from 4 to 7mm. There are four pouch-shaped sepals, light green, 5–7mm × 1.5–2mm.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Erysimum&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;erysimon&quot; (, &quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot; or , the hedgenettle), itself from the word &quot;eryo&quot; () meaning to drag or &quot;eryso&quot;, a form of &quot;rhyomai&quot; (), meaning &quot;to ward off&quot; or &quot;to heal&quot; in reference to its medicinal properties.

The common name &quot;wallflower&quot; derives from the plant&#x27;s ability to grow successfully in loose wall mortar.

== Distribution ==
Wallflowers are native to temperate Eurasia, North Africa and Macaronesia, and North America south to Costa Rica. Many wallflowers are endemic to small areas, such as:
*&quot;E. etnense&quot; (Mount Etna)
*&quot;E. franciscanum&quot; (north Californian coast)
*&quot;E. kykkoticum&quot; (Cyprus – nearly extinct)
*&quot;E. moranii&quot; (Guadalupe Island)
*&quot;E. nevadense&quot; (the Sierra Nevada of Spain)
*&quot;E. scoparium&quot; (the Teide volcano on Tenerife)
*&quot;E. teretifolium&quot; (endangered – inland sandhills of Santa Cruz County, California)

== Cultivation ==
Most wallflower garden cultivars (e.g. &quot;Erysimum&quot; &#x27;Chelsea Jacket&#x27;) are derived from &quot;E. cheiri&quot; (often placed in &quot;Cheiranthus&quot;), from southern Europe. They are often attacked by fungal and bacterial disease, so they are best grown as biennials and discarded after flowering. They are also susceptible to clubroot, a disease of Brassicaceae. Growth is best in dry soils with very good drainage, and they are often grown successfully in loose wall mortar. There is a wide range of flower color in the warm spectrum, including white, yellow, orange, red, pink, maroon, purple and russet. The flowers, appearing in spring, usually have a strong, pleasant fragrance. Wallflowers are often associated in spring bedding schemes with tulips and forget-me-nots.

The cultivar &#x27;Bowles&#x27;s Mauve&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It can become a bushy evergreen perennial in milder locations. It is strongly scented and attractive to bees.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Erysimum&quot; is found in a range of habitats across the northern hemisphere, and has developed diverse morphology and growth habits (herbaceous annual or perennial, and woody perennial). Different &quot;Erysimum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) species including the garden carpet (&quot;Xanthorhoe fluctuata&quot;). In addition, some species of weevils, like &quot;Ceutorhynchus chlorophanus&quot;, live inside the fruits feeding on the developing seeds. Many species of beetles, bugs and grasshoppers eat the leaves and stalks. Some mammalian herbivores, for example mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) in North America, argali (&quot;Ovis ammon&quot;) in Mongolia, red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) in Central Europe, or Spanish ibex (&quot;Capra pyrenaica&quot;) in the Iberian Peninsula, feed on wallflower flowering and fruiting stalks. &quot;Erysimum crepidifolium&quot; (pale wallflower) is toxic to some generalist vertebrate herbivores.

Most wallflowers are pollinator-generalists, their flowers being visited by many different species of bees, bee flies, hoverflies, butterflies, beetles, and ants. However, there are some specialist species. For example, &quot;Erysimum scoparium&quot; is pollinated almost exclusively by &quot;Anthophora alluadii&quot;.

===Defensive compounds===
Like most Brassicaceae, species in the genus &quot;Erysimum&quot; produce glucosinolates as defensive compounds. However, unlike almost all other genera in the Brassicaceae, &quot;Erysimum&quot; also accumulates cardiac glycosides, another class of phytochemicals with an ecological importance in insect defense. Cardiac glycosides specifically function to prevent insect herbivory and/or oviposition by blocking ion channel function in muscle cells. These chemicals are toxic enough to deter generalist, and even some specialist insect herbivores. Cardiac glycoside production is widespread in &quot;Erysimum&quot;, with at least 48 species in the genus containing these compounds. Accumulation of cardiac glycosides in &quot;Erysimum crepidifolium&quot;, but not other tested species, is induced by treatment with jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate, endogenous elicitors of chemical defenses in many plant species. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that &quot;Erysimum&quot; diversification from other Brassicaceae species that do not produce cardiac glycosides began in the Pliocene (2.33–5.2 million years ago), suggesting relatively recent evolution of cardiac glycosides as a defensive trait in this genus.

=== Escape from herbivory ===
The evolution of novel chemical defenses in plants, such as cardenolides in the genus &quot;Erysimum&quot;, is predicted to allow escape from herbivory by specialist herbivores and expansion into new ecological niches. The crucifer-feeding specialist &quot;Pieries rapae&quot; (white cabbage butterfly) is deterred from feeding and oviposition by cardenolides in &quot;Erysimum cheiranthoides.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Anthocharis cardamines&quot; (orange tip butterfly), which oviposits on almost all crucifer species, avoids &quot;E. cheiranthoides.&quot; &quot;Erysimum asperum&quot; (western wallflower) is resistant to feeding and oviposition of &quot;Pieris napi macdunnoughii&quot; (synonym &quot;Pieris marginalis&quot;, margined white butterfly). Two crucifer-feeding beetles, &quot;Phaedon&quot; sp. and &quot;Phyllotreta&quot; sp., were deterred from feeding by cardenolides that were applied to their preferred food plants. Consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced speciation after escape from herbivory, phylogenetic studies involving 128 &quot;Erysimum&quot; species indicate diversification in Eurasia between 0.5 and 2 million years ago, and in North America between 0.7 and 1.65 million years ago.) This evolutionarily rapid expansion of the &quot;Erysimum&quot; genus has resulted in several hundred known species distributed throughout the northern hemisphere.

== Ethnobotanical uses of &quot;Erysimum&quot; ==
&quot;Erysimum&quot; species have a long history of use in traditional medicine. In &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; by Pliny the Elder (), &quot;Erysimum&quot; is classified as a medicinal rather than a food plant. &quot;Erysimum cheiri&quot; is described as a medicinal herb in &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; by Pedanius Dioscorides (), which was the predominant European medical pharmacopeia for more than 1,500 years. Other medieval descriptions of medicinal herbs and their uses, including the &quot;Dispensatorium des Cordus&quot; by Valerius Cordus (1542), &quot;Bocks Kräuterbuch&quot; by Hieronymus Bock (1577), and Tabernaemontanus&#x27; &quot;Neuw Kreuterbuch&quot; by Jacobus Theodorus Tabernaemontanus (1588), also discuss applications of &quot;E. cheiri&quot;. In traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;Erysimum cheiranthoides&quot; has been used to treat heart disease and other ailments. Although medical uses of &quot;Erysimum&quot; became uncommon in Europe after the Middle Ages, &quot;Erysimum diffusum,&quot; as well as purified erysimin and erysimoside, have been applied more recently as Ukrainian ethnobotanical treatments.

<doc id="59919" wikidata="Q214169" url="?curid=59919" title="Pheasant">
<text>Pheasants ( ) are birds of several genera within the family Phasianidae in the order Galliformes. Although they can be found all over the world in introduced (and captive) populations, the pheasant genera&#x27;s native range is restricted to Eurasia. The classification &quot;pheasant&quot; is paraphyletic, as birds referred to as pheasants are included within both the subfamilies Phasianinae and Pavoninae, and in many cases are more closely related to smaller phasianids, grouse, and turkey (formerly classified in Perdicinae, Tetraoninae, and Meleagridinae) than to other pheasants.

Pheasants are characterised by strong sexual dimorphism, males being highly decorated with bright colours and adornments such as wattles. Males are usually larger than females and have longer tails. Males play no part in rearing the young. 

A pheasant&#x27;s call or cry can be recognised by the fact it sounds like a rusty sink or valve being turned.

Pheasants eat mostly seeds, grains, roots, and berries, while in the summer they take advantage of insects, fresh green shoots, spiders, earthworms, and snails. However, as an introduced species, in the UK they are a threat to endangered native adders.

The best-known is the common pheasant, which is widespread throughout the world, in introduced feral populations and in farm operations. Various other pheasant species are popular in aviaries, such as the golden pheasant (&quot;Chrysolophus pictus&quot;).

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;pheasant&quot; ultimately comes from Phasis, the ancient name of what is now called the Rioni River in Georgia.
It passed from Greek to Latin to French (spelled with an initial &quot;f&quot;) then to English, appearing for the first time in English around 1299.

<text>Alfred Tarski (; ; born Alfred Teitelbaum; January 14, 1901 – October 26, 1983) was a Polish-American logician and mathematician. A prolific author best known for his work on model theory, metamathematics, and algebraic logic, he also contributed to abstract algebra, topology, geometry, measure theory, mathematical logic, set theory, and analytic philosophy.

Educated in Poland at the University of Warsaw, and a member of the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic and the Warsaw school of mathematics, he immigrated to the United States in 1939 where he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Tarski taught and carried out research in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1942 until his death in 1983.

His biographers Anita Burdman Feferman and Solomon Feferman state that, &quot;Along with his contemporary, Kurt Gödel, he changed the face of logic in the twentieth century, especially through his work on the concept of truth and the theory of models.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Alfred Tarski was born Alfred Teitelbaum (Polish spelling: &quot;Tajtelbaum&quot;), to parents who were Polish Jews in comfortable circumstances. He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Szkoła Mazowiecka&quot;. Nevertheless, he entered the University of Warsaw in 1918 intending to study biology.

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski and Wacław Sierpiński and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Leśniewski recognized Tarski&#x27;s potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology. Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and in 1924 became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Leśniewski&#x27;s supervision. His thesis was entitled &quot;O wyrazie pierwotnym logistyki&quot; (&quot;On the Primitive Term of Logistic&quot;; published 1923). Tarski and Leśniewski soon grew cool to each other, mainly due to the latter&#x27;s increasing anti-semitism. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for Kotarbiński, which was reciprocated.

In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to &quot;Tarski&quot;. The Tarski brothers also converted to Roman Catholicism, Poland&#x27;s dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed atheist.

===Career===
After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the university, and served as Łukasiewicz&#x27;s assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at the Third Boys’ Gimnazjum of the Trade Union of Polish Secondary-School Teachers (later the Stefan Żeromski Gimnazjum), a Warsaw secondary school, beginning in 1925. Before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence until his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the Polish–Soviet War. They had two children; a son Jan Tarski, who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina, who married the mathematician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht.

Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at Lwów University, but on Bertrand Russell&#x27;s recommendation it was awarded to Leon Chwistek. In 1930, Tarski visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Karl Menger&#x27;s colloquium, and met Kurt Gödel. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger&#x27;s research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the Unity of Science movement, an outgrowth of the Vienna Circle. Tarski&#x27;s academic career in Poland was strongly and repeatedly impacted by his heritage. For example, in 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at Poznań University but the chair was abolished to avoid assigning it to Tarski (who was undisputedly the strongest applicant) because he was a Jew. Tarski&#x27;s ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at Harvard University. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the Nazi threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.

Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), City College of New York (1940), and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (1942), where he again met Gödel. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945. Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death. At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an astounding and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:



Tarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of Andrzej Mostowski, Bjarni Jónsson, Julia Robinson, Robert Vaught, Solomon Feferman, Richard Montague, James Donald Monk, Haim Gaifman, Donald Pigozzi, and Roger Maddux, as well as Chen Chung Chang and Jerome Keisler, authors of &quot;Model Theory&quot; (1973), a classic text in the field. He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Adolf Lindenbaum, Dana Scott, and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski&#x27;s students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time. However, he had extra-marital affairs with at least two of these students. After he showed another of his female student&#x27;s work to a male colleague, the colleague published it himself, leading her to leave the graduate study and later move to a different university and a different advisor.

Tarski lectured at University College, London (1950, 1966), the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris (1955), the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in Berkeley (1958–60), the University of California at Los Angeles (1967), and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (1974–75). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, received honorary degrees from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from Marseille&#x27;s Paul Cézanne University in 1977 and from the University of Calgary, as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the Association for Symbolic Logic, 1944–46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956–57. He was also an honorary editor of &quot;Algebra Universalis&quot;.

==Work in mathematics==
Tarski&#x27;s mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski&#x27;s mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see &quot;Interludes I–VI&quot; in Feferman and Feferman.

Tarski&#x27;s first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on set theory, a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and Stefan Banach proved that, if one accepts the Axiom of Choice, a ball can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the Banach–Tarski paradox.

In &quot;A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry&quot;, Tarski showed, by the method of quantifier elimination, that the first-order theory of the real numbers under addition and multiplication is decidable. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because Alonzo Church proved in 1936 that Peano arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) is &quot;not&quot; decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. In his 1953 &quot;Undecidable theories&quot;, Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras, are all undecidable. The theory of Abelian groups is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.

While teaching at the Stefan Żeromski Gimnazjum in the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught geometry. Using some ideas of Mario Pieri, in 1926 Tarski devised an original axiomatization for plane Euclidean geometry, one considerably more concise than Hilbert&#x27;s. Tarski&#x27;s axioms form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are points, and having only two primitive relations. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.

In 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean solid geometry could be recast as a second-order theory whose individuals are &quot;spheres&quot; (a primitive notion), a single primitive binary relation &quot;is contained in&quot;, and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment partially orders the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of mereology far easier to exposit than Lesniewski&#x27;s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.

&quot;Cardinal Algebras&quot; studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. &quot;Ordinal Algebras&quot; sets out an algebra for the additive theory of order types. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.

In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on binary relations, which began the work on relation algebra and its metamathematics that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most axiomatic set theory and Peano arithmetic. For an introduction to relation algebra, see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised cylindric algebras, which are to first-order logic what the two-element Boolean algebra is to classical sentential logic. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).

==Work in logic==
Tarski&#x27;s student, Robert Lawson Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time — along with Aristotle, Gottlob Frege, and Kurt Gödel. However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly for his pioneering work in the logic of relations.

Tarski produced axioms for &quot;logical consequence&quot; and worked on deductive systems, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert&#x27;s proof-theoretic metamathematics.
Around 1930, Tarski developed an abstract theory of logical deductions that models some properties of logical calculi. Mathematically, what he described is just a finitary closure operator on a set (the set of &quot;sentences&quot;). In abstract algebraic logic, finitary closure operators are still studied under the name &quot;consequence operator&quot;, which was coined by Tarski. The set &quot;S&quot; represents a set of sentences, a subset &quot;T&quot; of &quot;S&quot; a theory, and cl(&quot;T&quot;) is the set of all sentences that follow from the theory. This abstract approach was applied to fuzzy logic (see Gerla 2000).
Tarski&#x27;s 1936 article &quot;On the concept of logical consequence&quot; argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as &quot;Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences&quot;.

Tarski&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Truth and proof&quot; considered both Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems and Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem, and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.

===Truth in formalized languages===

In 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled &quot;Pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych&quot;, &quot;Setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages.&quot; The 1935 German translation was titled &quot;Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen&quot;, &quot;The concept of truth in formalized languages&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;Wahrheitsbegriff&quot;. An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume &quot;Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics&quot;. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century analytic philosophy, a contribution to symbolic logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language. For a brief discussion of its content, see Convention T (and also T-schema).

A philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski&#x27;s theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a correspondence theory of truth. The debate centers on how to read Tarski&#x27;s condition of material adequacy for a true definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:

: &quot;p&quot; is true if and only if p.

(where p is the proposition expressed by &quot;p&quot;)

The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as

as expressing merely a deflationary theory of truth or as embodying truth as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992).

===Logical consequence===
In 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture, “On the Concept of Following Logically&quot;,
he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).

This publication set out the modern model-theoretic definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski&#x27;s notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different cardinalities). This question is a matter of some debate in the philosophical literature. John Etchemendy stimulated much of the discussion about Tarski&#x27;s treatment of varying domains.

Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. &quot;What are Logical Notions?&quot; can thus be viewed as continuing &quot;On the Concept of Logical Consequence&quot;.

===Logical notions===

Tarski&#x27;s &quot;What are Logical Notions?&quot; (Tarski 1986) is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in Buffalo; it was edited without his direct involvement by John Corcoran. It became the most cited paper in the journal &quot;History and Philosophy of Logic&quot;.

In the talk, Tarski proposed demarcation of logical operations (which he calls &quot;notions&quot;) from non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the Erlangen program of the 19th-century German mathematician Felix Klein. Mautner (in 1946), and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician José Sebastião e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.

The Erlangen program classified the various types of geometry (Euclidean geometry, affine geometry, topology, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, &quot;rotate 30 degrees&quot; and &quot;magnify by a factor of 2&quot; are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.

As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.

Tarski&#x27;s proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations (automorphisms) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the universe of discourse of a model for the semantic theory of logic. If one identifies the truth value True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:

# &quot;Truth-functions&quot;: All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all &quot;n&quot;-ary truth-functions for finite &quot;n&quot;. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)
# &quot;Individuals&quot;: No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.
# &quot;Predicates&quot;:
#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension
#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension
#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs &lt;&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;&gt; in its extension, where &quot;a&quot; is a member of the domain
#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs &lt;&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;&gt; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are distinct members of the domain
#* &quot;n&quot;-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with conjunction, disjunction and negation (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)
# &quot;Quantifiers&quot;: Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as &quot;Exactly four&quot;, &quot;Finitely many&quot;, &quot;Uncountably many&quot;, and &quot;Between four and 9 million&quot;, for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates &quot;Fx&quot; and &quot;Gy&quot;, &quot;More(&quot;x, y&quot;)&quot;, which says &quot;More things have &quot;F&quot; than have &quot;G&quot;.&quot;
# &quot;Set-Theoretic relations&quot;: Relations such as inclusion, intersection and union applied to subsets of the domain are logical in the present sense.
# &quot;Set membership&quot;: Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of type theory, but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.
# &quot;Logical notions of higher order&quot;: While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.

In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).

Solomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski&#x27;s proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski&#x27;s preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary homomorphisms. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski&#x27;s proposal has in dealing with a sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman&#x27;s proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski&#x27;s original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.

Vann McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski&#x27;s proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. &quot;Arbitrarily&quot; includes a countable infinity.

;Logic literature
* The December 1986 issue of the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot; surveys Tarski&#x27;s work on model theory (Robert Vaught), algebra (Jonsson), undecidable theories (McNulty), algebraic logic (Donald Monk), and geometry (Szczerba). The March 1988 issue of the same journal surveys his work on axiomatic set theory (Azriel Levy), real closed fields (Lou Van Den Dries), decidable theory (Doner and Wilfrid Hodges), metamathematics (Blok and Pigozzi), truth and logical consequence (John Etchemendy), and general philosophy (Patrick Suppes).

<text>Sir Peter Markham Scott (14 September 1909 – 29 August 1989) was a British ornithologist, conservationist, painter, naval officer, broadcaster and sportsman. The only child of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott, he took an interest in observing and shooting wildfowl at a young age and later took to their breeding.

He established the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge in 1946 and helped found the World Wide Fund for Nature, the logo of which he designed. He was a yachting enthusiast from an early age and took up gliding in mid-life. He was part of the UK team for the 1936 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in sailing a one-man dinghy. He was knighted in 1973 for his work in conservation of wild animals and was also a recipient of the WWF Gold Medal and the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize.

==Early life==

Scott was born in London at 174, Buckingham Palace Road, the only child of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his wife, Kathleen ( Edith Agnes Kathleen Bruce), a sculptor. He was only two years old when his father died. Robert Scott, in a last letter to his wife, advised her to &quot;make the boy interested in natural history if you can; it is better than games.&quot; He was named after Sir Clements Markham, mentor of Scott&#x27;s polar expeditions, and a godfather along with J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan.

Kathleen Scott remarried in 1922. Her second husband, Hilton Young (later Lord Kennet), became stepfather to Peter. In 1923, Peter Scott&#x27;s half-brother, Wayland Young, was born. Scott was educated at Oundle School and Trinity College, Cambridge, initially reading Natural Sciences but graduating in the History of Art in 1931. At Cambridge, he shared lodging with John Berry and the two shared many views.

As a student he was also an active member of the Cambridge University Cruising Club, sailing against Oxford in the 1929 and 1930 Varsity Matches. He studied art at the State Academy in Munich for a year followed by studies at the Royal Academy Schools, London. One of the few non-wildlife paintings that he produced during his career, &quot;Dinghies Racing on Lake Ontario&quot;, is held by the Cambridge University Cruising Club.

Like his mother, he displayed a strong artistic talent and he became known as a painter of wildlife, particularly birds; he had his first exhibition in London in 1933. His wealthy background allowed him to follow his interests in art, wildlife and many sports, including wildfowling, sailing, gliding and ice skating. He represented Great Britain and Northern Ireland at sailing at the 1936 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal in the O-Jolle monotype class. He also participated in the Prince of Wales Cup in 1938 during which he and his crew on the &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; dinghy designed a modified wearable harness (now known as a trapeze) that helped them win.

==Military service==
During the Second World War, Scott served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. As a sub-lieutenant, during the failed evacuation of the 51st Highland Division he was the British naval officer sent ashore at Saint-Valery-en-Caux in the early hours of 11 June 1940 to evacuate some of the wounded. This was the last evacuation of British troops from the port area of St Valery that was not disrupted by enemy fire.

Then he served in destroyers in the North Atlantic but later moved to commanding the First (and only) Squadron of Steam Gun Boats against German E-boats in the English Channel.

Scott is credited with designing the Western Approaches ship camouflage scheme, which disguised ship superstructures. In July 1940, he managed to get the destroyer HMS &quot;Broke&quot;, in which he was serving, experimentally camouflaged, differently on the two sides. To starboard, the ship was painted blue-grey all over, but with white in naturally shadowed areas as countershading, following the ideas of Abbott Handerson Thayer from the First World War. To port, the ship was painted in &quot;bright pale colours&quot; to combine some disruption of shape with the ability to fade out during the night, again with shadowed areas painted white. However, he later wrote that compromise was fatal to camouflage, and that invisibility at night (by painting ships in white or other pale colours) had to be the sole objective. By May 1941, all ships in the Western Approaches (the North Atlantic) were ordered to be painted in Scott&#x27;s camouflage scheme. The scheme was said to be so effective that several British ships including HMS &quot;Broke&quot; collided with each other. The effectiveness of Scott&#x27;s and Thayer&#x27;s ideas was demonstrated experimentally by the Leamington Camouflage Centre in 1941. Under a cloudy overcast sky, the tests showed that a white ship could approach six miles (9.6 km) closer than a black-painted ship before being seen.

On 8 July 1941, it was announced that Scott had been mentioned in despatches &quot;for good services in rescuing survivors from a burning Vessel&quot; in April 1941 while serving on HMS &quot;Broke&quot;. On 2 October 1942, it was announced that he had again been mentioned in despatches &quot;for gallantry, daring and skill in the combined attack on Dieppe&quot;. He was further mentioned in despatches on 28 September 1943 for an action in the English Channel on 26 July 1943. On 1 June 1943, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) &quot;for skill and gallantry in action with enemy light forces&quot; for an action in the English Channel on 15 April 1943 while commanding H.M. Steam Gunboat &quot;Grey Goose&quot;. In the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 9 November 1943, he was awarded a Bar to the DSC for actions in the English Channel on the 4th and 27 September 1943 while commanding the First SGB Flotilla. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the Military Division (MBE) in the 1942 Birthday Honours.

==Postwar life==
Scott stood as a Conservative in the 1945 general election in Wembley North and narrowly failed to be elected. In 1946, he founded the organisation with which he was ever afterwards closely associated, the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) with its headquarters at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. There, through a captive breeding programme, he saved the nene or Hawaiian goose from extinction in the 1950s. In the years that followed, he led ornithological expeditions worldwide, and became a television personality, popularising the study of wildfowl and wetlands.

His BBC natural history series, &quot;Look&quot;, ran from 1955 to 1969 and made him a household name. It included the first BBC natural history film to be shown in colour, &quot;The Private Life of the Kingfisher&quot; (1968), which he narrated. He wrote and illustrated several books on the subject, including his autobiography, &quot;The Eye of the Wind&quot; (1961). In the 1950s, he also appeared regularly on BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, in the series, &quot;Nature Parliament&quot;.

In the early 1950s, his designs were used on a range of tableware, &quot;Wild Geese&quot;, by Midwinter Pottery.

Scott took up gliding in 1956 and became a British champion in 1963. He was chairman of the British Gliding Association (BGA) for two years from 1968 and was president of the Bristol &amp; Gloucestershire Gliding Club. He was responsible for involving Prince Philip in gliding.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1956 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Hammersmith, London.

As a member of the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, he helped create the Red Data books, the group&#x27;s lists of endangered species.

Scott was the founder President of the Society of Wildlife Artists and President of the Nature in Art Trust (a role in which his wife Philippa succeeded him). Scott tutored numerous artists including Paul Karslake.

From 1973 to 1983, Scott was Chancellor of the University of Birmingham. In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath.

Scott continued with his love of sailing, skippering the 12 Metre yacht &quot;Sovereign&quot; in the 1964 challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup which was held by the United States. &quot;Sovereign&quot; suffered a whitewash 4–0 defeat in a one-sided competition where the American boat was of a noticeably faster design. From 1955 to 1969 he was the president of the International Yacht Racing Union (now World Sailing).

He was one of the founders of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF, formerly called the World Wildlife Fund), and designed its panda logo. His pioneering work in conservation also contributed greatly to the shift in policy of the International Whaling Commission and signing of the Antarctic Treaty, the latter inspired by his visit to his father&#x27;s base on Ross Island in Antarctica. In 1986 he received the WWF Gold Medal. In the same year he received the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize for his role as cofounder of WWF and his life-long contributions to saving endangered wildlife.

Scott was a long-time vice-president of the British Naturalists&#x27; Association, whose Peter Scott Memorial Award was instituted after his death, to commemorate his achievements.

He died of a heart attack on 29 August 1989 in Bristol, at age 79.

==Documentaries==
Scott narrated &quot;Wild Wings&quot;, a 1966 British short documentary film, produced by British Transport Films. In 1967, it won an Oscar for Best Short Subject at the 39th Academy Awards.

In August 1986, an ITV Special was transmitted by Central Independent Television (Production No.6407) on Scott entitled &quot;Interest the Boy in Nature&quot; featuring Konrad Lorenz, Prince Philip, David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell; written, produced and directed by Robin Brown.

In 1996 Scott&#x27;s life and work in wildlife conservation was celebrated in a major BBC &quot;Natural World&quot; documentary, produced by Andrew Cooper and narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Filmed across three continents from Hawaii to the Russian arctic, &quot;In the Eye of the Wind&quot; was the BBC Natural History Unit&#x27;s tribute to Scott and the organisation he founded, the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust, on its 50th anniversary.

In June 2004, Scott and Sir David Attenborough were jointly profiled in the second of a three-part BBC Two series, &quot;The Way We Went Wild&quot;, about television wildlife presenters and were described as being largely responsible for the way that the British and much of the world view wildlife.

Scott&#x27;s life was also the subject of a BBC Four documentary called &quot;Peter Scott – A Passion for Nature&quot; produced in 2006 by Available Light Productions (Bristol).

==Loch Ness Monster==
In 1962, he co-founded the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau with Conservative MP David James, who had previously been Polar Adviser on the 1948 film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, based on his father&#x27;s polar expedition. In 1975 Scott proposed the scientific name &quot;Nessiteras rhombopteryx&quot; for the Loch Ness Monster (based on a blurred underwater photograph of a supposed fin) so that it could be registered as an endangered species. The name was based on the Ancient Greek for &quot;monster of Ness with diamond-shaped fin&quot;, but it was later pointed out by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to be an anagram of &quot;Monster hoax by Sir Peter S&quot;. Robert H. Rines, who took two supposed pictures of the monster in the 1970s, responded by pointing out that the letters could also be read as an anagram for, &quot;Yes, both pix are monsters, R.&quot;

==Personal life==
Scott married the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard in 1942 and had a daughter, Nicola, born a year later. Howard left Scott in 1946 and they were divorced in 1951.

In 1951, Scott married his assistant, Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby, while on an expedition to Iceland in search of the breeding grounds of the pink-footed goose. A daughter, Dafila, was born later in the same year (&quot;dafila&quot; is the old scientific name for a pintail). She, too, became an artist, painting birds. A son, Falcon, was born in 1954.

Scott shared a nanny (Enid) with Nigel Hadow and his son Pen Hadow.

==Civilian honours==
Having been appointed a military MBE in the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Civil Division (CBE) in the 1953 Coronation Honours. Having been appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1973 New Year Honours for services to conservation and the environment, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1973. In the 1987 Birthday Honours, he was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour as a Member (CH) &quot;for services to conservation&quot;. In 1987 he was also elected Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Legacy==
The fish Scotts&#x27; wrasse &quot;Cirrhilabrus scottorum&quot; was named after Peter and Philippa Scott for their “great contribution in nature conservation&quot;.

The &quot;Peter Scott Walk&quot; passes the mouth of the River Nene and follows the old sea bank along The Wash, from Scott&#x27;s lighthouse near Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire to the ferry crossing at King&#x27;s Lynn.

The &quot;Sir Peter Scott National Park&quot; is located in central Jamnagar, in Gujarat, India. Jamnagar also has a &quot;Sir Peter Scott Bird Hospital&quot;. These institutions in Jamnagar were founded as a result of the friendship between Peter Scott and Jam Sahib, the Indian ruler of Jamnagar.

<doc id="59925" wikidata="Q548803" url="?curid=59925" title="J. F. C. Fuller">
<text>Major-General John Frederick Charles &quot;Boney&quot; Fuller (1 September 1878 – 10 February 1966) was a senior British Army officer, military historian, and strategist, known as an early theorist of modern armoured warfare, including categorising principles of warfare. With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.

Fuller, a Nazi sympathizer, was implicated in a conspiracy against the British government in 1940.

==Early life==
Fuller was born in Chichester, West Sussex, the son of Alfred Fuller (1832-1927), an Anglican clergyman, and Selma Marie Philippine (1847-1940), née de la Chevallerie. of French descent but raised in Germany. Alfred Fuller retired as rector of Itchenor and moved to Chichester, where his son was born. After moving to Lausanne with his parents as a boy, he returned to England at the age of 11 without them; three years later, at &quot;the somewhat advanced age of 14&quot;, he began attending Malvern College and, later trained for an army career at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from 1897 to 1898. His nickname of &quot;Boney&quot;, which he was to retain, is said to have come either from an admiration for Napoleon Bonaparte, or from an imperious manner combined with military brilliance which resembled Napoleon&#x27;s.

==Career==
Fuller was commissioned into the 1st Battalion of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry (the old 43rd Foot) on 3 August 1898. He served in the Second Boer War in South Africa from December 1899 to 1902, and was promoted to lieutenant on 24 February 1900 a couple of months after arriving there. In the spring of 1904 Fuller was sent with his unit to India, where he contracted typhoid fever in autumn of 1905; he returned to England the next year on sick-leave, where he met the woman he married in December 1906. Instead of returning to India, he was reassigned to Volunteer units in England, serving as adjutant to the 2nd South Middlesex Volunteers (amalgamated into the Kensingtons during the Haldane Reforms) and helping to form the new 10th Middlesex. Fuller later claimed that his position with the 10th Middlesex inspired him to study soldiering seriously. In 1913, he was accepted into the Staff College, Camberley, starting work there in January 1914.

During the First World War, Fuller was a staff officer with the Home Forces and with VII Corps in France, and from 1916 in the Headquarters of the Machine-Gun Corps&#x27; Heavy Branch which was later to become the Tank Corps. He helped plan the tank attack at the 20 November 1917 Battle of Cambrai and the tank operations for the autumn offensives of 1918. His Plan 1919 for a fully mechanised offensive against the German army was never implemented. After 1918, in January of which he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel, he held various leading positions, notably as a commander of an experimental brigade at Aldershot.

After the war Fuller, who in January 1919 was promoted to brevet colonel in recognition of &quot;valuable services rendered in connection with the War&quot;, collaborated with his colleague B. H. Liddell Hart in developing new ideas for the mechanisation of 
armies, launching a crusade for the mechanisation and modernisation of the British Army. Chief instructor at the Staff College, Camberley from 1923, he became military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1926. In what came to be known as the &quot;Tidworth Incident&quot;, Fuller turned down the command of the Experimental Mechanized Force, which was formed on 27 August 1927. The appointment also carried responsibility for a regular infantry brigade and the garrison of Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain. Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Experimental Mechanized Force and the development of mechanized warfare techniques without extra staff to assist him with the additional extraneous duties, which the War Office refused to allocate. He was promoted to major-general in 1930 and retired three years later to devote himself entirely to writing.

==Retirement==
After retirement, Fuller served as a reporter during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935) and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Impatient with what he considered the inability of democracy to adopt military reforms, Fuller became involved with Sir Oswald Mosley and the British fascist movement. As a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), he sat on the party&#x27;s Policy Directorate and was considered one of Mosley&#x27;s closest allies. He was also a member of the clandestine far-right group the Nordic League.

Fuller&#x27;s ideas on mechanised warfare continued to be influential in the lead-up to the Second World War, ironically less with his countrymen than with the Nazis, notably Heinz Guderian who spent his own money to have Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Provisional Instructions for Tank and Armoured Car Training&quot; translated. In the 1930s, the German Army implemented tactics similar in many ways to Fuller&#x27;s analysis, which became known as Blitzkrieg. Like Fuller, theorists of Blitzkrieg partly based their approach on the theory that areas of large enemy activity should be bypassed to be eventually surrounded and destroyed. Blitzkrieg-style tactics were used by several nations throughout the Second World War, predominantly by the Germans in the invasion of Poland (1939), Western Europe (1940), and the Soviet Union (1941). While Germany and to some degree the Western Allies adopted Blitzkrieg ideas, they were not much used by the Red Army, which developed its armored warfare doctrine based on deep operations, which were developed by Soviet military theorists Marshal M. N. Tukhachevsky et al. in the 1920s based on their experiences in the First World War and the Russian Civil War.

Fuller was the only foreigner present at Nazi Germany&#x27;s first armed manoeuvres in 1935. Fuller frequently praised Adolf Hitler in his speeches and articles, once describing him as &quot;that realistic idealist who has awakened the common sense of the British people by setting out to create a new Germany&quot;. On 20 April 1939, Fuller was an honoured guest at Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday parade, watching as &quot;for three hours a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the Führer.&quot; Afterwards Hitler asked, &quot;I hope you were pleased with your children?&quot; Fuller replied, &quot;Your Excellency, they have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them.&quot;

During the Second World War, 1939–1945, Fuller was under suspicion for his Nazi sympathies. At one meeting of the Right Club, which had been set up in May 1939, Fuller, declared the need for &quot;a bloody revolution&quot; in Britain and added &quot;I am ready to start one right away.&quot; In 1940, Fuller was implicated as a participant in a fascist plot, organized by Leigh Vaughan-Henry, against the British government. Vaughan-Henry was reported to have already organized 18 cells of 25 members each for the coup, which was intended to take place when Germany landed in Britain. In a separate plot organized by John Beckett, Fuller was named as the Minister of Defense for a Quisling government.

Fuller continued to speak out in favour of a peaceful settlement with Germany. Alan Brooke (in his war diaries, p. 201) comments that &quot;the Director of Security called on him to discuss Boney Fuller and his Nazi activities&quot;, but Brooke commented that he did not think Fuller &quot;had any unpatriotic intentions&quot;. Although he was not interned or arrested, he was the only officer of his rank not invited to return to service during the war. There was some suspicion that he was not incarcerated in May 1940 along with other leading officials of the BUF because of his association with General Edmund Ironside and other senior officers. Mosley himself admitted to &quot;a little puzzlement&quot; as to why Fuller had not been imprisoned.

Ironside himself had been implicated as a potential leader of the coup, with Fuller telling retired Admiral Barry Domvile, a fellow Nazi sympathizer, that &quot;Ironside is with us.&quot; A fellow conspirator, Samuel Darwin-Fox, told an MI5 agent that:&quot;Italy would declare war almost immediately, that France would then give in and that Britain would follow before the end of the week. There would be a short civil war, the Government would leave first for Bristol and then for the Colonies, General Ironside would become dictator and after things had settled down Germany could do as she liked with Britain.&quot;Fuller spent his last years believing that the wrong side had won the Second World War. He most fully announced that thesis in the 1961 edition of &quot;The Reformation of War&quot;. There, he announced his belief that Hitler was the saviour of the West against the Soviet Union and denounced Churchill and Roosevelt for being too stupid to see so. Fuller died in Falmouth, Cornwall, in 1966.

==Military theories==
Fuller was a vigorous, expressive, and opinionated writer of military history and of controversial predictions of the future of war, publishing &quot;On Future Warfare&quot; in 1928. Seeing his teachings largely vindicated by the Second World War, he published &quot;Machine Warfare: An Enquiry into the Influence of Mechanics on the Art of War&quot; in 1942.

===&quot;The Foundations of the Science of War&quot; (1926)===
Fuller is perhaps best known today for his &quot;Nine Principles of War&quot; which have formed the foundation of much of modern military theory since the 1930s, and which were originally derived from a convergence of Fuller&#x27;s mystical and military interests. The Nine Principles went through several iterations; Fuller stated that &quot;the system evolved from six principles in 1912, rose to eight in 1915, to, virtually, nineteen in 1923, and then descended to nine in 1925&quot;. For example, notice how his analysis of General Ulysses S. Grant was presented in 1929.

The United States Army modified Fuller&#x27;s list and issued its first list of the principles of war in 1921, making it the basis of advanced training for officers into the 1990s, when it finally reconceptualised its training.

====The Nine Principles of War====
The Nine Principles involve the uses of force (combat power). They have been expressed in various ways, but Fuller&#x27;s 1925 arrangement is as follows:

# Direction: What is the overall aim? Which objectives must be met to achieve the aim?
# Concentration: Where will the commander focus the most effort?
# Distribution: Where and how will the commander position their force?
# Determination: The will to fight, the will to persevere, and the will to win must be maintained.
# Surprise (Demoralisation of Force): The commander&#x27;s ability to veil their intentions while discovering those of their enemy. Properly executed &quot;Surprise&quot; unbalances the enemy – causing Demoralisation of Force.
# Endurance: The force&#x27;s resistance to pressure. This is measured by the force&#x27;s ability to anticipate complications and threats. This is enhanced by planning on how best to avoid, overcome, or negate them and then properly educating and training the force in these methods.
# Mobility: The commander&#x27;s ability to manoeuvre their force while outmanoeuvring the enemy&#x27;s forces.
# Offensive Action (Disorganisation of Force): The ability to gain and maintain the initiative in combat. Properly executed &quot;Offensive Action&quot; disrupts the enemy - causing Disorganisation of Force.
# Security: The ability to protect the force from threats.

====Triads and Trichotomies====
Cabalistic influences on his theories can be shown by his use of the &quot;Law of Threes&quot; throughout his work. Fuller did not believe the Principles stood alone as is thought today, but that they complemented and overlapped each other as part of a whole, forming the Law of Economy of Force.

====Organisation of Force====
These Principles were further grouped into the categories of &quot;Control&quot; (command / co-operation), &quot;Pressure&quot; (attack / activity) and &quot;Resistance&quot; (protection / stability). The Principles of Control guides the dual Principles of Pressure and of Resistance, which in turn create the Principles of Control.
* Principles of Control (1, 4, &amp; 7): Direction, Determination, &amp; Mobility.
* Principles of Pressure (2, 5, &amp; 8): Concentration, Surprise, &amp; Offensive Action.
* Principles of Resistance (3, 6, &amp; 9): Distribution, Endurance, &amp; Security.

====The Unity of the Principles of War====
They were also grouped into Cosmic (&quot;Spiritual&quot;), Mental (&quot;Mind / Thought / Reason&quot;), Moral (&quot;Soul / Sensations / Emotions&quot;), and Physical (&quot;Body / Musculature / Action&quot;) Spheres, in which two Principles (like the double-edged point of an arrowhead) combine to create or manifest a third, which in turn guides the first and second Principles (like the fletches on an arrow&#x27;s tail). Each Sphere leads to the creation of the next until it returns to the beginning and repeats the circular cycle with reassessments of the &quot;Object&quot; and &quot;Objective&quot; to redefine the uses of &quot;Force&quot;. The Cosmic Sphere is seen as outside the other three Spheres, like the Heavens are outside the Realm of Man. They influence it indirectly in ways that cannot be controlled by the commander, but they are a factor in the use of Force. Force resides in the center of the pattern, as all of these elements revolve around it.
* Cosmic Sphere: Goal (&quot;Object&quot;) &amp; Desire (&quot;Objective&quot;) = Method (&quot;Economy of Force&quot;)
** &quot;Goal&quot; is the overall purpose or aim of the mission (what Goals must the mission complete or achieve?).
** &quot;Desire&quot; concerns the priority of the achievement or acquisition of the Goal (how important and essential is the Goal to the overall mission effort?). 
** &quot;Method&quot; is how the forces available will carry out the mission (How much of the mission&#x27;s force will be assigned - or are available – to accomplish the Goal?). 
* Mental Sphere (1, 2, &amp; 3): Reason (&quot;Direction&quot;) &amp; Imagination (&quot;Concentration&quot;) = Will (&quot;Distribution&quot;)
* Moral Sphere (4, 5, &amp; 6): Fear (&quot;Determination&quot;) &amp; Morale (&quot;Surprise&quot;) = Courage (&quot;Endurance&quot;)
* Physical Sphere (7, 8, &amp; 9): Attack (&quot;Offensive Action&quot;) &amp; Protection (&quot;Security&quot;) = Movement (&quot;Mobility&quot;)

These Principles of War have been adopted and further refined by the military forces of several nations, most notably within NATO, and continue to be applied widely to modern strategic thinking. Recently they have also been applied to business tactics and hobby wargaming.

===&quot;Lectures on Field Service Regulations III&quot; (1932)===
Fuller also had a knack for aphorisms, witness: &quot;To attack the nerves of an army, and through its nerves the will of its commander, is more profitable than battering to pieces the bodies of its men.&quot; His &quot;Lectures&quot; have attracted much attention over the course of decades, with one staff writer even going so far as to extend his vision of the tank as &quot;master-weapon&quot; to say that the helicopter not the tank would be the chief determinant of success on the battlefield from the late 20th century.

The book was carefully read by General Heinz Guderian of later Blitzkrieg fame and at the time Germany&#x27;s foremost tank expert. The Soviet Army initially issued 30,000 copies of it and designated it as a table book for all Red Army officers. Later, the Soviets increased publication to 100,000 volumes. In Czechoslovakia, it became the standard reference for the teaching of mechanized warfare at their staff college. Ironically, in Britain only 500 copies were sold by 1935 while in the United States, the Infantry Journal received a copy at the time of publishing but failed to review it.

===&quot;Armament and History (1945)&quot;===
Fuller also developed the idea of the &quot;Constant Tactical Factor&quot;. This states that every improvement in warfare is checked by a counter-improvement, causing the advantage to shift back and forth between the offensive and the defensive. Fuller&#x27;s firsthand experience in the First World War saw a shift from the defensive power of the machine gun to the offensive power of the tank.

==Magic and mysticism==
Fuller had an occultist side that oddly mixed with his military side. He was an early disciple of English poet and magician Aleister Crowley, and was very familiar with his and other forms of magick and mysticism. While serving in the First Oxfordshire Light Infantry he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley&#x27;s poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant. This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as &quot;The Star in the West&quot;. After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the A∴A∴., within which he became a leading member, editing order documents and its journal, &quot;The Equinox&quot;. During this period he wrote &quot;The Treasure House of Images&quot;, edited early sections of Crowley&#x27;s magical autobiography &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King&quot; and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A∴A∴ teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal&#x27;s revival, &quot;The Equinox, Volume IV&quot;.

After the April 1911 &quot;Jones vs. The Looking Glass&quot; case, in which a great deal was made of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s bisexuality (although Crowley himself was not a party to the case), Fuller became worried that his association with Crowley might be a hindrance to his career. Crowley writes in chapter 67 of his book, &quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&quot;:

After this, contact between the two men faded rapidly. The front pages of the 1913 issues of the &quot;Equinox&quot; (Volume 1, nos. 9 and 10), which gave general directions to A∴A∴ members, included a notice on the subject of Fuller, who was described as a &quot;former Probationer&quot;; the notice disparaged Fuller&#x27;s magical accomplishments and warned A∴A∴ members to accept no magical training from him. However, Fuller continued to be fascinated with occult subjects and in later years he would write about topics such as the Qabalah and yoga. During the mid-1940s, Charles Richard Cammell (author of &quot;Aleister Crowley: The Man, The Mage, The Poet&quot;) met with Fuller and reported his views about Crowley: &quot;I have heard an eminent personage, General J.F.C. Fuller, a man famous in arms and letters, one who has known the greatest statesmen, warriors, dictators, of our age, declare solemnly that the most extraordinary genius he ever knew was Crowley.&quot; After the Second World War and Crowley&#x27;s death, Fuller wrote a letter to Edward Noel FitzGerald stating: &quot;Crowley was a genuine avatar, but I don&#x27;t think he knew it, but I do think he senses it in an emotional way.&quot; (17 September 1949)

==Works==
Fuller was a prolific writer and published more than 45 books.

<text>Albert I (8 April 1875 – 17 February 1934) was King of the Belgians from 23 December 1909 until his death in 1934. He is popularly referred to as the Knight King (, ) or Soldier King (, ) in Belgium in reference to his role during World War I.

Albert was born in Brussels as the fifth child and second son of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Albert succeeded his uncle Leopold II to the Belgian throne in 1909. He married Elisabeth of Bavaria, with whom he had three children.

Albert ruled during an eventful period in the history of Belgium, which included the period of World War I (1914–1918), when most of Belgium was occupied by German forces. Other crucial events of his reign included the adoption of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919, the ruling of the Belgian Congo as an overseas possession of Belgium along with the League of Nations mandate of Ruanda-Urundi, the reconstruction of Belgium following the war, and the first five years of the Great Depression (1929–1934).

Albert died in a mountaineering accident in eastern Belgium in 1934, at the age of 58, and he was succeeded by his son Leopold III ().

==Early life==

Albert Léopold Clément Marie Meinrad was born 8 April 1875 in Brussels, the fifth child and second son of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, and his wife, Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Prince Philippe was the third (second surviving) son of Leopold I (), the first King of the Belgians, and his wife, Louise-Marie of France, and the younger brother of King Leopold II of Belgium (). Princess Marie was a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany (), and a member of the non-reigning, Catholic branch of the Hohenzollern family. Albert grew up in the Palace of the Count of Flanders, initially as third in the line of succession to the Belgian throne as his reigning uncle Leopold II&#x27;s son had already died. When, however, Albert&#x27;s older brother, Prince Baudouin of Belgium, who had been subsequently prepared for the throne, also died young, Albert, at the age of 16, unexpectedly became second in line (after his father) to the Belgian Crown.

Retiring and studious, Albert prepared himself strenuously for the task of kingship. In his youth, Albert was seriously concerned with the situation of the working classes in Belgium, and personally travelled around working-class districts incognito, to observe the living conditions of the people. Shortly before his accession to the throne in 1909, Albert undertook an extensive tour of the Belgian Congo, which had been annexed by Belgium in 1908, finding the country in poor condition. Upon his return to Belgium, he recommended reforms to protect the native population and further technological progress in the colony.

==Marriage==
Albert was married in Munich on 2 October 1900 to Bavarian Duchess Elisabeth Gabrielle Valérie Marie, a Wittelsbach princess whom he had met at a family funeral. A daughter of Bavarian Duke Karl-Theodor, and his second wife, the Infanta Maria Josepha of Portugal, she was born at Possenhofen Castle, Bavaria, Germany, on 25 July 1876, and died on 23 November 1965.

The civil wedding was conducted by Friedrich Krafft Graf von Crailsheim in the Throne Hall, and the religious wedding was conducted by Cardinal von Stein, assisted by Jakob von Türk, Confessionar of the King of Bavaria.

Based on the letters written during their engagement and marriage (cited extensively in the memoirs of their daughter, Marie-José) the young couple appear to have been deeply in love. The letters express a deep mutual affection based on a rare affinity of spirit. They also make clear that Albert and Elisabeth continually supported and encouraged each other in their challenging roles as king and queen. The spouses shared an intense commitment to their country and family and a keen interest in human progress of all kinds. Together, they cultivated the friendship of prominent scientists, artists, mathematicians, musicians, and philosophers, turning their court at Laeken into a kind of cultural salon.

===Children===
Albert and Elisabeth had three children:
* Léopold Philippe Charles Albert Meinrad Hubert Marie Michel, Duke of Brabant, Prince of Belgium, who became later the fourth king of the Belgians as Leopold III (3 November 1901 – 25 September 1983, at Woluwe-Saint-Lambert).
* Charles Théodore Henri Antoine Meinrad, Count of Flanders, Prince of Belgium, Prince Regent of Belgium (10 October 1903, in Brussels – 1 June 1983, at Ostend).
* Marie-José Charlotte Sophie Amélie Henriette Gabrielle, last Queen of Italy (4 August 1906, in Ostend – 27 January 2001). She was married at Rome, Italy on 8 January 1930 to Prince Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria, Prince of Piemonte (born 15 September 1904 and died on 18 March 1983 at Geneva, Switzerland). He became King Umberto II (r. 1946) of Italy.

==Accession==

Following the death of his uncle, Leopold II, Albert succeeded to the Belgian throne in December 1909, since Albert&#x27;s own father had died in 1905. Previous Belgian kings had taken the royal accession oath only in French; Albert innovated by taking it in Dutch as well. He and his wife, Queen Elisabeth, were popular in Belgium due to their simple, unassuming lifestyle and their harmonious family life, which stood in marked contrast to the aloof, autocratic manner and the dissolute private life of Leopold II. An important aspect of the early years of Albert&#x27;s reign was his institution of many reforms in the administration of the Belgian Congo, Belgium&#x27;s only colonial possession.

==Religion==

King Albert was a devout Catholic. Many stories illustrate his deep and tender piety. For instance, when his former tutor General De Grunne, in his old age, entered the Benedictine monastery of Maredsous in Belgium, King Albert wrote a letter to him in which he spoke of the joy of giving oneself to God. He said: &quot;May you spend many years at Maredsous in the supreme comfort of soul that is given to natures touched by grace, by faith in God&#x27;s infinite power and confidence in His goodness.&quot; To another friend, Lu Zhengxiang, a former prime minister of China who became a Catholic monk in Belgium, Albert wrote: &quot;Consecrating oneself wholly to the service of Our Lord gives, to those touched by grace, the peace of soul which is the supreme happiness here below.&quot; Albert used to tell his children: &quot;As you nourish your body, so you should nourish your soul.&quot; In an interesting meditation on what he viewed as the harm that would result if Christian ideals were abandoned in Belgium, he said: &quot;Every time society has distanced itself from the Gospel, which preached humility, fraternity, and peace, the people have been unhappy, because the pagan civilisation of ancient Rome, which they wanted to replace it with, is based only on pride and the abuse of force&quot; (Commemorative speech for the war dead of the Battle of the Yser, given by Dom Marie-Albert, Abbot of Orval Abbey, Belgium, in 1936).

==World War I==

The war inflicted great suffering on Belgium, which was subjected to a harsh German occupation. The King, fearing the destructive results of the war for Belgium and Europe and appalled by the huge casualty rates, worked through secret diplomatic channels for a negotiated peace between Germany and the Entente based on the &quot;no victors, no vanquished&quot; concept. He considered that such a resolution to the conflict would best protect the interests of Belgium and the future peace and stability of Europe. Neither Germany nor the Entente were favourable to the idea, tending instead to seek total victory, and Albert&#x27;s attempts to further a negotiated peace were unsuccessful. At the end of the war, as commander of the Army Group Flanders, consisting of Belgian, British and French divisions, Albert led the final offensive of the war that liberated occupied Belgium. King Albert, Queen Elisabeth, and their children then reentered Brussels to a hero&#x27;s welcome.

The King Albert I Memorial in Nieuwpoort is dedicated to King Albert and the Belgian troops during the Great War. There are also at least two memorials to Albert outside Belgium, to commemorate his role in the Great War: Nancy, France has a Boulevard Albert Ier and a statue of the King, and Le Havre, France has a Boulevard Albert Ier. Interestingly, the Nancy statue is marked &quot;Albert Ier&quot; even though, when it was erected in 1934 following his death earlier that year, he was the only King of the Belgians to have been called Albert.


==Post-war years==

Upon his return to Brussels, King Albert made a speech in which he outlined the reforms he desired to see implemented in Belgium, including an improved military, universal suffrage and the establishment of a Flemish University in Ghent.

===Trip to the United States===

From 23 September to 13 November 1919, King Albert, Queen Elisabeth of Bavaria, and their son Prince Leopold made an official visit to the United States. King Albert and his party arrived in New York City on 2 October. The party would then proceed to visit several sites in the Eastern United States including Boston and Niagara Falls, before heading to the Western United States. King Albert and his party arrived in California on 10 October. Upon arrival in Sacramento, the King awarded the Order of Leopold II to the engineer who was on board the King&#x27;s special train. During his brief stay in Sacramento thousands came to see the Belgian royals, with mothers even holding out their babies for the King to kiss. During a visit of the historic Native American pueblo of Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico, King Albert decorated Father Anton Docher with Knight in the Order of Leopold II. Docher offered the King a turquoise cross mounted in silver made by the Tiwas Indians. Ten thousand people travelled to Isleta for this occasion. That same year he was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. 
In New York, the King received a ticker tape parade in his honor. The visit was considered a success by the Belgian authorities.

===Introduction of universal male suffrage===
Since the Belgian general strike of 1893, plural votes had been granted to individual men based on their wealth, education, and age, but after the Belgian general strike of 1913 the promise had been made to have constitutional reform for &quot;one man, one vote&quot; universal suffrage but the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914 and the subsequent occupation delayed the implementation of the commission&#x27;s proposal.

In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war &quot;Government of National Union&quot; made up of members of the three main parties in Belgium, the Catholics, the Liberals, and the Socialists and attempted to mediate between the parties in order to bring about &quot;one man, one vote&quot; universal suffrage for men. He succeeded in doing so.

===Paris Peace Conference===
The Belgian Government sent the King to the Paris Peace Conference in April 1919, where he met with the leaders of France, Britain and the United States. He had four strategic goals:
# to restore and expand the Belgian economy using cash reparations from Germany;
# to assure Belgium&#x27;s security by the creation of a new buffer state on the left bank of the Rhine;
# to revise the obsolete treaty of 1839;
# to promote a &#x27;rapprochement&#x27; between Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

He strongly advised against a harsh, restrictive treaty against Germany to prevent future German aggression. He also considered that the dethronement of the princes of Central Europe and, in particular, the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire would constitute a serious menace to peace and stability on the continent. The Allies considered Belgium to be the chief victim of the war, and it aroused enormous popular sympathy, but the King&#x27;s advice played a small role in Paris.

===Later years===
Albert spent much of the remainder of his reign assisting in the postwar reconstruction of Belgium.

In 1920 Albert changed the family name from &quot;Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot; to &quot;House of Belgium&quot; (&quot;van België&quot;, in Dutch; &quot;de Belgique&quot; in French) as a result of strong anti-German sentiment. This mirrored the British royal family&#x27;s name-change to House of Windsor in 1917.

Albert was a committed conservationist and in 1925, influenced by the ideas of Carl E. Akeley, he founded Africa&#x27;s first national park, now known as Virunga National Park, in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo. During this period, he was also the first reigning European monarch to visit the United States.

==Death==
A passionate alpinist, King Albert I died in a mountaineering accident on 17 February 1934, while climbing alone on the Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche-les-Dames, in the Ardennes region of Belgium near Namur. His death shocked the world and he was deeply mourned, both in Belgium and abroad. Because King Albert was an expert climber, some questioned the official version of his death and suggested that the King was murdered (or even committed suicide) somewhere else and that his body had never been at Marche-les-Dames, or that it was deposited there. Several of those hypotheses with criminal motives were investigated by authorities, but doubts have remained ever since, being the subject of popular novels, books, and documentaries. Rumors of murder have been dismissed by most historians. There are two possible explanations for his death, according to the official juridical investigations: the first was that the king leaned against a boulder at the top of the mountain that became dislodged; the second that the pinnacle to which his rope was belayed broke, causing him to fall about . In 2016, DNA testing by geneticist Dr. Maarten Larmuseau and colleagues from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven on bloodstained leaves that were collected in 1934 from Marche-les-Dames concluded that King Albert had died at that location.

Like his predecessors Leopold I and Leopold II, King Albert is interred in the Royal Crypt at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels.

In 1935, prominent Belgian author Emile Cammaerts published a widely acclaimed biography of King Albert I, titled &quot;Albert of Belgium: Defender of Right&quot;. In 1993, a close climbing companion of the King, Walter Amstutz, founded the King Albert I Memorial Foundation, an association based in Switzerland and dedicated to honouring distinguished individuals in the mountaineering world.

To celebrate 175 years of the Belgian royal family and the 100th anniversary of his accession, Albert I was selected as the main motif of a high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Belgian 12.5 euro Albert I commemorative coin, minted in 2008. The obverse shows a portrait of the King.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, as consul, is sent against the slaves in Italy. Gaius Marius serves under Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus at Numantia.
* Scipio Aemilianus captures Numantia, after a siege of eight months, suffering famine and pestilence. The remnant population of 4,000 citizens, surrender and set their city on fire. Thus ends the Numantine War.
* Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, is elected tribune of the people. He attempts to pass a law to redistribute the public land to benefit small landowners. Opposed by wealthier factions in the Roman Senate, he is killed by a group of senators and their followers that same year.
* The Kingdom of Pergamum is deeded to Rome, Aristonicus starts a rebellion against this.

==== China ====
* June – A large army of the Han dynasty, under the overall command of Han Anguo, attempts to ambush the Xiongnu leader Junchen Chanyu in the Battle of Mayi. By pretending to betray the city of Mayi, a Han official had lured Junchen onto Han soil. However, a captured Chinese officer tips off Junchen, and so he avoids the ambush. The episode abrogates the Xiongnu-Han treaty (called heqin 和親 or &quot;harmonious kinship&quot;) and marks the beginning of Emperor Wu&#x27;s Han-Xiongnu War.
* Foreign Minister Wang Hui, who, against the opposition of Han Anguo, had advocated for war, fails to attack the retreating supply column of the Xiongnu and is sentenced to death. He commits suicide.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Attalus III, king of Pergamon. In his will, he makes the people of Rome his heirs (b. 170 BC)
* Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus the Roman tribune (assassination) (b. 168 BC)

<text>Year 128 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Octavius and Rufus (or, less frequently, year 626 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;) and the First Year of Yuanshuo. The denomination 128 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

They kill the governor of Liaoxi, defeat the governor of Yuyang, capture 2000 of the inhabitants of Liaoxi and Yuyang and defeat the Han general Han Anguo. Han Anguo and his cavalry force are surrounded in their camp but the arrival of relief forces coming from Yan causes the Xiongnu army to withdraw. The Xiongnu also invade Yanmen and kill or capture 1000 people.
* The Han general Wei Qing, with an army of 30,000 cavalrymen, defeats a Xiongnu army north of Yanmen. The Han general Li Xi attacks the Xiongnu further to the east, riding out of Dai Prefecture.
* Having spent a year in Greater Yuezhi, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian begins his return journey to China, having failed to persuade Yuezhi&#x27;s king to form an alliance against the Xiongnu.

<doc id="59940" wikidata="Q21744" url="?curid=59940" title="Falconidae">
<text>The falcons and caracaras are around 65 species of diurnal birds of prey that make up the family Falconidae (representing all extant species in the order Falconiformes). The family likely originated in South America during the Paleocene and is divided into three subfamilies: Herpetotherinae, which includes the laughing falcon and forest falcons; Polyborinae, which includes the spot-winged falconet and the caracaras; and Falconinae, the falcons and kestrels (&quot;Falco&quot;) and falconets (&quot;Microhierax&quot;).

==Description==
Falcons and caracaras are small to medium-sized birds of prey, ranging in size from the black-thighed falconet, which can weigh as little as , to the gyrfalcon, which can weigh as much as . They have strongly hooked bills, sharply curved talons and excellent eyesight. The plumage is usually composed of browns, whites, chestnut, black and grey, often with barring of patterning. There is little difference in the plumage of males and females, although a few species have some sexual dimorphism in boldness of plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
The family has a cosmopolitan distribution across the world, absent only from the densest forests of central Africa, some remote oceanic islands, the high Arctic and Antarctica. Some species have exceptionally wide ranges, particularly the cosmopolitan peregrine falcon, which ranges from Greenland to Fiji and has the widest natural breeding distribution of any bird. Other species have more restricted distributions, particularly island endemics like the Mauritius kestrel. Most habitat types are occupied, from tundra to rainforest and deserts, although they are generally more birds of open country and even forest species tend to prefer broken forest and forest edges. Some species, mostly in the genus &quot;Falco&quot;, are fully migratory, with some species summering in Eurasia and wintering entirely in Africa, other species may be partly migratory. The Amur falcon has one of the longest migrations, moving from East Asia to southern Africa.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===

Falcons and caracaras are carnivores, feeding on birds, small mammals including bats, reptiles, insects and carrion. In popular imagination the falconids are fast flying predators, and while this is true of the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and some falconets, other species, particularly the caracaras, are more sedentary in their feeding. The forest falcons of the Neotropics are generalist forest hunters. Several species, particularly the true falcons, will stash food supplies in caches. They are solitary hunters and pairs guard territories, although they may form large flocks during migration. Some species are specialists, such as the laughing falcon, which specialises in snakes, and the red-throated caracara, which mainly feeds on the larvae of bees and wasps; others are more generalist in their diet.

===Breeding===

The falcons and caracaras are generally solitary breeders, although around 10% of species are colonial, for example the red-footed falcon. They are monogamous, although some caracaras may also employ alloparenting strategies, where younger birds help adults (usually their parents) in raising the next brood of chicks. Nests are generally not built (except by the caracaras), but are co opted from other birds, for example pygmy falcons nest in the nests of weavers, or on the ledges on cliffs. Around 2–4 eggs are laid, and mostly incubated by the female. Incubation times vary from species to species and are correlated with body size, lasting 28 days in smaller species and up to 35 days in larger species. Chicks fledge after 28–49 days, again varying with size.

==Relations with humans==
Falcons and caracaras have a complicated relationship with humans. In ancient Egypt they were deified in the form of Horus, the sky and sun god who was the ancestor of the pharaohs. Caracaras also formed part of the legends of the Aztecs. Falcons were important in the (formerly often royal) sport of falconry. They have also been persecuted for their predation on game and farm animals, and that persecution has led to the extinction of at least one species, the Guadalupe caracara. Several insular species have declined dramatically, none more so than the Mauritius kestrel, which at one time numbered no more than four birds. Around five species of falcon are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN, including the saker falcon.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The family Falconidae was introduced by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819. The family is composed of three main branches: the falconets and true falcons, the caracaras, and the forest falcons. Differences exist between authorities in how these are grouped into subfamilies. Also, the placement of the laughing falcon (&quot;Herpetotheres&quot;) and the spot-winged falconet (&quot;Spiziapteryx&quot;) varies. One common approach uses two subfamilies Polyborinae and Falconinae. The first contains the caracaras, forest falcons, and laughing falcon. All species in this group are native to the Americas.

The composition of Falconidae is disputed, and Polyborninae is not featured in the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union checklists for North and South American birds that are produced by its Classification Committees (NACC and SACC). The Check-list of North American Birds considers the laughing falcon a true falcon (Falconinae) and replaces Polyborinae with Caracarinae and Micrasturinae. On the other hand, the Check-list of South American Birds classifies all caracaras as true falcons and puts the laughing falcon and forest falcons into the subfamily Herpetotherinae.

Falconinae, in its traditional classification, contains the falcons, falconets, and pygmy falcons. Depending on the authority, Falconinae may also include the caracaras and/or the laughing falcon.

===Phylogeny===
The following cladogram is based on a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the Falconidae by Jérôme Fuchs and collaborators that was published in 2015. The number of species is taken from the list of birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Fuchs and collaborators recommended that the genus &quot;Daptrius&quot; should be expanded to include the genera &quot;Phalcoboenus&quot; and &quot;Milvago&quot; due to the shallow genetic divergence. This change has been adopted by the Clements Checklist but not by the IOC.

===List of genera===
Below is list of the subfamilies and genera of the Falconidae.

===Fossil genera===

<text>Nyāya (Sanskrit: न्यायः, IAST: nyāyaḥ), literally meaning &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;rules&quot;, &quot;method&quot; or &quot;judgment&quot;, is one of the six orthodox (Āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy. Nyāya&#x27;s most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were systematic development of the theory of logic, methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.

Nyāya school&#x27;s epistemology accepts four out of six &quot;Pramanas&quot; as reliable means of gaining knowledge – &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;Anumāṇa&quot; (inference), &quot;Upamāna&quot; (comparison and analogy) and &quot;Śabda&quot; (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). In its metaphysics, Nyāya school is closer to the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism than others. It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance). Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led &quot;Nyāya&quot; to concern itself with epistemology, that is the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyyayikas, it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one&#x27;s delusions, and understanding true nature of soul, self and reality.

Naiyyayika scholars approached philosophy as a form of direct realism, stating that anything that really exists is in principle humanly knowable. To them, correct knowledge and understanding is different from simple, reflexive cognition; it requires &quot;Anuvyavasaya&quot; (अनुव्यवसाय, cross-examination of cognition, reflective cognition of what one thinks one knows). An influential collection of texts on logic and reason is the &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot;, attributed to Aksapada Gautama, variously estimated to have been composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.

&quot;Nyāya&quot; school shares some of its methodology and human suffering foundations with Buddhism; however, a key difference between the two is that Buddhism believes that there is neither a soul nor self; &quot;Nyāya&quot; school like some other schools of Hinduism such as &quot;Dvaita&quot; and &quot;Viśiṣṭādvaita&quot; believes that there is a soul and self, with liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;) as a state of removal of ignorance, wrong knowledge, the gain of correct knowledge, and unimpeded continuation of self.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nyaya&quot; (न्याय) is a Sanskrit word which means justice, equality for all being, specially a collection of general or universal rules. In some contexts, it means model, axiom, plan, legal proceeding, judicial sentence, or judgment. Nyaya could also mean, &quot;that which shows the way&quot; tracing its Sanskrit etymology. In the theory of logic, and Indian texts discussing it, the term also refers to an argument consisting of an enthymeme or sometimes for any syllogism. In philosophical context, &quot;Nyaya&quot; encompasses propriety, logic and method.

Panini, revered Sanskrit grammarian, derives the &quot;Nyaya&quot; from the root &quot;i&quot; which conveys the same meaning as &quot;gam&quot; – to go. &quot;Nyaya&quot; signifying logic is there etymologically identical with &quot;nigama&quot; the conclusion of a syllogism.

&quot;Nyaya&quot; is related to several other concepts and words used in Indian philosophies: &quot;Hetu-vidya&quot; (science of causes), &quot;Anviksiki&quot; (science of inquiry, systematic philosophy), &quot;Pramana-sastra&quot; (epistemology, science of correct knowledge), &quot;Tattva-sastra&quot; (science of categories), &quot;Tarka-vidya&quot; (science of reasoning, innovation, synthesis), &quot;Vadartha&quot; (science of discussion) and &quot;Phakkika-sastra&quot; (science of uncovering sophism, fraud, error, finding fakes). Some of these subsume or deploy the tools of &quot;Nyaya&quot;.

==Development==

The historical development of Nyāya school is unclear, although &quot;Nasadiya&quot; hymns of Book 10 Chapter 129 of Rigveda recite its spiritual questions in logical propositions. In early centuries BCE, states Clooney, the early Nyāya scholars began compiling the science of rational, coherent inquiry and pursuit of knowledge.

=== Foundational Text ===
Aksapada Gautama composed the &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot; (by 2nd century CE), a foundational text for Nyāya, that primarily discusses logic, methodology and epistemology. Gautama is also known as Aksapada and Dirghatapas. The names Gotama and Gautama points to the family to which he belonged while the names Aksapada and Dirghatapas refer respectively to his meditative habit and practice of long penance. The people of Mithila (modern Darbhanga in North Bihar) ascribe the foundation of Nyāya philosophy to Gautama, husband of Ahalya, and point out as the place of his birth a village named Gautamasthana where a fair is held every year on the 9th day of the lunar month of Chaitra (March–April). It is situated 28 miles north-east of Darbhanga.

=== Commentarial Tradition ===
Concepts in the foundational text, the Nyaya Sutras, were clarified through a tradition of commentaries. Commentaries were also a means to defend the philosophy from misinterpretations by scholars of other traditions.

The Nyāya scholars that followed refined, expanded, and applied the &quot;Nyaya Sutras&quot; to spiritual questions. While the early Nyaya scholars published little to no analysis on whether supernatural power or God exists, they did apply their insights into reason and reliable means to knowledge to the questions of nature of existence, spirituality, happiness and moksha. Later Nyāya scholars, such as Udayana, examined various arguments on theism and attempted to prove existence of God. Other Nyāya scholars offered arguments to disprove the existence of God.

The most important contribution made by the Nyāya school to Hindu thought has been its treatises on epistemology and system of logic that, subsequently, has been adopted by the majority of the other Indian schools.

==Metaphysics==

=== Sixteen categories (&quot;padārthas&quot;) ===
The Nyāya metaphysics recognizes sixteen &quot;padarthas&quot; or categories and includes all six (or seven) categories of the Vaisheshika in the second one of them, called &quot;prameya&quot;.

These sixteen categories are:

*Methods and objects of inquiry
*#&quot;pramāṇa&quot; (valid means of knowledge or knowledge sources),
*#&quot;prameya&quot; (objects of valid knowledge),
*Conditions and the components of inquiry
*#&quot;saṁśaya&quot; (doubt),
*#&quot;prayojana&quot; (aim),
*#&quot;dṛṣṭānta&quot; (example),
*#&quot;siddhānta&quot; (conclusion or accepted position),
*#&quot;avayava&quot; (members of syllogism or inferential components),
*#&quot;tarka&quot; (hypothetical/suppositional reasoning),
*#&quot;nirṇaya&quot; (settlement or certainty),
* Forms of and strategies for debate
*#&quot;vāda&quot; (truth-directed debate),
*#&quot;jalpa&quot; (victory-directed debate),
*#&quot;vitaṇḍā&quot; (destructive debate),
*#&quot;hetvābhāsa&quot; (defective reasons),
*#&quot;chala&quot; (tricks),
*#&quot;jāti&quot; (sophisticated refutation or misleading/futile objections) and
*#&quot;nigrahasthāna&quot; (point of defeat or clinchers).

According to Matthew Dasti and Stephen Phillips, it may be useful to interpret the word &quot;jnana&quot; as cognition rather than knowledge when studying the Nyāya system.

=== The self ===
Nyaya posits that there exists a self distinct from the mind, which is distinct from the body. The self is a nonphysical substance and is not inherently conscious. 

==Epistemology==
Nyāya treatises on epistemology widely influenced other schools of Hinduism. In Nyaya philosophy, knowledge is a type of &quot;awareness event that is in accordance with its object by virtue of having been produced by a well-functioning epistemic instrument.&quot; &quot;Pramāṇa&quot;, a Sanskrit word, literally is &quot;means of knowledge&quot;. It encompasses one or more reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge. The focus of Pramana is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn&#x27;t, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. By definition, &quot;pramāṇas&quot; are factive i.e. they cannot produce false belief. So, while statements can be false, testimony cannot be false. 

Nyāya scholars accepted four valid means (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;) of obtaining valid knowledge (&quot;prameya&quot;) –

# perception (&quot;pratyakṣa&quot;), 
# inference (&quot;anumāna&quot;), 
# comparison (&quot;upamāna&quot;), and 
# word/testimony of reliable sources (&quot;śabda&quot;).

The Nyāya scholars, along with those from other schools of Hinduism, also developed a theory of error, to methodically establish means to identify errors and the process by which errors are made in human pursuit of knowledge. These include &quot;saṁśaya&quot; (problems, inconsistencies, doubts) and &quot;viparyaya&quot; (contrariness, errors) which can be corrected or resolved by a systematic process of &quot;tarka&quot; (reasoning, technique).

===&quot;Pratyaksha&quot; (perception)===
&quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception) occupies the foremost position in the &quot;Nyāya&quot; epistemology. Perception can be of two types, &quot;laukika&quot; (ordinary) and &quot;alaukika&quot; (extraordinary). Ordinary perception is defined by Akṣapāda Gautama in his &quot;Nyāya Sutra&quot; (I, i.4) as a &#x27;non-erroneous cognition which is produced by the intercourse of sense-organs with the objects&#x27;.

Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception: &quot;Indriyarthasannikarsa&quot; (direct experience by one&#x27;s sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), &quot;Avyapadesya&quot; (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one&#x27;s sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else&#x27;s perception), &quot;Avyabhicara&quot; (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one&#x27;s sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and &quot;Vyavasayatmaka&quot; (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one&#x27;s failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).

Ordinary perception to Nyāya scholars was based on direct experience of reality by eyes, ears, nose, touch and taste. Extraordinary perception included &quot;yogaja&quot; or &quot;pratibha&quot; (intuition), &quot;samanyalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and &quot;jnanalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a &#x27;topic of study&#x27; by observing its current state).

====Determinate and indeterminate perception====
The Naiyyayika maintains two modes or stages in perception. The first is called &quot;nirvikalpa&quot; (indeterminate), when one just perceives an object without being able to know its features, and the second &quot;savikalpa&quot; (determinate), when one is able to clearly know an object. All &quot;laukika&quot; and &quot;alaukika&quot; &quot;pratyakshas&quot; are &quot;savikalpa&quot;, but it is necessarily preceded by an earlier stage when it is indeterminate. Vātsāyana says that if an object is perceived with its name we have determinate perception but if it is perceived without a name, we have indeterminate perception. Jayanta Bhatta says that indeterminate perception apprehends substance, qualities and actions and universals as separate and indistinct, without any association with any names, whereas determinate perception apprehends them all together with a name. There is yet another stage called &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot;, when one is able to re-recognise something on the basis of memory.

===&quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference)===
&quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference) is one of the most important contributions of the Nyāya. It can be of two types: inference for oneself (&quot;Svarthanumana&quot;, where one does not need any formal procedure, and at the most the last three of their 5 steps), and inference for others (&quot;Parathanumana&quot;, which requires a systematic methodology of 5 steps). Inference can also be classified into 3 types: &quot;Purvavat&quot; (inferring an unperceived effect from a perceived cause), &quot;Sheshavat&quot; (inferring an unperceived cause from a perceived effect) and &quot;Samanyatodrishta&quot; (when inference is not based on causation but on uniformity of co-existence). A detailed analysis of error is also given, explaining when anumana could be false.

====Theory of inference====
The methodology of inference involves a combination of induction and deduction by moving from particular to particular via generality. It has five steps, as in the example shown:
* There is fire on the hill (called &quot;Pratijñā&quot;, required to be proved)
* Because there is smoke there (called &quot;Hetu&quot;, reason)
* Wherever there is smoke, there is fire, e.g. in a kitchen (called &quot;Udāhārana&quot;, example of vyāpti)
* The hill has smoke that is pervaded by fire (called &quot;Upanaya&quot;, reaffirmation or application)
* Therefore, there is fire on the hill (called &quot;Nigamana&quot;, conclusion)

In Nyāya terminology for this example, the hill would be the &quot;paksha&quot; (minor term), the fire is the &quot;sādhya&quot; (major term), the smoke is &quot;hetu&quot;, and the relationship between the smoke and the fire is &quot;vyapti&quot;(middle term).

Hetu further has five characteristics

* It must be present in the &quot;Paksha&quot; (the case under consideration), 
* It must be present in all positive instances (&quot;sapaksha&quot;, or homologues),
* It must be absent in all negative instances
* It must not be incompatible with an established truth, (&quot;abādhitatva&quot;)
* Absence of another evidence for the opposite thesis (&quot;asatpratipakshitva&quot;)

==== Inference Fallacies (&quot;hetvābhasa&quot;) ====
The fallacies in Anumana (&quot;hetvābhasa&quot;) may occur due to the following

#&quot;Asiddha&quot;: It is the unproved &quot;hetu&quot; that results in this fallacy.
#*&quot;Ashrayasiddha&quot;: If Paksha [minor term] itself is unreal, then there cannot be locus of the hetu. e.g. The sky-lotus is fragrant, because it is a lotus like any other lotus.
#*&quot;Svarupasiddha&quot;: Hetu cannot exist in paksa at all. E.g. Sound is a quality, because it is visible.
#*&quot;Vyapyatvasiddha&quot;: Conditional hetu. `Wherever there is fire, there is smoke&#x27;. The presence of smoke is due to wet fuel.
#&quot;Savyabhichara&quot;: This is the fallacy of irregular hetu.
#*&quot;Sadharana&quot;: The hetu is too wide. It is present in both sapaksa and vipaksa. `The hill has fire because it is knowable&#x27;.
#*&quot;Asadharana&quot;: The hetu is too narrow. It is only present in the Paksha, it is not present in the Sapaksa and in the Vipaksha. `Sound is eternal because it is audible&#x27;.
#*&quot;Anupasamhari&quot;: Here the hetu is non-exclusive. The hetu is all-inclusive and leaves nothing by way of sapaksha or vipaksha. e.g. &#x27;All things are non-ternal, because they are knowable&#x27;.
#&quot;Satpratipaksa&quot;: Here the hetu is contradicted by another hetu. If both have equal force, then nothing follows. &#x27;Sound is eternal, because it is audible&#x27;, and &#x27;Sound is non-eternal, because it is produced&#x27;. Here &#x27;audible&#x27; is counterbalanced by &#x27;produced&#x27; and both are of equal force.
#&quot;Badhita&quot;: When another proof (as by perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term (hetu). &#x27;Fire is cold because it is a substance&#x27;.
#&quot;Viruddha&quot;: Instead of proving something it is proving the opposite. &#x27;Sound is eternal because it is produced&#x27;.

===&quot;Upamāna&quot; (comparison, analogy)===
&quot;Upamāna&quot; (उपमान) means comparison and analogy. &quot;Upamāna&quot;, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called &quot;upameyam&quot;, the object of comparison is called &quot;upamānam&quot;, while the attribute(s) are identified as &quot;sāmānya&quot;. Thus, explains Monier Williams, if a boy says &quot;her face is like the moon in charmingness&quot;, &quot;her face&quot; is &quot;upameyam&quot;, the moon is &quot;upamānam&quot;, and charmingness is &quot;sāmānya&quot;. The 7th century text Bhaṭṭikāvya in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not. In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of &quot;Upamāna&quot; and their value in epistemology are debated.

===&quot;Śabda&quot; (word, testimony)===
&quot;Śabda&quot; (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains &quot;Sabda-pramana&quot; as a concept which means testimony of a reliable and trustworthy person (&quot;āptavākya&quot;). The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other&#x27;s lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through &quot;Sabda&quot; (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the &quot;Sabda&quot; of reliable sources. The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as Carvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore &quot;Sabda&quot; is not a proper &quot;pramana&quot;. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.

Testimony can be of two types, &quot;Vaidika&quot; (Vedic), which are the words of the four sacred Vedas, and &quot;Laukika&quot;, or words and writings of trustworthy human beings. &quot;Vaidika&quot; testimony is preferred over &quot;Laukika&quot; testimony. Laukika-sourced knowledge must be questioned and revised as more trustworthy knowledge becomes available.

=== Direct Realism ===
In Nyaya philosophy, direct realism asserts that our cognitions are informational states revealing external objects. According to Nyaya, the world consists of stable, three-dimensional objects, and their system of categories accurately mirrors reality&#x27;s structure. Nyaya philosophy emphasizes the importance of universals, qualities, and relations in understanding the organization of the world. These foundational elements are believed to play essential roles in determining the phenomenological, causal, and logical organization of the world, playing a crucial role in the classification of objects.

===Comparison with other schools of Hinduism===
Each school of Hinduism has its own treatises on epistemology, with different number of &quot;Pramanas&quot;. For example, compared to Nyāya school&#x27;s four &quot;pramanas&quot;, Carvaka school has just one (perception), while Advaita Vedanta school recognizes six means to reliable knowledge.

==Theory of causation==

A &quot;cause&quot; is defined as an unconditional and invariable antecedent of an &quot;effect&quot; and an effect as an unconditional and invariable consequent of a cause. The same cause produces the same effect; and the same effect is produced by the same cause. The cause is &quot;not&quot; present in any hidden form whatsoever in its effect.

The following conditions should be met:
# The cause must be antecedent [Purvavrtti]
# Invariability [Niyatapurvavrtti]
# Unconditionality [Ananyathasiddha]

Nyaya recognizes five kinds of accidental antecedents [Anyathasiddha]

# Mere accidental antecedent. E.g., The colour of the potter&#x27;s cloth.
# Remote cause is not a cause because it is not unconditional. E.g., The father of the potter.
# The co-effects of a cause are not causally related.
# Eternal substances, or eternal conditions are not unconditional antecedents, e.g. space.
# Unnecessary things, e.g. the donkey of the potter.

Nyaya recognizes three kinds of cause:

# &quot;Samavayi&quot;, material cause, e.g. thread of a cloth.
# &quot;Asamavayi&quot;, colour of the thread which gives the colour of the cloth.
# &quot;Nimitta&quot;, efficient cause, e.g. the weaver of the cloth.

==&quot;Anyathakhyativada&quot; (theory of error)==
The Nyāya theory of error is similar to that of Kumarila&#x27;s Viparita-khyati (see Mimamsa). The Naiyyayikas also believe, like Kumarila, that error is due to a wrong synthesis of the presented and represented objects. The represented object is confused with the presented one. The word &quot;&#x27;anyatha&quot;&#x27; means &#x27;elsewise&#x27; and &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; and both of these meanings are brought out in error. The presented object is perceived elsewise and the represented object exists elsewhere. They further maintain that knowledge is not intrinsically valid but becomes so due to extraneous conditions (&quot;paratah pramana&quot; during both validity and invalidity).

==On God and liberation==
Early Naiyyayikas wrote very little about Ishvara (literally, the Supreme Soul). Evidence available suggests that early Nyāya scholars were non-theistic or atheists. Later, and over time, Nyāya scholars tried to apply some of their epistemological insights and methodology to the question: does God exist? Some offered arguments against and some in favor.

===Arguments that God does not exist===
In Nyāya Sūtra&#x27;s Book 4, Chapter 1, verses 19–21, postulates God exists, states a consequence, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.

A literal interpretation of the three verses suggests that Nyāya school rejected the need for a God for the efficacy of human activity. Since human action and results do not require assumption or need of the existence of God, sutra IV.1.21 is seen as a criticism of the &quot;existence of God and theism postulate&quot;. The context of the above verses includes various efficient causes. Nyāya Sūtra verses IV.1.22 to IV.1.24, for example, examine the hypothesis that &quot;random chance&quot; explains the world, after these Indian scholars had rejected God as the efficient cause.

===Arguments that God exists===
In &quot;Nyayakusumanjali,&quot; Udayana gives the following nine arguments to prove the existence of creative God and also refutes the existing objections and questions by atheistic systems of Carvaka, Mimamsa, Buddhists, Jains and Samkhya:

*&quot;Kāryāt&quot; (lit. &quot;from effect&quot;): The world is an effect. All effects have efficient cause. Hence the world must have an efficient cause. That efficient cause is God.
*&quot;Āyojanāt&quot; (lit., from combination): Atoms are inactive. To form a substance, they must combine. To combine, they must move. Nothing moves without intelligence and source of motion. Since we perceive substance, some intelligent source must have moved the inactive atoms. That intelligent source is God.
*&quot;Dhŗtyādéḥ&quot; (lit., from support): Something sustains this world. Something destroys this world. Unintelligent &quot;Adrsta&quot; (unseen principles of nature) cannot do this. We must infer that something intelligent is behind. That is God.
*&quot;Padāt&quot; (lit., from word): Each word has meaning and represents an object. This representational power of words has a cause. That cause is God.
*&quot;Pratyayataḥ&quot; (lit, from faith): Vedas are infallible. Human beings are fallible. Infallible Vedas cannot have been authored by fallible human beings. Someone authored the infallible Vedas. That author is God.
*&quot;Shrutéḥ&quot; (lit., from scriptures): The infallible Vedas testify to the existence of God. Thus God exists.
*&quot;Vākyāt&quot; (lit., from precepts): Vedas deal with moral laws. These are divine. Divine injunctions and prohibitions can only come from a divine creator of laws. That divine creator is God.
*&quot;Samkhyāviśeşāt&quot; (lit., from the specialty of numbers): By rules of perception, only number &quot;one&quot; can ever be directly perceived. All other numbers other than one, are inferences and concepts created by consciousness. When man is born, his mind is incapable of inferences and concepts. He develops consciousness as he develops. The consciousness development is self-evident and proven because of man&#x27;s ability with perfect numerical conception. This ability to conceive numerically perfect concepts must depend on something. That something is divine consciousness. So God must exist.
*&quot;Adŗşţāt&quot; (lit., from the unforeseen): Everybody reaps the fruits of his own actions. Merits and demerits accrue from his own actions. An Unseen Power keeps a balance sheet of the merit and demerit. But since this Unseen Power is Unintelligent, it needs intelligent guidance to work. That intelligent guide is God.
Naiyyayikas characterize Ishvara as absent of &quot;adharma&quot;, false knowledge, and error; and possessing &quot;dharma&quot;, right knowledge, and equanimity. Additionally, Ishvara is omnipotent and acts in a way that is good for his creatures.

===Liberation===
The Naiyyayikas believe that the bondage of the world is due to false knowledge, which can be removed by constantly thinking of its opposite (&quot;pratipakshabhavana&quot;), namely, the true knowledge. The opening aphorism of the &quot;&quot; states that only the true knowledge leads to &quot;niḥśreyasa&quot; (liberation). However, the Nyāya school also maintains that God&#x27;s grace is essential for obtaining true knowledge. Jayanta, in his &quot;Nyayamanjari&quot; describes salvation as a passive stage of the self in its natural purity, unassociated with pleasure, pain, knowledge and willingness.

==Literature==
In the &quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;, Nyāya is mentioned as one of the fourteen principal branches of learning. The &quot;Matsya-Purāṇa&quot; states that knowledge of Nyāya came from the mouth of Brahmā. The &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; also mentions principles of Nyāya.

The earliest text of the Nyāya School is the &#x27; of . The text is divided into five books, each having two sections. Vatsyayana&#x27;s &#x27; is a classic commentary on the &#x27;. Udyotakara&#x27;s &#x27; (6th century CE) is written to defend against the attacks made by Dignāga. &#x27;s &#x27; (9th century CE) is the next major exposition of this school. Two other texts, &#x27; and &#x27; are also attributed to him. Udayana&#x27;s (984 CE) &#x27; is an important commentary on &#x27;s treatise. His &#x27; is the first systematic account of theistic &#x27;. His other works include &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;. Jayanta Bhatta&#x27;s &#x27; (10th century CE) is basically an independent work. Bhasarvajna&#x27;s &quot;Nyayasara&quot; (10th century CE) is a survey of &quot;&quot; philosophy.

The later works on &#x27; accepted the &quot;&quot; categories and &#x27;s &#x27; (12th century CE) is a notable treatise of this syncretist school. &#x27;s &quot;&quot; (13th century CE) is another important work of this school.

&#x27;s &#x27; (14th century CE) is the first major treatise of the new school of &#x27;. His son, &#x27;s &#x27;, though a commentary on Udayana&#x27;s &#x27;, incorporated his father&#x27;s views. Jayadeva wrote a commentary on &quot;&quot; known as &#x27; (14th century CE). &#x27;s &#x27; (16th century CE) is first great work of Navadvipa school of . &#x27;s &#x27; and &#x27; are the next important works of this school. &#x27;s &#x27; (17th century CE) is also a notable work. The Commentaries on &#x27; by Jagadish Tarkalankar (17th century CE) and Gadadhar Bhattacharya (17th century CE) are the last two notable works of this school.

 (17th century CE) tried to develop a consistent system by combining the ancient and the new schools, &#x27; and &#x27; and &#x27; to develop the &#x27; school. His &#x27; and &#x27; are the popular manuals of this school.

== Differences from Western Philosophy ==


=== &quot;A priori&quot; knowledge ===
Nyaya philosophy does not establish a category of &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. This choice may be due to only considering &quot;de re&quot; knowledge, not &quot;de dicto&quot; knowledge.

=== Logic ===
The essential features of logic in the Western tradition are well captured in the following statement by a famous logician Alonzo Church:

Thus, the basic features of Western logic are: It deals with a study of ‘propositions’, specially their ‘logical form’ as abstracted from their ‘content’ or ‘matter’. It deals with ‘general conditions of valid inference’, wherein the truth or otherwise of the premises have no bearing on the ‘logical soundness or validity’ of an inference. It achieves this by taking recourse to a symbolic language that has little to do with natural languages. The main concern of Western logic, in its entire course of development, has been one of systematising patterns of mathematical reasoning, with the mathematical objects being thought of as existing either in an independent ideal world or in a formal domain. Indian logic however, does not deal with ideal entities, such as propositions, logical truth as distinguished from material truth, or with purely symbolic languages that apparently have nothing to do with natural languages.

The central concern of Indian logic as founded in &quot;nyāya&quot; is epistemology, or the theory of knowledge. Thus Indian logic is not concerned merely with making arguments in formal mathematics rigorous and precise, but attends to the much larger issue of providing rigour to the arguments encountered in natural sciences (including mathematics, which in Indian tradition has the attributes of a natural science and not that of a collection of context free formal statements), and in philosophical discourse. Inference in Indian logic is ‘deductive and inductive’, ‘formal as well as material’. In essence, it is the method of scientific enquiry. Indian ‘formal logic’ is thus not ‘formal’, in the sense generally understood: in Indian logic ‘form’ cannot be entirely separated from ‘content’. In fact, great care is exercised to exclude from logical discourse terms, which have no referential content. No statement, which is known to be false, is admitted as a premise in a valid argument. Thus, the ‘method of indirect proof’ (reductio ad absurdum) is not accepted as a valid method−neither in Indian philosophy nor in Indian mathematics−for proving the existence of an entity whose existence is not demonstrable (even in principle) by other (direct) means of proof.

Indian logic does not make any attempt to develop a purely symbolic and content independent or ‘formal language’ as the vehicle of logical analysis. Instead, what Indian logic, especially in its later phase of &quot;Navya-Nyāya&quot; starting with the work of Gāngeśa Upādhyāya of the 14th century, has developed is a technical language, which is based on the natural language Sanskrit, yet avoids ‘inexactness’ and ‘misleading irregularities’ by various technical devices. This technical language, being based on the natural language Sanskrit, inherits a certain natural structure and interpretation, and sensitivity to the context of enquiry. On the other hand, the symbolic formal systems of Western logic, though considerably influenced in their structure (say, in quantification, etc.) by the basic patterns discernible in European languages, are professedly purely symbolic, carrying no interpretation whatsoever−such interpretations are supposed to be supplied separately in the specific context of the particular field of enquiry ‘employing’ the symbolic formal system.

<doc id="59944" wikidata="Q814194" url="?curid=59944" title="Program counter">
<text>The program counter (PC), commonly called the instruction pointer (IP) in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register (IAR), the instruction counter, or just part of the instruction sequencer, is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.

Usually, the PC is incremented after fetching an instruction, and holds the memory address of (&quot;points to&quot;) the next instruction that would be executed.

Processors usually fetch instructions sequentially from memory, but &quot;control transfer&quot; instructions change the sequence by placing a new value in the PC. These include branches (sometimes called jumps), subroutine calls, and returns. A transfer that is conditional on the truth of some assertion lets the computer follow a different sequence under different conditions.

A branch provides that the next instruction is fetched from elsewhere in memory. A subroutine call not only branches but saves the preceding contents of the PC somewhere. A return retrieves the saved contents of the PC and places it back in the PC, resuming sequential execution with the instruction following the subroutine call.

== Hardware implementation ==
In a simple central processing unit (CPU), the PC is a digital counter (which is the origin of the term &quot;program counter&quot;) that may be one of several hardware registers. The instruction cycle begins with a &quot;fetch&quot;, in which the CPU places the value of the PC on the address bus to send it to the memory. The memory responds by sending the contents of that memory location on the data bus. (This is the stored-program computer model, in which a single memory space contains both executable instructions and ordinary data.) Following the fetch, the CPU proceeds to &quot;execution&quot;, taking some action based on the memory contents that it obtained. At some point in this cycle, the PC will be modified so that the next instruction executed is a different one (typically, incremented so that the next instruction is the one starting at the memory address immediately following the last memory location of the current instruction).

Like other processor registers, the PC may be a bank of binary latches, each one representing one bit of the value of the PC. The number of bits (the width of the PC) relates to the processor architecture. For instance, a “32-bit” CPU may use 32 bits to be able to address 232 units of memory. On some processors, the width of the program counter instead depends on the addressable memory; for example, some AVR microcontrollers have a PC which wraps around after 12 bits.

If the PC is a binary counter, it may increment when a pulse is applied to its COUNT UP input, or the CPU may compute some other value and load it into the PC by a pulse to its LOAD input.

To identify the current instruction, the PC may be combined with other registers that identify a segment or page. This approach permits a PC with fewer bits by assuming that most memory units of interest are within the current vicinity.

== Consequences in machine architecture ==
Use of a PC that normally increments assumes that what a computer does is execute a usually linear sequence of instructions. Such a PC is central to the von Neumann architecture. Thus programmers write a sequential control flow even for algorithms that do not have to be sequential. The resulting “von Neumann bottleneck” led to research into parallel computing, including non-von Neumann or dataflow models that did not use a PC; for example, rather than specifying sequential steps, the high-level programmer might specify desired function and the low-level programmer might specify this using combinatory logic.

This research also led to ways to making conventional, PC-based, CPUs run faster, including:

* Pipelining, in which different hardware in the CPU executes different phases of multiple instructions simultaneously.
* The very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, where a single instruction can achieve multiple effects.
* Techniques to predict out-of-order execution and prepare subsequent instructions for execution outside the regular sequence.

== Consequences in high-level programming ==
Modern high-level programming languages still follow the sequential-execution model and, indeed, a common way of identifying programming errors is with a “procedure execution” in which the programmer&#x27;s finger identifies the point of execution as a PC would. The high-level language is essentially the machine language of a virtual machine, too complex to be built as hardware but instead emulated or interpreted by software.

However, new programming models transcend sequential-execution programming:

* When writing a multi-threaded program, the programmer may write each thread as a sequence of instructions without specifying the timing of any instruction relative to instructions in other threads.
* In event-driven programming, the programmer may write sequences of instructions to respond to events without specifying an overall sequence for the program.
* In dataflow programming, the programmer may write each section of a computing pipeline without specifying the timing relative to other sections.

<doc id="59945" wikidata="Q468620" url="?curid=59945" title="History of logic">
<text>The history of logic deals with the study of the development of the science of valid inference (logic). Formal logics developed in ancient times in India, China, and Greece. Greek methods, particularly Aristotelian logic (or term logic) as found in the &quot;Organon&quot;, found wide application and acceptance in Western science and mathematics for millennia. The Stoics, especially Chrysippus, began the development of predicate logic.

Christian and Islamic philosophers such as Boethius (died 524), Avicenna (died 1037), Thomas Aquinas (died 1274) and William of Ockham (died 1347) further developed Aristotle&#x27;s logic in the Middle Ages, reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century, with Jean Buridan. The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century saw largely decline and neglect, and at least one historian of logic regards this time as barren. Empirical methods ruled the day, as evidenced by Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Novum Organon&quot; of 1620.

Logic revived in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period when the subject developed into a rigorous and formal discipline which took as its exemplar the exact method of proof used in mathematics, a hearkening back to the Greek tradition. The development of the modern &quot;symbolic&quot; or &quot;mathematical&quot; logic during this period by the likes of Boole, Frege, Russell, and Peano is the most significant in the two-thousand-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.

Progress in mathematical logic in the first few decades of the twentieth century, particularly arising from the work of Gödel and Tarski, had a significant impact on analytic philosophy and philosophical logic, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as modal logic, temporal logic, deontic logic, and relevance logic.
==Logic in India==
=== Hindu logic ===

==== Origin ====
The Nasadiya Sukta of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of &quot;catuskoti&quot;: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;not A&quot;, &quot;A and &#x27;not A, and &quot;not A and not not A&quot;.

Logic began independently in ancient India and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.

==== Before Gautama ====
Though the origins in India of public debate (&quot;pariṣad&quot;), one form of rational inquiry, are not clear, we know that public debates were common in preclassical India, for they are frequently alluded to in various &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; and in the early Buddhist literature. Public debate is not the only form of public deliberations in preclassical India. Assemblies (&quot;pariṣad&quot; or &quot;sabhā&quot;) of various sorts, comprising relevant experts, were regularly convened to deliberate on a variety of matters, including administrative, legal and religious matters.

==== Dattatreya ====
A philosopher named Dattatreya is stated in the Bhagavata Purana to have taught Anviksiki to Aiarka, Prahlada and others. It appears from the Markandeya purana that the Anviksiki-vidya expounded by him consisted of a mere disquisition on soul in accordance with the yoga philosophy. Dattatreya expounded the philosophical side of Anviksiki and not its logical aspect.

==== Medhatithi Gautama ====
While the teachers mentioned before dealt with some particular topics of Anviksiki, the credit of founding the Anviksiki in its special sense of a science is to be attributed to Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BC). Guatama founded the &quot;anviksiki&quot; school of logic. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the &quot;anviksiki&quot; and &quot;tarka&quot; schools of logic.

==== Panini ====
 (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350–283 BC) in his &quot;Arthashastra&quot; as an independent field of inquiry.

==== Nyaya-Vaisheshika ====

Two of the six Indian schools of thought deal with logic: Nyaya and Vaisheshika. The Nyāya Sūtras of Aksapada Gautama (c. 2nd century AD) constitute the core texts of the Nyaya school, one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. This realist school developed a rigid five-member schema of inference involving an initial premise, a reason, an example, an application, and a conclusion. The idealist Buddhist philosophy became the chief opponent to the Naiyayikas.

=== Jain logic ===

Jains made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of logic by also occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable.

The Jains have doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning:

* Anekāntavāda – the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
* Syādvāda – the theory of conditioned predication and;
* Nayavāda – The theory of partial standpoints.

These concepts in Jain philosophy made important contributions to the thought, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity. 

=== Buddhist logic ===

==== Nagarjuna ====
Nagarjuna (c. 150–250 AD), the founder of the Madhyamaka (&quot;Middle Way&quot;) developed an analysis known as the catuṣkoṭi (Sanskrit), a &quot;four-cornered&quot; system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the four possibilities of a proposition, &quot;P&quot;:
# &quot;P&quot;; that is, being.
# not &quot;P&quot;; that is, not being.
# &quot;P&quot; and not &quot;P&quot;; that is, being and not being.
# not (&quot;P&quot; or not &quot;P&quot;); that is, neither being nor not being.Under propositional logic, De Morgan&#x27;s laws would imply that this case is equivalent to the third case (&quot;P&quot; and not &quot;P&quot;), and would be therefore superfluous, with only 3 actual cases to consider.

=== Dignaga ===
However, Dignāga (c 480–540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism, and it was through him and his successor, Dharmakirti, that Buddhist logic reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, &quot;vyapti&quot;, also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion. To this end, a doctrine known as &quot;apoha&quot; or differentiation was developed. This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.

Dignāga&#x27;s famous &quot;wheel of reason&quot; (&quot;Hetucakra&quot;) is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dignāga&#x27;s analysis is much like John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.

==Logic in China==

In China, a contemporary of Confucius, Mozi, &quot;Master Mo&quot;, is credited with founding the Mohist school, whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions. In particular, one of the schools that grew out of Mohism, the Logicians, are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of formal logic. Due to the harsh rule of Legalism in the subsequent Qin dynasty, this line of investigation disappeared in China until the introduction of Indian philosophy by Buddhists.

==Logic in the ancient Mediterranean==

===Prehistory of logic===
Valid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the &quot;principles&quot; of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with geometry, which originally meant the same as &quot;land measurement&quot;. The ancient Egyptians discovered geometry, including the formula for the volume of a truncated pyramid. Ancient Babylon was also skilled in mathematics. Esagil-kin-apli&#x27;s medical &quot;Diagnostic Handbook&quot; in the 11th century BC was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions, while Babylonian astronomers in the 8th and 7th centuries BC employed an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems, an important contribution to the philosophy of science.

===Ancient Greece before Aristotle===
While the ancient Egyptians empirically discovered some truths of geometry, the great achievement of the ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative proof. Both Thales and Pythagoras of the Pre-Socratic philosophers seemed aware of geometric methods.

Fragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle, and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the Platonic Academy. The proofs of Euclid of Alexandria are a paradigm of Greek geometry. The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:

* Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an axiom of geometry.
* Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a proof or a &quot;derivation&quot; of the proposition.
* The proof must be &quot;formal&quot;; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.
Further evidence that early Greek thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called &quot;dissoi logoi&quot;, probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity. In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the Rhetoricians or Orators and the Sophists, who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.
====Thales====
It is said Thales, most widely regarded as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, measured the height of the pyramids by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. Thales was said to have had a sacrifice in celebration of discovering Thales&#x27; theorem just as Pythagoras had the Pythagorean theorem.

Thales is the first known individual to use deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to his theorem, and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Indian and Babylonian mathematicians knew his theorem for special cases before he proved it. It is believed that Thales learned that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle during his travels to Babylon.

====Pythagoras====

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met the c. 54 years older Thales. The systematic study of proof seems to have begun with the school of Pythagoras (i. e. the Pythagoreans) in the late sixth century BC. Indeed, the Pythagoreans, believing all was number, are the first philosophers to emphasize &quot;form&quot; rather than &quot;matter&quot;.

====Heraclitus and Parmenides====
The writing of Heraclitus (c. 535 – c. 475 BC) was the first place where the word &quot;logos&quot; was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy, Heraclitus held that everything changes and all was fire and conflicting opposites, seemingly unified only by this &quot;Logos&quot;. He is known for his obscure sayings.

In contrast to Heraclitus, Parmenides held that all is one and nothing changes. He may have been a dissident Pythagorean, disagreeing that One (a number) produced the many. &quot;X is not&quot; must always be false or meaningless. What exists can in no way not exist. Our sense perceptions with its noticing of generation and destruction are in grievous error. Instead of sense perception, Parmenides advocated &quot;logos&quot; as the means to Truth. He has been called the discoverer of logic,

Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, had the idea of a standard argument pattern found in the method of proof known as &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;. This is the technique of drawing an obviously false (that is, &quot;absurd&quot;) conclusion from an assumption, thus demonstrating that the assumption is false. Therefore, Zeno and his teacher are seen as the first to apply the art of logic. Plato&#x27;s dialogue Parmenides portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the monism of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Zeno famously used this method to develop his paradoxes in his arguments against motion. Such &quot;dialectic&quot; reasoning later became popular. The members of this school were called &quot;dialecticians&quot; (from a Greek word meaning &quot;to discuss&quot;).

====Plato====
None of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher Plato (428–347 BC) include any formal logic, but they include important contributions to the field of philosophical logic. Plato raises three questions:

* What is it that can properly be called true or false?
* What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?
* What is the nature of definition?

The first question arises in the dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (&quot;logos&quot;). The second question is a result of Plato&#x27;s theory of Forms. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called universals, namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the &quot;Republic&quot; and the &quot;Sophist&quot;, Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between &quot;forms&quot;. The third question is about definition. Many of Plato&#x27;s dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics. What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato&#x27;s student Aristotle, in particular Aristotle&#x27;s notion of the essence of a thing.

===Aristotle===
The logic of Aristotle, and particularly his theory of the syllogism, has had an enormous influence in Western thought. Aristotle was the first logician to attempt a systematic analysis of logical syntax, of noun (or &quot;term&quot;), and of verb. He was the first &quot;formal logician&quot;, in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying logical form of an argument. He sought relations of dependence which characterize necessary inference, and distinguished the validity of these relations, from the truth of the premises. He was the first to deal with the principles of contradiction and excluded middle in a systematic way. 
====The Organon====
His logical works, called the &quot;Organon&quot;, are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times. Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle&#x27;s logical works is:
* &quot;The Categories&quot;, a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.
* &quot;The Topics&quot; (with an appendix called &quot;On Sophistical Refutations&quot;), a discussion of dialectics.
* &quot;On Interpretation&quot;, an analysis of simple categorical propositions into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. 
* &quot;The Prior Analytics&quot;, a formal analysis of what makes a syllogism (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).
* &quot;The Posterior Analytics&quot;, a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle&#x27;s mature views on logic.

These works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. In the &quot;Categories&quot;, he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, which itself had a profound influence on Western thought.

He also developed a theory of non-formal logic (&quot;i.e.,&quot; the theory of fallacies), which is presented in &quot;Topics&quot; and &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;.

&quot;On Interpretation&quot; contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of opposition and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the square of opposition (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of modal logic.

The &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; contains his exposition of the &quot;syllogism&quot;, where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system.

===Stoics===

The other great school of Greek logic is that of the Stoics. Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher Euclid of Megara, a pupil of Socrates and slightly older contemporary of Plato, probably following in the tradition of Parmenides and Zeno. His pupils and successors were called &quot;Megarians&quot;, or &quot;Eristics&quot;, and later the &quot;Dialecticians&quot;. The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were Diodorus Cronus and Philo, who were active in the late 4th century BC. 

The Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was Chrysippus (c. 278 – c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine. He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive. Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently Diogenes Laërtius, Sextus Empiricus, Galen, Aulus Gellius, Alexander of Aphrodisias, and Cicero.

Three significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of modality, (ii) their theory of the Material conditional, and (iii) their account of meaning and truth.

* &quot;Modality&quot;. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between potentiality and actuality. Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false. Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his Master argument, which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:
:* Everything that is past is true and necessary.
:* The impossible does not follow from the possible.
:* What neither is nor will be is possible.
: Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true. Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.

* &quot;Conditional statements&quot;. The first logicians to debate conditional statements were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true antecedent and a false consequent. Precisely, let &quot;T0&quot; and &quot;T1&quot; be true statements, and let &quot;F0&quot; and &quot;F1&quot; be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):
:* If &quot;T0&quot;, then &quot;T1&quot;
:* If &quot;F0&quot;, then &quot;T0&quot;
:* If &quot;F0&quot;, then &quot;F1&quot;
: The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:
:* If &quot;T0&quot;, then &quot;F0&quot;
: Indeed, Sextus says &quot;According to [Philo], there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false.&quot; Philo&#x27;s criterion of truth is what would now be called a truth-functional definition of &quot;if ... then&quot;; it is the definition used in modern logic.

:In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.
* &quot;Meaning and truth&quot;. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (&quot;phone&quot;), which may be noise, speech (&quot;lexis&quot;), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (&quot;logos&quot;), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a &quot;lekton&quot;, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a &quot;proposition&quot;. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word &quot;Dion&quot;, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.

==Medieval logic==

===Logic in the Middle East===


The works of Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Al-Ghazali, Averroes and other Muslim logicians were based on Aristotelian logic and were important in communicating the ideas of the ancient world to the medieval West. Al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873–950) was an Aristotelian logician who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. Al-Farabi also considered the theories of conditional syllogisms and analogical inference, which were part of the Stoic tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian.

Maimonides (1138-1204) wrote a &quot;Treatise on Logic&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Maqala Fi-Sinat Al-Mantiq&quot;), referring to Al-Farabi as the &quot;second master&quot;, the first being Aristotle.

Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037) was the founder of Avicennian logic, which replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world, and also had an important influence on Western medieval writers such as Albertus Magnus. Avicenna wrote on the hypothetical syllogism and on the propositional calculus, which were both part of the Stoic logical tradition. He developed an original &quot;temporally modalized&quot; syllogistic theory, involving temporal logic and modal logic. He also made use of inductive logic, such as the methods of agreement, difference, and concomitant variation which are critical to the scientific method. One of Avicenna&#x27;s ideas had a particularly important influence on Western logicians such as William of Ockham: Avicenna&#x27;s word for a meaning or notion (&quot;ma&#x27;na&quot;), was translated by the scholastic logicians as the Latin &quot;intentio&quot;; in medieval logic and epistemology, this is a sign in the mind that naturally represents a thing. This was crucial to the development of Ockham&#x27;s conceptualism: A universal term (&quot;e.g.,&quot; &quot;man&quot;) does not signify a thing existing in reality, but rather a sign in the mind (&quot;intentio in intellectu&quot;) which represents many things in reality; Ockham cites Avicenna&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Metaphysics&quot; V in support of this view.

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;first figure&quot; and formulated an early system of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). Al-Razi&#x27;s work was seen by later Islamic scholars as marking a new direction for Islamic logic, towards a Post-Avicennian logic. This was further elaborated by his student Afdaladdîn al-Khûnajî (d. 1249), who developed a form of logic revolving around the subject matter of conceptions and assents. In response to this tradition, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) began a tradition of Neo-Avicennian logic which remained faithful to Avicenna&#x27;s work and existed as an alternative to the more dominant Post-Avicennian school over the following centuries.

The Illuminationist school was founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of &quot;decisive necessity&quot;, which refers to the reduction of all modalities (necessity, possibility, contingency and impossibility) to the single mode of necessity. Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) wrote a book on Avicennian logic, which was a commentary of Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Al-Isharat&quot; (&quot;The Signs&quot;) and &quot;Al-Hidayah&quot; (&quot;The Guidance&quot;). Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328), wrote the &quot;Ar-Radd &#x27;ala al-Mantiqiyyin&quot;, where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the syllogism and in favour of inductive reasoning. Ibn Taymiyyah also argued against the certainty of syllogistic arguments and in favour of analogy; his argument is that concepts founded on induction are themselves not certain but only probable, and thus a syllogism based on such concepts is no more certain than an argument based on analogy. He further claimed that induction itself is founded on a process of analogy. His model of analogical reasoning was based on that of juridical arguments. This model of analogy has been used in the recent work of John F. Sowa.

The &quot;Sharh al-takmil fi&#x27;l-mantiq&quot; written by Muhammad ibn Fayd Allah ibn Muhammad Amin al-Sharwani in the 15th century is the last major Arabic work on logic that has been studied. However, &quot;thousands upon thousands of pages&quot; on logic were written between the 14th and 19th centuries, though only a fraction of the texts written during this period have been studied by historians, hence little is known about the original work on Islamic logic produced during this later period.

===Logic in medieval Europe===
&quot;Medieval logic&quot; (also known as &quot;Scholastic logic&quot;) generally means the form of Aristotelian logic developed in medieval Europe throughout roughly the period 1200–1600. For centuries after Stoic logic had been formulated, it was the dominant system of logic in the classical world. When the study of logic resumed after the Dark Ages, the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher Boethius, who was familiar with some of Aristotle&#x27;s logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics. Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the &quot;Categories&quot;, &quot;On Interpretation&quot;, and Boethius&#x27;s translation of the Isagoge of Porphyry (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the &quot;Old Logic&quot; (&quot;Logica Vetus&quot; or &quot;Ars Vetus&quot;). An important work in this tradition was the &quot;Logica Ingredientibus&quot; of Peter Abelard (1079–1142). His direct influence was small, but his influence through pupils such as John of Salisbury was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed. The proof for the principle of explosion, also known as the principle of Pseudo-Scotus, the law according to which any proposition can be proven from a contradiction (including its negation), was first given by the 12th century French logician William of Soissons.

By the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;, including the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, and the &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Logica Nova&quot; or &quot;New Logic&quot;), had been recovered in the West. Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle. The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before. These were:

* The theory of supposition. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (&quot;e.g.,&quot; &#x27;man&#x27;) range over a domain of individuals (&quot;e.g.,&quot; all men). In the proposition &#x27;every man is an animal&#x27;, does the term &#x27;man&#x27; range over or &#x27;supposit for&#x27; men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual? Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern first-order logic. &quot;The theory of supposition with the associated theories of &quot;copulatio&quot; (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), &quot;ampliatio&quot; (widening of referential domain), and &quot;distributio&quot; constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic&quot;.
* The theory of syncategoremata. Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike &quot;categorematic&quot; terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but &#x27;co-signify&#x27; with other words. Examples of syncategoremata are &#x27;and&#x27;, &#x27;not&#x27;, &#x27;every&#x27;, &#x27;if&#x27;, and so on.
* The theory of consequences. A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms &#x27;if ... then&#x27;. For example, &#x27;if a man runs, then God exists&#x27; (&quot;Si homo currit, Deus est&quot;). A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of William of Ockham&#x27;s work Summa Logicae. There, Ockham distinguishes between &#x27;material&#x27; and &#x27;formal&#x27; consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern material implication and logical implication respectively. Similar accounts are given by Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.

The last great works in this tradition are the &quot;Logic&quot; of John Poinsot (1589–1644, known as John of St Thomas), the &quot;Metaphysical Disputations&quot; of Francisco Suarez (1548–1617), and the &quot;Logica Demonstrativa&quot; of Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (1667–1733).

==Traditional logic==

===The textbook tradition===

&quot;Traditional logic&quot; generally means the textbook tradition that begins with Antoine Arnauld&#x27;s and Pierre Nicole&#x27;s &quot;Logic, or the Art of Thinking&quot;, better known as the &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot;. Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century. The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval term logic. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that. The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of extension and intension. The account of propositions that Locke gives in the &quot;Essay&quot; is essentially that of the Port-Royal: &quot;Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree.&quot;

Dudley Fenner helped popularize Ramist logic, a reaction against Aristotle. Another influential work was the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; by Francis Bacon, published in 1620. The title translates as &quot;new instrument&quot;. This is a reference to Aristotle&#x27;s work known as the &quot;Organon&quot;. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure &quot;which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding&quot;. This method is known as inductive reasoning, a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a &quot;phenomenal nature&quot; such as heat, three lists should be constructed:
* The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.
* The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.
* The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.
Then, the &quot;form nature&quot; (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.

Other works in the textbook tradition include Isaac Watts&#x27;s &quot;Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason&quot; (1725), Richard Whately&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; (1826), and John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;A System of Logic&quot; (1843). Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill&#x27;s view that the foundations of logic lie in introspection influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.

===Logic in Hegel&#x27;s philosophy===

G.W.F. Hegel indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive &quot;Science of Logic&quot; into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his &quot;Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.&quot; The &quot;Shorter&quot; or &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; &quot;Logic&quot;, as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories—Hegel begins with &quot;Pure Being&quot; and &quot;Pure Nothing&quot;—to the &quot;Absolute&quot;, the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it. Despite the title, Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference. Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of &quot;Quality&quot; without the concept of &quot;Quantity&quot;); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves. His purpose is to show the rational structure of the &quot;Absolute&quot;—indeed of rationality itself. The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian dialectic.

Although Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:
* Carl von Prantl&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Logik im Abendland&quot; (1855–1867).
* The work of the British Idealists, such as F. H. Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Logic&quot; (1883).
* The economic, political, and philosophical studies of Karl Marx, and in the various schools of Marxism.

===Logic and psychology===
Between the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of psychology. The German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, for example, discussed deriving &quot;the logical from the psychological laws of thought&quot;, emphasizing that &quot;psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking.&quot; This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:
* Theodor Lipps described logic as &quot;a specific discipline of psychology&quot;.
* Christoph von Sigwart understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual&#x27;s compulsion to think in a certain way.
* Benno Erdmann argued that &quot;logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking&quot;.
Such was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill&#x27;s work. This psychological approach to logic was rejected by Gottlob Frege. It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by Edmund Husserl in the first volume of his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; (1900), an assault which has been described as &quot;overwhelming&quot;. Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that skepticism and relativism were unavoidable consequences.

Such criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called &quot;psychologism&quot;. For example, the American philosopher Josiah Royce, while acknowledging the force of Husserl&#x27;s critique, remained &quot;unable to doubt&quot; that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.

==Rise of modern logic==
The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic. The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in mathematics. The development of the modern &quot;symbolic&quot; or &quot;mathematical&quot; logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.

A number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows: Modern logic is fundamentally a &quot;calculus&quot; whose rules of operation are determined only by the &quot;shape&quot; and not by the &quot;meaning&quot; of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics. Many logicians were impressed by the &quot;success&quot; of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. C. S. Peirce noted that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by Laplace led to an error concerning the moon&#x27;s orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute. Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in metaphysics. He argued that a truly &quot;exact&quot; logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., &quot;diagrammatic&quot; or &quot;iconic&quot; thought. &quot;Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected&quot;. Modern logic is also &quot;constructive&quot; rather than &quot;abstractive&quot;; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called &quot;syncategoremata&quot;) and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.

==Modern logic==
The development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:
* The embryonic period from Leibniz to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.
* The algebraic period from Boole&#x27;s Analysis to Schröder&#x27;s &quot;Vorlesungen&quot;. In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.
* The logicist period from the Begriffsschrift of Frege to the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; of Russell and Whitehead. The aim of the &quot;logicist school&quot; was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology. The major logicists were Frege, Russell, and the early Wittgenstein. It culminates with the &quot;Principia&quot;, an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the antinomies which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.
* The metamathematical period from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of metalogic, in the finitist system of Hilbert, and the non-finitist system of Löwenheim and Skolem, the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of Gödel and Tarski. Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic. Later in the 1930s, Gödel developed the notion of set-theoretic constructibility.
* The period after World War II, when mathematical logic branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: model theory, proof theory, computability theory, and set theory, and its ideas and methods began to influence philosophy.

===Embryonic period===

The idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as Raymond Llull, who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings. The work of logicians such as the Oxford Calculators led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (&quot;calculationes&quot;) in words, a method used, for instance, in the &quot;Logica magna&quot; by Paul of Venice. Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician Thomas Hobbes suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction. The same idea is found in the work of Leibniz, who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus. But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to &quot;countless ambiguities&quot; and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words; hence, he proposed to identify an alphabet of human thought comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas, and create a &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; that would make all arguments &quot;as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate.&quot;

Gergonne (1816) said that reasoning does not have to be about objects about which one has perfectly clear ideas, because algebraic operations can be carried out without having any idea of the meaning of the symbols involved. Bolzano anticipated a fundamental idea of modern proof theory when he defined logical consequence or &quot;deducibility&quot; in terms of variables:Hence I say that propositions formula_1, formula_2, formula_3... are &quot;deducible&quot; from propositions formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7... with respect to variable parts formula_8, formula_9..., if every class of ideas whose substitution for formula_8, formula_9... makes all of formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7... true, also makes all of formula_1, formula_2, formula_3... true. Occasionally, since it is customary, I shall say that propositions formula_1, formula_2, formula_3... &quot;follow&quot;, or can be &quot;inferred&quot; or &quot;derived&quot;, from formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7... Propositions formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7... I shall call the &quot;premises&quot;, formula_1, formula_2, formula_3... the &quot;conclusions.&quot;This is now known as semantic validity.

===Algebraic period===

Modern logic begins with what is known as the &quot;algebraic school&quot;, originating with Boole and including Peirce, Jevons, Schröder, and Venn. Their objective was to develop a calculus to formalise reasoning in the area of classes, propositions, and probabilities. The school begins with Boole&#x27;s seminal work &quot;Mathematical Analysis of Logic&quot; which appeared in 1847, although De Morgan (1847) is its immediate precursor. The fundamental idea of Boole&#x27;s system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations. This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in Lincoln, Lincolnshire. For example, let x and y stand for classes, let the symbol &quot;=&quot; signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on. Boole calls these &quot;elective symbols&quot;, i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration. An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an &quot;elective function&quot;, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an &quot;elective equation&quot;. The theory of elective functions and their &quot;development&quot; is essentially the modern idea of truth-functions and their expression in disjunctive normal form.

Boole&#x27;s system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic. Boole distinguished between &quot;primary propositions&quot; which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and &quot;secondary propositions&quot;, which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different &quot;interpretations&quot; the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is &quot;All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics.&quot; An example of a secondary proposition is &quot;Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics.&quot; These are easily distinguished in modern predicate logic, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.

In his &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (1881), John Venn used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole&#x27;s methods could be mechanised, and constructed a &quot;logical machine&quot; which he showed to the Royal Society the following year. In 1885 Allan Marquand proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant (picture at the Firestone Library).

The defects in Boole&#x27;s system (such as the use of the letter &quot;v&quot; for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers. Jevons published &quot;Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity&quot; in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify exclusive or, which allowed Boole&#x27;s system to be greatly simplified. This was usefully exploited by Schröder when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; (1890–1905). Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, &quot;neither ... nor ...&quot; and equally well &quot;not both ... and ...&quot;, however, like many of Peirce&#x27;s innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until Sheffer rediscovered it in 1913. Boole&#x27;s early work also lacks the idea of the logical sum which originates in Peirce (1867), Schröder (1877) and Jevons (1890), and the concept of inclusion, first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).

The success of Boole&#x27;s algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schröder&#x27;s monumental &quot;Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik&quot; (&quot;Lectures on the Algebra of Logic&quot;, vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.

Boole&#x27;s unwavering acceptance of Aristotle&#x27;s logic is emphasized by the historian of logic John Corcoran in an accessible introduction to &quot;Laws of Thought.&quot; Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; and &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle&#x27;s logic. Boole&#x27;s goals were &quot;to go under, over, and beyond&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat—from assessing validity to solving equations—and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole&#x27;s &#x27;disagreements&#x27;, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. 
First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotelian logic to formulas in the form of equations—by itself a revolutionary idea. 
Second, in the realm of logic&#x27;s problems, Boole&#x27;s addition of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved Boole&#x27;s doctrine that Aristotle&#x27;s rules of inference (the &quot;perfect syllogisms&quot;) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. 
Third, in the realm of applications, Boole&#x27;s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle&#x27;s system could not deduce &quot;No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus&quot; from &quot;No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle&quot; or from &quot;No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle&quot;.

===Logicist period===

After Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician Gottlob Frege. Frege&#x27;s objective was the program of Logicism, i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic. Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or Begriffsschrift is important. Frege also tried to show that the concept of number can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic. He was not the first writer to suggest this. In his pioneering work (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15–17, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, J. S. Mill as well as Jevons, citing the latter&#x27;s claim that &quot;algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination.&quot;

Frege&#x27;s first work, the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (&quot;concept script&quot;) is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (&quot;modus ponens&quot; and substitution), and six axioms. Frege referred to the &quot;completeness&quot; of this system, but was unable to prove this. The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the quantifier in terms of mathematical functions. Traditional logic regards the sentence &quot;Caesar is a man&quot; as of fundamentally the same form as &quot;all men are mortal.&quot; Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as &quot;every Caesar is a man&quot;. At the outset Frege abandons the traditional &quot;concepts &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;predicate&quot;&quot;, replacing them with &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;function&quot; respectively, which he believes &quot;will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words &quot;if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,&quot; and so forth, deserves attention&quot;. Frege argued that the quantifier expression &quot;all men&quot; does not have the same logical or semantic form as &quot;all men&quot;, and that the universal proposition &quot;every A is B&quot; is a complex proposition involving two &quot;functions&quot;, namely &#x27; – is A&#x27; and &#x27; – is B&#x27; such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second. In modern notation, this would be expressed as

: formula_33

In English, &quot;for all x, if Ax then Bx&quot;. Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition. Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all. If &quot;all mammals&quot; were the logical subject of the sentence &quot;all mammals are land-dwellers&quot;, then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give &quot;all mammals are &quot;not&quot; land-dwellers&quot;. But this is not the case. This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and linguistics.

This means that in Frege&#x27;s calculus, Boole&#x27;s &quot;primary&quot; propositions can be represented in a different way from &quot;secondary&quot; propositions. &quot;All inhabitants are either men or women&quot; is

: formula_34

whereas &quot;All the inhabitants are men or all the inhabitants are women&quot; is

: formula_35

As Frege remarked in a critique of Boole&#x27;s calculus:

: &quot;The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot. In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it.&quot;

As well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege&#x27;s calculus also resolved the ancient problem of multiple generality. The ambiguity of &quot;every girl kissed a boy&quot; is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege&#x27;s logic resolves this through the different scope of the quantifiers. Thus

:formula_36

means that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But

:formula_37

means that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible. Using it, Frege provided a definition of the ancestral relation, of the many-to-one relation, and of mathematical induction.

This period overlaps with the work of what is known as the &quot;mathematical school&quot;, which included Dedekind, Pasch, Peano, Hilbert, Zermelo, Huntington, Veblen and Heyting. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was Hilbert&#x27;s Program, which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by &quot;finitistic&quot; means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms eponymously. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege&#x27;s work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.

The logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by Bertrand Russell. This proved Frege&#x27;s naive set theory led to a contradiction. Frege&#x27;s theory contained the axiom that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion. Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not). This contradiction is now known as Russell&#x27;s paradox. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by Ernst Zermelo. Zermelo set theory was the first axiomatic set theory. It was developed into the now-canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). Russell&#x27;s paradox symbolically is as follows:

:formula_38
The monumental Principia Mathematica, a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published 1910–1913 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate system of types: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the &quot;set of all sets&quot;. The &quot;Principia&quot; was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic.

===Metamathematical period===

The names of Gödel and Tarski dominate the 1930s, a crucial period in the development of metamathematics—the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce metatheories, or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert&#x27;s program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of Gödel, who in 1929 showed that a given first-order sentence is deducible if and only if it is logically valid—i.e. it is true in every structure for its language. This is known as Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem. A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert&#x27;s program to be unattainable in its original form. The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure such as an algorithm or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the natural numbers. For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself. These two results are known as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, or simply &quot;Gödel&#x27;s Theorem&quot;. Later in the decade, Gödel developed the concept of set-theoretic constructibility, as part of his proof that the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are consistent with Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

In proof theory, Gerhard Gentzen developed natural deduction and the sequent calculus. The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it &#x27;naturally&#x27; occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system. Since Gentzen&#x27;s work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science. Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.

Alfred Tarski, a pupil of Łukasiewicz, is best known for his definition of truth and logical consequence, and the semantic concept of logical satisfaction. In 1933, he published (in Polish) &quot;The concept of truth in formalized languages&quot;, in which he proposed his semantic theory of truth: a sentence such as &quot;snow is white&quot; is true if and only if snow is white. Tarski&#x27;s theory separated the metalanguage, which makes the statement about truth, from the object language, which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the T-schema) between phrases in the object language and elements of an interpretation. Tarski&#x27;s approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of model theory. Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as completeness, decidability, consistency and definability. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski &quot;changed the face of logic in the twentieth century&quot;.

Alonzo Church and Alan Turing proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert&#x27;s &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true. Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing&#x27;s paper introduced the halting problem as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.

Church&#x27;s system for computation developed into the modern λ-calculus, while the Turing machine became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the Church–Turing thesis that any deterministic algorithm that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both Peano arithmetic and first-order logic are undecidable. Later work by Emil Post and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of degrees of unsolvability.

The results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon analytic philosophy and philosophical logic, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as modal logic, temporal logic, deontic logic, and relevance logic.

===Logic after WWII===
After World War II, mathematical logic branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: model theory, proof theory, computability theory, and set theory.

In set theory, the method of forcing revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results. Paul Cohen introduced this method in 1963 to prove the independence of the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. His technique, which was simplified and extended soon after its introduction, has since been applied to many other problems in all areas of mathematical logic.

Computability theory had its roots in the work of Turing, Church, Kleene, and Post in the 1930s and 40s. It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as recursion theory. The priority method, discovered independently by Albert Muchnik and Richard Friedberg in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the degrees of unsolvability and related structures. Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory. The fields of constructive analysis and computable analysis were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of reverse mathematics. A separate branch of computability theory, computational complexity theory, was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into descriptive complexity.

Model theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title &quot;Contributions to the theory of models&quot;. In the 1960s, Abraham Robinson used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on infinitesimals, a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz. 

In proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the realizability method invented by Georg Kreisel and Gödel&#x27;s &quot;Dialectica&quot; interpretation. This work inspired the contemporary area of proof mining. The Curry–Howard correspondence emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and typed lambda calculi used in computer science. As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory. Advances were also made in ordinal analysis and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the Paris–Harrington theorem.

This was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking. For example, tense logic is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher Arthur Prior played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. Modal logics extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of modality (for example, possibility and necessity). The ideas of Saul Kripke, particularly about possible worlds, and the formal system now called Kripke semantics have had a profound impact on analytic philosophy. His best known and most influential work is &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1980). Deontic logics are closely related to modal logics: they attempt to capture the logical features of obligation, permission and related concepts. Although some basic novelties syncretizing mathematical and philosophical logic were shown by Bolzano in the early 1800s, it was Ernst Mally, a pupil of Alexius Meinong, who was to propose the first formal deontic system in his &quot;Grundgesetze des Sollens&quot;, based on the syntax of Whitehead&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s propositional calculus.

Another logical system founded after World War II was fuzzy logic by Azerbaijani mathematician Lotfi Asker Zadeh in 1965.

<text>Anglo-Catholicism comprises beliefs and practices that emphasise the Catholic heritage (especially pre-Reformation roots) and identity of the Church of England and various churches within Anglicanism. Anglo-Catholicism claims to restore liturgical and devotional expressions of church life that reflect the ancient practices of the early and medieval Church.

The term was coined in the early 19th century, although movements emphasising the Catholic nature of Anglicanism already existed. Particularly influential in the history of Anglo-Catholicism were the Caroline Divines of the 17th century, the Jacobite Nonjuring schism of the 17th and 18th centuries, and the Oxford Movement, which began at the University of Oxford in 1833 and ushered in a period of Anglican history known as the &quot;Catholic Revival&quot;.

== History ==
Following the passing of the Act of Supremacy and Henry VIII&#x27;s break with the Catholic Church, the Church of England continued to adhere to most traditional Catholic teachings and did not initially make any other major alterations to doctrine. The &quot;Ten Articles&quot; were published in 1536 and constitute the first official Anglican articles of faith. The articles for the most part concurred with the teachings of the Church in England as they had been prior to the Protestant Reformation and defended, among other things, the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the sacrament of Confession, the honouring and invocation of Christian saints, and prayer for the dead. Belief in purgatory, however, was made non-essential. This was followed by the &quot;Institution of the Christian Man&quot; (also called &quot;The Bishops&#x27; Book&quot;) in 1537, a combined effort by numerous Anglican clergy and theologians which—though not strongly Protestant in its inclinations—showed a slight move towards Reformed positions. &quot;The Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; was unpopular with conservative sections of the church, and quickly grew to be disliked by Henry VIII as well. The &quot;Six Articles&quot;, released two years later, moved away from all Reformed ideas and strongly affirmed Catholic positions regarding matters such as transubstantiation and Mass for the dead. The &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;, the official article of religion written by Henry in 1543, likewise expressed Catholic sacramental theology and encouraged prayer for the dead.

A major shift in the development of Anglican doctrine came in the reign of Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI, who repealed the &quot;Six Articles&quot; and under whose rule the Church of England became more identifiably Protestant. Though the Church&#x27;s practices and approach to the sacraments became strongly influenced by those of continental reformers, it nevertheless retained episcopal church structure. The Church of England was then briefly reunited with the Roman Catholic Church under Mary I, before separating again under Elizabeth I. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was an attempt to end the religious divisions among Christians in England, and is often seen as an important event in Anglican history, ultimately laying the foundations for the concept of &quot;via media&quot; in Anglicanism.

The nature of early Anglicanism was to be of great importance to the Anglo-Catholics of the 19th century, who would argue that their beliefs and practices were common during this period and were inoffensive to the earliest members of the Church of England.

=== Caroline Divines ===
The Caroline Divines were a group of influential Anglican theologians active in the 17th century who opposed Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Puritanism and stressed the importance of apostolic succession, episcopal polity, and the sacraments. The Caroline Divines also favoured elaborate liturgy (in some cases favouring the liturgy of the pre-Reformation Church) and aesthetics. Their influence saw a revival in the use of images and statues in churches. The leaders of the Anglo-Catholic revival in the 19th century would draw heavily from the works of the Caroline Divines.

=== Oxford Movement ===

The modern Anglo-Catholic movement began with the Oxford Movement in the Victorian era, sometimes termed &quot;Tractarianism&quot;. In the early 19th century, various factors caused misgivings among English church people, including the decline of church life and the spread of unconventional practices in the Church of England. The British government&#x27;s action in 1833 of beginning a reduction in the number of Church of Ireland bishoprics and archbishoprics inspired a sermon from John Keble in the University Church in Oxford on the subject of &quot;National Apostasy&quot;. This sermon marked the inception of what became known as the Oxford Movement.

The principal objective of the Oxford Movement was the defence of the Church of England as a divinely founded institution, of the doctrine of apostolic succession, and of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; as a &quot;rule of faith&quot;. The key idea was that Anglicanism was not a Protestant denomination but a branch of the historical Christian Church, along with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. It was argued that Anglicanism had preserved the historical apostolic succession of priests and bishops, and thus the Catholic sacraments. These ideas were promoted in a series of ninety &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, but were rejected both by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

The principal leaders of the Oxford Movement were John Keble, John Henry Newman, and Edward Bouverie Pusey. The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by some bishops of the Church and by the latitudinarians within the University of Oxford, who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organisation were of relatively little importance. Within the Oxford Movement, there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1845, the university censured a tract entitled &quot;Ideal of a Christian Church&quot; and its author, the pro-Roman Catholic theologian W. G. Ward, on which basis was imputed the moniker &quot;Ideal Ward&quot;. The year 1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical cleric George Cornelius Gorham in a celebrated legal action against church authorities. Consequently, some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship were received into the Roman Catholic Church, while others, such as Mark Pattison, embraced Latitudinarian Anglicanism, and yet others, such as James Anthony Froude, became skeptics. The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism.

===Recent developments===
Since at least the 1970s, Anglo-Catholicism has been dividing into two distinct camps, along a fault line which can perhaps be traced back to Bishop Charles Gore&#x27;s work in the 19th century.

The Oxford Movement had been inspired in the first place by a rejection of liberalism and latitudinarianism in favour of the traditional faith of the &quot;Church Catholic&quot;, defined by the teachings of the Church Fathers and the common doctrines of the historical Eastern and Western Christian traditions.

Because of the emphasis on upholding traditions, until the 1970s most Anglo-Catholics rejected liberalising development such as the conferral of holy orders on women. Present-day &quot;traditionalist&quot; Anglo-Catholics seek to maintain tradition and to keep Anglican doctrine in line with that of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. They often ally themselves with conservative evangelical Anglicans to defend traditional teachings on sexual morality and women&#x27;s roles in the Church. The main organisation in the Church of England that opposes the ordination of women, Forward in Faith, is largely composed of Anglo-Catholics.

Gore&#x27;s work, however, bearing the mark of liberal Protestant higher criticism, paved the way for an alternative form of Anglo-Catholicism influenced by liberal theology. Thus in recent years, many Anglo-Catholics have accepted the ordination of women, the use of inclusive language in Bible translations and the liturgy, and progressive attitudes towards homosexuality and the blessing of same sex unions. Such Anglicans often refer to themselves as &quot;Liberal Catholics&quot;. This more &quot;progressive&quot; style of Anglo-Catholicism is represented by Affirming Catholicism and the Society of Catholic Priests, although, unlike Forward in Faith, this organisation is not as visible with the laity.

A third strand of Anglican Catholicism criticises elements of both liberalism and conservatism, drawing instead on the 20th-century Catholic &quot;Nouvelle Théologie&quot;, especially Henri de Lubac. This movement rejected the dominance of Thomism and Neo-Scholasticism in Catholic theology, and advocated instead for a &quot;return to the sources&quot; of the Christian faith – scripture and the writings of the Church Fathers –, while remaining open to dialogue with the contemporary world on issues of theology. John Milbank and others within this strand have been instrumental in the creation of the ecumenical (though predominantly Anglican and Roman Catholic) movement known as radical orthodoxy.

Since the 1970s, some traditionalist Anglo-Catholics have left official Anglicanism to form &quot;continuing Anglican churches&quot; whereas others have left Anglicanism altogether for the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches, in the belief that liberal doctrinal changes in the Anglican churches have gone too far.

=== Personal ordinariates ===
In late 2009, in response to requests from various groups of Anglicans around the world who were dissatisfied with liberalising movements within the Anglican Communion, Pope Benedict XVI issued the apostolic constitution &quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus&quot;. This document invites groups of traditionalist Anglicans to form what are termed &quot;personal ordinariates&quot; under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Holy See of the Catholic Church in Rome, while preserving elements of the liturgical, musical, theological and other aspects of their Anglican patrimony. Under these terms, regional groupings of Anglican Catholics may apply for reception by the Holy See under the jurisdiction of an &quot;ordinary&quot; (i.e. a bishop or priest) appointed by Rome to oversee the community. While being in a country or region which is part of the Latin Church of the Roman Catholic Church, these ordinaries will nonetheless retain aspects of the Anglican patrimony, such as married priests and traditional English choral music and liturgy. Because apostolic constitutions are the highest level of papal legislation and are not time-limited, the invitation is open into the indefinite future.

The first personal ordinariate, the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, was established on 15 January 2011 in the United Kingdom. The second Anglican ordinariate, known as the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, was established on 1 January 2012 in the United States. The already existing Anglican Use parishes in the United States, which have existed since the 1980s, formed a portion of the first American personal ordinariate. These parishes were already in communion with Rome and use modified Anglican liturgies approved by the Holy See. They were joined by other groups and parishes of Episcopalians and some other Anglicans. A third Anglican ordinariate, known as the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross, was established on 15 June 2012 in Australia. The &quot;&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; is the authoritative expression of the Catholic faith professed by members&quot; of the personal ordinariates.

==Practices and beliefs==
===Theology===

Historically, Anglo-Catholics have valued &quot;highly the tradition of the early, undivided Church, they saw its authority as co-extensive with Scripture. They re-emphasised the Church&#x27;s institutional history and form. Anglo-Catholicism was emotionally intense, and yet drawn to aspects of the pre-Reformation Church, including the revival of religious orders, the reintroduction of the language and symbolism of the eucharistic sacrifice,&quot; and &quot;the revival of private confession. Its spirituality was Evangelical, but High Church in content and form.&quot; At the same time, Anglo-Catholics held that &quot;the Roman Catholic has corrupted the original ritualism; and she [the Anglican Church] claims that the ritualism which she presents is a revival in purity of the original ritualism of the Catholic Church.&quot; The spirituality of Anglo-Catholics is drawn largely from the teachings of the early Church, in addition to the Caroline Divines. Archbishop of Canterbury Matthew Parker, in 1572, published &quot;De Antiquitate Britannicæ Ecclesiæ&quot;, which traced the roots of the Anglican Church, arguing &quot;that the early British Church differed from Roman Catholicism in key points and thus provided an alternative model for patristic Christianity,&quot; a view repeated by many Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Chapman Grafton, Bishop of the Diocese of Fond du Lac. In addition, Anglo-Catholics hold that the Anglican churches have maintained &quot;catholicity and apostolicity.&quot; In the same vein, Anglo-Catholics emphasise the doctrines of apostolic succession and the threefold order, holding that these were retained by the Anglican Church after it went through the English Reformation.

In agreement with the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches, Anglo-Catholics—along with Old-Catholics and Lutherans—generally appeal to the &quot;canon&quot; (or rule) of St Vincent of Lerins: &quot;What everywhere, what always, and what by all has been believed, that is truly and properly Catholic.&quot;

The Anglican Thirty-nine Articles make distinctions between Anglican and Catholic understandings of doctrine; in the eyes of Anglo-Catholics, the Thirty-Nine Articles are catholic, containing statements that profess the universal faith of the early church. As the Articles were intentionally written in such a way as to be open to a range of interpretations, Anglo-Catholics have defended their practices and beliefs as being consistent with the Thirty-nine Articles, for example in Newman&#x27;s Tract 90 of 1841. Since the late 20th century, Anglo-Catholic thought related to the Thirty-nine Articles has included the New Perspective on Paul.

Anglo-Catholic priests often hear private confessions and anoint the sick, regarding these practices as sacraments. Anglo-Catholics also offer prayers for the departed and the intercession of the saints; C. S. Lewis, often considered an Anglo-Catholic in his theological sensibilities, writes:
Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship also believe in the real objective presence of Christ in the Eucharist and understand the way He is manifest in the sacrament to be a mystery of faith. Like the Eastern Orthodox and Lutherans, Anglo-Catholics, with the exception of the minority of Anglican Papalists, reject the Catholic doctrines of the papal supremacy and papal infallibility, with Walter Herbert Stowe, an Anglo-Catholic cleric, explaining the Anglican position on these issues:
 However, Anglo-Catholics share with Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood and in the sacrificial character of the Mass. A minority of Anglo-Catholics also encourage priestly celibacy. Most Anglo-Catholics, due to the silence of the Thirty-Nine Articles on the issue, encourage devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, but not all Anglo-Catholics adhere to a high doctrine of Mariology; in England, her title of Our Lady of Walsingham is popular.

===Liturgical practices===
Anglo-Catholics are often identified by their liturgical practices and ornaments. These have traditionally been characterised by the &quot;six points&quot; of the later Catholic Revival&#x27;s eucharistic practice:
* Eucharistic vestments
* Eastward-facing orientation of the priest at the altar instead of at the north side, the traditional evangelical Anglican practice
* Unleavened bread for the Eucharist
* Mixing of water with the eucharistic wine
* Incense
* Lights (altar candles)

Many other traditional Catholic practices are observed within Anglo-Catholicism, including eucharistic adoration. Some of these Anglo-Catholic &quot;innovations&quot; have since been accepted by broad church Anglicans, if not by Evangelical or Low Church Anglicans.

Various liturgical strands exist within Anglo-Catholicism:
* Some, such as the original members of the Oxford Movement, use official Anglican liturgical texts such as the Book of Common Prayer.
* Some use the modern Catholic rite of Mass.
* Some use the older &quot;Tridentine&quot; Catholic rite of Mass, in English or Latin, or liturgies based on it, such as the English Missal or Anglican Missal.
* Some occasionally use the mediaeval English Sarum Rite, which is broadly similar to the Tridentine Mass, in English or Latin.

Preferences for Elizabethan English and modern English texts vary within the movement.

In the United States, a group of Anglo-Catholics at the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) published, under the rubrics of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, the &quot;Anglican Service Book&quot; as &quot;a traditional-language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and additional devotions.&quot; This book is based on the 1979 Book of Common Prayer but includes offices and devotions in the traditional language of the 1928 Prayer Book that are not in the 1979 edition. The book also draws from sources such as the Anglican Missal.

In many Anglo-Catholic churches, clergy are referred to as Father, and in places where the priestly ministry of women is accepted, Mother.

<text>The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion (commonly abbreviated as the Thirty-nine Articles or the XXXIX Articles), finalised in 1571, are the historically defining statements of doctrines and practices of the Church of England with respect to the controversies of the English Reformation. The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; used by the Church of England, and feature in parts of the worldwide Anglican Communion (including the Episcopal Church), as well as by denominations outside of the Anglican Communion that identify with the Anglican tradition (see Continuing Anglican movement).

When Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church and was excommunicated, he began the reform of the Church of England, which would be headed by the monarch (himself), rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to determine what its doctrines and practices would be in relation to the Church of Rome and the new Protestant movements in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of thirty years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the excommunication of Elizabeth I in 1570. These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the finalisation of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to Calvinist doctrine and Catholic practice.

The articles went through at least five major revisions prior to their finalisation in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leanings – the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German Lutheran princes. The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions, and then the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Catholic doctrines. During the reign of Edward VI, Henry VIII&#x27;s son, the Forty-two Articles were written under the direction of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, owing to Edward VI&#x27;s death and the reversion of the English Church to Catholicism under Henry VIII&#x27;s elder daughter, Mary I.

Finally, upon the coronation of Elizabeth I and the re-establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Catholic Church, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion were initiated by the Convocation of 1563, under the direction of Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury. 

The Thirty-nine Articles were finalised in 1571, and incorporated into the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Although not the end of the struggle between Catholic and Protestant monarchs and citizens, the book helped to standardise the English language, and was to have a lasting effect on religion in the United Kingdom and elsewhere through its wide use.

==Predecessors==

===Ten Articles (1536)===
The Church of England&#x27;s break with Rome inaugurated a period of doctrinal confusion and controversy as both conservative and reforming clergy attempted to shape the church&#x27;s direction, the former as &quot;Catholicism without the Pope&quot; and the latter as Protestant. In an attempt &quot;to establish Christian quietness and unity&quot;, the Ten Articles were adopted by clerical Convocation in July 1536 as the English Church&#x27;s first post-papal doctrinal statement. The Ten Articles were crafted as a rushed interim compromise between conservatives and reformers. Historians have variously described it as a victory for Lutheranism and a success for Catholic resistance. Its provisions have also been described as &quot;confusing&quot;.

The first five articles dealt with doctrines that were &quot;commanded expressly by God, and are necessary to our salvation&quot;, while the last five articles dealt with &quot;laudable ceremonies used in the Church&quot;. This division reflects how the Articles originated from two different discussions earlier in the year. The first five articles were based on the Wittenberg Articles negotiated between English ambassadors Edward Foxe, Nicholas Heath and Robert Barnes and German Lutheran theologians, including Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. This doctrinal statement was itself based on the Augsburg Confession of 1530.

The five principal doctrines were the Bible and ecumenical creeds, baptism, penance, the Eucharist and justification. The core doctrine in the Ten Articles was justification by faith. Justification – which was defined as remission of sin and accepting into God&#x27;s favour – was through &quot;the only mercy and grace of the Father, promised freely unto us for his Son’s sake Jesus Christ, and the merits of his blood and passion&quot;. Good works would follow, not precede, justification. However, the Lutheran influence was diluted with qualifications. Justification was attained &quot;by contrition and faith joined with charity&quot;. In other words, good works were &quot;necessarily required to the attaining of everlasting life&quot;.

To the disappointment of conservatives, only three of the traditional seven sacraments were even mentioned (baptism, the Eucharist and penance). The Articles affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, stating that &quot;under the form and figure of bread and wine ... is verily, substantially and really contained the very self-same body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. This definition was acceptable to those who held to transubstantiation or sacramental union, but it clearly condemned sacramentarianism. More controversially for the reformers, the Articles maintained penance as a sacrament and the priest&#x27;s authority to grant divine absolution in confession.

Articles six to ten focused on secondary issues. Significantly, purgatory, which had been a central concern of medieval religion, was placed in the non-essential articles. On the question of its existence, the Ten Articles were ambiguous. They stated, &quot;the place where [departed souls] be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there&quot; was &quot;uncertain by scripture&quot;. Prayer for the dead and masses for the dead were permitted as arguably relieving the pain of departed souls in purgatory.

The Articles also defended the use of a number of Catholic rituals and practices opposed by Protestants, such as kissing the cross on Good Friday, while mildly criticising popular abuses and excesses. The use of religious images was permitted but people were to be taught not to kneel before them or make offerings to them. Prayer to Mary, mother of Jesus, and all the other saints was permitted as long as superstition was avoided.

In summary, the Ten Articles asserted:

# The Bible and the three ecumenical creeds are the basis and summary of true Christian faith.
# Baptism imparts remission of sins and regeneration and is necessary for salvation, even in the case of infants. It condemns the opinions of Anabaptists and Pelagians as heresy. 
# The sacrament of penance, with confession and absolution, is necessary to salvation.
# That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the Eucharist.
# Justification is by faith, but good works are necessary.
# Images can be used as representations of virtue and good example and also to remind people of their sins but are not objects of worship.
# Saints are to be honoured as examples of life and as furthering the prayers of the faithful.
# Praying to saints is permitted, and holy days should be observed.
# The observance of various rites and ceremonies, such as clerical vestments, sprinkling of holy water, bearing of candles on Candlemas, giving of ashes on Ash Wednesday, is good and laudable. However, none of these has power to forgive sin. 
# It is a good and charitable deed to pray for the dead. However, the doctrine of purgatory is biblically uncertain. Abuses related to purgatory, such as the claim that papal indulgences or masses for the dead offered at certain localities (such as the &quot;scala coeli&quot; mass) can deliver immediately from purgatory, are to be rejected.

=== &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; (1537) ===

The failure of the Ten Articles to settle doctrinal controversy led Thomas Cromwell, the King&#x27;s vicegerent in spirituals, to convene a national synod of bishops and high-ranking clergy for further theological discussion in February 1537. This synod produced a book called &quot;The Institution of the Christian Man&quot; (popularly called &quot;The Bishops&#x27; Book&quot;), the word &quot;institution&quot; being synonymous with &quot;instruction&quot;. &quot;The Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; preserved the semi-Lutheranism of the Ten Articles, and the articles on justification, purgatory, and the sacraments of baptism, the Eucharist and penance were incorporated unchanged into the new book.
When the synod met, conservatives were still angry that four of the traditional seven sacraments (confirmation, marriage, holy orders and extreme unction) had been excluded from the Ten Articles. John Stokesley argued for all seven, while Thomas Cranmer only acknowledged baptism and the Eucharist. The others divided along party lines. The conservatives were at a disadvantage because they found it necessary to appeal to sacred tradition, which violated Cromwell&#x27;s instructions that all arguments refer to scripture.

In the end, the missing sacraments were restored but placed in a separate section to emphasize &quot;a difference in dignity and necessity.&quot; Only baptism, the Eucharist and penance were &quot;instituted of Christ, to be as certain instruments or remedies necessary for our salvation&quot;. Confirmation was declared to have been introduced by the early Church in imitation of what they had read about the practice of the Apostles.

The &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; also included expositions on the creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Hail Mary. These were greatly influenced by William Marshall&#x27;s primer (an English-language book of hours) of 1535, which itself was influenced by Luther&#x27;s writings. Following Marshall, &quot;The Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; rejected the traditional Catholic numbering of the Ten Commandments, in which the prohibition on making and worshiping graven images was part of the first commandment, &quot;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&quot;. In agreement with the Eastern Orthodox and Huldrych Zwingli&#x27;s church at Zurich, the authors of the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; adopted the Jewish tradition of separating these commandments. While allowing images of Christ and the saints, the exposition on the second commandment taught against representations of God the Father and criticised those who &quot;be more ready with their substance to deck dead images gorgeously and gloriously, than with the same to help poor Christian people, the quick and lively images of God&quot;. Such teachings encouraged iconoclasm, which would become a feature of the English Reformation.

The list of the 46 divines as they appear in the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Book&quot; included all of the bishops, eight archdeacons and 17 other Doctors of Divinity, some of whom were later involved with translating the Bible and compiling the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;:

In August 1537, it was presented to the King who ordered that parts should be read from the pulpit every Sunday and feast day. Nevertheless, the King was not entirely satisfied and took it upon himself to make a revised &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot;, which, among other proposed changes, weakened the original&#x27;s emphasis on justification by faith. This revised version was never published. Because the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; was never authorised by the Crown or Convocation, the Ten Articles remained the official doctrinal standard of the Church of England.

===Six Articles (1539)===

Fearful of diplomatic isolation and a Catholic alliance, Henry VIII continued his outreach to the Lutheran Schmalkaldic League. 
In May 1538, three Lutheran theologians from Germany – Franz Burchard, vice-chancellor of Saxony; Georg von Boineburg, doctor of law; and Friedrich Myconius, superintendent of the church in Gotha – arrived in London and held conferences with English bishops and clergy at the archbishop&#x27;s Lambeth Palace through September.

The Germans presented, as a basis of agreement, a number of articles based on the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg. Bishops Tunstall, Stokesley and others were not won over by these Protestant arguments and did everything they could to avoid agreement. They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the Greek Church and not with the Protestants on the continent. The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans considered abuses (e.g. private masses for the dead, compulsory clerical celibacy, and withholding communion wine from the laity) allowed by the English Church. Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church practised them. As the King was unwilling to break with these practices, the Germans had all left England by 1 October.

Meanwhile, England was in religious turmoil. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform – some priests said mass in English rather than Latin and married without authorisation (Archbishop Cranmer was himself secretly married). Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs upholding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and radicals who held Anabaptist and Sacramentarian views denying real presence. In May 1539, a new Parliament met, and Lord Chancellor Audley told the House of Lords that the King desired religious uniformity. A committee of four conservative and four reformist bishops was appointed to examine and determine doctrine. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that the Lords examine six controversial doctrinal questions that became the basis of the Six Articles:

#whether the Eucharist could be the true body of Christ without transubstantiation,
#whether it needed to be given to the laity under both kinds,
#whether vows of chastity needed to be observed as part of divine law,
#whether clerical celibacy should be compulsory,
#whether private (votive) masses were required (legitimate) by divine law,
#whether auricular confession (that is, confession to a priest) was necessary as part of divine law.
Over the next month, these questions were argued in Parliament and Convocation with the active participation of the King. The final product was an affirmation of traditional teachings on all but the sixth question. Communion in one kind, compulsory clerical celibacy, vows of chastity and votive masses were a legitimate form. Protestants achieved a minor victory on auricular confession, which was declared &quot;expedient and necessary to be retained&quot; but not required by divine law. In addition, although the real presence was affirmed in traditional terminology, the word &quot;transubstantiation&quot; itself did not appear in the final version.

The Act of Six Articles became law in June 1539, which, unlike the Ten Articles, gave the Six Articles statutory authority. Harsh penalties were attached to violations of the Articles. Denial of transubstantiation was punished by burning without an opportunity to recant. Denial of any of the other articles was punished by hanging or life imprisonment. Married priests had until 12 July to put away their wives, which was likely a concession granted to give Archbishop Cranmer time to move his wife and children outside of England. After the act&#x27;s passage, bishops Latimer and Shaxton, outspoken opponents of the measure, were forced to resign their dioceses. The Act of Six Articles was repealed by the Treason Act 1547 during the reign of Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI.

===&quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; (1543)===
When Parliament re-convened in April 1540, a committee was formed to revise the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot;, which Henry VIII had never liked. The committee&#x27;s membership included both traditionalists and reformers, but the former held the majority. Convocation began discussing the revised text in April 1543. The &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;, or &quot;The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christian Man&quot; to use its formal title, was more traditional than the 1537 version and incorporated many of the King&#x27;s own revisions. It was approved by a special meeting of the nobility on 6 May and differed from the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Book&quot; in having been issued under the King&#x27;s authority. It was also statutorily enforced by the Act for the Advancement of True Religion. Because of its royal authorisation, the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; officially replaced the Ten Articles as the official doctrinal statement of the Church of England.

Significantly, the doctrine of justification by faith &quot;alone&quot; was totally rejected. Cranmer tried to save the doctrine by arguing that while true faith was accompanied by good works (in other words, faith was not &quot;alone&quot;) it was only faith that justified. However, Henry would not be persuaded, and the text was amended to read that faith justified &quot;neither only nor alone&quot;. It also stated that each person had free will to be &quot;a worker ... in the attaining of his own justification&quot;. The &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; also endorsed traditional views of the mass, transubstantiation, confession, and Church ceremonies. The traditional seven sacraments were all included without any distinction in importance made between them. It was taught that the second commandment did not forbid images but only &quot;godly honour&quot; being given to them. Looking at images of Christ and the saints &quot;provoked, kindled and stirred to yield thanks to Our Lord&quot;.

The one area in which the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; moved away from traditional teaching was on prayer for the dead and purgatory. It taught that no one could know whether prayers or masses for the dead benefited an individual soul, and it was better to offer prayers for &quot;the universal congregation of Christian people, quick and dead&quot;. People were encouraged to &quot;abstain from the name of purgatory, and no more dispute or reason thereof&quot;. Presumably, the hostility towards purgatory derived from its connection to papal authority. The King&#x27;s own behavior sent mixed signals. In 1540, he allowed offerings for the souls of deceased Knights of the Garter to be spent on works of charity instead of masses. At the same time, however, he required the new cathedral foundations to pray for the soul of Queen Jane. Perhaps because of the uncertainty surrounding this doctrine, bequests in wills for chantries, obits and masses fell by half what they had been in the 1520s.

===Forty-two Articles (1553)===

Henry VIII was succeeded by his son, Edward VI, in 1547. During Edward&#x27;s reign, the Church of England adopted a stronger Protestant identity. The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1549 authorised a reformed liturgy, and the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was even more explicitly Protestant. To make the English Church fully Protestant, Cranmer also envisioned a reform of canon law and the creation of a concise doctrinal statement, which would become the Forty-two Articles. Work on a doctrinal statement was delayed by Cranmer&#x27;s efforts to forge a doctrinal consensus among the various Protestant churches to counter the work of the Catholic Council of Trent. When this proved impossible, Cranmer turned his attention to defining what the Church of England believed.

In late 1552 the first edition of the confession was produced in the form of the Forty-Five Articles that Cranmer submitted for comment and revision, and which were approved by Parliament in June of 1553 by which time their number had been reduced to the Forty-two Articles which were drafted by Cranmer and a small group of fellow Protestants. The title page claimed that the articles were approved by Convocation when in reality they were never discussed or adopted by the clerical body. They were also never approved by Parliament. The articles were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553. All clergy, schoolmasters and members of the universities were required to subscribe to them. The theology of the articles has been described by some as a &quot;restrained&quot; Calvinism. Others point to a much stronger Lutheran influence.

== Development ==
Edward died in 1553. With the coronation of Mary I and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the articles were never enforced. However, after Mary&#x27;s death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles. In 1563, Convocation met under Archbishop Parker to revise the articles. Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article 29 to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings. In 1571, despite the opposition of Bishop Edmund Gheast, Article 29 was re-inserted, declaring that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ. This was done following the queen&#x27;s excommunication by the Pope Pius V in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article 29 would offend Catholic sensibilities. The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent. 

==Content==
The Thirty-nine Articles were intended to establish, in basic terms, the faith and practice of the Church of England. While not designed to be a creed or complete statement of the Christian faith, the articles explain the doctrinal position of the Church of England in relation to Calvinism, as well as Catholicism and Anabaptism. According to historian Anthony Milton, &quot;the Thirty-Nine Articles were certainly broadly consistent with the Reformed consensus in doctrinal matters&quot;.

The Thirty-nine Articles can be divided into eight sections based on their content:

Articles 1–5: The Doctrine of God:
The first five articles articulate the doctrine of God, the Holy Trinity and the incarnation of Jesus Christ. This is a departure from other doctrinal statements of the 16th and 17th centuries such as the Helvetic Confessions and the Westminster Confession, which begin with the doctrine of revelation and Holy Scripture as the source of knowledge about God.

Articles 6–8: Scripture and the Creeds:
These articles state that Holy Scripture contains everything necessary for salvation, so that no one can be required to believe any doctrine that cannot be proved on the basis of biblical teaching. The articles acknowledge the authority of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed because they express Scriptural teaching. It states that the Apocrypha is not part of Scripture. While not a basis of doctrine, the Apocrypha continues to be read by the church for moral instruction and examples for holy living.

Articles 9–18: Sin and Salvation:
These articles discuss the doctrines of original sin and justification by faith (salvation is a gift received through faith in Christ). They reject the medieval Catholic teachings on works of supererogation and that performing good works can make a person worthy to receive justification (congruous merit). They also reject the radical Protestant teaching that a person could be free from sin in this life. The articles address the doctrine of predestination—that &quot;Predestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God&quot;. Double predestination, the belief that God has also predestined some people to reprobation, is not endorsed by the articles. 

Articles 19–21: The Church and its Authority:
These articles explain the nature and authority of the visible church. They state that the church, under Scripture, has authority over matters of faith and order. General councils of the church can only be called with the permission of the civil authority. It is possible for church councils to reach the wrong decisions, so they should only be followed if their actions align with Scripture.

Articles 22–24: Errors to be avoided in the Church:
These articles condemn the Catholic teachings on purgatory, indulgences, the use of religious images and the invocation of saints. In addition, the Catholic practice of using Latin as a liturgical language is disapproved of in favour of the vernacular. The articles state that no person should preach publicly or administer the sacraments unless they are called and authorised by legitimate church authority. This was meant to counter the radical Protestant belief that a Christian could preach and act as a minister on his own initiative in defiance of church authorities.

Articles 25–31: The Sacraments: 
These articles explain the Church of England&#x27;s sacramental theology. According to the articles, sacraments are signs of divine grace which God works invisibly but effectively in people&#x27;s lives. Through sacraments, God creates and strengthens the faith of believers. The radical Protestant belief that sacraments are only outward signs of a person&#x27;s faith is denied by the articles. While the Catholic Church claimed seven sacraments, the articles recognise only two: baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The five rites called sacraments by Catholics are identified in the articles as either corrupted imitations of the Apostles (confirmation, penance and extreme unction) or as &quot;states of life allowed in the Scriptures&quot; (holy orders and marriage). 

Regeneration (or the gift of new life), membership in the church, forgiveness of sins and adoption as children of God are all received through baptism. The articles state that infant baptism is &quot;most agreeable with the institution of Christ&quot; and should continue to be practised in the church. In the Lord&#x27;s Supper, participants become partakers of the body and blood of Christ and receive the spiritual benefits of Christ&#x27;s death on the cross. According to the articles, this partaking should not be understood in terms of the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which is condemned as &quot;repugnant to the plain words of Scripture&quot;. Instead, the articles declare that there is no change in the substance of the bread and wine. Rather, participants are fed the body of Christ by the Holy Spirit and through faith. The articles declare that &quot;The offering of Christ once made is the perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world&quot;. This was meant as a repudiation of the popular medieval idea that the Mass was a sacrifice in which Christ was offered for the forgiveness of sins for the living and the dead in purgatory.

Articles 32–36: The Discipline of the Church:
The articles defend the practice of clerical marriage and the church&#x27;s power of excommunication. It states that traditions and ceremonies in the church may vary by time and place; national churches can alter or abolish traditions created by human authority. The &quot;First and Second Book of Homilies&quot; are said to contain correct doctrine and should be read in church. The articles also defend the ordination rites contained in the 1549 and 1552 Ordinals.

Articles 37–39: Christians and Civil Society:
The articles affirm the role of the monarch as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. It rejects all claims to the Pope&#x27;s jurisdiction in England. It defends the state&#x27;s right to use capital punishment and declares that Christians may serve in the military. It rejects the Anabaptist teaching that the property of Christians should be held in common, but it does explain that Christians should give alms to the poor and needy. It also defends the morality of oath-taking for civic purposes.

== Later history ==
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a &quot;Calvinist consensus&quot; developed within the church regarding the doctrines of salvation. Article 17 only endorsed election to salvation and was silent on whether God predestined people for reprobation; however, most of the bishops and leading churchmen believed in double predestination. When an Arminian minority emerged to challenge this consensus, Archbishop Whitgift issued the Lambeth Articles in 1595. These did not replace the Thirty-nine Articles but were meant to officially align Article 17 to Calvinist theology. The Queen was unwilling to alter her religious settlement and refused to assent to these new articles. 

The Thirty-nine Articles are printed in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and other Anglican prayer books. The Test Act 1672 made adherence to the Articles a requirement for holding civil office in England until its repeal in 1828. Students at Oxford University were still expected to sign up to them until the passing of the Oxford University Act 1854.

In the Church of England, only clergy (and until the 19th century members of Oxford and Cambridge Universities) are required to subscribe to the Articles. Starting in 1865, clergy affirmed that the doctrine contained in the Articles and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was agreeable to Scripture and that they would not preach in contradiction to it. Since 1975, clergy are required to acknowledge the Articles as one of the historic formularies of the Church of England that bear witness to the faith revealed in Scripture and contained in the creeds. The Church of Ireland has a similar declaration for its clergy, while some other churches of the Anglican Communion make no such requirement. The US Episcopal Church never required subscription to the Articles.

The influence of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. The Articles are the confession of faith of the Anglican tradition. In Anglican discourse, the Articles are regularly cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. An important concrete manifestation of this is the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral, which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion. The Articles continue to be invoked today in the Anglican Church. For example, in the ongoing debate over homosexual activity and the concomitant controversies over episcopal authority, Articles VI, XX, XXIII, XXVI, and XXXIV are regularly cited by those of various opinions.

Each of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion is, however, free to adopt and authorise its own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all Anglican Churches (neither is the Athanasian Creed). The only doctrinal documents agreed upon in the Anglican Communion are the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Nicene Creed of AD 325, and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. Beside these documents, authorised liturgical formularies, such as Prayer Book and Ordinal, are normative. The several provincial editions of Prayer Books (and authorised alternative liturgies) are, however, not identical, although they share a greater or smaller amount of family resemblance. No specific edition of the Prayer Book is therefore binding for the entire Communion.

A revised version was adopted in 1801 by the US Episcopal Church which deleted the Athanasian Creed. Earlier, John Wesley, founder of the Methodists, adapted the Thirty-nine Articles for use by American Methodists in the 18th century. The resulting Articles of Religion remain an official doctrinal statement of the United Methodist Church.

== Interpretation ==
According to theologian Henry Chadwick, the articles are a revealing window into the ethos and character of Anglicanism, in particular in the way the document works to navigate a &quot;via media&quot; (Latin: middle path or middle way) between the beliefs and practices of the Catholic Church on the one hand, and those of the Lutheran and Reformed churches on the other hand, thus giving the Church of England a unique middle-of-the-road position. The &quot;via media&quot; was expressed so adroitly in the Articles that some Anglican scholars have labelled their content as an early example of the idea that the doctrine of Anglicanism is one of &quot;Reformed Catholicism&quot;.

In 1628 Charles I prefixed a royal declaration to the articles, which demands a literal interpretation of them, threatening discipline for academics or churchmen teaching any personal interpretations or encouraging debate about them. It states: &quot;no man hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and Full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.&quot;

However, what the Articles truly mean has been a matter of debate in the Church since before they were issued. The evangelical wing of the Church has claimed to take the Articles at face value, and to regard them as of utmost importance. In 2003, evangelical Anglican clergyman Chris Pierce wrote:

This view has never been held by the whole church. In 1643, Archbishop of Armagh John Bramhall laid out a broader view of the Articles:

This divergence of opinion became overt during the Oxford Movement of the 19th century. The stipulations of Articles XXV and XXVIII were regularly invoked by evangelicals to oppose the reintroduction of certain beliefs, customs, and acts of piety with respect to the sacraments. In response, John Henry Newman&#x27;s Tract 90 attempted to show that the 39 Articles could be read according to an Anglo-Catholic interpretation.

<text>The Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet&#x27;s magnetosphere. Earth has two such belts, and sometimes others may be temporarily created. The belts are named after James Van Allen, who published an article describing the belts in 1958. 

Earth&#x27;s two main belts extend from an altitude of about above the surface, in which region radiation levels vary. The belts are in the inner region of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. They trap energetic electrons and protons. Other nuclei, such as alpha particles, are less prevalent. Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from the solar wind while others arrive as cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction.

The belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone. Apollo astronauts going through the Van Allen belts received a very low and harmless dose of radiation.

In 2013, the Van Allen Probes detected a transient, third radiation belt, which persisted for four weeks.

==Discovery==
Kristian Birkeland, Carl Størmer, Nicholas Christofilos, and Enrico Medi had investigated the possibility of trapped charged particles in 1895, forming a theoretical basis for the formation of radiation belts. The second Soviet satellite Sputnik 2 which had detectors designed by Sergei Vernov, followed by the US satellites Explorer 1 and Explorer 3, confirmed the existence of the belt in early 1958, later named after James Van Allen from the University of Iowa. The trapped radiation was first mapped by Explorer 4, Pioneer 3, and Luna 1.

The term &quot;Van Allen belts&quot; refers specifically to the radiation belts surrounding Earth; however, similar radiation belts have been discovered around other planets. The Sun does not support long-term radiation belts, as it lacks a stable, global dipole field. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere limits the belts&#x27; particles to regions above 200–1,000 km, (124–620 miles) while the belts do not extend past 8 Earth radii &quot;RE&quot;. The belts are confined to a volume which extends about 65° on either side of the celestial equator.

==Research==

The NASA Van Allen Probes mission aims at understanding (to the point of predictability) how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind.
NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts–funded studies have proposed magnetic scoops to collect antimatter that naturally occurs in the Van Allen belts of Earth, although only about 10 micrograms of antiprotons are estimated to exist in the entire belt.

The Van Allen Probes mission successfully launched on August 30, 2012. The primary mission was scheduled to last two years with expendables expected to last four. The probes were deactivated in 2019 after running out of fuel and are expected to deorbit during the 2030s. NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center manages the Living With a Star program—of which the Van Allen Probes were a project, along with Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The Applied Physics Laboratory was responsible for the implementation and instrument management for the Van Allen Probes.

Radiation belts exist around other planets and moons in the solar system that have magnetic fields powerful and stable enough to sustain them. Radiation belts have been detected at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune through in-situ observations, such as by Galileo (spacecraft) and Juno (spacecraft) at Jupiter, Cassini–Huygens at Saturn and fly-bys from the Voyager program and Pioneer program. Observations of radio emissions from highly energetic particles that are trapped in a planets magnetic field have also been used to remotely detect radiation belts, including at Jupiter and at the ultracool dwarf LSR J1835+3259. It is possible that Mercury (planet) may be able to trap charged particles in its magnetic field, although its highly dynamic magnetosphere (which varies on the order of minutes ) may not be able to sustain stable radiation belts. Venus and Mars do not have radiation belts, as their magnetospheric configurations do not trap energetic charged particles in orbit around the planet.

Geomagnetic storms can cause electron density to increase or decrease relatively quickly (i.e., approximately one day or less). Longer-timescale processes determine the overall configuration of the belts. After electron injection increases electron density, electron density is often observed to decay exponentially. Those decay time constants are called &quot;lifetimes.&quot; Measurements from the Van Allen Probe B&#x27;s Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) show long electron lifetimes (i.e., longer than 100 days) in the inner belt; short electron lifetimes of around one or two days are observed in the &quot;slot&quot; between the belts; and energy-dependent electron lifetimes of roughly five to 20 days are found in the outer belt.

== Inner belt ==

The inner Van Allen Belt extends typically from an altitude of 0.2 to 2 Earth radii (L values of 1.2 to 3) or to above the Earth. In certain cases, when solar activity is stronger or in geographical areas such as the South Atlantic Anomaly, the inner boundary may decline to roughly 200 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface. The inner belt contains high concentrations of electrons in the range of hundreds of keV and energetic protons with energies exceeding 100 MeV—trapped by the relatively strong magnetic fields in the region (as compared to the outer belt).

It is thought that proton energies exceeding 50 MeV in the lower belts at lower altitudes are the result of the beta decay of neutrons created by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei of the upper atmosphere. The source of lower energy protons is believed to be proton diffusion, due to changes in the magnetic field during geomagnetic storms.

Due to the slight offset of the belts from Earth&#x27;s geometric center, the inner Van Allen belt makes its closest approach to the surface at the South Atlantic Anomaly.
In March 2014, a pattern resembling &quot;zebra stripes&quot; was observed in the radiation belts by the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment (RBSPICE) onboard Van Allen Probes. The initial theory proposed in 2014 was that—due to the tilt in Earth&#x27;s magnetic field axis—the planet&#x27;s rotation generated an oscillating, weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt. A 2016 study instead concluded that the zebra stripes were an imprint of ionospheric winds on radiation belts.

==Outer belt==
The outer belt consists mainly of high-energy (0.1–10 MeV) electrons trapped by the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. It is more variable than the inner belt, as it is more easily influenced by solar activity. It is almost toroidal in shape, beginning at an altitude of 3 Earth radii and extending to 10 Earth radii (&quot;RE&quot;)— above the Earth&#x27;s surface. Its greatest intensity is usually around 4 to 5 &quot;RE&quot;. The outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by inward radial diffusion and local acceleration due to transfer of energy from whistler-mode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons. Radiation belt electrons are also constantly removed by collisions with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, losses to the magnetopause, and their outward radial diffusion. The gyroradii of energetic protons would be large enough to bring them into contact with the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Within this belt, the electrons have a high flux and at the outer edge (close to the magnetopause), where geomagnetic field lines open into the geomagnetic &quot;tail&quot;, the flux of energetic electrons can drop to the low interplanetary levels within about —a decrease by a factor of 1,000.

In 2014, it was discovered that the inner edge of the outer belt is characterized by a very sharp transition, below which highly relativistic electrons (&gt; 5MeV) cannot penetrate. The reason for this shield-like behavior is not well understood.

The trapped particle population of the outer belt is varied, containing electrons and various ions. Most of the ions are in the form of energetic protons, but a certain percentage are alpha particles and O+ oxygen ions—similar to those in the ionosphere but much more energetic. This mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably originate from more than one source.

The outer belt is larger than the inner belt, and its particle population fluctuates widely. Energetic (radiation) particle fluxes can increase and decrease dramatically in response to geomagnetic storms, which are themselves triggered by magnetic field and plasma disturbances produced by the Sun. The increases are due to storm-related injections and acceleration of particles from the tail of the magnetosphere. Another cause of variability of the outer belt particle populations is the wave-particle interactions with various plasma waves in a broad range of frequencies.

On February 28, 2013, a third radiation belt—consisting of high-energy ultrarelativistic charged particles—was reported to be discovered. In a news conference by NASA&#x27;s Van Allen Probe team, it was stated that this third belt is a product of coronal mass ejection from the Sun. It has been represented as a separate creation which splits the Outer Belt, like a knife, on its outer side, and exists separately as a storage container of particles for a month&#x27;s time, before merging once again with the Outer Belt.

The unusual stability of this third, transient belt has been explained as due to a &#x27;trapping&#x27; by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field of ultrarelativistic particles as they are lost from the second, traditional outer belt. While the outer zone, which forms and disappears over a day, is highly variable due to interactions with the atmosphere, the ultrarelativistic particles of the third belt are thought not to scatter into the atmosphere, as they are too energetic to interact with atmospheric waves at low latitudes. This absence of scattering and the trapping allows them to persist for a long time, finally only being destroyed by an unusual event, such as the shock wave from the Sun.

== Flux values ==
In the belts, at a given point, the flux of particles of a given energy decreases sharply with energy.

At the magnetic equator, electrons of energies exceeding 5000 keV (resp. 5 MeV) have omnidirectional fluxes ranging from 1.2×106 (resp. 3.7×104) up to 9.4×109 (resp. 2×107) particles per square centimeter per second.

The proton belts contain protons with kinetic energies ranging from about 100 keV, which can penetrate 0.6 μm of lead, to over 400 MeV, which can penetrate 143 mm of lead.

Most published flux values for the inner and outer belts may not show the maximum probable flux densities that are possible in the belts. There is a reason for this discrepancy: the flux density and the location of the peak flux is variable, depending primarily on solar activity, and the number of spacecraft with instruments observing the belt in real time has been limited. The Earth has not yet experienced a solar storm of Carrington event intensity while spacecraft with the proper instruments have been available to observe the event.

Radiation levels in the belts would be dangerous to humans if they were exposed for an extended period of time. The Apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts, bypassing inner belts completely, except for the Apollo 14 mission where the spacecraft traveled through the heart of the trapped radiation belts.

==Antimatter confinement==
In 2011, a study confirmed earlier speculation that the Van Allen belt could confine antiparticles. The Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) experiment detected levels of antiprotons orders of magnitude higher than are expected from normal particle decays while passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly. This suggests the Van Allen belts confine a significant flux of antiprotons produced by the interaction of the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere with cosmic rays. The energy of the antiprotons has been measured in the range from 60 to 750 MeV.

The very high energy released in antimatter annihilation has led to proposals to harness these antiprotons for spacecraft propulsion. The concept relies on the development of antimatter collectors and containers.

==Implications for space travel==

Spacecraft travelling beyond low Earth orbit enter the zone of radiation of the Van Allen belts. Beyond the belts, they face additional hazards from cosmic rays and solar particle events. A region between the inner and outer Van Allen belts lies at 2 to 4 Earth radii and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;safe zone&quot;.

Solar cells, integrated circuits, and sensors can be damaged by radiation. Geomagnetic storms occasionally damage electronic components on spacecraft. Miniaturization and digitization of electronics and logic circuits have made satellites more vulnerable to radiation, as the total electric charge in these circuits is now small enough so as to be comparable with the charge of incoming ions. Electronics on satellites must be hardened against radiation to operate reliably. The Hubble Space Telescope, among other satellites, often has its sensors turned off when passing through regions of intense radiation. A satellite shielded by 3 mm of aluminium in an elliptic orbit () passing the radiation belts will receive about 2,500 rem (25 Sv) per year. (For comparison, a full-body dose of 5 Sv is deadly.) Almost all radiation will be received while passing the inner belt.

The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners. The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them.

Astronauts&#x27; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission-to-mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.

==Causes==
It is generally understood that the inner and outer Van Allen belts result from different processes. The inner belt is mainly composed of energetic protons produced from the decay of neutrons, which are themselves the result of cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere. The outer Van Allen belt consists mainly of electrons. They are injected from the geomagnetic tail following geomagnetic storms, and are subsequently energized through wave-particle interactions.

In the inner belt, particles that originate from the Sun are trapped in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Particles spiral along the magnetic lines of flux as they move &quot;latitudinally&quot; along those lines. As particles move toward the poles, the magnetic field line density increases, and their &quot;latitudinal&quot; velocity is slowed and can be reversed, deflecting the particles back towards the equatorial region, causing them to bounce back and forth between the Earth&#x27;s poles. In addition to both spiralling around and moving along the flux lines, the electrons drift slowly in an eastward direction, while the protons drift westward.

The gap between the inner and outer Van Allen belts is sometimes called the &quot;safe zone&quot; or &quot;safe slot&quot;, and is the location of medium Earth orbits. The gap is caused by the VLF radio waves, which scatter particles in pitch angle, which adds new ions to the atmosphere. Solar outbursts can also dump particles into the gap, but those drain out in a matter of days. The VLF radio waves were previously thought to be generated by turbulence in the radiation belts, but recent work by J.L. Green of the Goddard Space Flight Center compared maps of lightning activity collected by the Microlab 1 spacecraft with data on radio waves in the radiation-belt gap from the IMAGE spacecraft; the results suggest that the radio waves are actually generated by lightning within Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The generated radio waves strike the ionosphere at the correct angle to pass through only at high latitudes, where the lower ends of the gap approach the upper atmosphere. These results are still being debated in the scientific community.

==Proposed removal==
Draining the charged particles from the Van Allen belts would open up new orbits for satellites and make travel safer for astronauts.

High Voltage Orbiting Long Tether, or HiVOLT, is a concept proposed by Russian physicist V. V. Danilov and further refined by Robert P. Hoyt and Robert L. Forward for draining and removing the radiation fields of the Van Allen radiation belts that surround the Earth.

Another proposal for draining the Van Allen belts involves beaming very-low-frequency (VLF) radio waves from the ground into the Van Allen belts.

Draining radiation belts around other planets has also been proposed, for example, before exploring Europa, which orbits within Jupiter&#x27;s radiation belt.

As of 2024, it remains uncertain if there are any negative unintended consequences to removing these radiation belts.

<doc id="59955" wikidata="Q50193" url="?curid=59955" title="Trojan Horse">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Trojan Horse () was a wooden horse said to have been used by the Greeks during the Trojan War to enter the city of Troy and win the war. The Trojan Horse is not mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, with the poem ending before the war is concluded, and it is only briefly mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. But in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; by Virgil, after a fruitless 10-year siege, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden horse at the behest of Odysseus, and hid a select force of men inside, including Odysseus himself. The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. That night, the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under the cover of darkness. The Greeks entered and destroyed the city, ending the war.

Metaphorically, a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; has come to mean any trick or stratagem that causes a target to invite a foe into a securely protected bastion or place. A malicious computer program that tricks users into willingly running it is also called a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; or simply a &quot;Trojan&quot;.

The main ancient source for the story still extant is the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, a Latin epic poem from the time of Augustus. The story featured heavily in the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;, both part of the Epic Cycle, but these have only survived in fragments and epitomes. As Odysseus was the chief architect of the Trojan Horse, it is also referred to in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
In the Greek tradition, the horse is called the &quot;wooden horse&quot; ( in Homeric/Ionic Greek (&quot;Odyssey&quot; 8.512); , in Attic Greek). In Dictys Cretensis&#x27; account, the idea of the Trojan Horse&#x27;s construction comes from Helenus, who prophesies that the Greeks must dedicate a wooden horse to Athena.

==Warriors in the horse==
Thirty of the Achaeans&#x27; best warriors hid in the Trojan horse&#x27;s womb and two spies in its mouth. Other sources give different numbers: The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; 50; Tzetzes 23; and Quintus Smyrnaeus gives the names of 30, but says there were more. In late tradition the number was standardized at 40. Their names follow:
== Literary accounts ==

According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Odysseus thought of building a great wooden horse (the horse being the emblem of Troy), hiding an elite force inside, and fooling the Trojans into wheeling the horse into the city as a trophy. Under the leadership of Epeius, the Greeks built the wooden horse in three days. Odysseus&#x27;s plan called for one man to remain outside the horse; he would act as though the Greeks had abandoned him, leaving the horse as a gift for the Trojans. An inscription was engraved on the horse reading: &quot;For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this offering to Athena&quot;. Then they burned their tents and left to Tenedos by night. Greek soldier Sinon was &quot;abandoned&quot; and was to signal to the Greeks by lighting a beacon.

In Virgil&#x27;s poem, Sinon, the only volunteer for the role, successfully convinces the Trojans that he has been left behind and that the Greeks are gone. Sinon tells the Trojans that the Horse is an offering to the goddess Athena, meant to atone for the previous desecration of her temple at Troy by the Greeks and ensure a safe journey home for the Greek fleet. Sinon tells the Trojans that the Horse was built to be too large for them to take it into their city and gain the favor of Athena for themselves.

While questioning Sinon, the Trojan priest Laocoön guesses the plot and warns the Trojans, in Virgil&#x27;s famous line &quot;Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes&quot; (&quot;I fear Greeks, even those bearing gifts&quot;), Danai ( &quot;Danaos&quot;) or Danaans (Homer&#x27;s name for the Greeks) being the ones who had built the Trojan Horse. However, the god Poseidon sends two sea serpents to strangle him and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus before any Trojan heeds his warning. According to Apollodorus, the two serpents were sent by Apollo, whom Laocoön had insulted by sleeping with his wife in front of the &quot;divine image&quot;. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Homer says that Helen of Troy also guesses the plot and tries to trick and uncover the Greek soldiers inside the horse by imitating the voices of their wives, and Anticlus attempts to answer, but Odysseus shuts his mouth with his hand. King Priam&#x27;s daughter Cassandra, the soothsayer of Troy, insists that the horse will be the downfall of the city and its royal family. She too is ignored, hence their doom and loss of the war.

This incident is mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;:

The most detailed and most familiar version is in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Book II (trans. A. S. Kline).

Book II includes Laocoön saying: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Do not trust the horse, Trojans! Whatever it is, I fear the Danaans [Greeks], even those bearing gifts.&quot;)

Well before Virgil, the story is also alluded to in Greek classical literature. In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Trojan Women&quot;, written in 415 BC, the god Poseidon proclaims: &quot;For, from his home beneath Parnassus, Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed host, and sent it within the battlements, fraught with death; whence in days to come men shall tell of &#x27;the wooden horse,&#x27; with its hidden load of warriors.&quot;
== Factual explanations ==
It has been speculated that the story of the Trojan Horse resulted from later poets creatively misunderstanding an actual historical use of a siege engine at Troy. Animal names are often used for military machinery, as with the Roman onager and various Bronze Age Assyrian siege engines which were often covered with dampened horse hides to protect against flaming arrows. Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, wrote in his book &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, &quot;That the work of Epeius was a contrivance to make a breach in the Trojan wall is known to everybody who does not attribute utter silliness to the Phrygians&quot;; by the Phrygians, he meant the Trojans.

Some authors have suggested that the gift might also have been a ship, with warriors hidden inside. It has been noted that the terms used to put men in the horse are those used by ancient Greek authors to describe the embarkation of men on a ship and that there are analogies between the building of ships by Paris at the beginning of the Trojan saga and the building of the horse at the end; ships are called &quot;sea-horses&quot; once in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. This view has recently gained support from naval archaeology: ancient text and images show that a Phoenician merchant ship type decorated with a horse head, called &quot;hippos&quot; (&#x27;horse&#x27;) by Greeks, became very diffuse in the Levant area around the beginning of the 1st millennium BC and was used to trade precious metals and sometimes to pay tribute after the end of a war. That has caused the suggestion that the original story viewed the Greek soldiers hiding inside the hull of such a vessel, possibly disguised as a tribute, and that the term was later misunderstood in the oral transmission of the story, the origin to the Trojan horse myth.

Ships with a horsehead decoration, perhaps cult ships, are also represented in artifacts of the Minoan/Mycenaean era; the image on a seal found in the palace of Knossos, dated around 1200 BC, which depicts a ship with oarsmen and a superimposed horse figure, originally interpreted as a representation of horse transport by sea, may in fact be related to this kind of vessel, and even be considered as the first (pre-literary) representation of the Trojan Horse episode.

A more speculative theory, originally proposed by Fritz Schachermeyr, is that the Trojan Horse is a metaphor for a destructive earthquake that damaged the walls of Troy and allowed the Greeks inside. In his theory, the horse represents Poseidon, who as well as being god of the sea was also god of horses and earthquakes. The theory is supported by the fact that archaeological digs have found that Troy VI was heavily damaged in an earthquake but is hard to square with the mythological claim that Poseidon himself built the walls of Troy in the first place.

==Ancient representations==
Pictorial representations of the Trojan Horse earlier than, or contemporary to, the first literary appearances of the episode can help clarify what was the meaning of the story as perceived by its contemporary audience. There are few ancient (before 480 BC) depictions of the Trojan Horse surviving. The earliest is on a Boeotian fibula dating from about 700 BC. Other early depictions are found on two relief pithoi from the Greek islands Mykonos and Tinos, both generally dated between 675 and 650 BC. The one from Mykonos (see figure) is known as the Mykonos vase. Historian Michael Wood dates the Mykonos vase to the eighth century BC, before the written accounts attributed by tradition to Homer, and posits this as evidence that the story of the Trojan Horse existed before those accounts were written. Other archaic representations of the Trojan horse are found on a Corinthian aryballos dating back to 560 BC (see figure), on a vase fragment to 540 BC (see figure), and on an Etruscan carnelian scarab. An Attic red-figure fragment from a kalyx-krater dated to around 400 BC depicts the scene where the Greeks are climbing down the Trojan Horse, represented by the wooden hatch door.

==Modern metaphorical use==
The term &quot;Trojan horse&quot; is used metaphorically to mean any trick or strategy that causes a target to invite a foe into a securely protected place; or to deceive by appearance, hiding malevolent intent in an outwardly benign exterior; to subvert from within using deceptive means.

<text>A smart card (SC), chip card, or integrated circuit card (ICC or IC card), is a card used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit (IC) chip. Many smart cards include a pattern of metal contacts to electrically connect to the internal chip. Others are contactless, and some are both. Smart cards can provide personal identification, authentication, data storage, and application processing. Applications include identification, financial, public transit, computer security, schools, and healthcare. Smart cards may provide strong security authentication for single sign-on (SSO) within organizations. Numerous nations have deployed smart cards throughout their populations.

The universal integrated circuit card (UICC) for mobile phones, installed as pluggable SIM card or embedded eSIM, is also a type of smart card. , 10.5billion smart card IC chips are manufactured annually, including 5.44billion SIM card IC chips.

== History ==
The basis for the smart card is the silicon integrated circuit (IC) chip. It was invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959. The invention of the silicon integrated circuit led to the idea of incorporating it onto a plastic card in the late 1960s.

=== Invention ===

The idea of incorporating an integrated circuit chip onto a plastic card was first introduced by the German engineer Helmut Gröttrup. In February 1967, Gröttrup filed the patents DE1574074 and DE1574075 in West Germany for a tamper-proof identification switch based on a semiconductor device and described contactless communication via inductive coupling. Its primary use was intended to provide individual copy-protected keys for releasing the tapping process at unmanned gas stations. In September 1968, Gröttrup, together with Jürgen Dethloff as an investor, filed further patents for this identification switch, first in Austria and in 1969 as subsequent applications in the United States, Great Britain, West Germany and other countries.

Independently, Kunitaka Arimura of the Arimura Technology Institute in Japan developed a similar idea of incorporating an integrated circuit onto a plastic card, and filed a smart card patent in March 1970. The following year, Paul Castrucci of IBM filed an American patent titled &quot;Information Card&quot; in May 1971.

In 1974 Roland Moreno patented a secured memory card later dubbed the &quot;smart card&quot;. In 1976, Jürgen Dethloff introduced the known element (called &quot;the secret&quot;) to identify gate user as of USP 4105156.

In 1977, Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips: one microprocessor and one memory, and in 1978, he patented the self-programmable one-chip microcomputer (SPOM) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip. Three years later, Motorola used this patent in its &quot;CP8&quot;. At that time, Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards. In 2001, Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger, who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto. In 2006, Axalto and Gemplus, at the time the world&#x27;s top two smart-card manufacturers, merged and became Gemalto. In 2008, Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business, which included the smart-card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large-scale smart-card management systems based on public key infrastructure (PKI).

The first mass use of the cards was as a telephone card for payment in French payphones, starting in 1983.

=== Carte bleue ===
After the Télécarte, microchips were integrated into all French &quot;Carte Bleue&quot; debit cards in 1992. Customers inserted the card into the merchant&#x27;s point-of-sale (POS) terminal, then typed the personal identification number (PIN), before the transaction was accepted. Only very limited transactions (such as paying small highway tolls) are processed without a PIN.

Smart-card-based &quot;electronic purse&quot; systems store funds on the card, so that readers do not need network connectivity. They entered European service in the mid-1990s. They have been common in Germany (Geldkarte), Austria (Quick Wertkarte), Belgium (Proton), France (Moneo), the Netherlands (Chipknip Chipper (decommissioned in 2015)), Switzerland (&quot;Cash&quot;), Norway (&quot;Mondex&quot;), Spain (&quot;Monedero 4B&quot;), Sweden (&quot;Cash&quot;, decommissioned in 2004), Finland (&quot;Avant&quot;), UK (&quot;Mondex&quot;), Denmark (&quot;Danmønt&quot;) and Portugal (&quot;Porta-moedas Multibanco&quot;).
Private electronic purse systems have also been deployed such as the Marines corps (USMC) at Parris Island allowing small amount payments at the cafeteria.

Since the 1990s, smart cards have been the subscriber identity modules (SIMs) used in GSM mobile-phone equipment. Mobile phones are widely used across the world, so smart cards have become very common.

=== EMV ===

Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV)-compliant cards and equipment are widespread with the deployment led by European countries. The United States started later deploying the EMV technology in 2014, with the deployment still in progress in 2019. Typically, a country&#x27;s national payment association, in coordination with MasterCard International, Visa International, American Express and Japan Credit Bureau (JCB), jointly plan and implement EMV systems.

Historically, in 1993 several international payment companies agreed to develop smart-card specifications for debit and credit cards. The original brands were MasterCard, Visa, and Europay. The first version of the EMV system was released in 1994. In 1998 the specifications became stable.

EMVCo maintains these specifications. EMVco&#x27;s purpose is to assure the various financial institutions and retailers that the specifications retain backward compatibility with the 1998 version. EMVco upgraded the specifications in 2000 and 2004.

EMV compliant cards were first accepted into Malaysia in 2005 and later into United States in 2014. MasterCard was the first company that was allowed to use the technology in the United States. The United States has felt pushed to use the technology because of the increase in identity theft. The credit card information stolen from Target in late 2013 was one of the largest indicators that American credit card information is not safe. Target made the decision on 30 April 2014 that it would try to implement the smart chip technology to protect itself from future credit card identity theft.

Before 2014, the consensus in America was that there were enough security measures to avoid credit card theft and that the smart chip was not necessary. The cost of the smart chip technology was significant, which was why most of the corporations did not want to pay for it in the United States. The debate finally ended when Target sent out a notice stating unauthorized access to magnetic strips costing Target over 300 million dollars along with the increasing cost of online credit theft was enough for the United States to invest in the technology. The adaptation of EMV&#x27;s increased significantly in 2015 

=== Development of contactless systems ===

&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards do not require physical contact between a card and reader. They are becoming more popular for payment and ticketing. Typical uses include mass transit and motorway tolls. Visa and MasterCard implemented a version deployed in 2004–2006 in the U.S., with Visa&#x27;s current offering called Visa Contactless. Most contactless fare collection systems are incompatible, though the MIFARE Standard card from NXP Semiconductors has a considerable market share in the US and Europe.

Use of &quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards in transport has also grown through the use of low cost chips NXP Mifare Ultralight and paper/card/PET rather than PVC. This has reduced media cost so it can be used for low cost tickets and short term transport passes (up to 1 year typically). The cost is typically 10% that of a PVC smart card with larger memory. They are distributed through vending machines, ticket offices and agents. Use of paper/PET is less harmful to the environment than traditional PVC cards.

Smart cards are also being introduced for identification and entitlement by regional, national, and international organizations. These uses include citizen cards, drivers’ licenses, and patient cards. In Malaysia, the compulsory national ID MyKad enables eight applications and has 18 million users. Contactless smart cards are part of ICAO biometric passports to enhance security for international travel.

=== Complex smart cards ===

Complex Cards are smart cards that conform to the ISO/IEC 7810 standard and include components in addition to those found in traditional single chip smart cards. Complex Cards were invented by Cyril Lalo and Philippe Guillaud in 1999 when they designed a chip smart card with additional components, building upon the initial concept consisting of using audio frequencies to transmit data patented by Alain Bernard. The first Complex Card prototype was developed collaboratively by Cyril Lalo and Philippe Guillaud, who were working at AudioSmartCard at the time, and Henri Boccia and Philippe Patrice, who were working at Gemplus. It was ISO 7810-compliant and included a battery, a piezoelectric buzzer, a button, and delivered audio functions, all within a 0.84mm thickness card.

The Complex Card pilot, developed by AudioSmartCard, was launched in 2002 by Crédit Lyonnais, a French financial institution. This pilot featured acoustic tones as a means of authentication. Although Complex Cards were developed since the inception of the smart card industry, they only reached maturity after 2010.

Complex Cards can accommodate various peripherals including:
* One or more buttons,
* A digital keyboard,
* An alphabetic keyboard,
* A touch keyboard,
* A small display, for a dynamic Card Security Code (CSC) for instance,
* A larger digital display, for OTP or balance, QR code
* An alphanumeric display, 
* A fingerprint sensor,
* A LED, 
* A buzzer or speaker.

While first generation Complex Cards were battery powered, the second generation is battery-free and receives power through the usual card connector and/or induction .

Sound, generated by a buzzer, was the preferred means of communication for the first projects involving Complex Cards. Later, with the progress of displays, visual communication is now present in almost all Complex Cards.

====Functionalities====

Complex Cards support all communication protocols present on regular smart cards: contact, thanks to a contact pad as defined ISO/IEC 7816 standard, contactless following the ISO/IEC 14443 standard, and magstripe.

Developers of Complex Cards target several needs when developing them: 
* One Time Password, 
* Provide account information, 
* Provide computation capabilities, 
* Provide a means of transaction security, 
* Provide a means of user authentication.

=====One time password=====

A Complex Card can be used to compute a cryptographic value, such as a One-time password. The One-Time Password is generated by a cryptoprocessor encapsulated in the card. To implement this function, the crypto processor must be initialized with a seed value, which enables the identification of the OTPs respective of each card. The hash of seed value has to be stored securely within the card to prevent unauthorized prediction of the generated OTPs.

One-Time Passwords generation is based either on incremental values (event based) or on a real time clock (time based). Using clock-based One-Time Password generation requires the Complex Card to be equipped with a Real-time clock.

Complex Cards used to generate One Time Password have been developed for: 
* Standard Chartered, Singapore,
* Bank of America, USA, 
* Erste Bank, Croatia, 
* Verisign, USA,
* RSA Security.

=====Account information=====

A Complex Card with buttons can display the balance of one or multiple account(s) linked to the card. Typically, either one button is used to display the balance in the case of a single account card or, in the case of a card linked to multiple accounts, a combination of buttons is used to select a specific account&#x27;s balance.

For additional security, features such as requiring the user to enter an identification or a security value such as a PIN can be added to a Complex Card.

Complex Cards used to provide account information have been developed for: 
* Getin Bank, Poland,
* TEB, Turkey.

The latest generation of battery free, button free, Complex Cards can display a balance or other kind of information without requiring any input from the card holder. The information is updated during the use of the card. For instance, in a transit card, key information such as the monetary value balance, the number of remaining trips or the expiry date of a transit pass can be displayed.

=====Transaction security=====

A Complex Card being deployed as a payment card can be equipped with capability to provide transaction security. Typically, online payments are made secure thanks to the Card Security Code (CSC), also known as card verification code (CVC2), or card verification value (CVV2). The card security code (CSC) is a 3 or 4 digits number printed on a credit or debit card, used as a security feature for card-not-present (CNP) payment card transactions to reduce the incidence of fraud.

The Card Security Code (CSC) is to be given to the merchant by the cardholder to complete a card-not-present transaction. The CSC is transmitted along with other transaction data and verified by the card issuer. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) prohibits the storage of the CSC by the merchant or any stakeholder in the payment chain. Although designed to be a security feature, the static CSC is susceptible to fraud as it can easily be memorized by a shop attendant, who could then use it for fraudulent online transactions or sale on the dark web. 
This vulnerability has led the industry to develop a Dynamic Card Security Code (DCSC) that can be changed at certain time intervals, or after each contact or contactless EMV transaction. This Dynamic CSC brings significantly better security than a static CSC.

The first generation of Dynamic CSC cards, developed by NagraID Security required a battery, a quartz and Real Time Clock (RTC) embedded within the card to power the computation of a new Dynamic CSC, after expiration of the programmed period.

The second generation of Dynamic CSC cards, developed by Ellipse World, Inc., does not require any battery, quartz, or RTC to compute and display the new dynamic code. Instead, the card obtains its power either through the usual card connector or by induction during every EMV transaction from the Point of Sales (POS) terminal or Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to compute a new DCSC.

The Dynamic CSC, also called dynamic cryptogram, is marketed by several companies, under different brand names: 
* MotionCode, first developed by NagraID Security, a company later acquired by IDEMIA, 
* DCV, the solution offered by Thales,
* EVC (Ellipse Verification Code) by Ellipse, a Los Angeles, USA based company.

The advantage of the Dynamic Card Security Code (DCSC) is that new information is transmitted with the payment transactions, thus making it useless for a potential fraudster to memorize or store it. A transaction with a Dynamic Card Security Code is carried out exactly the same way, with the same processes and use of parameters as a transaction with a static code in a card-not-present transaction. Upgrading to a DCSC allows cardholders and merchants to continue their payment habits and processes undisturbed.

=====User authentication=====

Complex Cards can be equipped with biometric sensors allowing for stronger user authentication. In the typical use case, fingerprint sensors are integrated into a payment card to bring a higher level of user authentication than a PIN.

To implement user authentication using a fingerprint enabled smart card, the user has to authenticate himself/herself to the card by means of the fingerprint before starting a payment transaction.

Several companies offer cards with fingerprint sensors, including: 
* Thales: Biometric card, 
* IDEMIA: F.Code, originally developed by NagraID Security,
* IDEX Biometrics, 
* NXP Semiconductors

====Components====

Complex Cards can incorporate a wide variety of components. The choice of components drives functionality, influences cost, power supply needs, and manufacturing complexity.

=====Buttons=====

Depending on Complex Card types, buttons have been added to allow an easy interaction between the user and the card. Typically, these buttons are used to:
* Select one action, such as which account to obtain the balance, or the unit (&quot;e.g.&quot; currency or number of trips) in which the information is displayed,
* Enter numeric data via the addition of a digital keypad,
* Enter text data via the addition of an alphanumeric keyboard.

While separate keys have been used on prototypes in the early days, capacitive keyboards are the most popular solution now, thanks to technology developments by AudioSmartCard International SA.

The interaction with a capacitive keyboard requires constant power, therefore a battery and a mechanical button are required to activate the card.

=====Buzzer=====

The first Complex Cards were equipped with a buzzer that made it possible to broadcast sound. This feature was generally used over the phone to send identification data such as an identifier and one-time passwords (OTPs). Technologies used for sound transmission include DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency signaling) or FSK (frequency-shift keying).

Companies that offered cards with buzzers include: 
* AudioSmartCard, 
* nCryptone,
* Prosodie,
* Société d&#x27;exploitation du jeton sécurisé – SEJS.

=====Display=====

Displaying data is an essential part of Complex Card functionalities. Depending on the information that needs to be shown, displays can be digital or alphanumeric and of varying lengths. Displays can be located either on the front or back of the card. A front display is the most common solution for showing information such as a One-Time Password or an electronic purse balance. A rear display is more often used for showing a Dynamic Card Security Code (DCSC).

Displays can be made using two technologies: 
* Liquid-crystal display (LCD) : LCDs are easily available from a wide variety of suppliers, and they are able to display either digits or alphabetical data. However, to be fitted in a complex smart card, LCDs need to have a certain degree of flexibility. Also, LCDs need to be powered to keep information displayed. 
* Bistable displays, also known as Ferroelectric liquid crystal displays, are increasingly used as they only require power to refresh the displayed information. The displayed data remains visible, without the need for of any power supply. Bistable displays are also available in a variety of specifications, displaying digits or pixels. Bistable displays are available from E Ink Corporation among others.

=====Cryptoprocessor=====

If a Complex smart Card is dedicated to making cryptographic computations (such as generating a one-time password) it may require a secure cryptoprocessor.

=====Power supply=====

As Complex Cards contain more components than traditional smart cards, their power consumption must be carefully monitored.

First generation Complex Cards require a power supply even in standby mode. As such, product designers generally included a battery in their design. Incorporating a battery creates an additional burden in terms of complexity, cost, space and flexibility in an already dense design. Including a battery in a Complex Card increases the complexity of the manufacturing process as a battery cannot be hot laminated.

Second generation Complex Cards feature a battery-free design. These cards harvest the necessary power from external sources; for example when the card interacts in a contact or contactless fashion with a payment system or an NFC-enabled smartphone. The use of a bistable display in the card design ensures that the screen remains legible even when the Complex Card is unconnected to the power source.

====Manufacturing====

Complex Card manufacturing methods are inherited from the smart card industry and from the electronics mounting industry. As Complex Cards incorporate several components while having to remain within 0.8 mm thickness and be flexible, and to comply with the ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811 and ISO/IEC 7816 standards, renders their manufacture more complex than standard smart cards.

One of the most popular manufacturing processes in the smart card industry is lamination. This process involves laminating an inlay between two card faces. The inlay contains the needed electronic components with an antenna printed on an inert support.

Typically battery-powered Complex Cards require a cold lamination manufacturing process. This process impacts the manufacturing lead time and the whole cost of such a Complex Card.

Second generation, battery-free Complex Cards can be manufactured by existing hot lamination process. This automated process, inherited from traditional smart card manufacturing, enables the production of Complex Cards in large quantities while keeping costs under control, a necessity for the evolution from a niche to a mass market.

====Card life cycle====

As with standard smart cards, Complex Cards go through a lifecycle comprising the following steps: 
* Manufacturing,
* Personalization,
* User enrollment, if needed by the application,
* Provisioning,
* Active life,
* Cancellation,
* Recycling / destruction.

As Complex Cards bring more functionalities than standard smart cards and, due to their complexity, their personalization can take longer or require more inputs. Having Complex Cards that can be personalized by the same machines and the same processes as regular smart cards allows them to be integrated more easily in existing manufacturing chains and applications.

First generation, battery-operated Complex Cards require specific recycling processes, mandated by different regulatory bodies. Additionally, keeping battery-operated Complex Cards in inventory for extended periods of time may reduce their performance due to battery ageing.

Second-generation battery-free technology ensures operation during the entire lifetime of the card and eliminates self-discharge, providing extended shelf life, and is more eco-friendly.

===History and major players===

Since the inception of smart cards, innovators have been trying to add extra features. As technologies have matured and have been industrialized, several smart card industry players have been involved in Complex Cards.

The Complex Card concept began in 1999 when Cyril Lalo and Philippe Guillaud, its inventors, first designed a smart card with additional components. The first prototype was developed collaboratively by Cyril Lalo, who was the CEO of AudioSmartCard at the time, and Henri Boccia and Philippe Patrice, from Gemplus. The prototype included a button and audio functions on a 0.84mm thick ISO 7810-compliant card .

Since then, Complex Cards have been mass-deployed primarily by NagraID Security.

Founded in 2002, by Alan Finkelstein, Innovative Card Technologies developed and commercialized enhancements for the smart card market. The company acquired the display card assets of nCryptone in 2006. Innovative Card Technologies has ceased its activities.

====NagraID====

Nagra ID, now known as NID, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Kudelski Group until 2014. NID can trace its history with Complex Cards back to 2003 when it collaborated on development with nCryptone. Nagra ID was instrumental in developing the cold lamination process for Complex Cards manufacturing.

Nagra ID manufactures Complex Cards that can include a battery, buttons, displays or other electronic components.

====NagraID Security====

Nagra ID Security began in 2008 as a spinoff of Nagra ID to focus on Complex Card development and manufacturing. The company was owned by Kudelski Group (50%), Cyril Lalo (25%) and Philippe Guillaud (25%).

NagraID Security quickly became a leading player in the adoption of Complex Cards due, in large part, to its development of MotionCode cards that featured a small display to enable a Card Security Code (CVV2).

NagraID Security was the first Complex Cards manufacturer to develop a mass market for payment display cards. Their customers included: 
* ABSA, South Africa,
* Banco Bicentenario, Venezuela,

Major references in the Complex Cards business include: 
* BPCE Group, France, 
* Orange Bank, France, 
* Société Générale, France.

====Plastc====

Set up in 2009, Plastc announced a single card that could digitally hold the data of up to 20 credit or debit cards. The company succeeded in raising US$9 million through preorders but failed to deliver any product. Plastc was then acquired in 2017 by Edge Mobile Payments, a Santa Cruz-based Fintech company. The Plastc project continues as the Edge card, a dynamic payment card that consolidates several payment cards in one device. The card is equipped with a battery and an ePaper screen and can store data from up to 50 credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards.

====Stratos====

Stratos was created in 2012 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. In 2015, Stratos developed the Stratos Bluetooth Connected Card, which was designed to integrate up to three credit and debit card in a single card format and featured a smartphone app used to manage the card. Due to its Lithium ion thin film battery, the Stratos card was equipped with LEDs and communicated in contactless mode and in Bluetooth low Energy.

In 2017 Stratos was acquired by CardLab Innovation, a company headquartered in Herlev, Denmark.

====Swyp====

The Swyp card included a battery, a button and a matrix display that showed which card was in use. The company registered users in its beta testing program, but the product never shipped on a commercial scale.

Qvivr raised US$5 million in January 2017 and went out of business in November 2017.

===Businesses===

Complex Cards have been adopted by numerous financial institutions worldwide. They may include different functionalities such as payment cards (credit, debit, prepaid), One-time password, mass-transit, and dynamic Card Security Code (CVV2).

Complex Card technology is used by numerous financial institutions including: 
* ABSA, South Africa, 
* Banca MontePaschi Belgio, 
* Bank of America, USA, 
* BPCE Group, France, 
* Carpatica Bank, Romania, 
* Credit Europe Bank, Romania, 
* Erste &amp; Steiermärkische Bank, Croatia 
* Getin Bank, Poland,

* Orange Bank, France, 
* PayPal, USA, 
* Sinopac, Taiwan, 
* Société Générale, France, 
* Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore, 
* Symantec, 
* TEB, Turkey.

== Design ==
A smart card may have the following generic characteristics:

* Dimensions similar to those of a credit card. ID-1 of the ISO/IEC 7810 standard defines cards as nominally . Another popular size is ID-000, which is nominally (commonly used in SIM cards). Both are thick.
* Contains a tamper-resistant security system (for example a secure cryptoprocessor and a secure file system) and provides security services (e.g., protects in-memory information).
* Managed by an administration system, which securely interchanges information and configuration settings with the card, controlling card blacklisting and application-data updates.
* Communicates with external services through card-reading devices, such as ticket readers, ATMs, Dip reader, etc.
* Smart cards are typically made of plastic, generally polyvinyl chloride, but sometimes polyethylene-terephthalate-based polyesters, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or polycarbonate.
Since April 2009, a Japanese company has manufactured reusable financial smart cards made from paper.

=== Internal structure ===
==== Data structures ====
As mentioned above, data on a smart card may be stored in a file system (FS). In smart card file systems, the root directory is called the &quot;master file&quot; (&quot;MF&quot;), subdirectories are called &quot;dedicated files&quot; (&quot;DF&quot;), and ordinary files are called &quot;elementary files&quot; (&quot;EF&quot;).

==== Logical layout ====
The file system mentioned above is stored on an EEPROM (storage or memory) within the smartcard. In addition to the EEPROM, other components may be present, depending upon the kind of smartcard. Most smartcards have one of three logical layouts:

* EEPROM only.
* EEPROM, ROM, RAM, and microprocessor.
* EEPROM, ROM, RAM, microprocessor, and secure element.

In cards with microprocessors, the microprocessor sits inline between the reader and the other components. The operating system that runs on the microprocessor mediates the reader&#x27;s access to those components to prevent unauthorized access.

=== Physical interfaces ===
==== Contact smart cards ====

Contact smart cards have a contact area of approximately , comprising several gold-plated contact pads. These pads provide electrical connectivity when inserted into a reader, which is used as a communications medium between the smart card and a host (e.g., a computer, a point of sale terminal) or a mobile telephone. Cards do not contain batteries; power is supplied by the card reader.

The ISO/IEC 7810 and ISO/IEC 7816 series of standards define:
* physical shape and characteristics,
* electrical connector positions and shapes,
* electrical characteristics,
* communications protocols, including commands sent to and responses from the card,
* basic functionality.

Because the chips in financial cards are the same as those used in subscriber identity modules (SIMs) in mobile phones, programmed differently and embedded in a different piece of PVC, chip manufacturers are building to the more demanding GSM/3G standards. So, for example, although the EMV standard allows a chip card to draw 50 mA from its terminal, cards are normally well below the telephone industry&#x27;s 6 mA limit. This allows smaller and cheaper financial card terminals.

Communication protocols for contact smart cards include T=0 (character-level transmission protocol, defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3) and T=1 (block-level transmission protocol, defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3).

==== Contactless smart cards ====
&quot;Contactless smart cards&quot; communicate with readers under protocols defined in the ISO/IEC 14443 standard. They support data rates of 106–848 kbit/s. These cards require only proximity to an antenna to communicate.
Like smart cards with contacts, contactless cards do not have an internal power source. Instead, they use a loop antenna coil to capture some of the incident radio-frequency interrogation signal, rectify it, and use it to power the card&#x27;s electronics. Contactless smart media can be made with PVC, paper/card and PET finish to meet different performance, cost and durability requirements.

APDU transmission by a contactless interface is defined in ISO/IEC 14443-4.

==== Hybrids ====
Hybrid cards implement contactless and contact interfaces on a single card with unconnected chips including dedicated modules/storage and processing.

;Dual-interface

Dual-interface cards implement contactless and contact interfaces on a single chip with some shared storage and processing. An example is Porto&#x27;s multi-application transport card, called Andante, which uses a chip with both contact and contactless (ISO/IEC 14443 Type B) interfaces. Numerous payment cards worldwide are based on hybrid card technology allowing them to communicate in contactless as well as contact modes.

====USB====
The CCID (Chip Card Interface Device) is a USB protocol that allows a smart card to be interfaced to a computer using a card reader which has a standard USB interface. This allows the smart card to be used as a security token for authentication and data encryption such as Bitlocker. A typical CCID is a USB dongle and may contain a SIM.

===Logical interfaces===
====Reader side====
Different smart cards implement one or more reader-side protocols. Common protocols here include CT-API and PC/SC.

====Application side====
Smartcard operating systems may provide application programming interfaces (APIs) so that developers can write programs (&quot;applications&quot;) to run on the smartcard. Some such APIs, such as Java Card, allow programs to be uploaded to the card without replacing the card&#x27;s entire operating system.

== Applications ==
=== Financial ===
Smart cards serve as credit or ATM cards, fuel cards, mobile phone SIMs, authorization cards for pay television, household utility pre-payment cards, high-security identification and access badges, and public transport and public phone payment cards.

Smart cards may also be used as electronic wallets. The smart card chip can be &quot;loaded&quot; with funds to pay parking meters, vending machines or merchants. Cryptographic protocols protect the exchange of money between the smart card and the machine. No connection to a bank is needed. The holder of the card may use it even if not the owner. Examples are Proton, Geldkarte, Chipknip and Moneo. The German Geldkarte is also used to validate customer age at vending machines for cigarettes.

These are the best known payment cards (classic plastic card):
* Visa: Visa Contactless, Quick VSDC, &quot;qVSDC&quot;, Visa Wave, MSD, payWave
* Mastercard: PayPass Magstripe, PayPass MChip
* American Express: ExpressPay
* Discover: Zip
* Unionpay: QuickPass

Roll-outs started in 2005 in the U.S. Asia and Europe followed in 2006. Contactless (non-PIN) transactions cover a payment range of ~$5–50. There is an ISO/IEC 14443 PayPass implementation. Some, but not all, PayPass implementations conform to EMV.

Non-EMV cards work like magnetic stripe cards. This is common in the U.S. (PayPass Magstripe and Visa MSD). The cards do not hold or maintain the account balance. All payment passes without a PIN, usually in off-line mode. The security of such a transaction is no greater than with a magnetic stripe card transaction.

EMV cards can have either contact or contactless interfaces. They work as if they were a normal EMV card with a contact interface. Via the contactless interface they work somewhat differently, in that the card commands enabled improved features such as lower power and shorter transaction times. EMV standards include provisions for contact and contactless communications. Typically modern payment cards are based on hybrid card technology and support both contact and contactless communication modes.

=== SIM ===
The subscriber identity modules used in mobile-phone systems are reduced-size smart cards, using otherwise identical technologies.

=== Identification ===
Smart-cards can authenticate identity. Sometimes they employ a public key infrastructure (PKI). The card stores an encrypted digital certificate issued from the PKI provider along with other relevant information. Examples include the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC), and other cards used by other governments for their citizens. If they include biometric identification data, cards can provide superior two- or three-factor authentication.

Smart cards are not always privacy-enhancing, because the subject may carry incriminating information on the card. Contactless smart cards that can be read from within a wallet or even a garment simplify authentication; however, criminals may access data from these cards.

Cryptographic smart cards are often used for single sign-on. Most advanced smart cards include specialized cryptographic hardware that uses algorithms such as RSA and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Today&#x27;s cryptographic smart cards generate key pairs on board, to avoid the risk from having more than one copy of the key (since by design there usually isn&#x27;t a way to extract private keys from a smart card). Such smart cards are mainly used for digital signatures and secure identification.

The most common way to access cryptographic smart card functions on a computer is to use a vendor-provided PKCS#11 library. On Microsoft Windows the Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) API is also supported.

The most widely used cryptographic algorithms in smart cards (excluding the GSM so-called &quot;crypto algorithm&quot;) are Triple DES and RSA. The key set is usually loaded (DES) or generated (RSA) on the card at the personalization stage.

Some of these smart cards are also made to support the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard for Personal Identity Verification, FIPS 201.

Turkey implemented the first smart card driver&#x27;s license system in 1987. Turkey had a high level of road accidents and decided to develop and use digital tachograph devices on heavy vehicles, instead of the existing mechanical ones, to reduce speed violations. Since 1987, the professional driver&#x27;s licenses in Turkey have been issued as smart cards. A professional driver is required to insert his driver&#x27;s license into a digital tachograph before starting to drive. The tachograph unit records speed violations for each driver and gives a printed report. The driving hours for each driver are also being monitored and reported. In 1990 the European Union conducted a feasibility study through BEVAC Consulting Engineers, titled &quot;Feasibility study with respect to a European electronic drivers license (based on a smart-card) on behalf of Directorate General VII&quot;. In this study, chapter seven describes Turkey&#x27;s experience.

Argentina&#x27;s Mendoza province began using smart card driver&#x27;s licenses in 1995. Mendoza also had a high level of road accidents, driving offenses, and a poor record of recovering fines. Smart licenses hold up-to-date records of driving offenses and unpaid fines. They also store personal information, license type and number, and a photograph. Emergency medical information such as blood type, allergies, and biometrics (fingerprints) can be stored on the chip if the card holder wishes. The Argentina government anticipates that this system will help to collect more than $10 million per year in fines.

In 1999 Gujarat was the first Indian state to introduce a smart card license system. As of 2005, it has issued 5 million smart card driving licenses to its people.

In 2002, the Estonian government started to issue smart cards named ID Kaart as primary identification for citizens to replace the usual passport in domestic and EU use.
As of 2010 about 1 million smart cards have been issued (total population is about 1.3 million) and they are widely used in internet banking, buying public transport tickets, authorization on various websites etc.

By the start of 2009, the entire population of Belgium was issued eID cards that are used for identification. These cards contain two certificates: one for authentication and one for signature. This signature is legally enforceable. More and more services in Belgium use eID for authorization.

Spain started issuing national ID cards (DNI) in the form of smart cards in 2006 and gradually replaced all the older ones with smart cards. The idea was that many or most bureaucratic acts could be done online but it was a failure because the Administration did not adapt and still mostly requires paper documents and personal presence.

On 14 August 2012, the ID cards in Pakistan were replaced. The Smart Card is a third generation chip-based identity document that is produced according to international standards and requirements. The card has over 36 physical security features and has the latest encryption codes. This smart card replaced the NICOP (the ID card for overseas Pakistani).

Smart cards may identify emergency responders and their skills. Cards like these allow first responders to bypass organizational paperwork and focus more time on the emergency resolution. In 2004, The Smart Card Alliance expressed the needs: &quot;to enhance security, increase government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification&quot;. emergency response personnel can carry these cards to be positively identified in emergency situations. WidePoint Corporation, a smart card provider to FEMA, produces cards that contain additional personal information, such as medical records and skill sets.

In 2007, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) proposed a new standard defining V1.0 of the Smart Card Web Server (SCWS), an HTTP server embedded in a SIM card intended for a smartphone user. The non-profit trade association SIMalliance has been promoting the development and adoption of SCWS. SIMalliance states that SCWS offers end-users a familiar, OS-independent, browser-based interface to secure, personal SIM data. As of mid-2010, SIMalliance had not reported widespread industry acceptance of SCWS.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.simalliance.org/en?t=/documentManager/sfdoc.file.supply&amp;fileID=1279268442341&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The OMA has been maintaining the standard, approving V1.1 of the standard in May 2009, and V1.2 was expected to be approved in October 2012.

Smart cards are also used to identify user accounts on arcade machines.

=== Public transit ===


Smart cards, used as transit passes, and integrated ticketing are used by many public transit operators. Card users may also make small purchases using the cards. Some operators offer points for usage, exchanged at retailers or for other benefits. Examples include Singapore&#x27;s CEPAS, Malaysia&#x27;s Touch n Go, Ontario&#x27;s Presto card, Hong Kong&#x27;s Octopus card, Tokyo&#x27;s Suica and PASMO cards, London&#x27;s Oyster card, Ireland&#x27;s Leap Card, Brussels&#x27; MoBIB, Québec&#x27;s Opus card, Boston&#x27;s CharlieCard, San Francisco&#x27;s Clipper card, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s SmarTrip, Auckland&#x27;s AT Hop, Brisbane&#x27;s go card, Perth&#x27;s SmartRider, Sydney&#x27;s Opal card and Victoria&#x27;s myki. However, these present a privacy risk because they allow the mass transit operator (and the government) to track an individual&#x27;s movement. In Finland, for example, the Data Protection Ombudsman prohibited the transport operator Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council (YTV) from collecting such information, despite YTV&#x27;s argument that the card owner has the right to a list of trips paid with the card. Earlier, such information was used in the investigation of the Myyrmanni bombing.

The UK&#x27;s Department for Transport mandated smart cards to administer travel entitlements for elderly and disabled residents. These schemes let residents use the cards for more than just bus passes. They can also be used for taxi and other concessionary transport. One example is the &quot;Smartcare go&quot; scheme provided by Ecebs. The UK systems use the ITSO Ltd specification. Other schemes in the UK include period travel passes, carnets of tickets or day passes and stored value which can be used to pay for journeys. Other concessions for school pupils, students and job seekers are also supported. These are mostly based on the ITSO Ltd specification.

Many smart transport schemes include the use of low cost smart tickets for simple journeys, day passes and visitor passes. Examples include Glasgow SPT subway. These smart tickets are made of paper or PET which is thinner than a PVC smart card e.g. Confidex smart media. The smart tickets can be supplied pre-printed and over-printed or printed on demand.

In Sweden, as of 2018–19, the old SL Access smart card system has started to be phased out and replaced by smart phone apps. The phone apps have less cost, at least for the transit operators who don&#x27;t need any electronic equipment (the riders provide that). The riders are able buy tickets anywhere and don&#x27;t need to load money onto smart cards. New NFC smart cards are still in use for foreseeable future (as of 2024).

=== Video games ===

In Japanese amusement arcades, contactless smart cards (usually referred to as &quot;IC cards&quot;) are used by game manufacturers as a method for players to access in-game features (both online like Konami E-Amusement and Sega ALL.Net and offline) and as a memory support to save game progress. Depending on a case by case scenario, the machines can use a game-specific card or a &quot;universal&quot; one usable on multiple machines from the same manufacturer/publisher. Amongst the most widely used there are Banapassport by Bandai Namco, E-amusement pass by Konami, Aime by Sega and Nesica by Taito.

In 2018, in an effort to make arcade game IC cards more user friendly, Konami, Bandai Namco and Sega have agreed on a unified system of cards named &quot;Amusement IC&quot;. Thanks to this agreement, the three companies are now using a unified card reader in their arcade cabinets, so that players are able to use their card, no matter if a Banapassport, an e-Amusement Pass or an Aime, with hardware and ID services of all three manufacturers. A common logo for &quot;Amusement IC&quot; cards has been created, and this is now displayed on compatible cards from all three companies. In January 2019, Taito announced that their Nesica card was also joining the &quot;Amusement IC&quot; agreement with the other three companies.

=== Computer security ===
Smart cards can be used as a security token.

Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox web browser can use smart cards to store certificates for use in secure web browsing.

Some disk encryption systems, such as VeraCrypt and Microsoft&#x27;s BitLocker, can use smart cards to securely hold encryption keys, and also to add another layer of encryption to critical parts of the secured disk.

GnuPG, the well known encryption suite, also supports storing keys in a smart card.

Smart cards are also used for single sign-on to log on to computers.

=== Schools ===
Smart cards are being provided to students at some schools and colleges. Uses include:

* Tracking student attendance
* As an electronic purse, to pay for items at canteens, vending machines, laundry facilities, etc.
* Tracking and monitoring food choices at the canteen, to help the student maintain a healthy diet
* Tracking loans from the school library
* Access control for admittance to restricted buildings, dormitories, and other facilities. This requirement may be enforced at all times (such as for a laboratory containing valuable equipment), or just during after-hours periods (such as for an academic building that is open during class times, but restricted to authorized personnel at night), depending on security needs.
* Access to transportation services

=== Healthcare ===

Smart health cards can improve the security and privacy of patient information, provide a secure carrier for portable medical records, reduce health care fraud, support new processes for portable medical records, provide secure access to emergency medical information, enable compliance with government initiatives (e.g., organ donation) and mandates, and provide the platform to implement other applications as needed by the health care organization.

=== Other uses ===
Smart cards are widely used to encrypt digital television streams. VideoGuard is a specific example of how smart card security worked.

=== Multiple-use systems ===
The Malaysian government promotes MyKad as a single system for all smart-card applications. MyKad started as identity cards carried by all citizens and resident non-citizens. Available applications now include identity, travel documents, drivers license, health information, an electronic wallet, ATM bank-card, public toll-road and transit payments, and public key encryption infrastructure. The personal information inside the MYKAD card can be read using special APDU commands.

== Security ==

Smart cards have been advertised as suitable for personal identification tasks, because they are engineered to be tamper resistant. The chip usually implements some cryptographic algorithm. There are, however, several methods for recovering some of the algorithm&#x27;s internal state.

Differential power analysis involves measuring the precise time and electric current required for certain encryption or decryption operations. This can deduce the on-chip private key used by public key algorithms such as RSA. Some implementations of symmetric ciphers can be vulnerable to timing or power attacks as well.

Smart cards can be physically disassembled by using acid, abrasives, solvents, or some other technique to obtain unrestricted access to the on-board microprocessor. Although such techniques may involve a risk of permanent damage to the chip, they permit much more detailed information (e.g., photomicrographs of encryption hardware) to be extracted.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of smart cards are directly related to the volume of information and applications that are programmed for use on a card. A single contact/contactless smart card can be programmed with multiple banking credentials, medical entitlement, driver&#x27;s license/public transport entitlement, loyalty programs and club memberships to name just a few. Multi-factor and proximity authentication can and has been embedded into smart cards to increase the security of all services on the card. For example, a smart card can be programmed to only allow a contactless transaction if it is also within range of another device like a uniquely paired mobile phone. This can significantly increase the security of the smart card.

Governments and regional authorities save money because of improved security, better data and reduced processing costs. These savings help reduce public budgets or enhance public services. There are many examples in the UK, many using a common open LASSeO specification.

Individuals have better security and more convenience with using smart cards that perform multiple services. For example, they only need to replace one card if their wallet is lost or stolen. The data storage on a card can reduce duplication, and even provide emergency medical information.

==Advantages==

The first main advantage of smart cards is their flexibility. Smart cards have multiple functions which simultaneously can be an ID, a credit card, a stored-value cash card, and a repository of personal information such as telephone numbers or medical history. The card can be easily replaced if lost, and, the requirement for a PIN (or other form of security) provides additional security from unauthorised access to information by others. At the first attempt to use it illegally, the card would be deactivated by the card reader itself.

The second main advantage is security. Smart cards can be electronic key rings, giving the bearer ability to access information and physical places without need for online connections. They are encryption devices, so that the user can encrypt and decrypt information without relying on unknown, and therefore potentially untrustworthy, appliances such as ATMs. Smart cards are very flexible in providing authentication at different level of the bearer and the counterpart. Finally, with the information about the user that smart cards can provide to the other parties, they are useful devices for customizing products and services.

Other general benefits of smart cards are:

*Portability
*Increasing data storage capacity
*Reliability that is virtually unaffected by electrical and magnetic fields.

==Smart cards and electronic commerce==
Smart cards can be used in electronic commerce, over the Internet, though the business model used in current electronic commerce applications still cannot use the full feature set of the electronic medium. An advantage of smart cards for electronic commerce is their use customize services. For example, for the service supplier to deliver the customized service, the user may need to provide each supplier with their profile, a boring and time-consuming activity. A smart card can contain a non-encrypted profile of the bearer, so that the user can get customized services even without previous contacts with the supplier.

== Disadvantages ==
The plastic or paper card in which the chip is embedded is fairly flexible. The larger the chip, the higher the probability that normal use could damage it. Cards are often carried in wallets or pockets, a harsh environment for a chip and antenna in contactless cards. PVC cards can crack or break if bent/flexed excessively. However, for large banking systems, failure-management costs can be more than offset by fraud reduction.

The production, use and disposal of PVC plastic is known to be more harmful to the environment than other plastics. Alternative materials including chlorine free plastics and paper are available for some smart applications.

If the account holder&#x27;s computer hosts malware, the smart card security model may be broken. Malware can override the communication (both input via keyboard and output via application screen) between the user and the application. Man-in-the-browser malware (e.g., the Trojan Silentbanker) could modify a transaction, unnoticed by the user. Banks like Fortis and Belfius in Belgium and Rabobank (&quot;random reader&quot;) in the Netherlands combine a smart card with an unconnected card reader to avoid this problem. The customer enters a challenge received from the bank&#x27;s website, a PIN and the transaction amount into the reader. The reader returns an 8-digit signature. This signature is manually entered into the personal computer and verified by the bank, preventing point-of-sale-malware from changing the transaction amount.

Smart cards have also been the targets of security attacks. These attacks range from physical invasion of the card&#x27;s electronics, to non-invasive attacks that exploit weaknesses in the card&#x27;s software or hardware. The usual goal is to expose private encryption keys and then read and manipulate secure data such as funds. Once an attacker develops a non-invasive attack for a particular smart card model, he or she is typically able to perform the attack on other cards of that model in seconds, often using equipment that can be disguised as a normal smart card reader. While manufacturers may develop new card models with additional information security, it may be costly or inconvenient for users to upgrade vulnerable systems. Tamper-evident and audit features in a smart card system help manage the risks of compromised cards.

Another problem is the lack of standards for functionality and security. To address this problem, the Berlin Group launched the ERIDANE Project to propose &quot;a new functional and security framework for smart-card based Point of Interaction (POI) equipment&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a power series (in one variable) is an infinite series of the form
formula_1
where &quot;formula_2&quot; represents the coefficient of the &quot;n&quot;th term and &quot;c&quot; is a constant called the &quot;center&quot; of the series. Power series are useful in mathematical analysis, where they arise as Taylor series of infinitely differentiable functions. In fact, Borel&#x27;s theorem implies that every power series is the Taylor series of some smooth function.

In many situations, the center &quot;c&quot; is equal to zero, for instance for Maclaurin series. In such cases, the power series takes the simpler form
formula_3

The partial sums of a power series are polynomials, the partial sums of the Taylor series of an analytic function are a sequence of converging polynomial approximations to the function at the center, and a converging power series can be seen as a kind of generalized polynomial with infinitely many terms. Conversely, every polynomial is a power series with only finitely many non-zero terms.

Beyond their role in mathematical analysis, power series also occur in combinatorics as generating functions (a kind of formal power series) and in electronic engineering (under the name of the Z-transform). The familiar decimal notation for real numbers can also be viewed as an example of a power series, with integer coefficients, but with the argument &quot;x&quot; fixed at . In number theory, the concept of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers is also closely related to that of a power series.

Every polynomial of degree can be expressed as a power series around any center , where all terms of degree higher than have a coefficient of zero. For instance, the polynomial formula_4 can be written as a power series around the center formula_5 as
formula_6
or around the center formula_7 as
formula_8

One can view power series as being like &quot;polynomials of infinite degree&quot;, although power series are not polynomials in the strict sense.

===Geometric series, exponential function and sine===
The geometric series formula
formula_9
which is valid for formula_10, is one of the most important examples of a power series, as are the exponential function formula
formula_11
and the sine formula
formula_12
valid for all real &quot;x&quot;. These power series are examples of Taylor series (or, more specifically, of Maclaurin series).

=== On the set of exponents ===

Negative powers are not permitted in an ordinary power series; for instance, formula_13 is not considered a power series (although it is a Laurent series). Similarly, fractional powers such as formula_14 are not permitted; fractional powers arise in Puiseux series. The coefficients formula_15 must not depend on thus for instance formula_16 is not a power series.

==Radius of convergence==

A power series formula_17 is convergent for some values of the variable , which will always include since formula_18 and the sum of the series is thus formula_19 for . The series may diverge for other values of , possibly all of them. If is not the only point of convergence, then there is always a number with such that the series converges whenever and diverges whenever . The number is called the radius of convergence of the power series; in general it is given as
formula_20
or, equivalently,
formula_21
This is the Cauchy–Hadamard theorem; see limit superior and limit inferior for an explanation of the notation. The relation
formula_22
is also satisfied, if this limit exists.

The set of the complex numbers such that is called the disc of convergence of the series. The series converges absolutely inside its disc of convergence and it converges uniformly on every compact subset of the disc of convergence.

For , there is no general statement on the convergence of the series. However, Abel&#x27;s theorem states that if the series is convergent for some value such that , then the sum of the series for is the limit of the sum of the series for where is a real variable less than that tends to .

== Operations on power series ==

=== Addition and subtraction ===
When two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are decomposed into power series around the same center &quot;c&quot;, the power series of the sum or difference of the functions can be obtained by termwise addition and subtraction. That is, if
formula_23 and formula_24
then
formula_25

The sum of two power series will have a radius of convergence of at least the smaller of the two radii of convergence of the two series, but possibly larger than either of the two. For instance it is not true that if two power series formula_26 and formula_27 have the same radius of convergence, then formula_28 also has this radius of convergence: if formula_29 and formula_30, for instance, then both series have the same radius of convergence of 1, but the series formula_31 has a radius of convergence of 3.

=== Multiplication and division ===
With the same definitions for formula_32 and formula_33, the power series of the product and quotient of the functions can be obtained as follows:
formula_34

The sequence formula_35 is known as the Cauchy product of the sequences formula_2 and 

For division, if one defines the sequence formula_37 by
formula_38
then 
formula_39
and one can solve recursively for the terms formula_37 by comparing coefficients.

Solving the corresponding equations yields the formulae based on determinants of certain matrices of the coefficients of formula_32 and formula_33
formula_43
formula_44

=== Differentiation and integration===
Once a function formula_32 is given as a power series as above, it is differentiable on the interior of the domain of convergence. It can be differentiated and integrated by treating every term separately since both differentiation and integration are linear transformations of functions:
formula_46

Both of these series have the same radius of convergence as the original series.

== Analytic functions ==

A function &quot;f&quot; defined on some open subset &quot;U&quot; of R or C is called analytic if it is locally given by a convergent power series. This means that every &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; has an open neighborhood &quot;V&quot; ⊆ &quot;U&quot;, such that there exists a power series with center &quot;a&quot; that converges to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot;.

Every power series with a positive radius of convergence is analytic on the interior of its region of convergence. All holomorphic functions are complex-analytic. Sums and products of analytic functions are analytic, as are quotients as long as the denominator is non-zero.

If a function is analytic, then it is infinitely differentiable, but in the real case the converse is not generally true. For an analytic function, the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be computed as
formula_47

where formula_48 denotes the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;c&quot;, and formula_49. This means that every analytic function is locally represented by its Taylor series.

The global form of an analytic function is completely determined by its local behavior in the following sense: if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are two analytic functions defined on the same connected open set &quot;U&quot;, and if there exists an element such that for all , then for all .

If a power series with radius of convergence &quot;r&quot; is given, one can consider analytic continuations of the series, that is, analytic functions &quot;f&quot; which are defined on larger sets than and agree with the given power series on this set. The number &quot;r&quot; is maximal in the following sense: there always exists a complex number with such that no analytic continuation of the series can be defined at .

The power series expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function can be determined using the Lagrange inversion theorem.

=== Behavior near the boundary ===

The sum of a power series with a positive radius of convergence is an analytic function at every point in the interior of the disc of convergence. However, different behavior can occur at points on the boundary of that disc. For example:

# &quot;Divergence while the sum extends to an analytic function&quot;: formula_50 has radius of convergence equal to formula_51 and diverges at every point of formula_52. Nevertheless, the sum in formula_53 is formula_54, which is analytic at every point of the plane except for formula_55.
# &quot;Convergent at some points divergent at others&quot;: formula_56 has radius of convergence formula_51. It converges for formula_58, while it diverges for formula_55.
# &quot;Absolute convergence at every point of the boundary&quot;: formula_60 has radius of convergence formula_51, while it converges absolutely, and uniformly, at every point of formula_52 due to Weierstrass M-test applied with the hyper-harmonic convergent series formula_63.
# &quot;Convergent on the closure of the disc of convergence but not continuous sum&quot;: Sierpiński gave an example of a power series with radius of convergence formula_51, convergent at all points with formula_52, but the sum is an unbounded function and, in particular, discontinuous. A sufficient condition for one-sided continuity at a boundary point is given by Abel&#x27;s theorem.

== Formal power series ==

In abstract algebra, one attempts to capture the essence of power series without being restricted to the fields of real and complex numbers, and without the need to talk about convergence. This leads to the concept of formal power series, a concept of great utility in algebraic combinatorics.

== Power series in several variables ==
An extension of the theory is necessary for the purposes of multivariable calculus. A power series is here defined to be an infinite series of the form
formula_66
where is a vector of natural numbers, the coefficients are usually real or complex numbers, and the center and argument are usually real or complex vectors. The symbol formula_67 is the product symbol, denoting multiplication. In the more convenient multi-index notation this can be written
formula_68
where formula_69 is the set of natural numbers, and so formula_70 is the set of ordered &quot;n&quot;-tuples of natural numbers.

The theory of such series is trickier than for single-variable series, with more complicated regions of convergence. For instance, the power series formula_71 is absolutely convergent in the set formula_72 between two hyperbolas. (This is an example of a &quot;log-convex set&quot;, in the sense that the set of points formula_73, where formula_74 lies in the above region, is a convex set. More generally, one can show that when c=0, the interior of the region of absolute convergence is always a log-convex set in this sense.) On the other hand, in the interior of this region of convergence one may differentiate and integrate under the series sign, just as one may with ordinary power series.

== Order of a power series ==
Let be a multi-index for a power series . The order of the power series &quot;f&quot; is defined to be the least value formula_75 such that there is &quot;a&quot;&quot;α&quot; ≠ 0 with formula_76, or formula_77 if &quot;f&quot; ≡ 0. In particular, for a power series &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in a single variable &quot;x&quot;, the order of &quot;f&quot; is the smallest power of &quot;x&quot; with a nonzero coefficient. This definition readily extends to Laurent series.

== 7816-1: Cards with contacts — Physical characteristics ==

Created in 1987, updated in 1998, amended in 2003, updated in 2011.

This part describes the physical characteristics of the card, primarily by reference to ISO/IEC 7810 &quot;Identification cards — Physical characteristics&quot;, but also with other characteristics such as mechanical strength.

== 7816-2: Cards with contacts — Dimensions and location of the contacts==

Created in 1988, updated in 1999, amended in 2004, updated in 2007. The standard defines an eight (or six) pin interface; the first pin is located at the bottom-right corner for the image given. Pins 4 and 8 are occasionally omitted.
== 7816-3: Cards with contacts — Electrical interface and transmission protocols ==

Created in 1989, amended in 1992 (addition of the T=1 protocol), amended in 1994 (revision of Protocol Type Selection), updated in 1997 (including addition of 3 volt operation), amended in 2002 (including addition of 1.8 volt operation), last updated in 2006 (including removal of Vpp).

== 7816-4: Organization, security and commands for interchange ==

This part describes the smart card APDU protocol used by many smart card and contactless devices, like EMV payment cards, and forms the basis of CCID protocol for security token devices. Many devices operate within the proprietary part of the protocol, using the standardized part for establishing the initial communication before switching to application specific exchange of data.

Created in 1995, updated in 2005, 2013 and 2020. Amended in 2023.

According to its abstract, it specifies:
* contents of command-response pairs exchanged at the interface,
* means of retrieval of data elements and data objects in the card,
* structures and contents of historical bytes to describe operating characteristics of the card,
* structures for applications and data in the card, as seen at the interface when processing commands,
* access methods to files and data in the card,
* a security architecture defining access rights to files and data in the card,
* means and mechanisms for identifying and addressing applications in the card,
* methods for secure messaging,
* access methods to the algorithms processed by the card. It does not describe these algorithms.

It does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.

ISO/IEC 7816-4:2020 is independent of the physical interface technology, and applies equally to contact cards, proximity cards and vicinity cards.

== 7816-5: Registration of application providers ==

Created in 1995, updated in 2004. This part is maintained by Danish Standards.

According to its abstract, ISO/IEC 7816-5 defines how to use an application identifier to ascertain the presence of and/or perform the retrieval of an application in a card.

ISO/IEC 7816-5:2004 shows how to grant the uniqueness of application identifiers through the international registration of a part of this identifier, and defines
* the registration procedure,
* the authorities in charge thereof,
* the availability of the register which links the registered parts of the identifiers and the relevant application providers.

== 7816-6: Interindustry data elements for interchange ==

Created in 1996, updated in 2004, amended in 2006, updated in 2016 and 2023. This part is maintained by Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN).

According to its abstract, it specifies the Data Elements (DEs) used for interindustry interchange based on integrated circuit cards (ICCs) both with contacts and without contacts. It gives the identifier, name, description, format, coding and layout of each DE and defines the means of retrieval of DEs from the card.

== 7816-7: Interindustry commands for Structured Card Query Language (SCQL) ==

Created in 1999.

== 7816-8: Commands and mechanisms for security operations ==
Created in 1995, updated in 2004, 2016, 2019, and 2021.

According to its abstract, it specifies interindustry commands for integrated circuit cards (either with contacts or without contacts) that may be used for cryptographic operations. These commands are complementary to and based on the commands listed in ISO/IEC 7816-4.

Annexes are provided that give examples of operations related to digital signatures, certificates and the import and export of asymmetric keys.

The choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanisms may affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms and protocols is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 7816-8.

== 7816-9: Commands for card management ==

Created in 1995, updated in 2004, updated in 2017.

According to its abstract, it specifies interindustry commands for integrated circuit cards (both with contacts and without contacts) for card and file management, e.g. file creation and deletion. These commands cover the entire life cycle of the card and therefore some commands may be used before the card has been issued to the cardholder or after the card has expired.

An annex is provided that shows how to control the loading of data (secure download) into the card, by means of verifying the access rights of the loading entity and protection of the transmitted data with secure messaging. The loaded data may contain, for example, code, keys and applets.

== 7816-10: Electronic signals and answer to reset for synchronous cards ==

Created in 1999.

This part specifies the power, signal structures, and the structure for the answer to reset between an integrated circuit card(s) with synchronous transmission and an interface device such as a terminal.

== 7816-11 Personal verification through biometric methods ==

Created in 2004, updated in 2017.

This part of ISO/IEC 7816 specifies security-related interindustry commands to be used for personal verification through biometric methods in integrated circuit cards. It also defines the data structure and data access methods for use of the card as a carrier of the biometric reference and/or as the device to perform the verification of the cardholder’s biometric probe (on-card biometric comparison). Identification of persons using biometric methods is outside the scope of this standard.

== 7816-12 Cards with contacts — USB electrical interface and operating procedures ==

Created in 2005.

According to its abstract, it specifies the operating conditions of an integrated circuit card that provides a USB interface. An integrated circuit card with a USB interface is named USB-ICC.

ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 specifies:
* the electrical conditions when a USB-ICC is operated by an interface device – for those contact fields that are not used, when the USB interface is applied;
* the USB standard descriptors and the USB-ICC class specific descriptor;
* the data transfer between host and USB-ICC using bulk transfers or control transfers;
* the control transfers which allow two different protocols named version A and version B;
* the (optional) interrupt transfers to indicate asynchronous events;
* status and error conditions.

ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 provides two protocols for control transfers. This is to support the protocol T=0 (version A) or to use the transfer on APDU level (version B). ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 provides the state diagrams for the USB-ICC for each of the transfers (bulk transfers, control transfers version A and version B). Examples of possible sequences which the USB-ICC must be able to handle are given in an informative annex.

The USB CCID device class defines a standard for communicating with ISO/IEC 7816 smart cards over USB.

== 7816-13: Commands for application management in multi-application environment ==

This part specifies commands for application management in a multi-application environment.

== 7816-15: Cryptographic information application ==

Created in 2004, amended in 2004, 2007, 2008, updated in 2016.

According to its abstract, it specifies a card application. This application contains information on cryptographic functionality. Further, ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 defines a common syntax (in ASN.1) and format for the cryptographic information and mechanisms to share this information whenever appropriate.

ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 supports the following capabilities:

* storage of multiple instances of cryptographic information in a card;
* use of the cryptographic information;
* retrieval of the cryptographic information;
* cross-referencing of the cryptographic information with DOs defined in ISO/IEC 7816 when appropriate;
* different authentication mechanisms; and
* multiple cryptographic algorithms.
