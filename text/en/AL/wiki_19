<text>The Sea of Japan is the marginal sea between the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin, the Korean Peninsula, and the mainland of the Russian Far East. The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean. Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean. This isolation also affects faunal diversity and salinity, both of which are lower than in the open ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and the Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.

The seawater has an elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen that results in high biological productivity. Therefore, fishing is the dominant economic activity in the region. The intensity of shipments across the sea has been moderate owing to political issues, but it is steadily increasing as a result of the growth of East Asian economies.

==Names==
&quot;Sea of Japan&quot; is the dominant term used in English for the sea, and the name in most European languages is equivalent, but it is sometimes called by different names in surrounding countries.

The sea is called (, literally &#x27;Japan Sea&#x27;) in Japan, (, &#x27;Japan Sea&#x27;) or originally (, &#x27;Whale Sea&#x27;) in China, (, &#x27;Japanese Sea&#x27;) in Russia, (, literally &#x27;Korean East Sea&#x27;) in North Korea, and (, literally &#x27;East Sea&#x27;) in South Korea.

===Naming dispute===
The use of the term &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; as the dominant name is a point of contention. South Korea wants the name &quot;East Sea&quot; to be used, either instead of or in addition to &quot;Sea of Japan;&quot; while North Korea prefers the name &quot;East Sea of Korea&quot;.

The primary issue in the dispute revolves around a disagreement about when the name &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; became the international standard. Japan claims the term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century, while the Koreas claim that the term &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; arose later while Korea was under Japanese rule, and before that occupation, other names such as &quot;Sea of Korea&quot; or &quot;East Sea&quot; were used in English. In 2012, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the intergovernmental organization that maintains a publication listing the limits of ocean and sea areas around the world, abandoned its most recent of several attempts in the last 25 years to revise its publication of the sea&#x27;s name. This was primarily because of the lack of agreement between the Koreas and Japan over the naming issue. In September 2020, the IHO announced that it would adopt a new numerical system, also known as &quot;S-130&quot;. In November 2020, S-23, the previous version of the nautical chart made in 1953 will be made public as an IHO publication to demonstrate the evolutionary process from the analogue to the digital era. The IHO approved the proposal of the new official nautical chart. The new chart will be marked with a numerical identifier without a name.

==History==
For centuries, the sea had protected Japan from land invasions, particularly by the Mongols. It had long been navigated by Asian and, from the 18th century, by European ships. Russian expeditions of 1733–1743 mapped Sakhalin and the Japanese islands. In the 1780s, the Frenchman Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, traveled northward across the sea through the strait later named after him. In 1796, a British naval officer, William Robert Broughton, explored the Strait of Tartary, the eastern coast of the Russian Far East and the Korean Peninsula.

In 1803–1806, the Russian navigator Adam Johann von Krusenstern while sailing across the globe in the ship &quot;Nadezhda&quot; also explored, in passing, the Sea of Japan and the eastern shores of Japanese islands. In 1849, another Russian explorer Gennady Nevelskoy discovered the strait between the continent and Sakhalin and mapped the northern part of the Strait of Tartary. Russian expeditions were made in 1853–1854 and 1886–1889 to measure the surface temperatures and record the tides. They also documented the cyclonal character of the sea currents.

Other notable expeditions of the 19th century include the American North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853–1856) and British Challenger expedition (1872–1876). The aquatic life was described by V. K. Brazhnikov in 1899–1902 and P. Yu. Schmidt in 1903–1904. The Japanese scientific studies of the sea began only in 1915 and became systematic since the 1920s.

American, Canadian and French whaleships cruised for whales in the sea between 1847 and 1892. Most entered the sea via Korea Strait and left via La Pérouse Strait, but some entered and exited via Tsugaru Strait. They primarily targeted right whales, but began catching humpbacks as right whale catches declined. They also made attempts to catch blue and fin whales, but these species invariably sank after being killed. Right whales were caught from March to September, with peak catches in May and June. During the peak years of 1848 and 1849 a total of over 170 vessels (over 60 in 1848, and over 110 in 1849) cruised in the Sea of Japan, with significantly lesser numbers in following years.

==Geography and geology==


The Sea of Japan was landlocked when the land bridge of East Asia existed. The Japan Arc started to form in the Early Miocene. In the Early Miocene the Japan Sea started to open, and the northern and southern parts of the Japanese archipelago separated from each other. During the Miocene, the Sea of Japan expanded.

The north part of the Japanese archipelago was further fragmented later until orogenesis of the north-eastern Japanese archipelago began in the later Late Miocene. The south part of the Japanese archipelago remained as a relatively large landmass. The land area had expanded northward in the Late Miocene. The orogenesis of high mountain ranges in north-eastern Japan started in Late Miocene and lasted in Pliocene also. The eastern margin of the sea may host an incipient subduction zone responsible for large earthquakes in 1940, 1964, 1983 and 1993.

Nowadays the Sea of Japan is bounded by the Russian mainland and Sakhalin island to the north, the Korean Peninsula to the west, and the Japanese islands of Hokkaidō, Honshū and Kyūshū to the east and south. It is connected to other seas by five straits: the Strait of Tartary between the Asian mainland and Sakhalin; La Pérouse Strait between Sakhalin and Hokkaidō; the Tsugaru Strait between Hokkaidō and Honshū; the Kanmon Straits between Honshū and Kyūshū; and the Korea Strait between the Korean Peninsula and Kyūshū.

The Korea Strait is composed of the Western Channel and the Tsushima Strait, on either side of Tsushima Island. The straits were formed in recent geologic periods. The oldest of them are the Tsugaru and Tsushima straits. Their formation had interrupted the migration of elephants into the Japanese islands at the end of the Neogene Period (about 2.6 million years ago). The most recent is La Perouse Strait, which formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago closing the path used by mammoths which had earlier moved to northern Hokkaidō. All the straits are rather shallow, with a minimal depth of the order of 100 meters or less. This hinders water exchange, thereby isolating the water and aquatic life of the Sea of Japan from the neighboring seas and oceans.

The sea has a surface area of about , a mean depth of and a maximum depth of . It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from south-west to north-east and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about with the largest part () belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than and has a maximum width of about .

It has three major basins: the &quot;Yamato Basin&quot; in the south-east, the &quot;Japan Basin&quot; in the north and the &quot;Tsushima Basin (Ulleung Basin)&quot; in the south-west. The Japan Basin is of oceanic origin and is the deepest part of the sea, whereas the Tsushima Basin is the shallowest with the depths below . On the eastern shores, the continental shelves of the sea are wide, but on the western shores, particularly along the Korean coast, they are narrow, averaging about .

There are three distinct continental shelves in the northern part (above 44° N). They form a staircase-like structure with the steps slightly inclined southwards and submerged to the depths of , and . The last step sharply drops to the depths of about toward the central (deepest) part of the sea. The bottom of this part is relatively flat, but has a few plateaus. In addition, an underwater ridge rising up to runs from north to south through the middle of the central part.

The Japanese coastal area of the sea consists of Okujiri Ridge, Sado Ridge, Hakusan Banks, Wakasa Ridge and Oki Ridge. Yamato Ridge is of continental origin and is composed of granite, rhyolite, andesite and basalt. It has an uneven bottom covered with boulders of volcanic rock. Most other areas of the sea are of oceanic origin. Seabed down to is of continental nature and is covered with a mixture of mud, sand, gravel and fragments of rock. The depths between are covered in hemipelagic sediments (i.e., of semi-oceanic origin); these sediments are composed of blue mud rich in organic matter. Pelagic sediments of red mud dominate the deeper regions.

There are no large islands in the sea. Most of the smaller ones are near the eastern coast, except for Ulleungdo (South Korea). The most significant islands are Moneron, Rebun, Rishiri, Okushiri, Ōshima, Sado, Okinoshima, Ulleungdo, Askold, Russky and Putyatin. The shorelines are relatively straight and lack large bays and capes; the coastal shapes are simplest in Sakhalin and are more winding in the Japanese islands.

The largest bays are Peter the Great Gulf, Sovetskaya Gavan; Vladimira Bay, Olga; Posyet Bay in Russia; East Korea Bay in North Korea; and Ishikari (Hokkaidō), Toyama (Honshū), and Wakasa (Honshū) Bays in Japan. Prominent capes include Lazareva, Peschanyi (sandy), Povorotny, Gromova, Pogibi, Tyk, and Korsakova in Russia; Crillon on Sakhalin; Sōya, Nosappu, Tappi, Nyuda, Rebun, Rishiri, Okushiri, Daso and Oki in Japan; and Musu Dan in North Korea.

As world sea level dropped during the ice cap advances of the last Ice Age, the exit straits of the Sea of Japan one by one dried and closed. There is controversy as to whether or not in each ice cap advance the world sea level fell low enough for the deepest, the western channel of the Korea Strait, to dry and close, turning the Sea of Japan into a huge cold inland lake with a surface layer of fresh water, freezing over in the winters.

==Climate==
The sea climate has warm waters and monsoons. This combination results in strong evaporation, which is especially noticeable between October and March when the strong ( or higher) north-western monsoon wind brings cold and dry continental air. The evaporation is blown further south, causing snowfall in the mountainous western coasts of Japan. This winter monsoon brings typhoons and storms, with the waves reaching which erode the western coasts of Japan. Tsunami waves have also been recorded in the sea. In addition, the monsoon enhances the surface water convection, down to the depths of .

The coldest months are January and February, with an average air temperature of in the north and in the south. The northern one-quarter of the sea, particularly the Siberian coast and the Strait of Tartary, freezes for about 4−5 months. The timing and extent of freezing vary from year to year, so ice may start forming in the bays as early as October and its remains may be seen even in June. Ice cover is continuous only in the bays and forms floating patches in the open sea. Ice melting in spring results in cold currents in the northern areas.

In summer the wind weakens to and reverses its direction, blowing warm and humid air from the North Pacific onto the Asian mainland. The warmest month is August, with an average air temperature of in the north and in the south. Annual precipitation increases from in the north-west to in the south-east.

A peculiar turbulent cloud pattern, named von Kármán vortices, is sometimes observed over the Sea of Japan. It requires a stable field of low clouds driven by the wind over a small (isolated) and tall obstacle, and usually forms over small mountainous islands. The Sea of Japan meets these conditions as it has frequent winds and cloudy skies, as well as compact, tall islands such as Rishiri (), Ulleungdo () and Ōshima ().

==Extent==

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the &quot;Japan Sea&quot; as follows:

==Hydrology==
The sea currents circulate in the counterclockwise direction. The Kuroshio (Japan Current), the Tsushima Current and the East Korea Warm Current bring warmer and more saline water to the north. There they merge into the Tsugaru Current and flow into the Pacific Ocean through the Tsugaru Strait. They also feed the Sōya Current and exit through the La Perouse Strait to the Sea of Okhotsk. The returning branch is composed of the Liman, North Korea and Central (or Mid-) Japan Sea currents which bring fresh and cold water along the Asian coast to the south.

Water temperature is mostly affected by exchange with the atmosphere in the northern part of the sea and by the currents in the southern part. Winter temperatures are or below in the north and in the south. In this season, there is a significant temperature difference between the western and eastern parts owing to the circular currents. So at the latitude of Peter the Great Gulf, the water temperature is about in the west and in the east. This east-west difference drops to in summer, and the temperatures rise to in the north and in the south.

Because the sea is enclosed, its waters form clearly separated layers which may show seasonal and spatial dependence. In winter, the temperature is almost constant with the depth in the northern part of the sea. However, in central-southern parts, it may be down to , at , at and then remain at about until the bottom. Heating by the sun and tropical monsoons increases the depth gradient in spring–summer.

In the north the surface layer (down to ) may heat up to . The temperature would drop sharply to at , then slowly decrease to at and remain so down to the seabed. On the contrary, the temperature in the south could gradually decrease to at , then to at and to at , but then it would rise to about near the bottom. This cold layer at about is formed by sinking of cold water in the northern part of the sea in winter and is brought south by the sea currents; it is rather stable and is observed all through the year.

The hydrological isolation of the Sea of Japan also results in slightly lower average water salinity (34.09‰, where ‰ means parts per thousand) compared with the Pacific Ocean. In winter, the highest salinity at 34.5‰ is observed in the south where evaporation dominates over precipitation. It is the lowest at 33.8‰ in the south-east and south-west because of frequent rains, and remains at about 34.09‰ in most other parts.

Thawing of ice in spring reduces water salinity in the north, but it remains high at 34.60–34.70‰ in the south, partly because of the inflow of salty water through the Korea Strait. A typical variation of salinity across the sea in summer is 31.5‰ to 34.5‰ from north to south. The depth distribution of salinity is relatively constant. The surface layer tends to be more fresh in the sea parts which experience ice melting and rains. The average water density is 1.0270 g/cm3 in the north and 1.0255 g/cm3 in the south in winter. It lowers in summer to 1.0253 and 1.0215 g/cm3, respectively.


Few rivers flow into the Sea of Japan from mainland Asia, the largest being Tumen, Rudnaya, Samarga, Partizanskaya and Tumnin; all of them have a mountainous character. In contrast, numerous large rivers flow from Honshū and Hokkaidō into the sea, including Japan&#x27;s four largest rivers: the Shinano, Ishikari, Agano and Mogami. The total annual river discharge into the sea is and is relatively constant through the year, except for a minor increase in July. Most water (97% or ) flows into the sea through the Korea Strait and discharges through the Tsugaru (64% or , La Pérouse ) and Korea straits. Rainfall, evaporation and riverine inflow make only 1% of the water balance. Between October and April, the outflow exceeds the inflow due to the lower income through the Korea Strait; this balance reverses between May and September.

The sea has complex tides, which are induced by the tidal wave of the Pacific Ocean penetrating through the Korea Strait and Tsugaru strait. The tides are semi-diurnal (rise twice a day) in the Korea Strait and in the northern part of the Strait of Tartary. They are diurnal at the eastern shore of Korea, Russian Far East and the Japanese islands of Honshū and Hokkaidō. Mixed tides occur in Peter the Great Gulf and Korea strait. The tidal waves have a speed of in the open sea. They accelerate in the Korea Strait (), La Pérouse Strait () and especially in the Tsugaru Strait ().

The amplitude of the tides is relatively low and varies strongly across the sea. It reaches 3 meters in the south near the Korea Strait, but quickly drops northwards to at the southern tip of Korean Peninsula and to at the North Korean shores. Similar low tides are observed in Hokkaidō, Honshū and south Sakhalin. The amplitude however increases to toward the north of the Strait of Tartary due to its funnel-like shape. Apart from tides, the water level also displays seasonal, monsoon-related variations across the entire sea with the highest levels observed in summer and lowest in winter. Wind may also locally change the water level by ; for example, it is higher in summer at the Korean and lower at the Japanese coasts.

The sea waters have blue to green-blue color and a transparency of about . They are rich in dissolved oxygen, especially in the western and northern parts, which are colder and have more phytoplankton than the eastern and southern areas. The oxygen concentration is 95% of the saturation point near the surface; it decreases with the depth to about 70% at .

==Flora and fauna==

The high concentration of dissolved oxygen results in the rich aquatic life of the Sea of Japan – there are more than 800 species of aquatic plants and more than 3,500 animal species, including more than 900 species of crustaceans, about 1,000 of fish and 26 of mammals. The coastal areas contain several kg/m2 of biomass. Pelagic (oceanic) fishes include saury, mackerel, Jack mackerels, sardines, anchovies, herring, sea bream, squid and various species of salmon and trout. The demersal (sea-bottom) fishes include cod, pollock and Atka mackerel.

Mammals are represented by seals and whales (ancient name for the basin in Chinese was &quot;Sea of Whales&quot;), and the crustaceans by shrimps and crabs. Because of the shallow straits connecting the sea with Pacific Ocean, the Sea of Japan has no characteristic oceanic deep-water fauna. Flora and fauna unique to the region near the Sea of Japan are known as &quot;Japan Sea elements&quot;.

==Economy==

Fishery had long been the main economic activity on the Sea of Japan. It is mainly carried out on and near the continental shelves and focuses on herring, sardines and bluefin tuna. These species are however depleted from after World War II. Squid is mostly caught near the sea center and salmon near the northern and south-western shores. There is also a well-developed seaweed production.

The importance of the fishery in the sea is illustrated by the territorial disputes between Japan and South Korea over Liancourt Rocks and between Japan and Russia over the Kuril Islands. It is also reflected in various legends, such as the legend of the Heishi rock, which says that once when herring vanished, an old fairy threw a bottle with magic water into the sea, and the herring returned. The bottle got stuck to the seabed and turned into a rock, which became a representation of the God of the Sea of Japan.

Vladivostok is a base for the Russian whaling fleet. Although it operates in the northern seas, its production is processed and partly distributed in the Vladivostok area. Vladivostok is also a terminal point of the Trans-Siberian Railway which brings many goods to and from this major port. There is a regular ferry service across the Strait of Tartary between the Russian continental port of Vanino and Kholmsk in Sakhalin.

The sea has magnetite sands as well as natural gas and petroleum fields near the northern part of Japan and Sakhalin Island. The intensity of shipments across the sea is moderate, owing to the cold relations between many bordering countries. As a result, the largest Japanese ports are on the Pacific coast, and the significant ports on the Sea of Japan are Niigata, Tsuruta and Maizuru. Major South Korean ports are Busan, Ulsan, and Pohang situated on the south-eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, but they also mainly target countries not bordering the Sea of Japan.

The major Russian port of Vladivostok mainly serves inland cargos, whereas Nakhodka and Vostochny are more international and have a busy exchange with Japan and South Korea. Other prominent Russian ports are Sovetskaya Gavan, Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky and Kholmsk, and the major ports of North Korea are Wonsan, Hamhung and Chongjin. The intensity of shipments across the Sea of Japan is steadily increasing as a result of the growth of East Asian economies.

<text>The comma  is a punctuation mark that appears in several variants in different languages. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight, but inclined from the vertical; others give it the appearance of a miniature filled-in figure placed on the baseline. In many typefaces it is the same shape as an apostrophe or single closing quotation mark .

The comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly to separate parts of a sentence such as clauses, and items in lists mainly when there are three or more items listed. The word &quot;comma&quot; comes from the Greek (), which originally meant a cut-off piece, specifically in grammar, a short clause.

A comma-shaped mark is used as a diacritic in several writing systems and is considered distinct from the cedilla. In Byzantine and modern copies of Ancient Greek, the &quot;rough&quot; and &quot;smooth breathings&quot; () appear above the letter. In Latvian, Romanian, and Livonian, the comma diacritic appears below the letter, as in .

In spoken language, a common rule of thumb is that the function of a comma is generally performed by a pause.

&quot;In this article,&quot; &quot;denotes a grapheme (writing) and&quot; /x/ &quot;denotes a phoneme (sound).&quot;
==History==

The development of punctuation is much more recent than the alphabet.

In the 3rd century BC, Aristophanes of Byzantium invented a system of single dots () at varying levels, which separated verses and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when reading aloud. The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line. For a short passage, a in the form of a dot was placed mid-level. This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.

The mark used today is descended from a , a diagonal slash known as , used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by Aldus Manutius.

==Uses in English==
In general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked grammatically to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in English writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage – and their rigidity – vary from language to language.

===List separator and the serial (Oxford) comma ===

Commas are placed between items in lists, as in &quot;They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice.&quot;

Whether the final conjunction, most frequently &quot;and&quot;, should be preceded by a comma, called the &quot;serial comma&quot;, is one of the most disputed linguistic or stylistic questions in English:

*They served apples, peaches, and bananas. (serial comma used)
*They served apples, peaches and bananas. (serial comma omitted)

The serial comma is used much more often, usually routinely, in the United States. A majority of American style guides mandate its use, including &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, Strunk and White&#x27;s classic &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; and the U.S. Government Publishing Office&#x27;s &quot;Style Manual&quot;. Conversely, the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; for journalistic writing advises against it.

The serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. Although less common in British English, its usage occurs within both American and British English. It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.

According to &quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot;, &quot;house style will dictate&quot; whether to use the serial comma. &quot;The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently.&quot; No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press. Its use is preferred by Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;. It is recommended by the United States Government Printing Office, Harvard University Press, and the classic &quot;Elements of Style&quot; of Strunk and White.

Use of a comma may prevent ambiguity:

* The sentence &quot;I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom&quot; could mean either &quot;I spoke to the boys and Sam and Tom&quot; (I spoke to more than three people) or &quot;I spoke to the boys, who are Sam and Tom&quot; (I spoke to two people);
* &quot;I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom&quot; – must be &quot;the boys and Sam and Tom&quot; (I spoke to more than three people).

The serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:
*&quot;I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas.&quot; This could mean either &quot;my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas&quot; (three people) or &quot;my mother, who is Anne Smith; and Thomas&quot; (two people). This sentence might be recast as &quot;my mother (Anne Smith) and Thomas&quot; for clarity.
* &quot;I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas.&quot; Because the comma after &quot;mother&quot; is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an appositive phrase – that is, a renaming of or further information about a noun – this construction formally suggests that my mother&#x27;s name is &quot;Anne Smith and Thomas&quot;. Because that is implausible, it is relatively clear that the construction refers to two separate people. Compare &quot;I thank my friend, Smith and Wesson&quot;, in which the ambiguity is obvious to those who recognise Smith and Wesson as a business name.

As a rule of thumb, &quot;The Guardian Style Guide&quot; suggests that straightforward lists (&quot;he ate ham, eggs and chips&quot;) do not need a comma before the final &quot;and&quot;, but sometimes it can help the reader (&quot;he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea&quot;). &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and other academic writing guides require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the &quot;and&quot; prefacing the last item in a series .

If the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, semicolons may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a colon.

In news headlines, a comma might replace the word &quot;and&quot;, even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:
* &quot;Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy.&quot;

===Separation of clauses===
Commas are often used to separate clauses. In English, a comma is often used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: &quot;After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.&quot; (Compare this with &quot;I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.&quot;) A relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in &quot;I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.&quot; (Without the comma, this would mean that only the trees more than six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (&quot;for&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;nor&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, &quot;so&quot;) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction. In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:
* &quot;Mary walked to the party, but she was unable to walk home.&quot;
* &quot;Designer clothes are silly, and I can&#x27;t afford them anyway.&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t push that button, or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!&quot;
In the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is a dependent clause (because it does not contain an explicit subject), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:
* &quot;Mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home.&quot;
* &quot;I think designer clothes are silly and can&#x27;t afford them anyway.&quot;
However, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an imperative, as in:
* &quot;Sit down and shut up.&quot;
The above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. Long coordinate clauses, particularly when separated by &quot;but&quot;, are often separated by commas:
* &quot;She had very little to live on, but would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers.&quot;

In some languages, such as German and Polish, stricter rules apply on comma use between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.

The joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in &quot;It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.&quot;) is known as a &quot;comma splice&quot; and is sometimes considered an error in English; in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with the literary device called &quot;asyndeton&quot;, in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted for a specific stylistic effect.

A much debated comma is the one in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which says &quot;A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; but ratified by several states as &quot;A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.&quot; which has caused much debate on its interpretation.

===Certain adverbs===
Commas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence, including &quot;however&quot;, &quot;in fact&quot;, &quot;therefore&quot;, &quot;nevertheless&quot;, &quot;moreover&quot;, &quot;furthermore&quot;, and &quot;still&quot;.

* &quot;Therefore, a comma would be appropriate in this sentence.&quot;
* &quot;Nevertheless, I will not use one.&quot;

If these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two examples below, if a semicolon separates the two sentences and the second sentence starts with an adverb, this adverb is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.

* &quot;In this sentence, furthermore, commas would also be called for.&quot;
* &quot;This sentence is a bit different; however, a comma is necessary as well.&quot;

Using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including &quot;then&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, &quot;instead&quot;, and &quot;too&quot; (meaning &quot;also&quot;).

* &quot;So, that&#x27;s it for this rule.&quot; or
* &quot;So that&#x27;s it for this rule.&quot;
* &quot;A comma would be appropriate in this sentence, too.&quot; or
* &quot;A comma would be appropriate in this sentence too.&quot;

=== Parenthetical phrases ===

Commas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: &quot;Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.&quot;
*Interjection: &quot;My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!&quot;
*Aside: &quot;My father, if you don&#x27;t mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.&quot;
*Appositive: &quot;My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.&quot;
*Absolute phrase: &quot;My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.&quot;
*Free modifier: &quot;My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.&quot;
*Resumptive modifier: &quot;My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.&quot;
*Summative modifier: &quot;My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.&quot;

The parenthesization of phrases may change the connotation, reducing or eliminating
ambiguity. In the following example, the thing in the first sentence that
is relaxing is the cool day, whereas in the second sentence, it is the walk since the introduction of commas makes &quot;on a cool day&quot; parenthetical:

:&quot;They took a walk on a cool day that was relaxing.&quot;

:&quot;They took a walk, on a cool day, that was relaxing.&quot;

As more phrases are introduced, ambiguity accumulates, but when commas separate
each phrase, the phrases clearly become modifiers of just one thing. In the
second sentence below, that thing is &quot;the walk&quot;:

:&quot;They took a walk in the park on a cool day that was relaxing.&quot;

:&quot;They took a walk, in the park, on a cool day, that was relaxing.&quot;

===Between adjectives===
A comma is used to separate &quot;coordinate adjectives&quot; (i.e., adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if &quot;and&quot; were placed between them. For example:
*&quot;The dull, incessant droning&quot; but &quot;the cute little cottage.&quot;
*&quot;The devious lazy red frog&quot; suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious), while &quot;the devious, lazy red frog&quot; does not carry this connotation.

===Before quotations===
Some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in &quot;Mr. Kershner says, &quot;You should know how to use a comma.&quot;&quot; Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a comma.

Other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus, they would write &quot;Mr. Kershner says &quot;You should know how to use a comma.&quot;&quot;

===In dates===

====Month day, year====
When a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English. The comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: December 19 1941.
Most style manuals, including &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;
and the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;,
also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after it: &quot;Feb. 14, 1987, was the target date.&quot;

If just the month and year are given, no commas are used: &quot;Her daughter may return in June 2009 for the reunion.&quot;

====Day month year====
When the day precedes the month, the month name separates the numeric day and year, so commas are not necessary to separate them: &quot;The Raid on Alexandria was carried out on 19 December 1941.&quot;

===In geographical names===
Commas are used to separate parts of geographical references, such as city and state (&quot;Dallas, Texas&quot;) or city and country (&quot;Kampala, Uganda&quot;). Additionally, most style manuals, including &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;
and the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;,
recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: &quot;The plane landed in Kampala, Uganda, that evening.&quot;

The United States Postal Service and Royal Mail recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder optical character recognition. Canada Post has similar guidelines, only making very limited use of hyphens.

=== In mathematics ===
Similar to the case in natural languages, commas are often used to delineate the boundary between multiple mathematical objects in a list (e.g., formula_1). Commas are also used to indicate the comma derivative of a tensor.

===In numbers===

In representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, English texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal. This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits, and often for four or five digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, periods or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in English of the decimal point. In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group, which is of three digits. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the SI writing style); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.

===In names===
Commas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: &quot;Smith, John&quot;. They are also used before many titles that follow a name: &quot;John Smith, Ph.D.&quot;

It can also be used in regnal names followed by their occupation: &quot;Louis XIII, king of France and Navarre&quot;.

Similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: &quot;socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1&quot;.

===Ellipsis===
Commas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted, as in &quot;The cat was white; the dog, brown.&quot; (Here the comma replaces &quot;was&quot;.)

===Vocative===
Commas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place, or thing:
*&quot;I hope, John, that you will read this.&quot;

===Between the subject and predicate===
In his 1785 essay &quot;An Essay on Punctuation&quot;, Joseph Robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.
*&quot;The good taste of the present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English language.&quot;
*&quot;Whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit, is an enemy to society.&quot;

===Differences between American and British usage in placement of commas and quotation marks===

The comma and the quotation mark can be paired in several ways.

In Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:
* My mother gave me the nickname &quot;Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy&quot;, which really made me angry.

In American English, the comma was commonly included inside a quotation mark:
* My mother gave me the nickname &quot;Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy,&quot; which really made me angry.

During the Second World War, the British carried the comma over into abbreviations. Specifically, &quot;Special Operations, Executive&quot; was written &quot;S.O.,E.&quot;. Nowadays, even the full stops are frequently discarded in British usage.

==Languages other than English==

=== Western Europe ===
Western European languages like German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese use the same comma as English, with similar spacing, though usage may be somewhat different. For instance, in Standard German, subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas.

===Comma variants===

The basic comma is defined in Unicode as , and many variants by typography or language are also defined.
:

Some languages use a completely different sort of character for the purpose of the comma.

There are also a number of comma-like diacritics with &quot;&quot; in their Unicode names that are not intended for use as punctuation. A comma-like low quotation mark is also available (shown below; corresponding sets of raised single quotation marks and double-quotation marks are not shown).

There are various other Unicode characters that include commas or comma-like figures with other characters or marks, that are not shown in these tables.

=== Greece ===
=== East Asia ===
 () is used in Chinese, Japanese punctuation, and somewhat in Korean punctuation. In China and Korea, this comma () is usually only used to separate items in lists, while it is the more common form of comma in Japan (, ).

In documents that mix Japanese and Latin scripts, the full-width comma () is used; this is the standard form of comma () in China. Since East Asian typography permits commas to join dependent clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought, commas may be used in ways that would be considered comma splices in English.

Korean punctuation uses both commas and interpuncts for lists.

In Unicode 5.2.0, &quot;numbers with commas&quot; ( through ) were added to the Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement block for compatibility with the ARIB STD B24 character set.

=== West Asia ===
Hebrew script is also written from right to left. However, Hebrew punctuation includes only a regular comma .

=== South Asia ===
Dravidian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of European languages with similar spacing.

==Computing==
In the common character encoding systems Unicode and ASCII, character 44 (0x2C) corresponds to the comma symbol. The HTML numeric character reference is codice_1.

In many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a function, to separate elements in a list, and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once.

In the C programming language the comma symbol is an operator which evaluates its first argument (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument. This is useful in &quot;for&quot; statements and macros.

In Smalltalk and APL, the comma operator is used to concatenate collections, including strings. In APL, it is also used monadically to rearrange the items of an array into a list.

In Prolog, the comma is used to denote Logical Conjunction (&quot;and&quot;).

The comma-separated values (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.

==Diacritical usage==

The comma is used as a diacritic mark in Romanian under (, ), and under (, ). A cedilla is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol (&#x27;d with comma below&#x27;) was used as part of the Romanian transitional alphabet (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter or letters , where derived from a Cyrillic ѕ (, ). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of (a small cursive ) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, , , and could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for /sz/, /tz/, and /dz/ respectively.

In Latvian, the comma is used on the letters , , , , and historically also , to indicate palatalization. Because the lowercase letter has a descender, the comma is rotated 180° and placed over the letter. Although their Adobe glyph names are &#x27;letter with comma&#x27;, their names in the Unicode Standard are &#x27;letter with a cedilla&#x27;. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992 and, per Unicode Consortium policy, their names cannot be altered. In the late 1920s and 1930s, the Latgalian orthography used in Siberia used additional letters with comma , , , , , , , 

In Livonian, whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and Estonian alphabets, the comma is used on the letters , , , , to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses and to represent the same palatal plosive phonemes which Latvian writes as and respectively.

In Czech and Slovak, the diacritic in the characters , , and resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a caron because the letter has an ascender. Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters (used in Finnish Romani and Lakota) and (used in Skolt Sami), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.

In 16th-century Guatemala, the archaic letter cuatrillo with a comma ( and ) was used to write Mayan languages.

<text>The apostrophe (, ) is a punctuation mark, and sometimes a diacritical mark, in languages that use the Latin alphabet and some other alphabets. In English, the apostrophe is used for three basic purposes:
* The marking of the omission of one or more letters, e.g. the contraction of &quot;do not&quot; to &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;
* The marking of possessive case of nouns (as in &quot;the eagle&#x27;s feathers&quot;, &quot;in one month&#x27;s time&quot;, &quot;the twins&#x27; coats&quot;)
* Use as a single quotation mark
It is also used in a few distinctive cases for the marking of plurals, e.g. &quot;p&#x27;s and q&#x27;s&quot; or Oakland A&#x27;s.

It is also used informally to indicate the units of foot and minutes of arc, although in these uses, the prime symbol is generally preferred.

The word &quot;apostrophe&quot; comes from the Greek (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], &#x27;[the accent of] turning away or elision&#x27;), through Latin and French.

==Usage in English==
===Historical development===
The apostrophe was first used by Pietro Bembo in his edition of &quot;De Aetna&quot; (1496). It was introduced into English in the 16th century in imitation of French practice.

====French practice==== 
Introduced by Geoffroy Tory (1529), the apostrophe was used in place of a vowel letter to indicate elision (as in in place of ). It was also frequently used in place of a final &quot;e&quot; (which was still pronounced at the time) when it was elided before a vowel, as in . Modern French orthography has restored the spelling .

====Early English practice====
From the 16th century, following French practice, the apostrophe was used when a vowel letter was omitted either because of incidental elision (&quot;I&#x27;m&quot; for &quot;I am&quot;) or because the letter no longer represented a sound (&quot;lov&#x27;d&quot; for &quot;loved&quot;). English spelling retained many inflections that were not pronounced as syllables, notably verb endings (&quot;-est&quot;, &quot;-eth&quot;, &quot;-es&quot;, &quot;-ed&quot;) and the noun ending &quot;-es&quot;, which marked either plurals or possessives, also known as genitives . An apostrophe followed by &quot;s&quot; was often used to mark a plural; specifically, the &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; notes that:

====Standardisation====
The use of elision has continued to the present day, but significant changes have been made to the possessive and plural uses. By the 18th century, an apostrophe with the addition of an &quot;s&quot; was regularly used for all possessive singular forms, even when the letter &quot;e&quot; was not omitted (as in &quot;the gate&#x27;s height&quot;). This was regarded as representing not the elision of the &quot;e&quot; in the &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; ending of the word being pluralized, but the elision of the &quot;e&quot; from the Old English genitive singular inflection &quot;-es&quot;.

The plural genitive did not use the &quot;-es&quot; inflection, and since many plural forms already consisted of the &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; ending, using the apostrophe in place of the elisioned &quot;e&quot; could lead to singular and plural possessives of a given word having the exact same spelling. The solution was to use an apostrophe after the plural &quot;s&quot; (as in &quot;girls&#x27; dresses&quot;). However, this was not universally accepted until the mid-19th century. Plurals not ending in -s keep the -&#x27;s marker, such as &quot;children&#x27;s toys, the men&#x27;s toilet&quot;, since there was no risk of ambiguity.

===Possessive apostrophe===
The apostrophe is used in English to indicate what is, for historical reasons, misleadingly called the possessive case in the English language. This case was called the genitive until the 18th century and, like the genitive case in other languages, expresses relationships other than possession. For example, in the expressions &quot;the school&#x27;s headmaster&quot;, &quot;the men&#x27;s department&quot;, and &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s weather&quot;, the school does not own/possess the headmaster, men do not own/possess the department, and tomorrow does not/will not own the weather. In the words of Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage:

This dictionary also cites a study that found that only 40% of the possessive forms were used to indicate actual possession.

The modern spelling convention distinguishes possessive singular forms (&quot;Bernadette&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;flower&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;glass&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;) from simple plural forms (&quot;Bernadettes&quot;, &quot;flowers&quot;, &quot;glasses&quot;, &quot;ones&quot;), and both of those from possessive plural forms (&quot;Bernadettes, &quot;flowers, &quot;glasses, &quot;ones). For example, the word &quot;glass&#x27;s&quot; is the singular possessive form of the noun &quot;glass&quot;. The plural form of &quot;glass&quot; is &quot;glasses&quot; and the plural possessive form is, therefore, &quot;glasses. One would therefore say &quot;I drank the glass&#x27;s contents&quot; to indicate drinking from one glass, but &quot;I drank the glasses&#x27; contents&quot; after also drinking from another glass.

For singular forms, the modern possessive or genitive inflection is a survival from certain genitive inflections in Old English, for which the apostrophe originally marked the loss of the old &quot;e&quot; (for example, became ). Its use for indicating plural &quot;possessive&quot; forms was not standard before the middle of the 19th century.

====General principles for the possessive apostrophe====
===== Summary of rules for most situations =====
* Possessive personal pronouns, serving as either noun-equivalents or adjective-equivalents, do not use an apostrophe, even when they end in &quot;s&quot;. The complete list of those ending in the letter &quot;s&quot; or the corresponding sound or but not taking an apostrophe is &quot;ours&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;hers&quot;, &quot;its&quot;, &quot;theirs&quot;, and &quot;whose&quot;.
* Other pronouns, singular nouns not ending in &quot;s&quot;, and plural nouns not ending in &quot;s&quot; all take s&quot; in the possessive: e.g., &quot;someone&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;a cat&#x27;s toys&quot;, &quot;women&#x27;s&quot;.
* Plural nouns already ending in &quot;s&quot; take only an apostrophe after the pre-existing &quot;s&quot; to form the possessive: e.g., &quot;three cats&#x27; toys&quot;.

===== Basic rule (singular nouns) =====

For most singular nouns the ending s&quot; is added; e.g., &quot;the cat&#x27;s whiskers&quot;.
*If a singular noun ends with an &quot;s&quot;-sound (spelled with &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-se&quot;, for example), practice varies as to whether to add s&quot; or the apostrophe alone. In many cases, both spoken and written forms differ between writers (see details below).
* Acronyms and initialisms used as nouns (CD, DVD, NATO, RADAR, etc.) follow the same rules as singular nouns: e.g., &quot;the TV&#x27;s picture quality&quot;.

===== Basic rule (plural nouns) =====

When the noun is a normal plural, with an added &quot;s&quot;, no extra &quot;s&quot; is added in the possessive, and it is pronounced accordingly; so &quot;the neighbours&#x27; garden&quot; (there is more than one neighbour owning the garden) is standard rather than &quot;the neighbours&#x27;s garden&quot;.
* If the plural is not one that is formed by adding &quot;s&quot;, an &quot;s&quot; is added for the possessive, after the apostrophe: &quot;children&#x27;s hats&quot;, &quot;women&#x27;s hairdresser&quot;, &quot;some people&#x27;s eyes&quot; (but compare &quot;some peoples&#x27; recent emergence into nationhood&quot;, where &quot;peoples&quot; is meant as the plural of the singular &quot;people&quot;). These principles are universally accepted.
* A few English nouns have plurals that are not spelled with a final &quot;s&quot; but nevertheless end in an /s/ or a /z/ sound: &quot;mice&quot; (plural of &quot;mouse&quot;; also in compounds like &quot;dormouse&quot;, &quot;titmouse&quot;), &quot;dice&quot; (when used as the plural of &quot;die&quot;), &quot;pence&quot; (a plural of &quot;penny&quot;, with compounds like &quot;sixpence&quot; that now tend to be taken as singulars). In the absence of specific exceptional treatment in style guides, the possessives of these plurals are formed by adding an apostrophe and an &quot;s&quot; in the standard way: &quot;seven titmice&#x27;s tails were found&quot;, &quot;the dice&#x27;s last fall was a seven&quot;, &quot;his few pence&#x27;s value was not enough to buy bread&quot;. These would often be rephrased, where possible: &quot;the last fall of the dice was a seven&quot;.

===== Basic rule (compound nouns) =====

Compound nouns have their singular possessives formed with an apostrophe and an added &quot;s&quot;, in accordance with the rules given above: &quot;the Attorney-General&#x27;s husband&quot;; &quot;the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports&#x27;s prerogative&quot;; &quot;this Minister for Justice&#x27;s intervention&quot;; &quot;her father-in-law&#x27;s new wife&quot;.
*In such examples, the plurals are formed with an &quot;s&quot; that does not occur at the end: e.g., &quot;attorneys-general&quot;. A problem therefore arises with the &quot;possessive&quot; plurals of these compounds. Sources that rule on the matter appear to favour the following forms, in which there is both an &quot;s&quot; added to form the plural, and a separate &quot; &#x27;s&quot; added for the possessive: &quot;the attorneys-general&#x27;s husbands&quot;; &quot;successive Ministers for Justice&#x27;s interventions&quot;; &quot;their fathers-in-law&#x27;s new wives&quot;. Because these constructions stretch the resources of punctuation beyond comfort, in practice they are normally reworded: &quot;interventions by successive Ministers for Justice&quot;.

===== Joint or separate possession =====

For two nouns (or noun phrases) joined by &quot;and&quot;, there are several ways of expressing possession, including:
:1. marking of the last noun (e.g. &quot;Jack and Jill&#x27;s children&quot;)
:2. marking of both nouns (e.g. &quot;Jack&#x27;s and Jill&#x27;s children&quot;).
Some grammars make no distinction in meaning between the two forms. Some publishers&#x27; style guides, however, make a distinction, assigning the &quot;segregatory&quot; (or &quot;distributive&quot;) meaning to the form &quot;John&#x27;s and Mary&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;combinatorial&quot; (or &quot;joint&quot;) meaning to the form &quot;John and Mary&#x27;s&quot;. A third alternative is a construction of the form &quot;Jack&#x27;s children and Jill&#x27;s&quot;, which is always distributive, i.e. it designates the combined set of Jack&#x27;s children and Jill&#x27;s children.

When a coordinate possessive construction has two personal pronouns, the normal possessive inflection is used, and there is no apostrophe (e.g., &quot;his and her children&quot;). The issue of the use of the apostrophe arises when the coordinate construction includes a noun (phrase) and a pronoun. In this case, the inflection of only the last item may sometimes be, at least marginally, acceptable (&quot;you and your spouse&#x27;s bank account&quot;). The inflection of both is normally preferred (e.g. Jack&#x27;s and your dogs), but there is a tendency to avoid this construction, too, in favour of a construction that does not use a coordinate possessive (e.g. by using &quot;Jack&#x27;s letters and yours&quot;). Where a construction like &quot;Jack&#x27;s and your dogs&quot; is used, the interpretation is usually &quot;segregatory&quot; (i.e. not joint possession).

===== With other punctuation; compounds with pronouns =====

If the word or compound includes, or ends with, a punctuation mark, an apostrophe and an &quot;s&quot; are still added in the usual way: &quot;Westward Ho!&#x27;s railway station&quot;; &quot;&quot;Awaye!&quot;″s Paulette Whitten recorded Bob Wilson&#x27;s story&quot;; &quot;Washington, D.C.&#x27;s museums&quot;. (assuming that the prevailing style requires full stops in &quot;D.C.&quot;).
*If the word or compound already includes a possessive apostrophe, a double possessive results: &quot;Tom&#x27;s sisters&#x27; careers&quot;; &quot;the head of marketing&#x27;s husband&#x27;s preference&quot;; &quot;the master of foxhounds&#x27; best dog&#x27;s death&quot;. Many style guides, while allowing that these constructions are possible, advise rephrasing: &quot;the head of marketing&#x27;s husband prefers that ...&quot;. If an original apostrophe or apostrophe with &quot;s&quot; occurs at the end, it is left by itself to serve both purposes: &quot;Our employees are better paid than McDonald&#x27;s employees&quot;; &quot;Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s indices are widely used&quot;: the fixed forms of &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s&quot; already include possessive apostrophes. For similar cases involving geographical names, see below.
* Similarly, the possessives of all phrases whose wording is fixed are formed in the same way:
**&quot;Us and Thems inclusion on the album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;
**You Am I&#x27;s latest CD
**The 69&#x27;ers&#x27; drummer, Tom Callaghan (only the second apostrophe is possessive)
** &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot;&#x27;s first track is called &quot;Joyriders&quot;.
** Was &quot;She&quot; success greater, or &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;?
:For complications with foreign phrases and titles, see below.

===== Time, money, and similar =====

An apostrophe is used in time and money references in constructions such as &quot;one hour&#x27;s respite&quot;, &quot;two weeks&#x27; holiday&quot;, &quot;a dollar&#x27;s worth&quot;, &quot;five pounds&#x27; worth&quot;, &quot;one mile&#x27;s drive from here&quot;. This is like an ordinary possessive use. For example, &quot;one hour&#x27;s respite&quot; means &quot;a respite of one hour&quot; (exactly as &quot;the cat&#x27;s whiskers&quot; means &quot;the whiskers of the cat&quot;).

===== Possessive pronouns and adjectives =====

No apostrophe is used in the following possessive pronouns and adjectives: &quot;hers&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;its&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;, &quot;theirs&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;, and &quot;yours&quot;. All other possessive pronouns do end with an apostrophe and an &quot;s&quot;. In singular forms, the apostrophe comes first, e.g. &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;; &quot;everyone&#x27;s&quot;; &quot;somebody&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;nobody else&#x27;s&quot;, etc., while the apostrophe follows the &quot;s&quot; in plural forms as with nouns: &quot;the others&#x27; complaints&quot;.

The possessive of &quot;it&quot; was originally &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;, in contrast to the modern &quot;its&quot;. The apostrophe was dropped by the early 19th century. Authorities are now unanimous that &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; can be only a contraction of &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it has&quot;. Despite this, using &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; as a possessive pronoun is a common grammatical error in present times.

===== Importance for disambiguation =====

Each of these four phrases (listed in Steven Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;) has a distinct meaning:
*My sister&#x27;s friend&#x27;s investment &quot;(the investment belonging to a friend of my sister)&quot;
*My sister&#x27;s friends&#x27; investment &quot;(the investment belonging to several friends of my sister)&quot;
*My sisters&#x27; friend&#x27;s investment &quot;(the investment belonging to a friend of several of my sisters)&quot;
*My sisters&#x27; friends&#x27; investment &quot;(the investment belonging to several friends of several of my sisters)&quot;

Kingsley Amis, on being challenged to produce a sentence whose meaning depended on a possessive apostrophe, came up with:
*Those things over there are my husband&#x27;s. (&quot;Those things over there belong to my husband.&quot;)
*Those things over there are my husbands&#x27;. (&quot;Those things over there belong to several husbands of mine.&quot;)
*Those things over there are my husbands. (&quot;I&#x27;m married to those men over there.&quot;)

====Singular nouns ending with an &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot; sound====
Some singular nouns are pronounced with a sibilant sound at the end: /s/ or /z/. The spelling of these ends with &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-se&quot;, &quot;-z&quot;, &quot;-ze&quot;, &quot;-ce&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, or &quot;-xe&quot;.

Most respected authorities recommend that practically all singular nouns, including those ending with a sibilant sound, have possessive forms with an extra &quot;s&quot; after the apostrophe so that the spelling reflects the underlying pronunciation. Examples include Oxford University Press, the Modern Language Association, the BBC and &quot;The Economist&quot;. Such authorities demand possessive singulars like these: &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;; &quot;Tony Adams&#x27;s friend; my boss&#x27;s job; the US&#x27;s economy&quot;. Rules that modify or extend the standard principle have included the following:
*If the singular possessive is difficult or awkward to pronounce with an added sibilant, do not add an extra &quot;s&quot;; these exceptions are supported by the &quot;Yahoo! Style Guide&quot;, and &quot;The American Heritage Book of English Usage&quot;. Such sources permit possessive singulars like these: &quot;Socrates&#x27; later suggestion&quot;; or &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; if that is how the pronunciation is intended. The style guides of &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; omit the extra s in this case.
*Some style guides advise that Classical, biblical, and similar names ending in a sibilant, especially if they are polysyllabic, should not take an added &quot;s&quot; in the possessive; among sources giving exceptions of this kind are &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, which make general stipulations, and Vanderbilt University, which mentions only &quot;Moses&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;. As a particular case, &quot;Jesus&#x27;&quot; – referred to as &quot;an accepted liturgical archaism&quot; in &quot;Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot; – is commonly written instead of &quot;Jesus&#x27;s&quot;.
* There are also some entrenched uses, for example &quot;St James&#x27;s Park&quot; (in London) (but the Newcastle stadium displays its name spelled &quot;St James&#x27; Park&quot;), &quot;St James&#x27;s Palace&quot; (and &quot;the Court of St James&#x27;s&quot;), &quot;St. James&#x27;s Hospital&quot; (in Dublin), &quot;King James&#x27;s School&quot;, Knaresborough and &quot;King James&#x27;s School&quot;, Almondbury (but there is no genitive at all in &quot;St James Park&quot; (Exeter) or &quot;St. James Park&quot; (Bronx); nor is there one in &quot;the King James Bible&quot; since, like the &quot;Hebrew Bible&quot;, it is a description not a possessive).

Although less common, some contemporary writers still follow the older practice of omitting the second &quot;s&quot; in some cases ending with a sibilant, but usually not when written &quot;-x&quot; or &quot;-xe&quot;. The Associated Press Stylebook recommends or allows the practice of omitting the additional &quot;s&quot; in proper nouns ending with an &quot;s&quot;, but not in words ending with other sibilants (&quot;z&quot; and &quot;x&quot;). The 15th edition of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; had recommended the traditional practice, which included providing for several exceptions to accommodate spoken usage such as the omission of the extra &quot;s&quot; after a polysyllabic word ending in a sibilant, but the 16th edition no longer recommends omitting the possessive &quot;s&quot;.

Similar examples of notable names ending in an &quot;s&quot; that are often given a possessive apostrophe with no additional &quot;s&quot; include &quot;Dickens&quot; and &quot;Williams&quot;. There is often a policy of leaving off the additional &quot;s&quot; on any such name, but this can prove problematic when specific names are contradictory (for example, &quot;St James&#x27; Park&quot; in Newcastle [the football ground] and the area of &quot;St James&#x27;s Park&quot; in London). However, debate has been going on regarding the punctuation of St James&#x27; Park (Newcastle) for some time, unlike St James&#x27;s Park (London) which is the less contentious version. For more details on practice with geographic names, see the relevant section below.

Some writers like to reflect standard spoken practice in cases like these with &quot;sake&quot;: &quot;for convenience&#x27; sake&quot;, &quot;for goodness&#x27; sake&quot;, &quot;for appearance&#x27; sake&quot;, &quot;for compromise&#x27; sake&quot;, etc. This punctuation is preferred in major style guides. Others prefer to add &quot;&#x27;s&quot;: &quot;for convenience&#x27;s sake&quot;. Still others prefer to omit the apostrophe when there is an &quot;s&quot; sound before &quot;sake&quot;: &quot;for morality&#x27;s sake&quot;, but &quot;for convenience sake&quot;.

====Nouns ending with silent &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;====

The English possessive of French nouns ending in a silent &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; is addressed by various style guides. Certainly a sibilant is pronounced in examples like &quot;Descartes&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Dumas&#x27;s&quot;; the question addressed here is whether &quot;s&quot; needs to be added. Similar examples with &quot;x&quot; or &quot;z&quot;: &quot;&#x27;s main ingredient is truffle&quot;; &quot;His &#x27;s loss went unnoticed&quot;; &quot;Verreaux(&#x27;s) eagle, a large, predominantly black eagle, &quot;Aquila verreauxi&quot;...&quot; (OED, entry for &quot;Verreaux&quot;, with silent &quot;x&quot;; see Verreaux&#x27;s eagle); in each of these some writers might omit the added &quot;s&quot;. The same principles and residual uncertainties apply with &quot;naturalised&quot; English words, like &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Arkansas&quot;.

For possessive &quot;plurals&quot; of words ending in a silent &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, the few authorities that address the issue at all typically call for an added &quot;s&quot; and suggest that the apostrophe precede the &quot;s&quot;: &quot;The Loucheux&#x27;s homeland is in the Yukon&quot;; &quot;Compare the two Dumas&#x27;s literary achievements&quot;. The possessive of a cited French title with a silent plural ending is uncertain: &quot;&#x27;s long and complicated publication history&quot;, but &quot;&#x27; singular effect was &#x27;exotic primitive&#x27; ...&quot; (with nearby sibilants &quot;-ce-&quot; in &quot;noces&quot; and &quot;s-&quot; in &quot;singular&quot;). Compare treatment of other titles, above.

Guides typically seek a principle that will yield uniformity, even for foreign words that fit awkwardly with standard English punctuation.

====Possessives in geographic names====
Place names in the United States do not use the possessive apostrophe on federal maps and signs. The United States Board on Geographic Names, which has responsibility for formal naming of municipalities and geographic features, has deprecated the use of possessive apostrophes since 1890 so as not to show ownership of the place. Only five names of natural features in the US are officially spelled with a genitive apostrophe: Martha&#x27;s Vineyard; Ike&#x27;s Point, New Jersey; John E&#x27;s Pond, Rhode Island; Carlos Elmer&#x27;s Joshua View, Arizona; and Clark&#x27;s Mountain, Oregon. Some municipalities, originally incorporated using the apostrophe, have dropped it in accordance with this policy; Taylors Falls in Minnesota, for example, was originally incorporated as &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Falls&quot;. On the state level, the federal policy is not always followed: Vermont&#x27;s official state website has a page on Camel&#x27;s Hump State Forest.

Australia&#x27;s Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping also has a no-apostrophe policy, a practice it says goes back to the 1900s and which is generally followed around the country.

On the other hand, the United Kingdom has Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Bishop&#x27;s Castle and King&#x27;s Lynn (among many others) but St Albans, St Andrews and St Helens. London Underground&#x27;s Piccadilly line has the adjacent stations of Earl&#x27;s Court in Earl&#x27;s Court and Barons Court. These names were mainly fixed in form many years before grammatical rules were fully standardised. While Newcastle United play football at a stadium called St James&#x27; Park, and Exeter City at St James Park, London has a St James&#x27;s Park (this whole area of London is named after the parish of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly).

Modern usage has been influenced by considerations of technological convenience including the economy of typewriter ribbons and films, and similar computer character &quot;disallowance&quot; which tend to ignore past standards. Practice in the United Kingdom and Canada is not so uniform.

====Possessives in names of organizations====
Sometimes the apostrophe is omitted in the names of clubs, societies, and other organizations, even though the standard principles seem to require it: &quot;Country Women&#x27;s Association&quot;, but &quot;International Aviation Association&quot;; &quot;Magistrates&#x27; Court of Victoria&quot;, but &quot;Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union&quot;. Usage is variable and inconsistent. Style guides typically advise consulting an official source for the standard form of the name (as one would do if uncertain about other aspects of the spelling of the name); some tend towards greater prescriptiveness, for or against such an apostrophe. As the case of &quot;&quot; shows, it is not possible to analyze these forms simply as non-possessive plurals, since &quot;women&quot; is the only correct plural form of &quot;woman&quot;.

====Possessives in business names====
Where a business name is based on a family name it should in theory take an apostrophe, but many leave it out (contrast &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s&quot; with &quot;Harrods&quot;). In recent times there has been an increasing tendency to drop the apostrophe. Names based on a first name are more likely to take an apostrophe, but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an &quot;s&quot; at the end is also a name, such as Parson. A small activist group called the Apostrophe Protection Society has campaigned for large retailers such as Harrods, Currys, and Selfridges to reinstate their missing punctuation. A spokesperson for Barclays PLC stated, &quot;It has just disappeared over the years. Barclays is no longer associated with the family name.&quot; Further confusion can be caused by businesses whose names look as if they should be pronounced differently without an apostrophe, such as Paulos Circus, and other companies that leave the apostrophe out of their logos but include it in written text, such as Cadwalader&#x27;s.

===Apostrophe showing omission===
An apostrophe is commonly used to indicate omitted characters, normally letters:
* It is used in contractions, such as &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; from &quot;cannot&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; from &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it has&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll&quot; from &quot;I will&quot; or &quot;I shall&quot;.
* It is used in abbreviations, as &quot;gov&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;government&quot;. It may indicate omitted numbers where the spoken form is also capable of omissions, as &quot;&#x27;70s&quot; for &quot;1970s&quot; representing &quot;seventies&quot; for &quot;nineteen-seventies&quot;. In modern usage, apostrophes are generally omitted when letters are removed from the start of a word, particularly for a compound word. For example, it is not common to write &quot;&#x27;bus&quot; (for &quot;omnibus&quot;), &quot;&#x27;phone&quot; (&quot;telephone&quot;), &quot;&#x27;net&quot; (&quot;Internet&quot;). However, if the shortening is unusual, dialectal or archaic, the apostrophe may still be used to mark it (e.g., &quot;&#x27;bout&quot; for &quot;about&quot;, &quot;&#x27;less&quot; for &quot;unless&quot;, &quot;&#x27;twas&quot; for &quot;it was&quot;). Sometimes a misunderstanding of the original form of a word results in a non-standard contraction. A common example: &quot;&#x27;til&quot; for &quot;until&quot;, though &quot;till&quot; is in fact the original form, and &quot;until&quot; is derived from it.
**The spelling &quot;fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le&quot;, contracted from the nautical term &quot;forecastle&quot;, is unusual for having three apostrophes. The spelling &quot;bo&#x27;s&#x27;n&#x27;s&quot; (from &quot;boatswain&#x27;s&quot;), as in &quot;Bo&#x27;s&#x27;n&#x27;s Mate&quot;, also has three apostrophes, two showing omission and one possession. &quot;Fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le&quot; may also take a possessive &quot;s&quot; – as in &quot;the fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le&#x27;s timbers&quot; – giving four apostrophes in one word. A word which formerly contained two apostrophes is &quot;sha&#x27;n&#x27;t &quot;for &quot;shall not&quot;, examples of which may be found in the older works of P. G. Wodehouse and &quot;Frank Richards&quot; (Charles Hamilton), but this has been superseded by &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot;.
**Shortenings with more apostrophes, such as &quot;y&#x27;all&#x27;dn&#x27;t&#x27;ve&quot; (y&#x27;all wouldn&#x27;t have), are possible, particularly in Southern US dialects.
*It is sometimes used when the normal form of an inflection seems awkward or unnatural; for example, &quot;KO&#x27;d&quot; rather than &quot;KOed&quot; (where &quot;KO&quot; is used as a verb meaning &quot;to knock out&quot;); &quot;a spare pince-nez&#x27;d man&quot; (cited in OED, entry for &quot;pince-nez&quot;; &quot;pince-nezed&quot; is also in citations).
*An apostrophe&#x27;s function as possessive or contractive can depend on the grammatical context:
**We rehearsed for Friday&#x27;s opening night. (&quot;We rehearsed for the opening night on Friday.&quot;)
**We rehearsed because Friday&#x27;s opening night. (&quot;We rehearsed because Friday is opening night.&quot; &quot;Friday&#x27;s&quot; here is a contraction of &quot;Friday is&quot;.)
*Eye dialects use apostrophes in creating the effect of a non-standard pronunciation.
*Apostrophes to omit letters in place names are common on British road signs when space does not allow for the full name for example, Wolverhampton abbreviated as &quot;W&#x27;hampton&quot; and Kidderminster as &quot;K&#x27;minster&quot;.
*The United States Board on Geographic Names, while discouraging possessive apostrophes in place names, allows apostrophes indicating omission, as in &quot;Lake O&#x27; the Woods&quot;, or when normally present in a surname, as in &quot;O&#x27;Malley Draw&quot;.

===Use in forming some plurals===

Following an evolution in usage in the 20th century, today &quot;the apostrophe of plurality continues in at least five areas&quot;: abbreviations, letters of the alphabet/small words, numbers, family names, and in non-standard use.

====Abbreviations====
For abbreviations, including acronyms, the use of &quot;s&quot; without an apostrophe is now more common than its use with an apostrophe. Most modern style guides disparage the use of apostrophes in all plural abbreviations.

Some references continue to condone their use, or even recommend their use in some abbreviations. For example, &quot;The Canadian Style&quot; states &quot;Add an apostrophe and &quot;s&quot; to form the plural of abbreviations containing more than one period&quot;, so &quot;G.M.&#x27;s&quot; is preferred to &quot;G.M.s&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; condones &quot;V.I.P.&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;VIP&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;VIPs&quot; equally.

====Letters of the alphabet, and small words====
For single lowercase letters, pluralization with &quot;&#x27;s&quot; is usual. Many guides recommend apostrophes whether the single letters are lowercase (as in &quot;minding your p&#x27;s and q&#x27;s&quot;) or uppercase (as in &quot;A&#x27;s and S&#x27;s&quot;). &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; recommends the apostrophe of plurality only for lowercase letters. Sometimes, adding just &quot;s&quot; rather than &quot;&#x27;s&quot; may leave meaning ambiguous or presentation inelegant. However, an apostrophe is not always the preferred solution. APA style requires the use of italics instead of an apostrophe: &quot;p&quot;s, &quot;n&quot;s, etc.

In the phrase &quot;dos and don&#x27;ts&quot;, most modern style guides disparage spelling the first word as &quot;do&#x27;s&quot;. However, there is a lack of consensus and certainly the use of an apostrophe continues, legitimately, in which &quot;the apostrophe of plurality occurs in the first word but not the second&quot;.

====Numbers and symbols====
The &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; notes that &quot;a plural &quot;s&quot; after a set of numbers is often preceded by an apostrophe, as in &quot;3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s&quot;..., but many housestyles and individuals now favour &quot;3s and 4s&quot;&quot;. Most style guides prefer the lack of apostrophe for groups of years (e.g. &quot;1980s&quot;) and will prefer &quot;90s&quot; or &quot;&#x27;90s&quot; over &quot;90&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;&#x27;90&#x27;s&quot;.

While many guides discourage using an apostrophe in all numbers/dates, many other guides &quot;encourage&quot; using an apostrophe for numbers or are divided on the issue; for example, the &quot;Australian Government Style Manual&quot; recommends &quot;Binary code uses 0’s and 1’s&quot; but recommends &quot;the 2020s&quot;. Still other guides take a laissez-faire approach. For example, the University of Sussex&#x27;s online guide notes regional variation in the use of apostrophes in dates, and slightly prefers &quot;1&#x27;s and 7&#x27;s&quot; over &quot;1s and 7s&quot; but condones both.

The apostrophe is very often used in plurals of symbols, for example &quot;that page has too many &amp;&#x27;s and #&#x27;s on it&quot;. Some style guides state that the apostrophe is unnecessary since there is no ambiguity but that some editors and teachers prefer this usage. The addition of an &quot;s&quot; without an apostrophe may make the text difficult to read.

For many numbers and symbols, a useful alternative is to write out the numbers as words (e.g. &quot;thousands&quot; instead of &quot;1000&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;1000s&quot;, and &quot;ampersands&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;s&quot; or &quot;&amp;&#x27;s&quot;).

====Family names====
The vast majority of English references published from the late 20th century onwards disparage the use of apostrophes in family-name plurals, for example identifying &quot;Joneses&quot; as correct and &quot;Jones&#x27;s&quot; as incorrect. As an exception, the &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; (2018) reports that, in addition to &quot;Joneses&quot; etc., standard apostrophe usage does continue &quot;in family names, especially if they end in &quot;-s&quot;, as in &quot;keeping up with the Jones&#x27;s&quot;&quot;.

====Nonstandard use====
See , below.

===Use in non-English names===
Names that are not strictly native to English sometimes have an apostrophe substituted to represent other characters (see also As a mark of elision, below).
*Anglicised versions of Irish surnames typically contain an apostrophe after an &quot;O&quot; (in place of Ó), for example &quot;Dara O&#x27;Briain&quot; for .
*Some Scottish and Irish surnames use an apostrophe after an &quot;M&quot;, for example &quot;M&#x27;Gregor&quot;. The apostrophe here may be seen as marking a contraction where the prefix &quot;Mc&quot; or &quot;Mac&quot; would normally appear. However, it may also arise from a misinterpretation of printers&#x27; use of an inverted comma, (&quot;turned comma&quot; or &quot;6-quote&quot;), as a substitute for superscript &quot;c&quot; when printing with hand-set metal type. Compare: M&#x27;Lean, McLean, M‘Lean.

===Use in transliteration===
In transliterated foreign words, an apostrophe may be used to separate letters or syllables that otherwise would likely be interpreted incorrectly. For example:
*in the Arabic word , a transliteration of , the syllables are as in &quot;mus·haf&quot;, not &quot;mu·shaf&quot;
*in the Japanese name &quot;Shin&#x27;ichi&quot;, the apostrophe shows that the pronunciation is &quot;shi·n·i·chi&quot; (hiragana ), where the letters &quot;n&quot; () and &quot;i&quot; () are separate morae, rather than &quot;shi·ni·chi&quot; ().
*in the Chinese Pinyin romanization, the apostrophe (, , géyīn fúhào, &#x27;syllable-dividing mark&#x27;) is used before a syllable starting with a vowel (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, or &quot;e&quot;) in a multiple-syllable word when the syllable does not start the word (which is most commonly realized as ), unless the syllable immediately follows a hyphen or other dash. This is done to remove ambiguity that could arise, as in &quot;Xi&#x27;an&quot;, which consists of the two syllables &#x27; (&quot;) &#x27; (&quot;), compared to such words as &#x27; (&quot;). (This ambiguity does not occur when tone marks are used: The two tone marks in &#x27; unambiguously show that the word consists of two syllables. However, even with tone marks, the city is usually spelled with an apostrophe as &quot;.)
Furthermore, an apostrophe may be used to indicate a glottal stop in transliterations. For example:
*in the Arabic word , a common transliteration of (part of) &quot;al-qur&#x27;ān&quot;, the apostrophe corresponds to the diacritic maddah over the , one of the letters in the Arabic alphabet. An by itself would indicate the long vowel , and the adds a glottal stop.
Rather than (modifier letter left half ring), the apostrophe is sometimes used to indicate a voiced pharyngeal fricative as it sounds and looks like the glottal stop to most English speakers. For example:
*in the Arabic word for , the apostrophe corresponds to the Arabic letter .
Finally, in &quot;scientific&quot; transliteration of Cyrillic script, the apostrophe usually represents the soft sign , though in &quot;ordinary&quot; transliteration it is usually omitted. For example, 
* &quot;The Ob River (Russian: Обь), also Ob&#x27;, is a major river in western Siberia.&quot;

===Non-standard English use===


Failure to observe standard use of the apostrophe is widespread and frequently criticised as incorrect, often generating heated debate. The British founder of the Apostrophe Protection Society earned a 2001 Ig Nobel prize for &quot;efforts to protect, promote and defend the differences between plural and possessive&quot;. A 2004 report by British examination board OCR stated that &quot;the inaccurate use of the apostrophe is so widespread as to be almost universal&quot;. A 2008 survey found that nearly half of the UK adults polled were unable to use the apostrophe correctly.

==== Superfluous apostrophes (&quot;greengrocers&#x27; apostrophes&quot;)====

Apostrophes used in a non-standard manner to form noun plurals are known as &quot;greengrocers&#x27; apostrophes&quot; or &quot;grocers&#x27; apostrophes&quot;, often written as &quot;greengrocer&#x27;s apostrophes&quot; or &quot;grocer&#x27;s apostrophes&quot;. They are sometimes humorously called &quot;greengrocers apostrophe&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;rogue apostrophes&quot;, or &quot;idiot&#x27;s apostrophes&quot; (a literal translation of the German word &quot;Deppenapostroph&quot;, which criticises the misapplication of apostrophes in Denglisch). The practice, once common and acceptable (see Historical development), comes from the identical sound of the plural and possessive forms of most English nouns. It is often criticised as a form of hypercorrection coming from a widespread ignorance of the proper use of the apostrophe or of punctuation in general. Lynne Truss, author of &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot;, points out that before the 19th century it was standard orthography to use the apostrophe to form a plural of a foreign-sounding word that ended in a vowel (e.g., , , , , , ) to clarify pronunciation. Truss says this usage is no longer considered proper in formal writing.

The term is believed to have been coined in the middle of the 20th century by a teacher of languages working in Liverpool, at a time when such mistakes were common in the handwritten signs and advertisements of greengrocers (e.g., &quot; 1/- a pound, 1/6d a pound&quot;). Some have argued that its use in mass communication by employees of well-known companies has led to the less literate assuming it to be standard and adopting the habit themselves.

The same use of apostrophe before noun plural -s forms is sometimes made by non-native speakers of English. For example, in Dutch, the apostrophe is inserted before the &quot;s&quot; when pluralising most words ending in a vowel or &quot;y&quot; for example, (English &quot;babies&quot;) and (English &quot;radios&quot;). This often produces so-called &quot;Dunglish&quot; errors when carried over into English. Hyperforeignism has been formalised in some pseudo-anglicisms. For example, the French word (from English &quot;pin&quot;) is used (with the apostrophe in both singular and plural) for collectible lapel pins. Similarly, there is an Andorran football club called (after such British clubs as Rangers F.C.) and a Japanese dance group called Super Monkey&#x27;s.

====Omission====
In the UK there is a tendency to drop apostrophes in many commonly used names such as St Annes, St Johns Lane, and so on.

UK supermarket chain Tesco omits the mark where standard practice would require it. Signs in Tesco advertise (among other items) . In his book &quot;Troublesome Words&quot;, author Bill Bryson lambasts Tesco for this, stating that &quot;the mistake is inexcusable, and those who make it are linguistic Neanderthals.&quot;

The United States Board on Geographic Names discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names (see above), though state agencies do not always conform; Vermont&#x27;s official state website provides information concerning Camel&#x27;s Hump State Forest.

The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, Australia, excludes possessive apostrophes from place names, along with other punctuation.

====Particular cases====
George Bernard Shaw, a proponent of English spelling reform on phonetic principles, argued that the apostrophe was mostly redundant. He did not use it for spelling &quot;cant&quot;, &quot;hes&quot;, etc., in many of his writings. He did, however, allow &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;. Hubert Selby Jr. used a slash instead of an apostrophe mark for contractions and did not use an apostrophe at all for possessives. Lewis Carroll made greater use of apostrophes, and frequently used &quot;sha&#x27;n&#x27;t&quot;, with an apostrophe in place of the elided &quot;ll&quot; as well as the more usual &quot;o&quot;. These authors&#x27; usages have not become widespread.

The British pop group Hear&#x27;Say famously made unconventional use of an apostrophe in its name. Truss comments that &quot;the naming of Hear&#x27;Say in 2001 was ... a significant milestone on the road to punctuation anarchy&quot;.

===Criticism===
Over the years, the use of apostrophes has been criticised. George Bernard Shaw called them &quot;uncouth bacilli&quot;, referring to the apostrophe-like shape of many bacteria. The author and language commentator Anu Garg has called for the abolition of the apostrophe, stating &quot;Some day this world would be free of metastatic cancers, narcissistic con men, and the apostrophe.&quot; In his book &quot;American Speech&quot;, linguist Steven Byington stated of the apostrophe that &quot;the language would be none the worse for its abolition&quot;. Adrian Room, in his &quot;English Journal&quot; article &quot;Axing the Apostrophe&quot;, argued that apostrophes are unnecessary, and context will resolve any ambiguity. In a letter to the &quot;English Journal&quot;, Peter Brodie stated that apostrophes are &quot;largely decorative ... [and] rarely clarify meaning&quot;. John C. Wells, emeritus professor of phonetics at University College London, says the apostrophe is &quot;a waste of time&quot;. The Apostrophe Protection Society, founded by retired journalist John Richards in 2001, was brought to a full stop in 2019, Richards (then aged 96) accepting that &quot;the ignorance and laziness present in modern times have won!&quot;

In a &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; blog, Geoffrey Pullum proposed that apostrophe be considered a 27th letter of the alphabet, arguing that it is not a form of punctuation.

==Non-English use==

===As a mark of elision===
In many languages, especially European languages, the apostrophe is used to indicate the elision of one or more sounds, as in English.
*In Albanian, the apostrophe is used to show that a vowel has been omitted from words, especially in different forms of verbs and in some forms of personal pronoun. For example, : them (from : them), (from ). It is used too in some of the forms of possessive pronouns, for example: (from ).
*In Afrikaans, as in Dutch, the apostrophe is used to show that letters have been omitted from words. The most common use is in the indefinite article , which is a contraction of &quot;een&quot; meaning &#x27;one&#x27; (the number). As the initial &quot;e&quot; is omitted and cannot be capitalised, the second word in a sentence that begins with is capitalised instead. For example: , &#x27;A tree is green&#x27;. In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals and diminutives where the root ends with long vowels, e.g. , , , , etc.
* In Catalan, French, Italian, Ligurian, and Occitan word sequences such as , (often shortened to &quot;maître d″&quot;, when used in English), , and the final vowel in the first word (&quot;de&quot; &#x27;of&#x27;, &quot;le&quot; &#x27;the&#x27;, etc.) is elided because the word that follows it starts with a vowel or a mute h. French elision similarly occurs with instead of (&#x27;that he&#x27;), instead of (&#x27;it is&#x27; / &#x27;it&#x27;s&#x27;), and so on. Catalan, French, Italian, and Occitan surnames sometimes contain apostrophes of elision, e.g. , .
** French feminine singular possessive adjectives do not undergo such elision anymore, but change to the masculine form instead: &#x27; preceding &#x27; becomes &quot;&quot; (&#x27;my church&#x27;).
** Quebec&#x27;s Bill 101, which dictates the use of French in the province, prohibits the use of apostrophes in proper names in which it would not be used in proper French (thus the international donut chain Tim Hortons, originally spelled with the possessive apostrophe as Tim Horton&#x27;s, was required to drop the apostrophe in Quebec to comply with Bill 101).
*In Danish, apostrophes are sometimes seen on commercial materials. One might commonly see (&#x27;Take me with [you]&#x27;) next to a stand with advertisement leaflets; that would be written in standard orthography. As in German, the apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive, except when there is already an &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot; or &quot;z&quot; present in the base form, as in (&#x27;the Book of Esajas&#x27;).
*In Dutch, as in Afrikaans, the apostrophe is used to indicate omitted characters. For example, the indefinite article can be shortened to , and the definite article shortened to . When this happens in the first word of a sentence, the &quot;second&quot; word of the sentence is capitalised. In general, this way of using the apostrophe is considered non-standard, except as &quot;genitivus temporalis&quot; in , , , (for , &#x27;at morning, at afternoon, at evening, at night&#x27;) and in some frozen place names such as &quot;&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch&quot; (possessive, lit. &quot;The Duke&#x27;s forest&quot;), &quot;″s-Gravenhage&quot; (traditional name of The Hague, lit. &quot;The Count&#x27;s hedge&quot;), &quot;″s-Gravenbrakel&quot; (Braine-le-Comte, in Belgium), &quot;″s-Hertogenrade&quot; (Herzogenrath, in Germany), etc. In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals where the singulars end with long vowels, e.g. , ; and for the genitive of proper names ending with these vowels, e.g. , . These are in fact elided vowels; use of the apostrophe prevents spellings like and . However, most diminutives do not use an apostrophe where the plural forms would; producing spellings such as and .
*In Esperanto, the limits the elision mark to the definite article (from ) and singular nominative nouns ( from , &#x27;heart&#x27;). This is mostly confined to poetry and songs. Idiomatic phrases such as (from , &#x27;thanks to&#x27;) and (from &#x27;of the&#x27;) are nonetheless frequent. In-word elision is usually marked with a hyphen, as in (from , &#x27;Dr&#x27;). Some early guides used and advocated the use of apostrophes between word parts, to aid recognition of such compound words as , &#x27;guitarist&#x27;; but in the latter case, modern usage is to use either a hyphen or a middle dot when disambiguation is necessary, as in &quot;ĉas-hundo&quot; or &quot;ĉas·hundo&quot;, &quot;a hunting dog&quot;, not to be mispronounced as &quot;ĉa.ŝun.do&quot;.
* In Finnish, the apostrophe is used in inflected forms of words whose basic form has a &quot;k&quot; between similar vowels, to show that the &quot;k&quot; has elided in the inflected form: for example the word &#x27; (&quot;raw&quot;) becomes &#x27; in the plural. The apostrophe shows that the identical vowels on either side of it belong to different syllables.
* The Galician language standard admits the use of the apostrophe () for contractions that normally do not use it (e.g.: de + a= da), when the second element begins a proper noun, generally a title: (the plot of A Esmorga [title of a novel]). They are also used to reproduce oral elisions and, as stated below, to join (or split) commercial names of popular public establishments such as restaurants (, The pot).
* In Ganda, when a word ending with a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the final vowel of the first word is elided and the initial vowel of the second word lengthened in compensation. When the first word is a monosyllable, this elision is represented in the orthography with an apostrophe: in &#x27; &#x27;the father of the children&#x27;, &#x27; (&#x27;of&#x27;) becomes &quot;w&quot;″; in &#x27; (&#x27;who is it?&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;who&#x27;) becomes &quot;y″&quot;. But the final vowel of a polysyllable is always written, even if it is elided in speech: &#x27; (&#x27;this man&#x27;), not *&#x27;, because &quot;&quot; (&#x27;man&#x27;) is a polysyllable.
* In German an apostrophe is used almost exclusively to indicate omitted letters. It must not be used for plurals or most of the possessive forms. The only exceptions are the possessive cases of names ending in an &quot;s&quot;-sound as in &#x27;, or &quot;to prevent ambiguities&quot; in all other possessive cases of names, as in &#x27; (referring to the female name &#x27;, not the male name &#x27;). The English/Saxon style of using an apostrophe for possession was introduced after the spelling reform, but is strongly disagreed on by native speakers, and discouraged. Although possessive usage (beyond the exceptions) is widespread, it is often deemed incorrect. The German equivalent of &quot;greengrocers&#x27; apostrophes&quot; would be the derogatory &quot;&quot; (&#x27;idiot&#x27;s apostrophe&#x27;; ).
* In modern printings of Ancient Greek, apostrophes are also used to mark elision. Some Ancient Greek words that end in short vowels elide when the next word starts with a vowel. For example, many Ancient Greek authors would write (&#x27;) for (&#x27;) and (&#x27;) for (&#x27;). Such modern usage should be carefully distinguished from polytonic Greek&#x27;s native rough and smooth breathing marks, which usually appear as a form of rounded apostrophe.
* In Hebrew, the &quot;geresh&quot; (׳), often typed as an apostrophe, is used to denote abbreviations. A double &quot;geresh&quot; (״), known by the dual form gershayim, is used to denote acronyms or initialisms; it is inserted before (i.e., to the right of) the last letter of the acronym. Examples: (abbreviation for , &#x27;professor&#x27;, &#x27;professor&#x27;); (&#x27;, &#x27;P.S.&#x27;). The &quot;geresh&quot; is also used to indicate the elision of a sound; however, this use is much less frequent, and confined to the purpose of imitating a natural, informal utterance, for example: (&#x27; – short for , &quot;&quot;, &#x27;I am/do not&#x27;).
*In Irish, the past tense of verbs beginning with a vowel, or with &quot;fh&quot; followed by a vowel, begins with &quot;d&#x27; &quot;(elision of &quot;do&quot;), for example becomes (&#x27;opened&#x27;) and becomes (&#x27;returned&#x27;). The copula is often elided to &quot;&#x27;s&quot;, and (&#x27;to&#x27;), (&#x27;my&#x27;) etc. are elided before &quot;f&quot; and vowels.
*In Italian it is used for elision with pronouns, as in instead of ; with articles, as in instead of ; and for truncation, as in instead of . Stylistically, sentences beginning with È (as in ) are often rendered as E&#x27; in newspapers, to minimise leading (inter-line spacing). 
*In modern Norwegian, the apostrophe marks that a word has been contracted, such as &#x27; from &#x27; (&#x27;have/has not&#x27;). Unlike English and French, such elisions are not accepted as part of standard orthography but are used to create a more &quot;oral style&quot; in writing. The apostrophe is also used to mark the genitive for words that end in an -s sound: words ending in -s, -x, and -z, some speakers also including words ending in the sound . As Norwegian does not form the plural with -s, there is no need to distinguish between an -s forming the possessive and the -s forming the plural. Therefore, we have &#x27; (&#x27;man&#x27;) and &#x27; (&#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27;), without apostrophe, but &#x27; (&#x27;naval pilot&#x27;) and &quot; (&#x27;naval pilot&#x27;s&#x27;). Indicating the possessive for the two former American presidents named George Bush, whose names end in , could be written as both &#x27; (simply adding an -s to the name) and &#x27; (adding an apostrophe to the end of the name).
* In Portuguese the apostrophe is used to reproduce certain popular pronunciations such as (pay attention to yourself) or in a few combinations of word, when there is the suppression of the vowel of the preposition &quot;de&quot; in certain compound words (the ones formed by two or more stems) such as (&#x27;water tower&#x27;), (&#x27;guineafowl&#x27;), (a plant species, ), (&#x27;morning star&#x27;), etc. Portuguese has many contractions between prepositions and articles or pronouns (like &quot;na&quot; for &quot;em&quot; + &quot;a&quot;), but these are written without an apostrophe. Also, the apostrophe is most commonly not used in the word &quot;pra&quot;, the reduced or popular form of the preposition &quot;para&quot; (but some advocate for its used in preposition + article contractions: &quot;para + a = p&#x27;ra/pra&quot;, &quot;para + o = p&#x27;ro/pro&quot;, etc.).
* Modern Spanish no longer uses the apostrophe to indicate elision in standard writing, although it can sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose. Instead Spanish writes out the spoken elision in full (&#x27;, &#x27;) except for the contraction &#x27; for &#x27; + &quot;&quot;, and &quot;al&quot; for &quot;a&quot; + &quot;el&quot;, which use no apostrophe.
*In Swedish, the apostrophe marks an elision, such as &#x27;, short for &#x27; (&#x27;in the city&#x27;), to make the text more similar to the spoken language. This is relaxed style, fairly rarely used, and would not be used by traditional newspapers in political articles, but could be used in entertainment related articles and similar. The formal way to denote elision in Swedish is by using colon, e.g. &#x27; for &#x27; which is rarely spelled out in full. The apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive except – although not mandatory – when there is already an &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot; or &quot;z&quot; present in the base form, as in &quot;&quot;.
*Welsh uses the apostrophe to mark elision of the definite article (&#x27;the&#x27;) following a vowel (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or, in Welsh, &quot;w&quot;), as in , &#x27;to the house&#x27;. It is also used with the particle , such as with , &#x27;she is&#x27;.

===As a glottal stop===
Several languages and transliteration systems use the apostrophe or some similar mark to indicate a glottal stop, sometimes considering it a letter of the alphabet:

*In several Finno-Ugric languages, such as Estonian and Finnish; for example in the Finnish word &#x27;, being the genitive or accusative of &#x27; (&#x27;raw&#x27;).
*In Guarani, it is called &#x27; , and used in the words &#x27; (language, to speak), &#x27; (grass), &#x27; (sterile).
*In Hawaiian, the &quot;okina&quot; , an inverted apostrophe, is often rendered as . It is considered a letter of the alphabet.
*Mayan.
*In the Tongan language, the apostrophe is called a &quot;&quot; and is the last letter of the alphabet. It represents the glottal stop. Like the okina, it is inverted.
*Various other Austronesian languages, such as Samoan, Tahitian, and Chamorro.
*Tetum, one of the official languages of East Timor.
*The Brazilian native Tupi language.
*Mossi (Mooré), a language of Burkina Faso.
*In Võro, the apostrophe is used in parallel with the letter &quot;q&quot; as symbol of plural, for example &quot;majaq&quot; or &quot;maja&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;houses&#x27;), imperative &quot;annaq&quot; or &quot;anna&#x27;&quot;, and in all other word forms with glottal stop.
*Several fictional languages such as Klingon, D&#x27;ni, Mando&#x27;a or Na&#x27;vi add apostrophes to make names appear &quot;alien&quot;.

The apostrophe represents sounds resembling the glottal stop in the Turkic languages and in some romanizations of Semitic languages, including Arabic and Hebrew. In that case, the letter &quot;&#x27;ayn&quot; (Arabic ع and Hebrew ע) is correspondingly transliterated with the opening single quotation mark.

===As a mark of palatalization or non-palatalization===
Some languages and transliteration systems use the apostrophe to mark the presence, or the lack of, palatalization:

*In Belarusian and Ukrainian, the apostrophe is used between a consonant and a following &quot;soft&quot; (iotated) vowel (Be.: е, ё, ю, я; Uk.: є, ї, ю, я) to indicate that &quot;no&quot; palatalization of the preceding consonant takes place, and the vowel is pronounced in the same way as at the beginning of a word. It therefore marks a morpheme boundary before and, in Belarusian, is a letter of the alphabet (as the hard sign in Russian is) rather than a simple punctuation mark in English, as it is not a punctuation mark in Belarusian. It appears frequently in Ukrainian, as, for instance, in the words: () &#x27;five&#x27;, () &#x27;departure&#x27;, () &#x27;united&#x27;, () &#x27;to clear up, explain&#x27;, () play (drama), etc.
*In Russian and some derived alphabets, the same function has been served by the hard sign (ъ, formerly called &quot;yer&quot;). But the apostrophe saw some use as a substitute after 1918, when Soviet authorities enforced an orthographic reform by confiscating movable type bearing the hard sign from stubborn printing houses in Petrograd.
*In some Latin transliterations of certain Cyrillic alphabets (for Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian), the apostrophe is used to replace the soft sign (ь, indicating palatalization of the preceding consonant), e.g., &quot;Русь&quot; is transliterated &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot; according to the BGN/PCGN system. (The prime symbol is also used for the same purpose.) Some of these transliteration schemes use a double apostrophe ( ˮ ) to represent the apostrophe in Ukrainian and Belarusian text and the hard sign (ъ) in Russian text, e.g. Ukrainian &#x27; (&#x27;Slavic&#x27;) is transliterated as &#x27;.
*Some Karelian orthographies use an apostrophe to indicate palatalization, e.g. &#x27; (&#x27;to give advice&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;just (like)&#x27;), &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to revive&#x27;).
*In Võro an apostrophe is often (also in the Võro Wikipedia) used as a simplification to replace the regular Võro palatalization mark which is the accute accent, for example &quot;as&#x27;aq&quot; replacing regular form &quot;aśaq&quot; (&#x27;things&#x27;).

===To separate morphemes===
Some languages use the apostrophe to separate the root of a word and its affixes, especially if the root is foreign and unassimilated. (For another kind of morphemic separation see pinyin, below.)

* In Danish an apostrophe is sometimes used to join the enclitic definite article to words of foreign origin, or to other words that would otherwise look awkward. For example, one would write &#x27; to mean &quot;the IP address&quot;. There is some variation in what is considered &quot;awkward enough&quot; to warrant an apostrophe; for instance, long-established words such as &#x27; (&#x27;company&#x27;) or &#x27; (&#x27;level&#x27;) might be written &#x27; and &quot;&quot;, but will generally be seen without an apostrophe. Due to Danish influence, this usage of the apostrophe can also be seen in Norwegian, but is non-standard – a hyphen should be used instead: e.g. (the CD).
*In Estonian, apostrophes can be used in the declension of some foreign names to separate the stem from any declension endings; e.g., &#x27; (genitive case) or &#x27; (illative case) of &quot;Monet&quot; (name of the famous painter).
*In Finnish, apostrophes are used in the declension of foreign names or loan words that end in a consonant when written but are pronounced with a vowel ending, e.g. &#x27; (&#x27;in a show&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;to Bordeaux&#x27;). For Finnish as well as Swedish, there is a closely related use of the colon.
*In Polish, the apostrophe is used exclusively for marking inflections of words and word-like elements (but not acronyms – a hyphen is used instead) whose spelling conflicts with the normal rules of inflection. This mainly affects foreign words and names. For instance, one would correctly write &#x27; for &quot;Al Gore&#x27;s campaign&quot;. In this example, &#x27; is spelled without an apostrophe, since its spelling and pronunciation fit into normal Polish rules; but &#x27; needs the apostrophe, because &quot;e&quot; disappears from the pronunciation, changing the inflection pattern. This rule is often misunderstood as calling for an apostrophe after &quot;all&quot; foreign words, regardless of their pronunciation, yielding the incorrect &#x27;, for example. The effect is akin to the greengrocers&#x27; apostrophe (see above).
*In Turkish, proper nouns are capitalised and an apostrophe is inserted between the noun and any following inflectional suffix, e.g. &#x27; (&quot;in Istanbul&quot;), contrasting with &#x27; (&quot;in school&quot;, &#x27; is a common noun) and &#x27; (&#x27;Istanbulite&#x27;, &quot;-lu&quot; is a derivational suffix).
*In Welsh the apostrophe is used with infixed pronouns in order to distinguish them from the preceding word (e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;and my sister&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;, &#x27;about a sister&#x27;).

===Miscellaneous uses in other languages===
*In Breton, the combination &#x27; is used for the consonant (like &quot;ch&quot; in Scottish English &quot;Loch Ness&quot;), while &#x27; is used for the consonant (as in French &quot;&quot; or English &quot;she&quot;).
*In Czech, an apostrophe is used for writing to indicate spoken or informal language where the writer wants to express the natural way of informal speech, but it should not be used in formal text or text of a serious nature. E.g., instead of &#x27; (&#x27;he read&#x27;), the word form &#x27; is used. &#x27; is the informal variant of the verb form &#x27;, at least in some varieties. These two words are the same in meaning, but to use the informal form gives the text a more natural tone, as though a friend were talking to you. Furthermore, the same as in the Slovak case below holds for lowercase &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, and for the two-digit year notation.
*In Finnish, one of the consonant gradation patterns is the change of a &quot;k&quot; into a hiatus, e.g. &#x27; → &#x27; (&#x27;a pile&#x27; → &#x27;a pile&#x27;s&#x27;). This hiatus has to be indicated in spelling with an apostrophe if a long vowel (represented by doubling (e.g. ) or the final vowel of a diphthong (e.g. ) would be immediately followed by the same vowel, e.g. &#x27; → &#x27;, &#x27; → &#x27;. (This is in contrast to compound words, where the problem of a vowel recurring over a syllable break is solved with a hyphen, e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;land area&#x27;.) Similarly, the apostrophe is used to mark the hiatus (contraction) that occurs in poetry, e.g. &#x27; for &quot;&quot; (&#x27;where is&#x27;).
*Galician restaurants sometimes use &quot;″&quot; in their names following the standard article &quot;&quot; (&#x27;the&#x27;).
*In Ganda, &#x27; (pronounced ) is used in place of &quot;ŋ&quot; on keyboards where this character is not available. The apostrophe distinguishes it from the letter combination &#x27; (pronounced ), which has separate use in the language. Compare this with the Swahili usage below.
*In Hebrew, the &quot;geresh&quot; (a diacritic similar to the apostrophe and often represented by one) is used for several purposes other than to mark an elision:
**As an adjacent to letters to show sounds that are not represented in the Hebrew alphabet: Sounds such as (English &quot;j&quot; as in &quot;job&quot;), (English &quot;th&quot; as in &quot;thigh&quot;), and (English &quot;ch&quot; as in &quot;check&quot;) are indicated using ג, ת, and צ with a &quot;geresh&quot; (informally &quot;chupchik&quot;). For example, the name &quot;George&quot; is spelled in Hebrew (with representing the first and last consonants).
**To denote a Hebrew numeral (e.g., , which stands for &#x27;50&#x27;)
**To denote a Hebrew letter which stands for itself (e.g., – the letter &quot;mem&quot;)
**Gershayim (a double geresh) to denote a Hebrew letter name (e.g., – the letter &quot;lamed&quot;)
**Another (rarer) use of geresh is to denote the last syllable (which in some cases, but not all, is a suffix) in some words of Yiddish origin (e.g., ).
**In the Middle Ages and the Early modern period, gershayim were also used to denote foreign words, as well as a means of emphasis.
* In Italian, an apostrophe is sometimes used as a substitute for a grave or an acute accent. This may be done after an initial E or an accented final vowel (when writing in all-capitals), or when the proper form of the letter is unavailable for technical reasons. So a sentence beginning (&#x27;It is true that...&#x27;) may be written as . This form is often seen in newspapers, as it is the only case of an accent above the cap height and its omission permits the text to be more closely spaced (leading). Less commonly, a forename like might be rendered as &quot;Niccolo″&quot;, or &quot;NICCOLO″&quot;; &quot;perché&quot;, as &quot;perche″&quot;, or &quot;PERCHE″&quot;. This applies only to machine or computer writing, in the absence of a suitable keyboard. 
* In Jèrriais, one of the uses of the apostrophe is to mark gemination, or consonant length: For example, &#x27; represents , &#x27; , &#x27; , &#x27; , and &quot;&quot; (contrasted with , , , , and ).
* In Lithuanian, the apostrophe is occasionally used to add a Lithuanized ending on an international word, e.g.- &quot;parking&#x27;as&quot;, &quot;Skype&#x27;as&quot;, &quot;Facebook&#x27;as&quot;.
* In standard Lojban orthography, the apostrophe is a letter in its own right (called ) that can appear only between two vowels, and is phonemically realised as either [h] or, more rarely, [θ].
*In Macedonian the apostrophe is sometimes used to represent the sound schwa, which can be found on dialectal levels, but not in the Standard Macedonian.
*In Slovak, the caron over lowercase &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, and uppercase &quot;L&quot; consonants resembles an apostrophe, for example, &quot;ď&quot;, &quot;ť&quot;, &quot;ľ&quot;, and &quot;Ľ&quot;. This is especially so in certain common typographic renderings. But it is non-standard to use an apostrophe instead of the caron. There is also &quot;l&quot; with an acute accent: &quot;ĺ&quot;, &quot;Ĺ&quot;. In Slovak the apostrophe is properly used only to indicate elision in certain words (&#x27;, as an abbreviated form of &#x27; (&#x27;you are&#x27;), or &#x27; for &#x27; (&#x27;up&#x27;)); however, these elisions are restricted to poetry (with a few exceptions). Moreover, the apostrophe is also used before a two-digit year number (to indicate the omission of the first two digits): &quot;&quot; (usually used for 1987).
* In Swahili, an apostrophe after &#x27; shows that there is no sound of after the sound; that is, that the &#x27; is pronounced as in English &quot;singer&quot;, not as in English &quot;finger&quot;.
* In Switzerland, the apostrophe is used as thousands separator alongside the fixed space (e.g., 2&#x27;000&#x27;000 or for two million) in all four national languages.
* In the new Uzbek Latin alphabet adopted in 2000, the apostrophe serves as a diacritical mark to distinguish different phonemes written with the same letter: it differentiates &#x27; (corresponding to Cyrillic &quot;ў&quot;) from &#x27;, and &#x27; (Cyrillic &quot;ғ&quot;) from &#x27;. This avoids the use of special characters, allowing Uzbek to be typed with ease in ordinary ASCII on any Latin keyboard. In addition, a postvocalic apostrophe in Uzbek represents the glottal stop phoneme derived from Arabic &quot;hamzah&quot; or &quot;&#x27;ayn&quot;, replacing Cyrillic &quot;ъ&quot;.
*In English Yorkshire dialect, the apostrophe is used to represent the word &quot;the&quot;, which is contracted to a more glottal (or &#x27;unreleased&#x27;) /t/ sound. Most users will write &quot;in t&#x27;barn&quot; (&#x27;in the barn&#x27;), &quot;on t&#x27;step&quot; (&#x27;on the step&#x27;); and those unfamiliar with Yorkshire speech will often make these sound like &quot;intuh barn&quot; and &quot;ontuh step&quot;. A more accurate rendition might be &quot;in&#x27;t barn&quot; and &quot;on&#x27;t step&quot;, though even this does not truly convey correct Yorkshire pronunciation as the &quot;t&quot; is more like a glottal stop.
*In the pinyin (hànyǔ pīnyīn) system of romanization for Standard Chinese, an apostrophe is often loosely said to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise. Example: the standard romanization for the name of the city &quot;Xī&#x27;ān&quot; includes an apostrophe to distinguish it from a single-syllable word &quot;&quot;. More strictly, however, it is standard to place an apostrophe only before every &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, or &quot;o&quot; that starts a new syllable after the first if it is not preceded by a hyphen or a dash. Examples: &quot;Tiān&#x27;ānmén&quot;, &quot;Yǎ&#x27;ān&quot;; but simply &quot;Jǐnán&quot;, in which the syllables are &quot;ji&quot; and &quot;nan&quot;, since the absence of an apostrophe shows that the syllables are not &quot;jin&quot; and &quot;an&quot; (contrast &quot;Jīn&#x27;ān&quot;). This is a kind of morpheme-separation marking (see above).
*In the largely superseded Wade–Giles romanization for Standard Chinese, an apostrophe marks aspiration of the preceding consonant sound. Example: in &quot;tsê&quot; (pinyin &quot;ze&quot;) the consonant represented by &quot;ts&quot; is unaspirated, but in &quot;ts&#x27;ê&quot; (pinyin &quot;ce&quot;) the consonant represented by &quot;ts″&quot; is aspirated. Some academic users of the system write this character as a spiritus asper ( or ) or single left (opening) quotation mark (‘).
*In some systems of romanization for the Japanese, the apostrophe is used between moras in ambiguous situations, to differentiate between, for example, &#x27; and &#x27; + &quot;&quot;. (This is similar to the practice in Pinyin mentioned above.)
*In science fiction and fantasy, the apostrophe is often used in fictional names, sometimes to indicate a glottal stop (for example Mitth&#x27;raw&#x27;nuruodo in &quot;Star Wars&quot;), but also sometimes simply for decoration.
==Typographic form==

The shape of the apostrophe originated in manuscript writing, as a point with a downwards tail curving clockwise. This form was inherited by the typographic apostrophe, , also known as the typeset apostrophe (or, informally, the curly apostrophe). Later sans-serif typefaces had stylised apostrophes with a more geometric or simplified form, but usually retaining the same directional bias as a closing quotation mark.

With the invention of the typewriter, a &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; shape quotation mark, , was created to represent a number of different glyphs with a single keystroke: the apostrophe, both the opening and the closing single quotation marks, the single primes, and on some typewriters even the exclamation point (by backspacing and overprinting with a period). This is known as the typewriter apostrophe or vertical apostrophe. The same convention was adopted for double quotation marks (). Both simplifications carried over to computer keyboards and the ASCII character set.

==Informal use in measurement and mathematics ==

Formally, the symbol used to represent a foot of length, depth, or height, is (prime) and that for the inch is (double prime). (Thus, for example, the notation signifies 5 feet and 7 inches). Similarly, the prime symbol is the formal representation of a minute of arc (1/60 of a degree in geometry and geomatics), and double prime represents a second of arc (for example, 17°54′32″ represents 17 degrees 54 minutes and 32 seconds). Similarly in mathematics, the prime is generally used to generate more variable names for similar things without resorting to subscripts, with generally meaning something related to (or derived from) .

Because of the very close similarity of the typewriter apostrophe and typewriter double quote to prime and double prime, substitution in informal contexts is ubiquitous but they are deprecated in contexts where proper typography is important. There is also a risk of an automatic process &quot;correcting&quot; a typewriter apostrophe to a typographic apostrophe, which results in another variant when a prime symbol was intended.

==Unicode ==
In its Unicode Standard (version 13.0), the Unicode Consortium describes three characters that represent apostrophe:

*: The typewriter or ASCII apostrophe. The standard remarks:

* is preferred where the character is to represent a punctuation mark, as for contractions: &quot;we’ve&quot;, and the code is also referred to as a punctuation apostrophe. The closing single quote and the apostrophe were unified in Unicode 2.1 &quot;to correct problems in the mapping tables from Windows and Macintosh code pages.&quot; This can make searching text more difficult as quotes and apostrophes cannot be distinguished without context.
* (from Unicode block Spacing Modifier Letters) is preferred where the apostrophe is to represent a modifier letter (for example, in transliterations to indicate a glottal stop). In the latter case, it is also referred to as a letter apostrophe. The letter apostrophe may be used, for example, in transliterations to represent the Arabic glottal stop (&quot;hamza&quot;) or the Cyrillic &quot;soft sign&quot;, or in some orthographies such as &quot;&quot; of Breton, where this combination is an independent trigraph. ICANN considers this the proper character for Ukrainian apostrophe within IDNs. This character is rendered identically to in the Unicode code charts, and the standard cautions that one should never assume this code is used in any language.

==Computing==
In modern computing practice, Unicode is the standard and default method for character encoding. However, Unicode itself and many legacy applications have echoes of earlier practices. Furthermore, the limited character set provided by computer keyboards has also required practical and pragmatic adjustments. These issues are detailed below.

===ASCII encoding===
The typewriter apostrophe, , was inherited by computer keyboards, and is the only apostrophe character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at code value 0x27 (39). In ASCII, it may be used to represent any of left single quotation mark, right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).

Many earlier (pre-1985) computer displays and printers rendered the ASCII apostrophe as a typographic apostrophe, and rendered the backtick (freestanding grave accent symbol, , 0x60, 96) as a matching left single quotation mark. This allowed a more typographic appearance of text: codice_1 would appear as on these systems. This can still be seen in many documents prepared at that time, and is still used in the TeX typesetting system to create typographic quotes.

===Typographic apostrophe in 8-bit encodings===
Support for the typographic apostrophe ( ’ ) was introduced in several 8-bit character encodings, such as the original Apple Macintosh operating system&#x27;s Mac Roman character set (in 1984), and later in the CP1252 encoding of Microsoft Windows. Both sets also used this code point for a closing single quote. There is no such character in ISO 8859-1.

The Microsoft Windows code page CP1252 (sometimes incorrectly called &quot;ANSI&quot; or &quot;ISO-Latin&quot;) contains the typographic apostrophe at 0x92. Due to &quot;smart quotes&quot; in Microsoft software converting the ASCII apostrophe to this value, other software makers have been effectively forced to adopt this as a &quot;de facto&quot; convention. For instance, the HTML5 standard specifies that this value is interpreted as this character from CP1252. Some earlier non-Microsoft browsers would display a &#x27;?&#x27; for this and make web pages composed with Microsoft software somewhat hard to read.

===Entering apostrophes===
Although ubiquitous in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe () is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since it does not have its own key on most types of consumer keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, most people use the typewriter apostrophe (). Because typewriter apostrophes are now often automatically converted to typographic apostrophes by word processing and similar software, the typographic apostrophe routinely appears in documents produced by non-professionals (albeit sometimes incorrectly—see below).

XML (and hence XHTML) defines an codice_2 character entity reference for the ASCII typewriter apostrophe. This entity reference is officially supported in HTML since HTML 5.

===Smart quotes===
To make typographic apostrophes easier to enter, word processing and publishing software often convert typewriter apostrophes to typographic apostrophes during text entry (at the same time converting opening and closing single and double quotes to their standard left-handed or right-handed forms). A similar facility may be offered on web servers after submitting text in a form field, e.g. on weblogs or free encyclopedias. This is known as the &quot;smart quotes&quot; feature; apostrophes and quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as &quot;dumb quotes&quot;.

Such conversion is not always correct. Smart quotes features often incorrectly convert a leading apostrophe to an opening quotation mark (e.g., in abbreviations of years: &quot;‘29&quot; rather than the correct &quot;’29&quot; for the years &quot;1929&quot; or &quot;2029&quot; (depending on context); or &quot;‘twas&quot; instead of &quot;’twas&quot; as the archaic abbreviation of &quot;it was&quot;). Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a prime rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°  08″ as 49° 53’ 08”.

In Microsoft Word it is possible to turn smart quotes off (in some versions, by navigating through &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;AutoCorrect&quot;, &quot;AutoFormat as you type&quot;, and then unchecking the appropriate option). Alternatively, typing Control-Z (for &quot;Undo&quot;) immediately after entering the apostrophe will convert it back to a typewriter apostrophe. In Microsoft Word for Windows, holding down the Control key while typing two apostrophes will produce a single typographic apostrophe.

===Programming===
Some programming languages, like Pascal, use the ASCII apostrophe to delimit string literals. In many languages, including JavaScript, ECMAScript, and Python, either the apostrophe or the double quote may be used, allowing string literals to contain the other character (but not to contain both without using an escape character), e.g. codice_3. Strings delimited with apostrophes are often called &quot;single quoted&quot;. Some languages, such as Perl, PHP, and many shell languages, treat single quoted strings as &quot;raw&quot; strings, while double quoted strings have expressions (such as codice_4) replaced with their values when interpreted.

The C programming language (and many derived languages like C++, Java, C#, and Scala) uses apostrophes to delimit a character literal. In these languages a character is a different object than a one-letter string.

In C++, since C++14, apostrophes can be included as optional digit separators in numeric literals.

In Visual Basic (and earlier Microsoft BASIC dialects such as QuickBASIC) an apostrophe is used to denote the start of a comment.

In the Lisp family of programming languages, an apostrophe is shorthand for the codice_5 operator.

In Rust, in addition to being used to delimit a character literal, an apostrophe can start an explicit lifetime.

<text>Gennady Ivanovich Nevelskoy (; in Drakino, Soligalichsky Uyezd, Kostroma Governorate – in St. Petersburg) was a Russian navigator and naval officer.

In 1829 he joined the Naval Cadet Corps and in 1846 was given the rank of Captain lieutenant in the Russian Navy. 

In 1848 Nevelskoy set out in command of what became the to the area of the present-day Russian Far East, exploring Sakhalin and the outlet of the Amur River. He proved that the Strait of Tartary was not a gulf, but indeed a strait, connected to Amur&#x27;s estuary by a narrow section (later called Nevelskoy Strait). On 13 August 1850 he founded Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, the first Russian settlement in the region.

Not knowing of the work of the Japanese navigator Mamiya Rinzō, who had explored the same area forty years earlier, the Russians took Nevelskoy&#x27;s report as the first proof that Sakhalin is indeed an island. They renamed the Gulf of Tartary as the Strait of Tartary, and named the northernmost, narrowest section of the strait, the Strait of Nevelskoy, in the captain&#x27;s honour. It connects the strait&#x27;s main body (formerly known as the Gulf of Tartary) with the Amur Liman (Amur River estuary).

==Memory==
The following entities are named after Nevelskoy:
* The Gulf and the Strait of the Far East, the city Nevelskoi in the Sakhalin Oblast, a street in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Kholmsk (and in other cities of the Sah. area), Novosibirsk, village Wrangell Nakhodka and several other places. 
* Monuments in Nikolaevsk-on-Amur, as the founder of the city. 
* The passenger ship &#x27;(Project 860)&#x27; Amur River Shipping Company. 
* A cruiser was to be named Admiral Nevelskoy but was requisitioned by the Imperial German Navy.
* The G.I. Nevelskoi Maritime State University in Vladivostok was named in his honour, as was its expedition yacht &quot;Admiral Nevelskoi&quot;.
* The monument to Gennady Ivanovich Nevelskoy was opened in 1891 in Vladivostok, its creators were the sculptor Bach and the engineer of the fleet Antipenko. It was accepted for state protection in 1974, and in 2019 the boundaries of the object of cultural heritage of regional significance were determined. 
* The Nevelskoi Nautical School, Kholmsk. 
* Planes of the Russian airline Aeroflot 
* Since 2007, the Ivanovo-Voznesensk sea cadet corps has been named after Nevelskoy. 
* &quot;Admiral Nevelskoy&quot; was the name of a Ropucha-class landing ship. 
Memorials:
* Until the mid-1990s there was a monument of Nevelskoy in Khabarovsk. During the night of 17 to 18 May 1996 the monument in Central Park of Culture and Rest of Khabarovsk was destroyed by minors. The sculpture was dismantled for reconstruction and has not been restored. 
* July 16, 2008, in the city of Irkutsk, on the wall of Holy Cross Church (wedding place Gennady Nevelskoi and Catherine Yelchaninova) was a memorial plaque. The idea belongs to the installation of Irkutsk poet and member of the Board of Navy veterans Irkutsk Gennady Haidee. 
* The monument in the town of Korsakov Sakhalin Oblast. Opened in July 2013

<text>The colon, , is a punctuation mark consisting of two equally sized dots aligned vertically. A colon often precedes an explanation, a list, or a quoted sentence. It is also used between hours and minutes in time, between certain elements in medical journal citations, between chapter and verse in Bible citations, between a two numbers in a ratio, and, in the US, for salutations in business letters and other formal letters.

==History==

In Ancient Greek, in rhetoric and prosody, the term (&quot;&quot;, &#x27;limb, member of a body&#x27;) did not refer to punctuation, but to a member or section of a complete thought or passage; see also &quot;Colon (rhetoric)&quot;. From this usage, in palaeography, a colon is a clause or group of clauses written as a line in a manuscript.

In the 3rd century BC, Aristophanes of Byzantium is alleged to have devised a punctuation system, in which the end of such a was thought to occasion a medium-length breath, and was marked by a middot . In practice, evidence is scarce for its early usage, but it was revived later as the &quot;ano teleia&quot;, the modern Greek semicolon. Some writers also used a double dot symbol , that later came to be used as a full stop or to mark a change of speaker. (See also &quot;Punctuation in Ancient Greek&quot;.)

In 1589, in &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;, the English term &quot;colon&quot; and the corresponding punctuation mark is attested:
In 1622, in Nicholas Okes&#x27; print of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, the typographical construction of a colon followed by a hyphen or dash to indicate a restful pause is attested. This construction, known as the &quot;dog&#x27;s bollocks&quot;, was once common in British English, though this usage is now discouraged.

As late as the 18th century, John Mason related the appropriateness of a colon to the length of the pause taken when reading the text aloud, but silent reading eventually replaced this with other considerations.

==Usage in English==
In modern English usage, a complete sentence precedes a colon, while a list, description, explanation, or definition follows it. The elements which follow the colon may or may not be a complete sentence: since the colon is preceded by a sentence, it is a complete sentence whether what follows the colon is another sentence or not. While it is acceptable to capitalise the first letter after the colon in American English, it is not the case in British English, except where a proper noun immediately follows a colon.

;Colon used before list
:&quot;Daequan was so hungry that he ate everything in the house: chips, cold pizza, pretzels and dip, hot dogs, peanut butter, and candy.&quot;

;Colon used before a description
:&quot;Bertha is so desperate that she&#x27;ll date anyone, even William: he&#x27;s uglier than a squashed toad on the highway, and that&#x27;s on his good days.&quot;

;Colon before definition
:&quot;For years while I was reading Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; and criticism on it, I had to constantly look up the word &quot;egregious&quot; since the villain uses that word: outstandingly bad or shocking.&quot;

;Colon before explanation
:&quot;I guess I can say I had a rough weekend: I had chest pain and spent all Saturday and Sunday in the emergency room.&quot;

Some writers use fragments (incomplete sentences) before a colon for emphasis or stylistic preferences (to show a character&#x27;s voice in literature), as in this example:
:&quot;Dinner: chips and juice. What a well-rounded diet I have.&quot;

&quot;The Bedford Handbook&quot; describes several uses of a colon. For example, one can use a colon after an independent clause to direct attention to a list, an appositive, or a quotation, and it can be used between independent clauses if the second summarizes or explains the first. In non-literary or non-expository uses, one may use a colon after the salutation in a formal letter, to indicate hours and minutes, to show proportions, between a title and subtitle, and between city and publisher in bibliographic entries.

Luca Serianni, an Italian scholar who helped to define and develop the colon as a punctuation mark, identified four punctuational modes for it: &quot;syntactical-deductive&quot;, &quot;syntactical-descriptive&quot;, &quot;appositive&quot;, and &quot;segmental&quot;.

===Syntactical-deductive===
The colon introduces the logical consequence, or effect, of a fact stated before.

:&quot;There was only one possible explanation: the train had never arrived.&quot;

===Syntactical-descriptive===
In this sense the colon introduces a description; in particular, it makes explicit the elements of a set.
:&quot;I have three sisters: Daphne, Rose, and Suzanne.&quot;

Syntactical-descriptive colons may separate the numbers indicating hours, minutes, and seconds in abbreviated measures of time.
:&quot;The concert begins at 21:45.&quot;
:&quot;The rocket launched at 09:15:05.&quot;

British English and Australian English, however, more frequently uses a point for this purpose:
:&quot;The programme will begin at 8.00 pm.&quot;
:&quot;You will need to arrive by 14.30.&quot;

A colon is also used in the descriptive location of a book verse if the book is divided into verses, such as in the Bible or the Quran:
:&quot;Isaiah 42:8&quot;
:&quot;Deuteronomy 32:39&quot;
:&quot;Quran 10:5&quot;

===Appositive===
:&quot;Luruns could not speak: he was drunk.&quot;

An appositive colon also separates the subtitle of a work from its principal title. (In effect, the example given above illustrates an appositive use of the colon as an abbreviation for the conjunction &quot;because&quot;.) Dillon has noted the impact of colons on scholarly articles, but the reliability of colons as a predictor of quality or impact has also been challenged. In titles, neither needs to be a complete sentence as titles do not represent writing:

:&quot;Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi&quot;

===Segmental===

Like a dash or quotation mark, a segmental colon introduces speech. The segmental function was once a common means of indicating an unmarked quotation on the same line. The following example is from the grammar book &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot;:

:&quot;Benjamin Franklin proclaimed the virtue of frugality: A penny saved is a penny earned.&quot;

This form is still used in British industry-standard templates for written performance dialogues, such as in a play. The colon indicates that the words following an character&#x27;s name are spoken by that character.

:&quot;Patient: Doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains.&quot;
:&quot;Doctor: Pull yourself together!&quot;
The uniform visual pattern of codice_1 placement on a script page assists an actor in scanning for the lines of their assigned character during rehearsal, especially if a script is undergoing rewrites between rehearsals.

===Use of capitals===
Use of capitalization or lower-case after a colon varies. In British English, and in most Commonwealth countries, the word following the colon is in lower case unless it is normally capitalized for some other reason, as with proper nouns and acronyms. British English also capitalizes a new sentence introduced by a colon&#x27;s segmental use.

American English permits writers to similarly capitalize the first word of any independent clause following a colon. This follows the guidelines of some modern American style guides, including those published by the Associated Press and the Modern Language Association. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, however, requires capitalization only when the colon introduces a direct quotation, a direct question, or two or more complete sentences.

In many European languages, the colon is usually followed by a lower-case letter unless the upper case is required for other reasons, as with British English. German usage requires capitalization of independent clauses following a colon. Dutch further capitalizes the first word of any quotation following a colon, even if it is not a complete sentence on its own.

===Spacing and parentheses===

In print, a thin space was traditionally placed before a colon and a thick space after it. In modern English-language printing, no space is placed before a colon and a single space is placed after it. In French-language typing and printing, the traditional rules are preserved.

One or two spaces may be and have been used after a colon. The older convention (designed to be used by monospaced fonts) was to use &quot;two&quot; spaces after a colon.

In modern typography, a colon will be placed outside the closing parenthesis introducing a list. In very early English typography, it could be placed inside, as seen in Roger Williams&#x27; 1643 book about the Native American languages of New England.

==Usage in other languages==

===Suffix separator===
In Finnish and Swedish, the colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the apostrophe in the English possessive case, connecting a grammatical suffix to an abbreviation or initialism, a special symbol, or a digit (e.g., Finnish &quot;USA:n&quot; and Swedish &quot;USA:s&quot; for the genitive case of &quot;USA&quot;, Finnish &quot;%:ssa&quot; for the inessive case of &quot;%&quot;, or Finnish &quot;20:een&quot; for the illative case of &quot;20&quot;).

===Abbreviation mark===
Written Swedish uses colons in contractions, such as &quot;S:t&quot; for &quot;Sankt&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Saint&quot;) – for example in the name of the Stockholm metro station &quot;S:t Eriksplan&quot;, and &quot;k:a&quot; for &quot;kyrka&quot; (&quot;church&quot;) – for instance Svenska k:a (Svenska kyrkan), the Evangelical Lutheran national Church of Sweden. This can even occur in people&#x27;s names, for example Antonia Ax:son Johnson (&quot;&quot; for &quot;Axelson&quot;). Early Modern English texts also used colons to mark abbreviations.

===Word separator===

In Ethiopia, both Amharic and Ge&#x27;ez script used and sometimes still use a colon-like mark as word separator.

Historically, a colon-like mark was used as a word separator in Old Turkic script.

===End of sentence or verse===
In Armenian, a colon indicates the end of a sentence, similar to a Latin full stop or period.

In liturgical Hebrew, the sof pasuq is used in some writings such as prayer books to signal the end of a verse.

===Score divider===
In German, Hebrew, and sometimes in English, a colon divides the scores of opponents in sports and games. A result of 149–0 would be written as 149 : 0 in German and in Hebrew.

==Mathematics and logic==

The colon is used in mathematics, cartography, model building, and other fields, in this context it denotes a ratio or a scale, as in 3:1 (pronounced &quot;three to one&quot;).

When a ratio is reduced to a simpler form, such as 10:15 to 2:3, this may be expressed with a double colon as 10:15::2:3; this would be read &quot;10 is to 15 as 2 is to 3&quot;. This form is also used in tests of logic where the question of &quot;Dog is to Puppy as Cat is to _____?&quot; can be expressed as &quot;Dog:Puppy::Cat:_____&quot;. For these uses, there is a dedicated Unicode symbol () that is preferred in some contexts. Compare (ratio colon) with 2:3 (U+003A ASCII colon).

In some languages (e.g. German, Russian, and French), the colon is the commonly used sign for division (instead of ÷).
The notation | : | may also denote the index of a subgroup.

The notation indicates that is a function with domain and codomain .

The combination with an equal sign () is used for definitions.

In mathematical logic, when using set-builder notation for describing the characterizing property of a set, it is used as an alternative to a vertical bar (which is the ISO 31-11 standard), to mean &quot;such that&quot;. Example:
:formula_1 (&quot;S&quot; is the set of all in formula_2 (the real numbers) such that is strictly greater than 1 and strictly smaller than 3)

In older literature on mathematical logic, it is used to indicate how expressions should be bracketed (see Glossary of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;).

In type theory and programming language theory, the colon sign after a term is used to indicate its type, sometimes as a replacement to the &quot;∈&quot; symbol. Example:
:formula_3.

A colon is also sometimes used to indicate a tensor contraction involving two indices, and a double colon (::) for a contraction over four indices.

A colon is also used to denote a parallel sum operation involving two operands (many authors, however, instead use a ∥ sign and a few even a ∗ for this purpose).

==Computing==
The character was on early typewriters and therefore appeared in most text encodings, such as Baudot code and EBCDIC. It was placed at code 58 in ASCII and from there inherited into Unicode. Unicode also defines several related characters:
*, used in IPA.
*, IPA modifier-letter.
*, used in IPA.
*, IPA modifier-letter.
*, used by Uralic Phonetic Alphabet.
*, compatible with right-to-left text.
*, for mathematical usage.
*, for use in pretty-printing programming languages.
*
*
*
*, see Colon (letter). (This character is also sometimes used in Windows filenames as it is identical to the colon in the Segoe UI font used for filenames. The colon itself is not permitted as it is a reserved character.)
*, compatibility character for the Chinese Standard GB 18030.
*, for compatibility with halfwidth and fullwidth fonts.
*, compatibility character for the Chinese National Standard CNS 11643.

===Programming languages===
Many programming languages, most notably ALGOL, Pascal and Ada, use a colon and equals sign as the assignment operator, to distinguish it from a single equals which is an equality test (C instead uses a single equals as assignment, and a double equals as the equality test).

Many languages including C and Java use the colon to indicate the text before it is a label, such as a target for a goto or an introduction to a case in a switch statement. In a related use, Python uses a colon to separate a control statement (the &quot;clause header&quot;) from the block of statements it controls (the &quot;suite&quot;):
if test(x):
 print(&quot;test(x) is true!&quot;)
else:
 print(&quot;test(x) is not true...&quot;)
In many languages, including JavaScript, colons are used to define name–value pairs in a dictionary or object. This is also used by data formats such as JSON. Some other languages use an equals sign.
var obj = {
 name: &quot;Charles&quot;,
 age: 18,


The colon is used as part of the ?: conditional operator in C and many other languages.

C++ uses a double colon as the scope resolution operator, and class member access. Most other languages use a period but C++ had to use this for compatibility with C. Another language using colons for scope resolution is Erlang, which uses a single colon.

In BASIC, it is used as a separator between the statements or instructions in a single line. Most other languages use a semicolon, but BASIC had used semicolon to separate items in print statements.

In Forth, a colon &quot;precedes&quot; definition of a new word.

Haskell uses a colon (pronounced as &quot;cons&quot;, short for &quot;construct&quot;) as an operator to add a data element to the front of a list:

&quot;child&quot; : [&quot;woman&quot;, &quot;man&quot;] -- equals [&quot;child&quot;,&quot;woman&quot;,&quot;man&quot;]

while a double colon codice_2 is read as &quot;has type of&quot; (compare scope resolution operator):

(&quot;text&quot;, False) :: ([Char], Bool)

The ML languages (such as Standard ML) have the above reversed, where the double colon (codice_2) is used to add an element to the front of a list; and the single colon (codice_4) is used for type guards.

MATLAB uses the colon as a binary operator to generate a vector, or to select a part of an extant matrix.

APL uses the colon:
* to introduce a control structure element. In this usage it must be the first non-blank character of the line.
* after a label name that will be the target of a codice_5 or a right-pointing arrow (this style of programming is deprecated and programs are supposed to use control structures instead).
* to separate a guard (Boolean expression) from its expression in a dynamic function. Two colons are used for an Error guard (one or more error numbers).
* Colon + space are used in class definitions to indicate inheritance.
* ⍠ (a colon in a box) is used by APL for its variant operator.

The colon is also used in many operating systems commands.

In the esoteric programming language INTERCAL, the colon is called &quot;two-spot&quot; and used to label a 32-bit variable, distinct from &quot;spot&quot; (.) to label a 16-bit variable.

===Addresses===
Internet URLs use the colon to separate the protocol (such as ) from the hostname or IP address.

In an IPv6 address, colons (and one optional double colon) separate up to 8 groups of 16 bits in hexadecimal representation. In a URL, a colon follows the initial scheme name (such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and separates a port number from the hostname or IP address.

In Microsoft Windows filenames, the colon is reserved for use in alternate data streams and cannot appear in a filename. It was used as the directory separator in Classic Mac OS, and was difficult to use in early versions of the newer BSD-based macOS due to code swapping the slash and colon to try to preserve this usage. In most systems it is often difficult to put a colon in a filename as the shell interprets it for other purposes.

CP/M and early versions of MSDOS required the colon after the names of devices, such as though this gradually disappeared except for disks (where it had to be between the disk name and the required path representation of the file as in codice_6). This then migrated to use in URLs.

===Text markup===
It is often used as a single post-fix delimiter, signifying a token keyword had immediately preceded it or the transition from one mode of character string interpretation to another related mode. Some applications, such as the widely used MediaWiki, utilize the colon as both a pre-fix and post-fix delimiter.
In wiki markup, the colon is often used to indent text. Common usage includes separating or marking comments in a discussion as replies, or to distinguish certain parts of a text.
In human-readable text messages, a colon, or multiple colons, is sometimes used to denote an action (similar to how asterisks are used) or to emote (for example, in vBulletin). In the action denotation usage it has the inverse function of quotation marks, denoting actions where unmarked text is assumed to be dialogue. For example:

:Tom: Pluto is so small; it should not be considered a planet. It is tiny!
:Mark: Oh really? ::drops Pluto on Tom&#x27;s head:: Still think it&#x27;s small now?

Colons may also be used for sounds, e.g., ::click::, though sounds can also be denoted by asterisks or other punctuation marks.

Colons can also be used to represent eyes in emoticons.

<text>Hauts-de-Seine (; ) is a department in the Île-de-France region of France. It covers Paris&#x27;s western inner suburbs. It is bordered by Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne to the east, Val-d&#x27;Oise to the north, Yvelines to the west and Essonne to the south. With a population of 1,624,357 (as of 2019) and a total area of 176 square kilometres (68 square miles), it has the second highest population density among all departments of France, after Paris. It is the fifth most populous department in France. Its prefecture is Nanterre, but Boulogne-Billancourt, one of its two subprefectures, alongside Antony, has a larger population.

Hauts-de-Seine is best known for containing the modern office, cinema and shopping complex La Défense, one of Grand Paris&#x27;s main economic centres and one of Europe&#x27;s major business districts. Hauts-de-Seine is one of the wealthiest departments in France; it had the highest GDP per capita in France at €107,800 in 2020. Its inhabitants are called (masculine) and (feminine) in French.

==History==
From 1790 to 1968, Hauts-de-Seine was part of the former department of Seine.

The Hauts-de-Seine department was created in 1968, from parts of the former departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise. Its creation reflected the implementation of a law passed in 1964; Nanterre had already been selected as the prefecture for the new department early in 1965.

In 2016, the Departmental Council of Hauts-de-Seine voted in favour of a fusion of Hauts-de-Seine and Yvelines, its western neighbour. Following a similar vote in Yvelines, an was established. The fusion project was abandoned in 2021, but the cooperation between the two departments continues.

==Geography==
===Location===
Hauts-de-Seine and two other small departments (Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne) form an inner ring around Paris, known as the &quot;Petite Couronne&quot; (literal translation: &quot;Little Crown&quot;). Together with the City of Paris, they are included in Greater Paris since 1 January 2016. It is the smallest department in France, followed by Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne. It is slightly smaller than Maldives.

===Administration===
Hauts-de-Seine comprises three departmental arrondissements and 36 communes:
Hauts-de-Seine currently has the fewest number of any communes in Metropolitan France. With only 36 communes, not including Paris which has only one commune, this makes the French department in Metropolitan France with the fewest number of communes.

==Economy==
Hauts-de-Seine is one of France&#x27;s wealthiest departments and one of Europe&#x27;s richest areas. Its GDP per capita was €106,800 in 2020, according to Eurostat official figures.

==Politics==

In both local and national elections, the department predominantly supports centre-right political candidates, though the 1st and 11th constituencies favor the left. 

Hauts-de-Seine was the political base of Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French Republic from 2007 to 2012. He was the mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine (1983–2002) and president of the Departmental Council of Hauts-de-Seine (2004–2007) before he assumed the office. Sarkozy had succeeded Charles Pasqua as president of the Departmental Council.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Hauts-de-Seine received national media attention as the result of a corruption scandal concerning the misuse of public funds provided for the department&#x27;s housing projects. Implicated were Charles Pasqua, as well as other personalities of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) party.

===Departmental Council of Hauts-de-Seine===

Hauts-de-Seine is governed by a departmental council. Its 46 members are called departmental councillors. The electorate of Hauts-de-Seine usually votes for right-wing parties; there has never been a left-wing majority since the department&#x27;s inception in 1968.

The departmental council is the deliberative organ of the department. The executive is led by the council president, assisted by vice presidents, in charge of various portfolios. Departmental councillors are elected (two per canton) by the department&#x27;s inhabitants for six-year terms (no term limits). The president of the Departmental Council is Georges Siffredi, elected in 2020.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===National representation===

Hauts-de-Seine elected the following members of the National Assembly in the 2024 legislative election:

In the Senate, Hauts-de-Seine is represented by:
* André Gattolin (LREM), since 2011

<text>The Paris Commune (, ) was a French revolutionary government that seized power in Paris on 18 March 1871 and controlled parts of the city until 28 May 1871. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the French National Guard had defended Paris, and working-class radicalism grew among its soldiers. Following the establishment of the French Third Republic in September 1870 (under French chief-executive Adolphe Thiers from February 1871) and the complete defeat of the French Army by the Germans by March 1871, soldiers of the National Guard seized control of the city on 18 March. The Communards killed two French Army generals and refused to accept the authority of the Third Republic; instead, the radicals set about establishing their own independent government.

The Commune governed Paris for two months, promoting policies that tended toward a progressive, anti-religious system of their own self-styled socialism, which was an eclectic mix of many 19th-century schools of thought. These policies included the separation of church and state, self-policing, the remission of rent, the abolition of child labor, and the right of employees to take over an enterprise deserted by its owner. The Commune closed all Catholic churches and schools in Paris. Feminist, communist, old-style social democracy (a mix of reformism and revolutionism), and anarchist/Proudhonist currents, among other socialist types, played important roles in the Commune.

The various Communards had little more than two months to achieve their respective goals before the national French Army suppressed the Commune during the (&quot;bloody week&quot;) beginning on 21 May 1871. The national forces still loyal to the Third Republic government either killed in battle or executed an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Communards, though one unconfirmed estimate from 1876 put the toll as high as 20,000. In its final days, the Commune executed the Archbishop of Paris, Georges Darboy, and about one hundred hostages, mostly gendarmes and priests.

National army forces took 43,522 Communards as prisoners, including 1,054 women. More than half of the prisoners had not fought, and were released immediately. The Third Republic tried around 15,000 in court, 13,500 of whom were found guilty, 95 were sentenced to death, 251 to forced labor, and 1,169 to deportation (mostly to New Caledonia). Many other Commune supporters, including several of the leaders, fled abroad, mostly to England, Belgium or Switzerland. All the surviving prisoners and exiles received pardons in 1880 and could return home, where some resumed political careers.

Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who described the régime in Paris as the first example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Engels wrote: &quot;Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled with wholesome terror at the words: &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;. Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.&quot;

== Prelude ==
On 2 September 1870, France was defeated in the Battle of Sedan, and Emperor Napoleon III was captured. When the news reached Paris the next day, shocked and angry crowds came out into the streets. Empress Eugénie, the acting Regent, fled the city, and the government of the Second Empire swiftly collapsed. Republican and radical deputies of the National Assembly proclaimed the new French Republic, and formed a Government of National Defence with the intention of continuing the war. The Prussian army marched swiftly toward Paris.

=== Demographics ===
In 1871, France was deeply divided between the large rural, Catholic, and conservative population of the French countryside and the more republican and radical cities of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and a few others. In the first round of the 1869 parliamentary elections held under the French Empire, 4,438,000 had voted for the Bonapartist candidates supporting Napoleon III, while 3,350,000 had voted for the republicans or the legitimists. In Paris, however, the republican candidates dominated, winning 234,000 votes against 77,000 for the Bonapartists.

Of the two million people in Paris in 1869, according to the official census, there were about 500,000 industrial workers, or fifteen percent of all the industrial workers in France, plus another 300,000–400,000 workers in other enterprises. Only about 40,000 were employed in factories and large enterprises; most were employed in small industries in textiles, furniture and construction. There were also 115,000 servants and 45,000 concierges. In addition to the native French population, there were about 100,000 immigrant workers and political refugees, the largest number being from Italy and Poland.

During the war and the Siege of Paris, various members of the middle and upper classes departed the city. At the same time, there was an influx of refugees from parts of France occupied by the Germans. The working class and immigrants suffered the most from the lack of industrial activity due to the war and the siege; they formed the bedrock of the Commune&#x27;s popular support.

=== Radicalisation of the Paris workers ===
The Commune resulted in part from growing discontent among the Paris workers. This discontent can be traced to the first worker uprisings, the Canut revolts (a was a Lyonnais silk worker, often working on Jacquard looms), in Lyon and Paris in the 1830s. Many Parisians, especially workers and the lower-middle classes, supported a democratic republic. A specific demand was that Paris should be self-governing with its own elected council, something enjoyed by smaller French towns but denied to Paris by a national government wary of the capital&#x27;s unruly populace.

Socialist movements, such as the First International, had been growing in influence with hundreds of societies affiliated to it across France. In early 1867, Parisian employers of bronze-workers attempted to de-unionise their workers. This was defeated by a strike organised by the International. Later in 1867, a public demonstration in Paris was answered by the dissolution of its executive committee and the leadership being fined. Tensions escalated: Internationalists elected a new committee and put forth a more radical programme, the authorities imprisoned their leaders, and a more revolutionary perspective was taken to the International&#x27;s 1868 Brussels Congress. The International had considerable influence even among unaffiliated French workers, particularly in Paris and the large cities.

The killing of journalist Victor Noir incensed Parisians, and the arrests of journalists critical of the Emperor did nothing to quiet the city. The German military attaché, Alfred von Waldersee, wrote in his diary in February: &quot;Every night isolated barricades were thrown up, constructed for the most part out of disused conveyances, especially omnibuses, a few shots were fired at random, and scenes of disorder were taken part in by a few hundreds of persons, mostly quite young&quot;. He noted, however, that &quot;working-men, as a class, took no part in the proceedings.&quot; A coup was attempted in early 1870, but tensions eased significantly after the plebiscite in May. The war with Prussia, initiated by Napoleon III in July, was initially met with patriotic fervour.

=== Radicals and revolutionaries ===
Paris was the traditional home of French radical movements. Revolutionaries had gone into the streets and overthrown their governments during the popular uprisings of July 1830 and the French Revolution of 1848, as well as subsequent failed attempts such as the 1832 June Rebellion and the uprising of June 1848.

Of the radical and revolutionary groups in Paris at the time of the Commune, the most conservative were the &quot;radical republicans&quot;. This group included the young doctor and future prime minister Georges Clemenceau, who was a member of the National Assembly and Mayor of the 18th arrondissement. Clemenceau tried to negotiate a compromise between the Commune and the government, but neither side trusted him; he was considered extremely radical by the provincial deputies of rural France, but too moderate by the leaders of the Commune.

The most extreme revolutionaries in Paris were the followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, a charismatic professional revolutionary who had spent most of his adult life in prison. He had about a thousand followers, many of them armed and organized into cells of ten persons each. Each cell operated independently and was unaware of the members of the other groups, communicating only with their leaders by code. Blanqui had written a manual on revolution, &quot;Instructions for an Armed Uprising&quot;, to give guidance to his followers. Though their numbers were small, the Blanquists provided many of the most disciplined soldiers and several of the senior leaders of the Commune.

=== Defenders of Paris ===
By 20 September 1870, the German army had surrounded Paris and was camped just from the French front lines. The regular French Army in Paris, under General Trochu&#x27;s command, had only 50,000 professional soldiers of the line; the majority of the French first-line soldiers were prisoners of war, or trapped in Metz, surrounded by the Germans. The regulars were thus supported by around 5,000 firemen, 3,000 gendarmes, and 15,000 sailors. The regulars were also supported by the Garde Mobile, new recruits with little training or experience. 17,000 of them were Parisian, and 73,000 from the provinces. These included twenty battalions of men from Brittany, who spoke little French.

The largest armed force in Paris was the National Guard, numbering about 300,000 men. They also had very little training or experience. They were organised by neighbourhoods; those from the upper- and middle-class arrondissements tended to support the national government, while those from the working-class neighbourhoods were far more radical and politicised. Guardsmen from many units were known for their lack of discipline; some units refused to wear uniforms, often refused to obey orders without discussing them, and demanded the right to elect their own officers. The members of the National Guard from working-class neighbourhoods became the main armed force of the Commune.

=== Siege of Paris; first demonstrations ===
As the Germans surrounded the city, radical groups saw that the Government of National Defence had few soldiers to defend itself, and launched the first demonstrations against it. On 19 September, National Guard units from the main working-class neighbourhoods—Belleville, Ménilmontant, La Villette, Montrouge, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the Faubourg du Temple—marched to the centre of the city and demanded that a new government, a Commune, be elected. They were met by regular army units loyal to the Government of National Defence, and the demonstrators eventually dispersed peacefully. On 5 October, 5,000 protesters marched from Belleville to the Hôtel de Ville, demanding immediate municipal elections and rifles. On 8 October, several thousand soldiers from the National Guard, led by Eugène Varlin of the First International, marched to the centre chanting &#x27;Long Live the Commune!&quot;, but they also dispersed without incident.

Later in October, General Louis Jules Trochu launched a series of armed attacks to break the German siege, with heavy losses and no success. The telegraph line connecting Paris with the rest of France had been cut by the Germans on 27 September. On 6 October, Defense Minister Léon Gambetta departed the city by balloon to try to organise national resistance against the Germans.

=== Uprising of 31 October ===
On 28 October, the news arrived in Paris that the 160,000 soldiers of the French army at Metz, which had been surrounded by the Germans since August, had surrendered. The news arrived the same day of the failure of another attempt by the French army to break the siege of Paris at Le Bourget, with heavy losses. On 31 October, the leaders of the main revolutionary groups in Paris, including Blanqui, Félix Pyat and Louis Charles Delescluze, called new demonstrations at the Hôtel de Ville against General Trochu and the government. Fifteen thousand demonstrators, some of them armed, gathered in front of the Hôtel de Ville in pouring rain, calling for the resignation of Trochu and the proclamation of a commune. Shots were fired from the Hôtel de Ville, one narrowly missing Trochu, and the demonstrators crowded into the building, demanding the creation of a new government, and making lists of its proposed members.

Blanqui, the leader of the most radical faction, established his own headquarters at the nearby Prefecture of the Seine, issuing orders and decrees to his followers, intent upon establishing his own government. While the formation of the new government was taking place inside the Hôtel de Ville, however, units of the National Guard and the Garde Mobile loyal to General Trochu arrived and recaptured the building without violence. By three o&#x27;clock, the demonstrators had been given safe passage and left, and the brief uprising was over.

On 3 November, city authorities organized a plebiscite of Parisian voters, asking if they had confidence in the Government of National Defence. &quot;Yes&quot; votes totalled 557,996, while 62,638 voted &quot;no&quot;. Two days later, municipal councils in each of the twenty arrondissements of Paris voted to elect mayors; five councils elected radical opposition candidates, including Delescluze and a young Montmartrean doctor, Georges Clemenceau.

=== Negotiations with the Germans; continued war ===
In September and October, Adolphe Thiers, the leader of the National Assembly conservatives, had toured Europe, consulting with the foreign ministers of Britain, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, and found that none of them were willing to support France against the Germans. He reported to the government that there was no alternative to negotiating an armistice. He travelled to German-occupied Tours and met with Otto von Bismarck on 1 November. The German Chancellor demanded the cession of all of Alsace, parts of Lorraine, and enormous reparations. The Government of National Defence decided to continue the war and raise a new army to fight the Germans. The newly organized French armies won a single victory at Coulmiers on 10 November, but an attempt by General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot on 29 November at Villiers to break out of Paris was defeated with a loss of 4,000 soldiers, compared with 1,700 German casualties.

Everyday life for Parisians became increasingly difficult during the siege. In December, temperatures dropped to , and the Seine froze for three weeks. Parisians suffered shortages of food, firewood, coal and medicine. The city was almost completely dark at night. The only communication with the outside world was by balloon, carrier pigeon, or letters packed in iron balls floated down the Seine. Rumours and conspiracy theories abounded. Because supplies of ordinary food ran out, starving denizens ate most of the city zoo&#x27;s animals, then resorted to feeding on rats.

By early January 1871, Bismarck and the Germans themselves were tired of the prolonged siege. They installed seventy-two 120- and 150-mm artillery pieces in the forts around Paris and on 5 January began to bombard the city day and night. Between 300 and 600 shells hit the centre of the city every day.

=== Uprising and armistice ===
Between 11 and 19 January 1871, the French armies had been defeated on four fronts and Paris was facing a famine. General Trochu received reports from the prefect of Paris that agitation against the government and military leaders was increasing in the political clubs and in the National Guard of the working-class neighbourhoods of Belleville, La Chapelle, Montmartre, and Gros-Caillou.

At midday on 22 January, three or four hundred National Guards and members of radical groups—mostly Blanquists—gathered outside the Hôtel de Ville. A battalion of from Brittany was inside the building to defend it in case of an assault. The demonstrators presented their demands that the military be placed under civil control, and that there be an immediate election of a commune. The atmosphere was tense, and in the middle of the afternoon, gunfire broke out between the two sides; each side blamed the other for firing first. Six demonstrators were killed, and the army cleared the square. The government quickly banned two publications, &#x27; of Delescluze and &#x27; of Pyat, and arrested 83 revolutionaries.

At the same time as the demonstration in Paris, the leaders of the Government of National Defence in Bordeaux had concluded that the war could not continue. On 26 January, they signed a ceasefire and armistice, with special conditions for Paris. The city would not be occupied by the Germans. Regular soldiers would give up their arms, but would not be taken into captivity. Paris would pay an indemnity of 200 million francs. At Jules Favre&#x27;s request, Bismarck agreed not to disarm the National Guard, so that order could be maintained in the city.

=== Adolphe Thiers; parliamentary elections of 1871 ===

The national government in Bordeaux called for national elections at the end of January, held just ten days later on 8 February. Most electors in France were rural, Catholic and conservative, and this was reflected in the results; of the 645 deputies assembled in Bordeaux on February, about 400 favoured a constitutional monarchy under either Henri, Count of Chambord (grandson of Charles X) or Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (grandson of Louis Philippe).

Of the 200 republicans in the new parliament, 80 were former Orléanists (Philippe&#x27;s supporters) and moderately conservative. They were led by Adolphe Thiers, who was elected in 26 departments, the most of any candidate. There were an equal number of more radical republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Ferry, who wanted a republic without a monarch, and who felt that signing the peace treaty was unavoidable. Finally, on the extreme left, there were the radical republicans and socialists, a group that included Louis Blanc, Léon Gambetta and Georges Clemenceau. This group was dominant in Paris, where they won 37 of the 42 seats.

On 17 February the new parliament elected the 74-year-old Thiers as chief executive of the Third Republic. He was considered to be the candidate most likely to bring peace and to restore order. Long an opponent of the Prussian war, Thiers persuaded parliament that peace was necessary. He travelled to Versailles, where Bismarck and the German Emperor were waiting, and on 24 February the armistice was signed.

=== Dispute over cannons of Paris ===

At the end of the war, 400 obsolete muzzle-loading bronze cannons, paid for by the Paris public via a subscription, remained in the city. The new Central Committee of the National Guard, now dominated by radicals, decided to put the cannons in parks in the working-class neighborhoods of Belleville, Buttes-Chaumont and Montmartre, to keep them away from the regular army and to defend the city against any attack by the national government. Thiers was equally determined to bring the cannons under national-government control.

Clemenceau, a friend of several revolutionaries, tried to negotiate a compromise; some cannons would remain in Paris and the rest go to the army. However, neither Thiers nor the National Assembly accepted his proposals. The chief executive wanted to restore order and national authority in Paris as quickly as possible, and the cannons became a symbol of that authority. The Assembly also refused to prolong the moratorium on debt collections imposed during the war; and suspended two radical newspapers, &#x27; of Jules Valles and &#x27; of Henri Rochefort, which further inflamed Parisian radical opinion. Thiers also decided to move the National Assembly and government from Bordeaux to Versailles, rather than to Paris, to be farther away from the pressure of demonstrations, which further enraged the National Guard and the radical political clubs.

On 17 March 1871, there was a meeting of Thiers and his cabinet, who were joined by Paris mayor Jules Ferry, National Guard commander General Louis d&#x27;Aurelle de Paladines and General Joseph Vinoy, commander of the regular army units in Paris. Thiers announced a plan to send the army the next day to take charge of the cannons. The plan was initially opposed by War Minister Adolphe Le Flô, d&#x27;Aurelle de Paladines, and Vinoy, who argued that the move was premature, because the army had too few soldiers, was undisciplined and demoralized, and that many units had become politicized and were unreliable. Vinoy urged that they wait until Germany had released the French prisoners of war, and the army returned to full strength. Thiers insisted that the planned operation must go ahead as quickly as possible, to have the element of surprise. If the seizure of the cannon was not successful, the government would withdraw from the centre of Paris, build up its forces, and then attack with overwhelming force, as they had done during the uprising of June 1848. The Council accepted his decision, and Vinoy gave orders for the operation to begin the next day.

=== Failed seizure attempt and government retreat ===

Early in the morning of 18 March, two brigades of soldiers climbed the butte of Montmartre, where the largest collection of cannons, 170 in number, were located. A small group of revolutionary national guardsmen were already there, and there was a brief confrontation between the brigade led by General Claude Lecomte, and the National Guard; one guardsman, named Turpin, was shot, later dying. Word of the shooting spread quickly, and members of the National Guard from all over the neighbourhood, along with others including Clemenceau, hurried to the site to confront the soldiers.

While the Army had succeeded in securing the cannons at Belleville and Buttes-Chaumont and other strategic points, at Montmartre a crowd gathered and continued to grow, and the situation grew increasingly tense. The horses that were needed to take the cannon away did not arrive, and the army units were immobilized. As the soldiers were surrounded, they began to break ranks and join the crowd. General Lecomte tried to withdraw, and then ordered his soldiers to load their weapons and fix bayonets. He thrice ordered them to fire, but the soldiers refused. Some of the officers were disarmed and taken to the city hall of Montmartre, under the protection of Clemenceau. General Lecomte and his staff officers were seized by the guardsmen and his mutinous soldiers and taken to the local headquarters of the National Guard under the command of captain Simon Charles Mayer at the ballroom of the Chateau-Rouge. The officers were pelted with rocks, struck, threatened, and insulted by the crowd. In the middle of the afternoon, Lecomte and the other officers were taken to 6 rue des Rosiers by members of a group calling themselves the Committee of Vigilance of the 18th , who demanded that they be tried and executed.

At 5:00 in the afternoon, the National Guard had captured another important prisoner: General Jacques Leon Clément-Thomas. An ardent republican and fierce disciplinarian, he had helped suppress the armed uprising of June 1848 against the Second Republic. Because of his republican beliefs, he had been arrested by Napoleon III and exiled, and had only returned to France after the downfall of the Empire. He was particularly hated by the national guardsmen of Montmartre and Belleville because of the severe discipline he imposed during the siege of Paris. Earlier that day, dressed in civilian clothes, he had been trying to find out what was going on, when he was recognized by a soldier and arrested, and brought to the building at rue des Rosiers. At about 5:30 on 18 March, the angry crowd of national guardsmen and deserters from Lecomte&#x27;s regiment at rue des Rosiers seized Clément-Thomas, beat him with rifle butts, pushed him into the garden, and shot him repeatedly. A few minutes later, they did the same to General Lecomte. Doctor Jean Casimir Félix Guyon, who examined the bodies shortly afterwards, found forty bullets in Clément-Thomas&#x27;s body and nine in Lecomte&#x27;s back. By late morning, the operation to recapture the cannons had failed, and crowds and barricades were appearing in all the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. General Vinoy ordered the army to pull back to the Seine, and Thiers began to organise a withdrawal to Versailles, where he could gather enough troops to take back Paris.

On the afternoon of 18 March, following the government&#x27;s failed attempt to seize the cannons at Montmartre, the Central Committee of the National Guard ordered the three battalions to seize the Hôtel de Ville, where they believed the government was located. They were not aware that Thiers, the government, and the military commanders were at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the gates were open and there were few guards. They were also unaware that Marshal Patrice MacMahon, the future commander of the forces against the Commune, had just arrived at his home in Paris, having just been released from imprisonment in Germany. As soon as he heard the news of the uprising, he made his way to the railway station, where national guardsmen were already stopping and checking the identity of departing passengers. A sympathetic station manager hid him in his office and helped him board a train, and he escaped the city. While he was at the railway station, national guardsmen sent by the Central Committee arrived at his house looking for him.

On the advice of General Vinoy, Thiers ordered the evacuation to Versailles of all the regular forces in Paris, some 40,000 soldiers, including those in the fortresses around the city; the regrouping of all the army units in Versailles; and the departure of all government ministries from the city.

=== National Guard takes power ===

In February, while the national government had been organising in Bordeaux, a new rival government had been organised in Paris. The National Guard had not been disarmed as per the armistice, and had on paper 260 battalions of 1,500 men each, a total of 390,000 men. Between 15 and 24 February, some 500 delegates elected by the National Guard began meeting in Paris. On 15 March, just before the confrontation between the National Guard and the regular army over the cannons, 1,325 delegates of the federation of organisations created by the National Guard elected a leader, Giuseppe Garibaldi (who was in Italy and respectfully declined the title), and created a Central Committee of 38 members, which made its headquarters in a school on the rue Basfroi, between Place de la Bastille and . The first vote of the new Central Committee was to refuse to recognise the authority of General D&#x27;Aurelle de Paladines, the official commander of the National Guard appointed by Thiers, or of General Vinoy, the Military Governor of Paris.

Late on 18 March, when they learned that the regular army was leaving Paris, units of the National Guard moved quickly to take control of the city. The first to take action were the followers of Blanqui, who went quickly to the Latin Quarter and took charge of the gunpowder stored in the Panthéon, and to the Orléans railway station. Four battalions crossed the Seine and captured the prefecture of police, while other units occupied the former headquarters of the National Guard at the Place Vendôme, as well as the Ministry of Justice. That night, the National Guard occupied the offices vacated by the government; they quickly took over the Ministries of Finance, the Interior, and War. At eight in the morning the next day, the Central Committee was meeting in the Hôtel de Ville. By the end of the day, 20,000 national guardsmen camped in triumph in the square in front of the Hôtel de Ville, with several dozen cannons. A red flag was hoisted over the building.

The extreme-left members of the Central Committee, led by the Blanquists, demanded an immediate march on Versailles to disperse the Thiers government and to impose their authority on all of France; but the majority first wanted to establish a more solid base of legal authority in Paris. The Committee officially lifted the state of siege, named commissions to administer the government, and called elections for 23 March. They also sent a delegation of mayors of the Paris , led by Clemenceau, to negotiate with Thiers in Versailles to obtain a special independent status for Paris.

On 22 March 1871, demonstrators holding banners declaring them to be &quot;Friends of Peace&quot; were blocked from entering the Place Vendôme by guardsmen who, after being fired on, opened fire on the crowd. At least 12 people were killed and many wounded. The event was labeled the Massacre in the Rue de la Paix.

=== Council elections ===

In Paris, hostility was growing between the elected republican mayors, including Clemenceau, who believed that they were legitimate leaders of Paris, and the Central Committee of the National Guard. On 22 March, the day before the elections, the Central Committee declared that it, not the mayors, was the legitimate government of Paris. It declared that Clemenceau was no longer the Mayor of Montmartre, and seized the city hall there, as well as the city halls of the 1st and 2nd , which were occupied by more radical national guardsmen. &quot;We are caught between two bands of crazy people,&quot; Clemenceau complained, &quot;those sitting in Versailles and those in Paris.&quot;

The elections of 26 March elected a Commune council of 92 members, one for every 20,000 residents. Ahead of the elections, the Central Committee and the leaders of the International gave out their lists of candidates, mostly belonging to the extreme left. The candidates had only a few days to campaign. Thiers&#x27; government in Versailles urged Parisians to abstain from voting. When the voting was finished, 233,000 Parisians had voted, out of 485,000 registered voters, or forty-eight percent. In upper-class neighborhoods many abstained from voting: 77 percent of voters in the 7th and 8th arrondissements; 68 percent in the 15th, 66 percent in the 16th, and 62 percent in the 6th and 9th. But in the working-class neighborhoods, turnout was high: 76 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 65 percent in the 19th, and 55 to 60 percent in the 10th, 11th, and 12th.

A few candidates, including Blanqui (who had been arrested when outside Paris, and was in prison in Brittany), won in several . Other candidates who were elected, including about twenty moderate republicans and five radicals, refused to take their seats. In the end, the council had just 60 members. Nine of the winners were Blanquists (some of whom were also from the International); twenty-five, including Delescluze and Pyat, classified themselves as &quot;Independent Revolutionaries&quot;; about fifteen were from the International; the rest were from a variety of radical groups. One of the best-known candidates, Clemenceau, received only 752 votes. The professions represented in the council were 33 workers; five small businessmen; 19 clerks, accountants and other office staff; twelve journalists; and a selection of workers in the liberal arts. 20 members were Freemasons. All were men; women were not allowed to vote. The winners were announced on 27 March, and a large ceremony and parade by the National Guard was held the next day in front of the Hôtel de Ville, decorated with red flags.

=== Organisation and early work ===
The new Commune held its first meeting on 28 March in a euphoric mood. The members adopted a dozen proposals, including an honorary presidency for Blanqui; the abolition of the death penalty; the abolition of military conscription; a proposal to send delegates to other cities to help launch communes there; and a resolution declaring that membership in the Paris Commune was incompatible with being a member of the National Assembly. This was aimed particularly at Pierre Tirard, the republican mayor of the 2nd arrondissement, who had been elected to both Commune and National Assembly. Seeing the more radical political direction of the new Commune, Tirard and some twenty republicans decided it was wisest to resign from the Commune. A resolution was also passed, after a long debate, that the deliberations of the council were to be secret, since the Commune was effectively at war with the government in Versailles and should not make its intentions known to the enemy.

Following the model proposed by the more radical members, the new government had no president, no mayor, and no commander in chief. The Commune began by establishing nine commissions, similar to those of the National Assembly, to manage the affairs of Paris. The commissions in turn reported to an Executive Commission. One of the first measures passed declared that military conscription was abolished, that no military force other than the National Guard could be formed or introduced into the capital, and that all healthy male citizens were members of the National Guard. The new system had one important weakness: the National Guard now had two different commanders. They reported to both the Central Committee of the National Guard and to the Executive Commission, and it was not clear which one was in charge of the inevitable war with Thiers&#x27; government.

== Administration and actions ==

=== Programme ===
The Commune adopted the discarded French Republican Calendar during its brief existence and used the socialist red flag rather than the republican tricolor. Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services for the city which at the time consisted of two million residents. It also reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and social democracy. Because the Commune met on fewer than sixty days before it was suppressed, only a few decrees were actually implemented. The decrees included:
* remission of rents owed for the entire period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended);
* abolition of child labour and night work in bakeries;
* granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of national guardsmen killed in active service;
* free return by pawnshops of all workmen&#x27;s tools and household items, valued up to 20 francs, pledged during the siege;
* postponement of commercial debt obligations, and the abolition of interest on the debts;
* right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it were deserted by its owner; the Commune, nonetheless, recognised the previous owner&#x27;s right to compensation;
* prohibition of fines imposed by employers on their workmen.

=== Feminist initiatives ===
Women played an important role in both the initiation and the governance of the Commune, though women could not vote in the Commune elections and there were no elected women members of the Commune itself. Their participation included building barricades and caring for wounded fighters. Joséphine Marchais, a washer woman, picked up a gun during the battles of 22-23 May and said, &quot;You cowardly crew! Go and Fight! If I&#x27;m killed it will be because I&#x27;ve done some killing first!&quot; She was arrested as an incendiary, but there is no documentation that she was a (female arsonist). She worked as a with the . While carrying back the laundry she was given by the guardsmen, she carried away the body of her lover, Jean Guy, who was a butcher&#x27;s apprentice. There were reports in various newspapers of female arsonists, but evidence remains weak. The &quot;Paris Journal&quot; reported that soldiers arrested 13 women who allegedly threw petrol into houses. There were rumours that were paid 10 francs per house. While it was clear that communard arsonists burned the Tuileries Palace, the Hotel de Ville and other landmarks, the reports of women participating were exaggerated at the time.

Some women organised a feminist movement, following earlier attempts in 1789 and 1848. Thus, Nathalie Lemel, a socialist bookbinder, and Élisabeth Dmitrieff, a young Russian exile and member of the Russian section of the First International, created the Women&#x27;s Union for the Defence of Paris and Care of the Wounded on 11 April 1871. The feminist writer André Léo, a friend of Paule Minck, was also active in the Women&#x27;s Union. Believing that the situation of women could only be improved through a global struggle against capitalism, the association demanded gender and wage equality, the right of divorce for women, the right to secular education, and professional education for girls. They also demanded suppression of the distinction between married women and concubines, and between legitimate and illegitimate children. They advocated the abolition of prostitution (obtaining the closing of the maisons de tolérance, or legal brothels). The Women&#x27;s Union also participated in several municipal commissions and organised cooperative workshops. Along with Eugène Varlin, Nathalie Lemel created the cooperative restaurant , which served free food for indigents, and then fought during the Bloody Week on the barricades.

Paule Minck opened a free school in the Church of Saint Pierre de Montmartre and ran the in the Church of Saint-Sulpice on the Left Bank. The Russian Anne Jaclard, who declined to marry Dostoyevsky and finally became the wife of Blanquist activist Victor Jaclard, founded the newspaper with André Léo. She was also a member of the , along with Louise Michel and Paule Minck, as well as of the Russian section of the First International. Victorine Brocher, close to the IWA activists, and founder of a cooperative bakery in 1867, also fought during the Commune and the Bloody Week. Louise Michel, the famed &quot;Red Virgin of Montmartre&quot; (see photo), who would later be deported to New Caledonia, was one of those who symbolised the active participation of a small number of women in the insurrectionary events. A women&#x27;s battalion of the National Guard defended the Place Blanche during the repression.

=== Bank of France ===
The Commune named François Jourde as the head of the Commission of Finance. A former clerk of a notary, accountant in a bank and employee of the city&#x27;s bridges and roads department, Jourde maintained the Commune&#x27;s accounts with prudence. Paris&#x27;s tax receipts amounted to 20 million francs, with another six million seized at the Hôtel de Ville. The expenses of the Commune were 42 million, the largest part going to pay the daily salary of the National Guard. Jourde first obtained a loan from the Rothschild Bank, then paid the bills from the city account, which was soon exhausted.

The gold reserves of the Bank of France had been moved out of Paris for safety in August 1870, in addition to 88 million francs in gold coins and 166 million francs in banknotes. When the Thiers government left Paris in March, they did not have the time or the reliable soldiers to take the money with them. The reserves were guarded by 500 national guardsmen who were themselves Bank of France employees. Some Communards wanted to appropriate the bank&#x27;s reserves to fund social projects, but Jourde resisted, explaining that without the gold reserves the currency would collapse and all the money of the Commune would be worthless. The Commune appointed Charles Beslay as the Commissioner of the Bank of France, and he arranged for the Bank to loan the Commune 400,000 francs a day. This was approved by Thiers, who felt that to negotiate a future peace treaty the Germans were demanding war reparations of five billion francs; the gold reserves would be needed to keep the franc stable and pay the indemnity. Jourde&#x27;s actions were later condemned by Karl Marx and other Marxists, who felt the Commune should have confiscated the bank&#x27;s reserves.

===Press===
From 21 March, the Central Committee of the National Guard banned the major pro-Versailles newspapers, and . Their offices were invaded and closed by crowds of the Commune&#x27;s supporters. After 18 April other newspapers sympathetic to Versailles were also closed. The Versailles government, in turn, imposed strict censorship and prohibited any publication in favour of the Commune.

At the same time, the number of pro-Commune newspapers and magazines published in Paris during the Commune expanded exponentially. The most popular of the pro-Commune newspapers was &#x27;, published by Jules Vallès, which was published from 22 February until 23 May. Another highly popular publication was &#x27;, inspired by a similar paper of the same name published from 1790 until 1794; after its first issue on 6 March, it was briefly closed by General Vinoy, but it reappeared until 23 May. It specialised in humour, vulgarity and extreme abuse against the opponents of the Commune.

A republican press also flourished, including such papers as &#x27; of Henri Rochefort, which was both violently anti-Versailles and critical of the faults and excesses of the Commune. The most popular republican paper was &#x27;, which condemned both Thiers and the killing of generals Lecomte and Clement-Thomas by the Communards. Its editor Auguste Vacquerie was close to Victor Hugo, whose son François-Victor Hugo wrote for the paper. The editors wrote, &quot;We are against the National Assembly, but we are not for the Commune. That which we defend, that which we love, that which we admire, is Paris.&quot;

=== Anti-clericalism ===

From the beginning, the Commune had a hostile relationship with the Catholic Church. On 2 April, soon after the Commune was established, it voted a decree accusing the Catholic Church of &quot;complicity in the crimes of the monarchy.&quot; The decree declared the separation of church and state, confiscated the state funds allotted to the Church, seized the property of religious congregations, and ordered that Catholic schools cease religious education and become secular.
Over the next seven weeks, some two hundred priests, nuns and monks were arrested, and twenty-six churches were closed to the public. At the urging of the more radical newspapers, National Guard units searched the basements of churches, looking for evidence of alleged sadism and criminal practices. More extreme elements of the National Guard carried out mock religious processions and parodies of religious services. Some churches, like Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois, were turned into socialist meeting clubs.

Early in May, some of the political clubs began to demand the immediate execution of Archbishop Darboy and the other priests in the prison. The Archbishop and a number of priests were executed during Bloody Week, in retaliation for the execution of Commune soldiers by the regular army.

===Destruction of the Vendôme Column===

The destruction of the Vendôme Column honouring the victories of Napoleon I, topped by a statue of the Emperor, was one of the most prominent civic events during the Commune. It was voted on 12 April by the executive committee of the Commune, which declared that the column was &quot;a monument of barbarism&quot; and a &quot;symbol of brute force and false pride.&quot; The idea had originally come from the painter Gustave Courbet, who had written to the Government of National Defence on 4 September calling for the demolition of the column. In October, he had called for a new column, made of melted-down German cannons, &quot;the column of peoples, the column of Germany and France, forever federated.&quot; Courbet was elected to the Council of the Commune on 16 April, after the decision to tear down the column had already been made. The ceremonial destruction took place on 16 May. In the presence of two battalions of the National Guard and the leaders of the Commune, a band played &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and the &quot;Chant du Départ&quot;. The first effort to pull down the column failed, but at 5:30 in the afternoon the column broke from its base and shattered into three pieces. The pedestal was draped with red flags, and pieces of the statue were taken to be melted down and made into coins.

On 12 May a crowd organised by the Commune destroyed the residence of Adolphe Thiers, the leader of the Third Republic, on Place Saint-Georges. Proposed by Henri Rochefort, editor of the , on 6 April, it was not voted upon by the Commune until 10 May.

== War with the national government ==

=== Mobilization of both sides and attack by the government army ===

In Versailles, Thiers had estimated that he needed 150,000 men to recapture Paris, and that he had only about 20,000 reliable first-line soldiers, plus about 5,000 gendarmes. He worked rapidly to assemble a new and reliable regular army. Most of the soldiers were prisoners of war who had just been released by the Germans, following the terms of the armistice. Others were sent from military units in all of the provinces. To command the new army, Thiers chose Patrice MacMahon, who had won fame fighting the Austrians in Italy under Napoleon III, and who had been seriously wounded at the Battle of Sedan. He was highly popular both within the army and in the country. By 30 March, less than two weeks after the Army&#x27;s Montmartre rout, it began skirmishing with the National Guard on the outskirts of Paris.

The Versailles Army was the first to attack. On 21 March, they occupied the fort of Mont-Valérien where the Commune&#x27;s fédérés had neglected to settle: this position which dominated the entire near western suburbs of Paris gave them a considerable advantage. On 30 March, General de Gallifet occupied the Courbevoie roundabout and on 2 April, the Versaillais seized Courbevoie and Puteaux, the fédérés retreating towards Neuilly.

=== Failure of the march on Versailles ===

In Paris, members of the Military Commission and the executive committee of the Commune, as well as the Central Committee of the National Guard, met on 1 April. They decided to launch an offensive against the Army in Versailles within five days. The attack was first launched on the morning of 2 April by five battalions who crossed the Seine at the Pont de Neuilly. The National Guard troops were quickly repulsed by the Army, with a loss of about twelve soldiers. One officer of the Versailles army, a surgeon from the medical corps, was killed; the National Guardsmen had mistaken his uniform for that of a gendarme. Five national guardsmen were captured by the regulars; two were Army deserters and two were caught with their weapons in their hands. General Vinoy, the commander of the Paris Military District, had ordered any prisoners who were deserters from the Army to be shot. The commander of the regular forces, Colonel Georges Ernest Boulanger, went further and ordered that all four prisoners be summarily shot. The practice of shooting prisoners captured with weapons became common in the bitter fighting in the weeks ahead.

Despite this first failure, Commune leaders were still convinced that, as at Montmartre, French army soldiers would refuse to fire on national guardsmen. They prepared a massive offensive of 27,000 national guardsmen who would advance in three columns. They were expected to converge at the end of 24 hours at the gates of the Palace of Versailles. They advanced on the morning of 3 April—without cavalry to protect the flanks, without artillery, without stores of food and ammunition, and without ambulances—confident of rapid success. They passed by the line of forts outside the city, believing them to be occupied by national guardsmen. In fact the army had re-occupied the abandoned forts on 28 March. The National Guard soon came under heavy artillery and rifle fire; they broke ranks and fled back to Paris. Once again national guardsmen captured with weapons were routinely shot by army units.

=== Decree on Hostages ===
Commune leaders responded to the execution of prisoners by the Army by passing a new order on 5 April—the Decree on Hostages, which will only be implemented when the insurrection is crushed (Bloody Week). Under the decree, any person accused of complicity with the Versailles government could be immediately arrested, imprisoned and tried by a special jury of accusation. Those convicted by the jury would become &quot;hostages of the people of Paris.&quot; Article 5 stated, &quot;Every execution of a prisoner of war or of a partisan of the government of the Commune of Paris will be immediately followed by the execution of a triple number of hostages held by virtue of article four.&quot; Prisoners of war would be brought before a jury, which would decide if they would be released or held as hostages.

The National Assembly in Versailles responded to the decree the next day; it passed a law allowing military tribunals to judge and punish suspects within 24 hours. Émile Zola wrote, &quot;Thus we citizens of Paris are placed between two terrible laws; the law of suspects brought back by the Commune and the law on rapid executions which will certainly be approved by the Assembly. They are not fighting with cannon shots, they are slaughtering each other with decrees.&quot; About one hundred hostages, including the Archbishop, were shot by the Commune before its end.

=== Radicalisation ===

By April, as MacMahon&#x27;s forces steadily approached Paris, divisions arose within the Commune about whether to give absolute priority to military defence, or to political and social freedoms and reforms. The majority, including the Blanquists and the more radical revolutionaries, supported by of Pyat and of Vermersch, supported giving the military priority. The publications , and Valles&#x27; feared that a more authoritarian government would destroy the kind of social republic they wanted to achieve. Soon, the Council of the Commune voted, with strong opposition, for the creation of a Committee of Public Safety, modelled on and named after the committee that carried out the Reign of Terror (1793–94). Because of the implications carried by its name, many members of the Commune opposed the Committee of Public Safety&#x27;s creation.

The committee was given extensive powers to hunt down and imprison enemies of the Commune. Led by Raoul Rigault, it began to make several arrests, usually on suspicion of treason, intelligence with the enemy, or insults to the Commune. Those arrested included General Edmond-Charles de Martimprey, the governor of Les Invalides, alleged to have caused the assassination of revolutionaries in December 1851—as well as more recent commanders of the National Guard, including Gustave Cluseret. High religious officials had been arrested: Archbishop Darboy, the Vicar General Abbé Lagarde, and the Curé of the Madeleine Abbé Deguerry. The policy of holding hostages for possible reprisals was denounced by some defenders of the Commune, including Victor Hugo, in a poem entitled &quot;No Reprisals&quot; published in Brussels on 21 April. On 12 April, Rigault proposed to exchange Archbishop Darboy and several other priests for the imprisoned Blanqui. Thiers refused the proposal, arguing that it would encourage more hostage-taking. On 14 May, Rigault proposed to exchange 70 hostages for the extreme-left leader, and Thiers again refused.

=== Composition of the National Guard ===
Since every able-bodied man in Paris was obliged to be a member of the National Guard, the Commune on paper had an army of about 200,000 men on 6 May; the actual number was much lower, probably between 25,000 and 50,000 men. At the beginning of May, 20 percent of the National Guard was reported absent without leave.

By the end of the Commune, 43,522 prisoners were captured, 7,000 to 8,000 Communards had gone into exile abroad, and an estimated 10 to 15,000 Communards were killed, giving a total Commune force of about 65,000 men.

The National Guard had hundreds of cannons and thousands of rifles in its arsenal, but only half of the cannons and two-thirds of the rifles were ever used. There were heavy naval cannons mounted on the ramparts of Paris, but few national guardsmen were trained to use them. Between the end of April and 20 May, the number of trained artillerymen fell from 5,445 to 2,340.

The officers of the National Guard were elected by the soldiers, and their leadership qualities and military skills varied widely. Gustave Cluseret, the commander of the National Guard until his dismissal on 1 May, had tried to impose more discipline in the force, disbanding many unreliable units and making soldiers live in barracks instead of at home. He recruited officers with military experience, particularly Poles who had fled to France in 1863, after the Russians quelled the January Uprising; they played a prominent role in the last days of the Commune. One of these officers was General Jaroslav Dombrowski (), a Polish noble and a former Imperial Russian Army officer, who was appointed commander of the Commune forces on the right bank of the Seine. On 5 May, he was appointed commander of the Commune&#x27;s whole army. Dombrowski held this position until 23 May, when he was killed while defending the city barricades.

=== Capture of Fort Issy ===
One of the key strategic points around Paris was Fort Issy, south of the city near the Porte de Versailles, which blocked the route of the Army into Paris. The fort&#x27;s garrison was commanded by Leon Megy, a former mechanic and a militant Blanquist, who had been sentenced to 20 years of hard labour for killing a policeman. After being freed he had led the takeover of the prefecture of Marseille by militant revolutionaries. When he came back to Paris, he was given the rank of colonel by the Central Committee of the National Guard, and the command of Fort Issy on 13 April.

The army commander, General Ernest de Cissey, began a systematic siege and a heavy bombardment of the fort that lasted three days and three nights. At the same time Cissey sent a message to Colonel Megy, with the permission of Marshal MacMahon, offering to spare the lives of the fort&#x27;s defenders, and let them return to Paris with their belongings and weapons, if they surrendered the fort. Colonel Megy gave the order, and during the night of 29–30 April, most of the soldiers evacuated the fort and returned to Paris. But news of the evacuation reached the Central Committee of the National Guard and the Commune. Before General Cissey and the Versailles army could occupy the fort, the National Guard rushed reinforcements there and re-occupied all the positions. General Cluseret, commander of the National Guard, was dismissed and put in prison. General Cissey resumed the intense bombardment of the fort. The defenders resisted until the night of 7–8 May, when the remaining national guardsmen in the fort, unable to withstand further attacks, decided to withdraw. The new commander of the National Guard, Louis Rossel, issued a terse bulletin: &quot;The tricolor flag flies over the fort of Issy, abandoned yesterday by the garrison.&quot; The abandonment of the fort led the Commune to dismiss Rossel, and replace him with Delescluze, a fervent Communard but a journalist with no military experience.

Bitter fighting followed, as MacMahon&#x27;s army worked their way systematically forward to the walls of Paris. On 20 May, MacMahon&#x27;s artillery batteries at Montretout, Mont-Valerian, Boulogne, Issy, and Vanves opened fire on the western neighbourhoods of the city—Auteuil, Passy, and Trocadéro—with shells falling close to l&#x27;Étoile. Dombrowski reported that the soldiers he had sent to defend the ramparts of the city between Point du Jour and Porte d&#x27;Auteuil had retreated to the city; he had only 4,000 soldiers left at la Muette, 2,000 at Neuilly, and 200 at Asnières and Saint Ouen. &quot;I lack artillerymen and workers to hold off the catastrophe.&quot; On 19 May, while the Commune executive committee was meeting to judge the former military commander Cluseret for the loss of the Issy fortress, it received word that the forces of Marshal MacMahon were within the fortifications of Paris.

== &quot;Bloody Week&quot; ==

=== 21 May: Army enters Paris ===
The final offensive on Paris by MacMahon&#x27;s army began on Sunday, 21 May. On the front line in the southwest, soldiers camped just outside the city learned from an agent inside the walls that the National Guard had withdrawn from one section of the city wall at Point-du-Jour, and the fortifications were undefended. An army engineer crossed the moat and inspected the empty fortifications, and immediately telegraphed the news to Marshal MacMahon, who was with Thiers at Fort Mont-Valérien. MacMahon promptly gave orders, and two battalions passed through the fortifications without meeting resistance. The Versailles forces were able to swiftly capture the city gates of the Porte de Saint-Cloud, La Muette and the Porte de Versailles from inside. By four o&#x27;clock in the morning, fifty thousand soldiers had passed into the city, and advanced as far as the Champs-Élysées.

When he received the news from Dombrowski that the army was inside Paris, the Commune leader Delescluze refused to believe it, and refused to ring the bells to warn the city until the following morning. The trial of Gustave Cluseret, the former commander, was still going on at the Commune when they received the message from General Dombrowski that the army was inside the city. He asked for reinforcements and proposed an immediate counterattack. &quot;Remain calm,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and everything will be saved. We must not be defeated!&quot;. When they had received this news, the members of the Commune executive returned to their deliberations on the fate of Cluseret, which continued until eight o&#x27;clock that evening.

The first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and Dombrowski was the first to be accused. Rumours circulated that he had accepted a million francs to give up the city. He was deeply offended by the rumours. They stopped when Dombrowski died two days later from wounds received on the barricades. His last reported words were: &quot;Do they still say I was a traitor?&quot;

=== 22 May: Barricades, first street battles ===
On the morning of 22 May, bells finally were rung around the city, and Delescluze, as delegate for war of the Commune, issued a proclamation, posted all over Paris:

The Committee of Public Safety issued its own decree:

Despite the appeals, only fifteen to twenty thousand persons, including many women and children, responded. The forces of the Commune were outnumbered five-to-one by the army of Marshal MacMahon.

Once the fighting began inside Paris, the strong neighborhood loyalties that had been an advantage of the Commune became something of a disadvantage: instead of an overall planned defence, each &quot;quartier&quot; fought desperately for its survival, and each was overcome in turn. The webs of narrow streets that made entire districts nearly impregnable in earlier Parisian revolutions had in the centre been replaced by wide boulevards during Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. The Versailles forces enjoyed a centralised command and had superior numbers. Equally important, they had learned the tactics of street fighting from 1848 and earlier uprisings. They avoided making frontal attacks on Commune barricades. They tunnelled through walls of neighbouring houses to establish positions above the barricades, and gradually worked their way around and behind them, usually forcing the Communards to withdraw without a fight. The majority of the barricades in Paris were abandoned without combat. On the morning of 22 May, the regular army occupied a large area from the Porte Dauphine; to the Champ de Mars and the École Militaire, where General Cissey established his headquarters; to the Porte de Vanves. In a short time the 5th corps of the army advanced toward Parc Monceau and Place Clichy, while General Félix Douay occupied the Place de l&#x27;Étoile and General Clichant occupied the Gare Saint-Lazare. Little resistance was encountered in the west of Paris, but the army moved forward slowly and cautiously, in no hurry.

No one had expected the army to enter the city, so only a few large barricades were already in place, on the rue Saint-Florentin and Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, and the rue de Rivoli. Barricades had not been prepared in advance; some nine hundred barricades were built hurriedly out of paving stones and sacks of earth. Many other people prepared shelters in the cellars. The first serious fighting took place on the afternoon of the 22nd, an artillery duel between regular army batteries on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay and the Madeleine, and National Guard batteries on the terrace of the Tuileries Palace. On the same day, the first executions of National Guard soldiers by the regular army inside Paris took place; some sixteen prisoners captured on the rue du Bac were given a summary hearing, and then shot.

===23 May: Battle for Montmartre; burning of Tuileries Palace===
On 23 May the next objective of the army was the butte Montmartre, where the uprising had begun. The National Guard had built and manned a circle of barricades and makeshift forts around the base of the butte. The eighty-five cannon and twenty rapid-firing guns captured from the army at the beginning of the Commune were still there, but no one had expected an attack and they had no ammunition, powder cartridges or trained gunners.

The garrison of one barricade, at Chaussee Clignancourt, included a battalion of about thirty women, including Louise Michel, the celebrated &quot;Red Virgin of Montmartre&quot;, who had already participated in many battles outside the city. She was seized by regular soldiers and thrown into the trench in front of the barricade and left for dead. She escaped and soon afterwards surrendered to the army, to prevent the arrest of her mother. The battalions of the National Guard were no match for the army; by midday on the 23rd the regular soldiers were at the top of Montmartre, and the tricolor flag was raised over the Solferino tower. The soldiers captured 42 guardsmen and several women, took them to the same house on rue des Rosier where generals Clement-Thomas and Lecomte had been executed, and shot them. On the rue Royale, soldiers seized the formidable barricade around the Madeleine church; 300 prisoners captured with their weapons were shot there, the largest of the mass executions of the rebels.

On the same day, having had little success fighting the army, units of national guardsmen began to take revenge by burning public buildings symbolising the government. The guardsmen led by Paul Brunel, one of the original leaders of the Commune, took cans of oil and set fire to buildings near the rue Royale and the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Following the example set by Brunel, guardsmen set fire to dozens of other buildings on rue Saint-Florentin, rue de Rivoli, rue du Bac, rue de Lille, and other streets.

The Tuileries Palace, which had been the residence of most of the monarchs of France from Henry IV to Napoleon III, was defended by a garrison of some three hundred National Guard with thirty cannon placed in the garden. They had been engaged in a day-long artillery duel with the regular army. At about seven in the evening, the commander of the garrison, Jules Bergeret, gave the order to burn the palace. The walls, floors, curtains and woodwork were soaked with oil and turpentine, and barrels of gunpowder were placed at the foot of the grand staircase and in the courtyard, then the fires were set. The fire lasted 48 hours and gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the . Bergeret sent a message to the Hotel de Ville: &quot;The last vestiges of royalty have just disappeared. I wish that the same will happen to all the monuments of Paris.&quot;

The Richelieu library of the Louvre, connected to the Tuileries, was also set on fire and entirely destroyed. The rest of the Louvre was saved by the efforts of the museum curators and fire brigades. The consensus of later historians is that most of the major fires were started by the National Guard and several organised Communard groups; but that few if any fires were started by women. In addition to public buildings, the National Guard also started fires at the homes of a number of residents associated with the regime of Napoleon III, including that of historian and playwright Prosper Mérimée, author of &quot;Carmen&quot;.

===24 May: Burning of Hotel de Ville; executions of Communards, the archbishop and hostages===
At two in the morning on 24 May, Brunel and his men went to the Hôtel de Ville, which was still the headquarters of the Commune and of its chief executive, Delescluze. Wounded men were being tended in the halls, and some of the National Guard officers and Commune members were changing from their uniforms into civilian clothes and shaving their beards, preparing to escape from the city. Delescluze ordered everyone to leave the building, and Brunel&#x27;s men set it on fire.

The battles resumed at daylight on 24 May, under a sky black with smoke from the burning palaces and ministries. There was no co-ordination or central direction on the Commune side; each neighborhood fought on its own. The National Guard disintegrated, with many soldiers changing into civilian clothes and fleeing the city, leaving between 10,000 and 15,000 Communards to defend the barricades. Delescluze moved his headquarters from the Hôtel de Ville to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, and set fire to the Hotel de Ville. More public buildings were set afire, including the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture de Police, the theatres of Châtelet and Porte-Saint-Martin, and the Church of Saint-Eustache. Most of the Palais de Justice was destroyed, but the Sainte-Chapelle survived. Fires set at the Louvre Palace, Palais-Royal and Notre-Dame were extinguished without causing significant damage.

As the army continued its methodical advance, the summary executions of captured Communard soldiers by the army continued. Informal military courts were established at the , Châtelet, the Luxembourg Palace, Parc Monceau, and other locations around Paris. The hands of captured prisoners were examined to see if they had fired weapons. The prisoners gave their identity, sentence was pronounced by a court of two or three gendarme officers, the prisoners were taken out and sentences immediately carried out.

Amid the news of the growing number of executions carried out by the army in different parts of the city, the Communards carried out their own executions as a desperate and futile attempt at retaliation. Raoul Rigaut, the chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, without getting the authorisation of the Commune, executed one group of four prisoners, before he himself was captured and shot by an army patrol. On 24 May, a delegation of national guardsmen and Gustave Genton, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, came to the new headquarters of the Commune at the city hall of the 11th arrondissement and demanded the immediate execution of the hostages held at the prison of La Roquette. The new prosecutor of the Commune, Théophile Ferré, hesitated and then wrote a note: &quot;Order to the Citizen Director of La Roquette to execute six hostages.&quot; Genton asked for volunteers to serve as a firing squad, and went to the La Roquette prison, where many of the hostages were being held. Genton was given a list of hostages and selected six names, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris, and three priests. The governor of the prison, M. François, refused to give up the Archbishop without a specific order from the Commune. Genton sent a deputy back to the Prosecutor, who wrote &quot;and especially the archbishop&quot; on the bottom of his note. Archbishop Darboy and five other hostages were promptly taken out into the courtyard of the prison, lined up against the wall, and shot.

=== 25 May: Death of Delescluze ===
By the end of 24 May, the regular army had cleared most of the Latin Quarter barricades, and held three-fifths of Paris. MacMahon had his headquarters at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay. The insurgents held only the 11th, 12th, 19th and 20th arrondissements, and parts of the 3rd, 5th, and 13th. Delescluze and the remaining leaders of the Commune, about 20 in all, were at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement on Place Voltaire. A bitter battle took place between about 1,500 national guardsmen from the 13th arrondissement and the Mouffetard district, commanded by Walery Antoni Wróblewski, a Polish exile who had participated in the uprising against the Russians, against three brigades commanded by General de Cissey.

During the course of the 25th, the insurgents lost the city hall of the 13th arrondissement and moved to a barricade on Place Jeanne-d&#x27;Arc, where 700 were taken prisoner. Wroblewski and some of his men escaped to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, where he met Delescluze, the chief executive of the Commune. Several of the other Commune leaders, including Brunel, were wounded, and Pyat had disappeared. Delescluze offered Wroblewski the command of the Commune forces, which he declined, saying that he preferred to fight as a private soldier. At about seven-thirty, Delescluze put on his red sash of office, walked unarmed to the barricade on the Place du Château-d&#x27;Eau, climbed to the top and showed himself to the soldiers, and was promptly shot dead.

===26 May: Capture of Place de la Bastille; more executions===
On the afternoon of 26 May, after six hours of heavy fighting, the regular army captured the Place de la Bastille. The National Guard still held parts of the 3rd Arrondissement, from the Carreau du Temple to the Arts-et-Metiers, and the National Guard still had artillery at their strongpoints at the Buttes-Chaumont and Père-Lachaise, from which they continued to bombard the regular army forces along the Canal Saint-Martin.

A contingent of several dozen national guardsmen led by Antoine Clavier, a commissaire, and Emile Gois, a colonel of the National Guard, arrived at La Roquette prison and demanded, at gunpoint, the remaining hostages there: ten priests, thirty-five policemen and gendarmes, and two civilians. They took them first to the city hall of the 20th arrondissement; the Commune leader of that district refused to allow his city hall to be used as a place of execution. Clavier and Gois took them instead to Rue Haxo. The procession of hostages was joined by a large and furious crowd of national guardsmen and civilians who insulted, spat upon, and struck the hostages. Arriving at an open yard, they were lined up against a wall and shot in groups of ten. National guardsmen in the crowd opened fire along with the firing squad. The hostages were shot from all directions, then beaten with rifle butts and stabbed with bayonets. According to Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, a defender of the Commune, a total of 63 people were executed by the Commune during the bloody week.

=== 27–28 May: Final battles; executions at Père-Lachaise Cemetery ===


On the morning of 27 May, the regular army soldiers of Generals Grenier, Paul de Ladmirault and Jean-Baptiste Montaudon launched an attack on the National Guard artillery on the heights of the Buttes-Chaumont. The heights were captured at the end of the afternoon by the first regiment of the French Foreign Legion. One of the last remaining strongpoints of the National Guard was the Père Lachaise Cemetery, defended by about 200 men. At 6:00 in the evening, the army used cannon to demolish the gates and the First Regiment of naval infantry stormed the cemetery. Savage fighting followed around the tombs until nightfall, when the last Communards were taken prisoner. The captured guardsmen were taken to the wall of the cemetery and shot. Another group of prisoners, consisting of officers of the National guard, was collected at Mazas Prison and La Roquette prison. They were given brief trials before the military tribunal, sentenced to death, and then delivered to Père Lachaise. There they were lined up in front of the same wall and executed in groups, and then buried with them in a common grave. This group include one woman, the only recorded execution of a woman by the army during the Bloody Week. The wall is now called the Communards&#x27; Wall, and is the site of annual commemorations of the Commune.

On 28 May, the regular army captured the remaining positions of the Commune, which offered little resistance. In the morning, the regular army captured La Roquette prison and freed the remaining 170 hostages. The army took 1,500 prisoners at the National Guard position on Rue Haxo, and 2,000 more at Derroja, near Père Lachaise. A handful of barricades at rue Ramponneau and Avenue de Tourville held out into the middle of the afternoon, when all resistance ceased.

== Communard prisoners and casualties ==
=== Prisoners and exiles ===


The French Army officially recorded the capture of 43,522 prisoners during and immediately after Bloody Week. Of these, 1,054 were women, and 615 were under the age of 16. They were marched in groups of 150 or 200, escorted by cavalrymen, to Versailles or the Camp de Satory, where they were held in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions until they could be tried. More than half of the prisoners, 22,727, were released before trial for extenuating circumstances or on humanitarian grounds. Since Paris had been officially under a state of siege during the Commune, the prisoners were tried by military tribunals. Trials were held for 15,895 prisoners, of whom 13,500 were found guilty. Ninety-five were sentenced to death; 251 to forced labour; 1,169 to deportation, usually to New Caledonia; 3,147 to simple deportation; 1,257 to solitary confinement; 1,305 to prison for more than a year; and 2,054 to prison for less than a year.

A separate and more formal trial was held beginning 7 August for the Commune leaders who survived and had been captured, including Théophile Ferré, who had signed the death warrant for the hostages, and the painter Gustave Courbet, who had proposed the destruction of the column in Place Vendôme. They were tried by a panel of seven senior army officers. Ferré was sentenced to death, and Courbet was sentenced to six months in prison, and later ordered to pay the cost of rebuilding the column. Serving part of his sentence in the Sainte-Pélagie Prison in Paris, he was allowed an easel and paints, but he could not have models pose for him. He did a famous series of still-life paintings of flowers and fruit.
He was released, but was unable to pay for the rebuilding of the column. He went into exile in Switzerland and died before making a payment.

In October 1871 a commission of the National Assembly reviewed the sentences; 310 of those convicted were pardoned, 286 had their sentences reduced, and 1,295 commuted. Of the 270 condemned to death—175 in absentia—25 were shot, including Ferré and Gustave Genton, who had selected the hostages for execution. Thousands of Communards, including leaders such as Félix Pyat, succeeded in slipping out of Paris before the end of the battle, and went into exile; some 3,500 going to England, 2,000–3,000 to Belgium, and 1,000 to Switzerland.

A partial amnesty was granted on 3 March 1879, allowing 400 of the 600 deportees sent to New Caledonia to return, and 2,000 of the 2,400 prisoners sentenced in absentia. A general amnesty was granted on 11 July 1880, allowing the remaining 543 condemned prisoners, and 262 sentenced in absentia, to return to France.

=== Casualties ===
Historians have long debated the number of Communards killed during Bloody Week. The official army report by General Félix Antoine Appert mentioned only Army casualties, which amounted, from April through May, to 877 killed, 6,454 wounded, and 183 missing. The report assessed information on Communard casualties only as &quot;very incomplete&quot;. The issue of casualties during the Bloody Week arose at a National Assembly hearing on 28 August 1871, when Marshal MacMahon testified. Deputy M. Vacherot told him, &quot;A general has told me that the number killed in combat, on the barricades, or after the combat, was as many as 17,000 men.&quot; MacMahon responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that estimate is based upon; it seems exaggerated to me. All I can say is that the insurgents lost a lot more people than we did.&quot; Vacherot continued, &quot;Perhaps this number applies to all of the siege, and to the fighting at Forts d&#x27;Issy and Vanves.&quot; MacMahon replied, &quot;the number is exaggerated.&quot; Vacherot persisted, &quot;It was General Appert who gave me that information. Perhaps he meant both dead and wounded.&quot; MacMahon replied, &quot;That&#x27;s a different matter.&quot;

In 1876 Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, who had fought on the barricades during Bloody Week, and had gone into exile in London, wrote a highly popular and sympathetic history of the Commune. At the end, he wrote: &quot;No one knows the exact number of victims of the Bloody Week. The chief of the military justice department claimed seventeen thousand shot.&quot; This was inaccurate; Appert made no such claim, he referred only to prisoners. &quot;The municipal council of Paris,&quot; Lissagaray continued, &quot;paid for the burial of seventeen thousand bodies; but a large number of persons were killed or cremated outside of Paris.&quot; Later historians, including Robert Tombs, could not find the source Lissagaray cited for the city payment for seventeen thousand burials, and Lissagaray provided no evidence that thousands of Communards were cremated or buried outside Paris. &quot;It is no exaggeration,&quot; Lissagaray concluded, &quot;to say twenty thousand, a number admitted by the officers.&quot; But neither MacMahon or Appert had &quot;admitted&quot; that twenty thousand were killed, they both said the number was exaggerated.

In a new 1896 edition, Lissagaray wrote that the twenty thousand estimate included those killed not only in Paris, but also in the other Communes that broke out in France at the same time, and those killed in fighting outside Paris before the Bloody Week. Several historians repeated versions of Lissagaray&#x27;s estimate, among them Pierre Milza (&quot;...As many as twenty thousand&quot;), Alfred Cobban and Benedict Anderson. Vladimir Lenin said that Lissagaray&#x27;s estimate demonstrated ruling-class brutality: &quot;20,000 killed in the streets... Lessons: bourgeoisie will stop at &quot;nothing&quot;.&quot;

Between 1878 and 1880, a French historian and member of the Académie française, Maxime Du Camp, wrote a new history . Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 Communard corpses had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, for a total of 6,667.

Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it &quot;a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune&quot; and Paul Lidsky called it &quot;the bible of the anti-Communard literature.&quot; In 2012, however, supporting du Camp&#x27;s research, historian Robert Tombs made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the total number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, estimating around 1,400 of those to have been executed and the rest being killed in combat or dying from wounds received during the fighting. Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, &quot;the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.&quot;

The debate was still underway in 2021. A new book was published by mathematician Michele Audin in May, 2021, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of The Commune. Citing cemetery and police records which she said had not been consulted by Tombs and other earlier historians, she wrote that &quot;more than ten thousand&quot; and &quot;certainly fifteen thousand&quot; Communards had been killed in the &quot;Bloody Week&quot;.

The number killed during the &quot;Bloody Week&quot;, usually estimated at ten to fifteen thousand or possibly more, was extraordinarily high by historical standards. Eight years before the Bloody Week, during the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the deadliest battle of the American Civil War, a total of 7,863 soldiers, both Confederate and Union, were killed, or about half as many as the estimated Commune casualties. The number may have equalled or exceeded the number executed during the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, when, following June 1793, 16,594 official death sentences were carried out throughout France.

== Critique ==

=== Contemporary artists and writers ===
French writers and artists had strong views about the Commune. Gustave Courbet was the most prominent artist to take part in the Commune, and was an enthusiastic participant and supporter, though he criticised its executions of suspected enemies. On the other side, the young Anatole France described the Commune as &quot;A committee of assassins, a band of hooligans [], a government of crime and madness.&quot; The diarist Edmond de Goncourt wrote, three days after &quot;La Semaine Sanglante&quot;, &quot;...the bleeding has been done thoroughly, and a bleeding like that, by killing the rebellious part of a population, postpones the next revolution... The old society has twenty years of peace before it...&quot;

On 23 April, George Sand, an ardent republican who had taken part in the 1848 revolution, took the opposite view. She wrote &quot;The horrible adventure continues. They ransom, they threaten, they arrest, they judge. They have taken over all the city halls, all the public establishments, they&#x27;re pillaging the munitions and the food supplies.&quot; Soon after the Commune began, Gustave Flaubert wrote to Sand, &quot;Austria did not go into Revolution after Sadowa, nor Italy after Novara, nor Russia after Sebastopol! But our good Frenchmen hasten to pull down their house as soon as the chimney takes fire...&quot; Near the end of the Commune, Flaubert wrote to her again, &quot;As for the Commune, which is about to die out, it is the last manifestation of the Middle Ages.&quot; On 10 June, when the Commune was finished, Flaubert wrote to Sand:

Victor Hugo blamed Thiers for his short-sightedness. At the news that the government had failed to have the cannons seized he wrote in his diary, &quot;He touched off the fuse to the powder keg. Thiers is premeditated thoughtlessness.&quot; On the other hand, he was critical of the Commune but sympathetic to the Communards. At the beginning of April, he moved to Brussels to take care of the family of his son, who had just died. On 9 April, he wrote, &quot;In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly.&quot; He wrote poems that criticized both the government and the Commune&#x27;s policy of taking hostages for reprisals, and condemned the destruction of the Vendôme Column. On 25 May, during the Bloody Week, he wrote: &quot;A monstrous act; they&#x27;ve set fire to Paris. They&#x27;ve been searching for firemen as far away as Brussels.&quot; But after the repression, he offered to give sanctuary to members of the Commune, which, he said, &quot;was barely elected, and of which I never approved.&quot; He became the most vocal advocate of an amnesty for exiled Communards, finally granted in the 1880s.

Émile Zola, as a journalist for , reported on the fall of the Commune, and was one of the first reporters to enter the city during Bloody Week. On 25 May he reported: &quot;Never in civilised times has such a terrible crime ravaged a great city... The men of the Hôtel de Ville could not be other than assassins and arsonists. They were beaten and fled like robbers from the regular army, and took vengeance upon the monuments and houses... The fires of Paris have pushed over the limit the exasperation of the army. ...Those who burn and who massacre merit no other justice than the gunshot of a soldier.&quot; But on 1 June, when the fighting was over, his tone had changed, &quot;The court martials are still meeting and the summary executions continue, less numerous, it&#x27;s true. The sound of firing squads, which one still hears in the mournful city, atrociously prolongs the nightmare ... Paris is sick of executions. It seems to Paris that they&#x27;re shooting everyone. Paris is not complaining about the shooting of the members of the Commune, but of innocent people. It believes that, among the pile, there are innocent people, and that it&#x27;s time that each execution is preceded by at least an attempt at a serious inquiry ... When the echoes of the last shots have ceased, it will take a great deal of gentleness to heal the million people suffering nightmares, those who have emerged, shivering from the fire and massacre.&quot;

=== Anarchists ===
The anarchist philosopher George Woodcock said that &quot;a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel.&quot; Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune. He saw the Commune as above all a &quot;rebellion against the State,&quot; and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the State but also revolutionary dictatorship.

Louise Michel was an important participant in the Paris Commune, though she was not formally introduced to anarchist doctrines until her exile after the Commune. Initially she worked as an ambulance woman, treating those injured on the barricades. During the Siege of Paris, she untiringly preached resistance to the Prussians. On the establishment of the Commune, she joined the National Guard. She offered to shoot Thiers, and suggested the destruction of Paris by way of vengeance for its surrender. In December 1871, she was brought before the 6th council of war and charged with offences including trying to overthrow the government, encouraging citizens to arm themselves, and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform. Defiantly, she vowed to never renounce the Commune, and dared the judges to sentence her to death. According to court records, Michel told the court, &quot;Since it seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no right to anything but a little slug of lead, I demand my share. If you let me live, I shall never cease to cry for vengeance.&quot; Michel was sentenced to penal transportation. Following the 1871 Paris Commune, the anarchist movement, as with the whole of the workers&#x27; movement, was decapitated and severely crippled for years.

=== Marxism ===
Communists, left-wing socialists, anarchists, and others have seen the Commune as a model for, or a prefiguration of, a liberated society, with a political system based on participatory democracy from the grassroots up. Marx and Engels, Mikhail Bakunin, and later Lenin, tried to draw major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; and the &quot;withering away of the state&quot;) from the limited experience of the Commune.

Marx, in &quot;The Civil War in France&quot; (1871), written during the Commune, praised the Commune&#x27;s achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, &quot;the form at last discovered&quot; for the emancipation of the proletariat. Marx wrote that, &quot;Working men&#x27;s Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators, history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all of the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them.&quot;

Later, however, in private, Marx expressed a different, more critical view of the Commune. In 1881, in a letter to a Dutch friend, Nieuwenhaus, he wrote: &quot;The Commune was simply the rebellion of a city in exceptional circumstances, and furthermore, the majority of the Commune was in no way socialist, and could not have been. With a little bit of good sense, they might, however, have obtained a compromise with Versailles favourable to the mass of the people, which was in fact the only real possibility.&quot;

Engels echoed his partner, maintaining that the absence of a standing army, the self-policing of the &quot;quarters&quot;, and other features meant that the Commune was no longer a &quot;state&quot; in the old, repressive sense of the term. It was a transitional form, moving towards the abolition of the state as such. He used the famous term later taken up by Lenin and the Bolsheviks: the Commune was, he said, the first &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, a state run by workers and in the interests of workers. But Marx and Engels also analyzed what they perceived to be the weaknesses or errors of the commune, including its inability to link up with the rest of the French people, its failure to completely re-organize state machinery, its Central Committee passing over power too soon to the representative assembly, its failure to immediately pursue the retreating bourgeois, and the failure to recognize the possibility that France and Prussia would unite against the commune.

The other point of disagreement was the anti-authoritarian socialists&#x27; opposition to the Communist conception of conquest of power and of a temporary transitional state: the anarchists were in favour of general strike and immediate dismantlement of the state through the constitution of decentralised workers&#x27; councils, as those seen in the Commune.

Lenin, like Marx, considered the Commune a living example of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;. But he criticised the Communards for not having done enough to secure their position, highlighting two errors in particular. The first was that the Communards &quot;stopped half way ... led astray by dreams of ... establishing a higher [capitalist] justice in the country ... such institutions as the banks, for example, were not taken over&quot;. Secondly, he thought their &quot;excessive magnanimity&quot; had prevented them from &quot;destroying&quot; the class enemy. For Lenin, the Communards &quot;underestimated the significance of direct military operations in civil war; and instead of launching a resolute offensive against Versailles that would have crowned its victory in Paris, it tarried and gave the Versailles government time to gather the dark forces and prepare for the blood-soaked week of May&quot;.

In 1926, Mao Zedong published &quot;The Importance of Commemorating the Paris Commune.&quot; Similarly to Lenin&#x27;s analysis, Mao wrote that there were two reasons for the Commune&#x27;s failure: (1) it lacked a united and disciplined party to lead it, and (2) it was too benevolent towards its enemies.

=== Other commentary ===
The American Ambassador in Paris during the Commune, Elihu Washburne, writing in his personal diary which is quoted at length in noted historian David McCullough&#x27;s book &quot;The Greater Journey&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster 2011), described the Communards as &quot;brigands&quot;, &quot;assassins&quot;, and &quot;scoundrels&quot;; &quot;I have no time now to express my detestation ... [T]hey threaten to destroy Paris and bury everybody in its ruins before they will surrender.&quot;

Edwin Child, a young Londoner working in Paris, noted that during the Commune, &quot;the women behaved like tigresses, throwing petroleum everywhere and distinguishing themselves by the fury with which they fought&quot;. However, it has been argued in recent research that these famous female arsonists of the Commune, or , may have been exaggerated or a myth. Lissagaray claimed that because of this myth, hundreds of working-class women were murdered in Paris in late May, falsely accused of being , but he offered no evidence to support his claim. Lissagaray also claimed that the artillery fire by the French army was responsible for probably half of the fires that consumed the city during the Bloody Week. However, photographs of the ruins of the Tuileries Palace, the Hotel de Ville, and other prominent government buildings that burned show that the exteriors were untouched by cannon fire, while the interiors were completely gutted by fire; and prominent Communards such as Jules Bergeret, who escaped to live in New York, proudly claimed credit for the most famous acts of arson.

== Academic dispute over Thiers&#x27; handling of the crisis ==
Historian J.P.T. Bury considers that Thiers tackled the crisis in a ruthless but successful way, thus giving a solid base to the Third Republic. As he put it, &quot;the exile of so many extremists enabled the new Republic to [...] develop in a peaceful and orderly fashion.&quot;

This view is shared by French historian Alain Plessis, who writes that &quot;the crushing of the communards [...] was ultimately to facilitate the advent of the Third Republic.&quot;

For David Thomson, Thiers had no other option to restore the unity of a country fractured by an overwhelming defeat and innumerable factions.

Another French historian, Paul Lidsky, argues that Thiers felt urged by mainstream newspapers and leading intellectuals to take decisive action against &#x27;the social and democratic vermin&#x27; (Le Figaro), &#x27;those abominable ruffians&#x27; (Countess of Ségur).

Even a moderate daily newspaper like &quot;&quot; wrote, &quot;even though we were to drown this uprising in blood, were we to bury it under the ruins of the burning city, there would be no room for compromise.&quot;

Theodore Zeldin in &quot;France 1848–1945, vol.I&quot; goes so far as to say Thiers deliberately ordered Paris to be evacuated in order to incite part of the population to rise up and eventually have a pretext for crushing Paris as a rebellious force.

== Influence and legacy ==
The Paris Commune inspired other uprisings named or called Communes: in Moscow (December 1905); Hungary (March–July 1919); Canton (December 1927), most famously, Petrograd (1917), and Shanghai, 1927 and Shanghai, 1967. The Commune was regarded with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin identified the Russian soviets as the contemporary forms of the Commune and wrote: &quot;We are only dwarves perched on the shoulders of those giants.&quot; He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title &quot;Commissar&quot;, which was borrowed directly from the of the Commune. Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow in 1924 by French communists. Stalin wrote: &quot;In 1917 we thought that we would form a commune, an association of workers, and that we would put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching.&quot; The Bolsheviks renamed their dreadnought battleship &quot;Sevastopol&quot; to . In the years of the Soviet Union, the spaceflight Voskhod 1 carried part of a Communard banner.

The Communards inspired many anarchists, such as Paul Brousse, Errico Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero, and Andrea Costa. By taking up arms, they spread their ideas faster and more forcefully than they would have with the written word. The historian Zoe Baker writes that &quot;while a person must find, buy, and read a book or newspaper for it to radicalise them, an insurrection rapidly gains the attention of large numbers of people, including those who cannot read, and puts them in a position where they must take a side in the ongoing struggle.&quot;

The National Assembly decreed a law on 24 July 1873 for the construction of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre, near the location of the cannon park and where General Clément-Thomas and General Lecomte were killed, specifying that it be erected to &quot;expiate the crimes of the Commune&quot;. A plaque and a church, (Our Lady of the Hostages) on Rue Haxo mark the place where fifty hostages, including priests, gendarmes and four civilians, were shot by a firing squad.

A plaque also marks the wall in Père Lachaise Cemetery where 147 Communards were executed, commonly known as the Communards&#x27; Wall. Memorial commemorations are held at the cemetery every year in May to remember the Commune. Another plaque behind the Hôtel de Ville marks the site of a mass grave of Communards shot by the army. Their remains were later reburied in city cemeteries.

There are several locations named after the Paris Commune. Including the in Paris, the Straße der Pariser Kommune in Berlin, Germany, the Komunardů in Prague, Czech Republic, and the Công xã Paris Square in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

The Paris Commune was a recurring theme during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. When students put up the first big character poster following the 16 May Notification, Mao Zedong described it as the &quot;declaration of China&#x27;s twentieth-century Paris Commune.&quot; In the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s early period, the spontaneity of everyday life and mass political participation during the Paris Commune became lessons to be learned. For example, the 8 August 1966 &quot;Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concerning the Great Proletarian Revolution&quot; stated, &quot;It is necessary to institute a system of general elections, like that of the Paris Commune, for electing members to the cultural revolutionary groups and committees and delegates to the cultural revolutionary congresses.&quot; During the phase of the Cultural Revolution where mass political mobilization was trending downward, the Shengwulian (an ultraleft group in Hunan province) modeled its ideology on the radically egalitarian nature of the Paris Commune.

Pol Pot, the leader of Khmer Rouge was also inspired by Paris Commune and said the Commune had been overthrown because the proletariat had failed to exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. He would not make the same mistake.

In 2021, Paris commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Commune with &quot;a series of exhibitions, lectures and concerts, plays and poetry readings&quot; lasting from March through May. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, planted a memorial Araucaria tree native to New Caledonia in Montmartre; New Caledonia is where thousands of Communards were deported after the Commune was suppressed. The city&#x27;s plans to commemorate the Commune proved controversial, evoking protest from right-wing members of the city council.

The Commune continued to inspire strong emotions, even 150 years later. On 29 May 2021, a procession of Catholics honouring the memory of the Archbishop of Paris and the other hostages shot by the Commune in its final days was attacked and dispersed by participants from a far-left anti-fascist procession, also commemorating the Commune anniversary, outside the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

According to BBC News, as of 2021, supporters of the Paris Commune view it as &quot;a springtime of hope bloodily repressed by the forces of conservatism&quot;, while members of the political right view the Commune as &quot;a time of chaos and class vengeance. They remembered the killings of priests and the burning of landmarks like the Hôtel de Ville.&quot;

=== Other communes of 1871 ===
Soon after the Paris Commune took power in Paris, revolutionary and socialist groups in several other French cities tried to establish their own communes. The Paris Commune sent delegates to the large cities to encourage them. The longest-lasting commune outside Paris was that of Marseille, from 23 March to 4 April, which was suppressed with the loss of thirty soldiers and one hundred and fifty insurgents. None of the other Communes lasted more than a few days, and most ended with little or no bloodshed.

* Lyon. The Lyon Commune was a short-lived revolutionary movement in Lyon. Lyon had a long history of worker&#x27;s movements and uprisings. On 28 September 1870, even before the Paris Commune, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin and socialist Paul Clusaret led an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall), but were stopped, arrested and expelled from the city by national guardsmen who supported the Republic. On 22 March, when the news of the seizure of power by the Paris Commune reached Lyon, socialist and revolutionary members of the National Guard met and heard a speech by a representative of the Paris Commune. They marched to the city hall, occupied it, and established a Commune of fifteen members, of whom eleven were militant revolutionaries. They arrested the mayor and the prefect of the city, hoisted a red flag over the city hall, and declared support for the Paris Commune. A delegate from the Paris Commune, Charles Amouroux, spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people in front of the city hall. However, the following day the national guardsmen from other neighborhoods gathered at the city hall, held a meeting, and put out their own bulletin, declaring that the takeover was a &quot;regrettable misunderstanding,&quot; and declared their support for the government of the Republic. On 24 March, the four major newspapers of Lyon also repudiated the Commune. On 25 March, the last members of the Commune resigned and left the city hall peacefully. The Commune had lasted only two days.
* Saint-Étienne. On 24 March, inspired by the news from Paris, a crowd of republican and revolutionary workers and national guardsmen invaded the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) of Saint-Étienne, and demanded a plebiscite for the establishment of a Commune. Revolutionary members of the National Guard and a unit of regular army soldiers supporting the Republic were both outside the city. The prefect, an engineer named de L&#x27;Espée, was meeting with a delegation from the National Guard in his office when a shot was fired outside, killing a worker. The national guardsmen stormed the city hall, capturing the prefect. In the resulting chaos, more shots were fired and the prefect was killed. The National Guard members quickly established an executive committee, sent soldiers to occupy the railway station and telegraph office, and proclaimed a Commune, with elections to be held on 29 March. However, on the 26th, the more moderate republican members of the National Guard disassociated themselves from the Commune. An army unit entered the city on the morning of 28 March and went to the city hall. The few hundred revolutionary national guardsmen still at the city hall dispersed quietly, without any shots being fired.
* Marseille. Even before the Commune, Marseille had a strongly republican mayor and a tradition of revolutionary and radical movements. On 22 March, socialist politician Gaston Cremieux addressed a meeting of workers in Marseille and called upon them to take up arms and to support the Paris Commune. Parades of radicals and socialists took to the street, chanting &quot;Long live Paris! Long live the Commune!&quot; On 23 March, the Prefect of the city called a mass meeting of the National Guard, expecting they would support the government; but, instead, the national guardsmen, as in Paris, stormed the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and took the mayor and prefect prisoner. They declared a Commune, led by a commission of six members, later increased to twelve, composed of both revolutionaries and moderate socialists. The military commander of Marseille, General Henry Espivent de la Villeboisnet, withdrew his troops from the city, along with many city government officials, to Aubagne, to see what would happen. The revolutionary commission soon split into two factions, one in the city hall and the other in the prefecture, each claiming to be the legal government of the city. On 4 April, General Espivent, with six to seven thousand regular soldiers supported by sailors and National Guard units loyal to the Republic, entered Marseille, where the Commune was defended by about 2,000 national guardsmen. The regular army forces laid siege to the prefecture, defended by about 400 national guardsmen. The building was bombarded by artillery and then stormed by the soldiers and sailors. About 30 soldiers and 150 insurgents were killed. As in Paris, insurgents captured with weapons in hand were executed, and about 900 others were imprisoned. Gaston Cremieux was arrested, condemned to death in June 1871, and executed five months later.
* Besançon. The Besançon Commune originated from the emergence of unions, including a section of International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, in connection with the future Jura Federation. An insurrection in Besançon was planned for late May or early June 1871; the plan was abandoned following Semaine sanglante.
* Other cities. There were attempts to establish Communes in other cities. A radical government briefly took charge in the industrial town of Le Creusot, from 24 to 27 March, but left without violence when confronted by the army. The Capitole (City Hall), prefecture and arsenal of Toulouse were taken over by revolutionary national guardsmen on 24 March, but handed back to the army without fighting on 27 March. There was a similar short-lived takeover of the city hall in Narbonne (23–28 March). In Limoges, no Commune was declared, but from 3 to 5 April revolutionary National Guard soldiers blockaded the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall), mortally wounded an army colonel, and briefly prevented a regular army unit from being sent to Paris to fight the Commune, before being themselves disarmed by the army.

=== Aftermath ===
* Adolphe Thiers was formally elected the first President of the French Third Republic on 30 August 1871. He was replaced by the more conservative Patrice MacMahon in 1873. In his final years, Thiers became an ally of the republicans against the constitutional monarchists in the Assembly. When he died in 1877, his funeral was a major political event. Historian Jules Ferry reported that a million Parisians lined the streets; the funeral procession was led by republican deputies Leon Gambetta and Victor Hugo. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, where one of the final battles of the Commune had been fought.
* Patrice MacMahon, leader of the regular army that crushed the Commune, served as the president of the Third Republic from 1873 to 1879. When he died in 1893, he was buried with the highest military honours at Les Invalides.
* Georges Clemenceau, the mayor of Montmartre at the beginning of the Commune, became the leader of the Radical Party in the National Assembly. He was Prime Minister of France during the pivotal years of World War I, and signed the Versailles Treaty, restoring Alsace-Lorraine to France.

Some leaders of the Commune, including Delescluze, died on the barricades, but most of the others survived and lived long afterwards, and some of them resumed political careers in France. Between 1873 and 1876, 4,200 political prisoners were sent to the penal colony of New Caledonia. The convicts included about one thousand Communards, including Henri de Rochefort and Louise Michel.

* The most remarkable comeback was that of Commune leader Felix Pyat, who had been a former military leader of the Commune, and member of the Committee of Public safety. On the Commune he organised the destruction of the column in Place Vendome, as well the demolition of the home of Adolphe Thiers and the expiatory chapel to Louis XVI. He escaped Paris during Bloody Week, was condemned to death in absentia in 1873, and went into exile in England. After the general amnesty in 1881 he returned to Paris, and in March 1888 was elected to the National Assembly for the department of Bouches-du-Rhône. He took his seat on the extreme Left; he died at Saint-Gratien the following year.
* Louis Auguste Blanqui had been elected the honorary President of the Commune, but was in prison for its duration. He was given a sentence in a penal colony in 1872, but because of his health the sentence was changed to imprisonment. He was elected Deputy of Bordeaux in April 1879, but was disqualified. After he was released from prison, he continued his career as an agitator. He died after giving a speech in Paris in January 1881. Like Adolphe Thiers, he is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, where one of the last battles of the Commune was fought.
* Louise Michel, the famous &quot;Red Virgin&quot;, was sentenced to transportation to a penal colony in New Caledonia, where she served as a schoolteacher. She received amnesty in 1880, and returned to Paris, where she resumed her career as an activist and anarchist. She was arrested in 1880 for leading a mob that pillaged a bakery, was imprisoned, then pardoned. She was arrested several more times, and once was freed with the intervention of Georges Clemenceau. She died in 1905, and was buried near her close friend and colleague during the Commune, Théophile Ferré, the man who had signed the death warrant for the archbishop of Paris and other hostages.
* Adrien Lejeune, the last surviving communard, settled in the Soviet Union in 1928 where he died in 1942.

* &quot;The Queen of the Night&quot; by Alexander Chee (2016) depicts the survival of fictional opera singer Lilliet Berne during the siege of Paris. The novel&#x27;s heroine also interacts with several notable figures of the day, including George Sand and the Empress Eugénie de Montijo.
* Several popular British and American novelists of the late 19th century depicted the Commune as a tyranny against which Anglo-Americans and their aristocratic French allies heroically pitted themselves. Among the most well-known of these anti-Commune novels are &quot;Woman of the Commune&quot; (1895, AKA &quot;A Girl of the Commune&quot;) by G. A. Henty and in the same year, &quot;The Red Republic: A Romance of the Commune&quot; by Robert W. Chambers.

<doc id="59135" wikidata="Q1621783" url="?curid=59135" title="Solemnity">
<text>In the liturgical calendar of the Roman Rite, a solemnity is a feast day of the highest rank celebrating a mystery of faith such as the Trinity, an event in the life of Jesus, his mother Mary, his earthly father Joseph, or another important saint. The observance begins with the vigil on the evening before the actual date of the feast. Unlike feast days of the rank of feast (other than feasts of the Lord) or those of the rank of memorial, solemnities replace the celebration of Sundays outside Advent, Lent, and Easter (those in Ordinary Time).

The word comes from postclassical Latin , meaning a solemnity, festival, celebration of a day.

==Ranking==

The solemnities of Nativity of the Lord, the Epiphany, the Ascension, and Pentecost are outranked only by the Paschal Triduum.

Other solemnities inscribed in the General Roman Calendar give way also to the following celebrations:
:* The Paschal Triduum
:* Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter
:* Ash Wednesday
:* Weekdays of Holy Week up to and including Thursday
:* Days within the Octave of Easter

Solemnities inscribed in particular calendars yield not only to these, but also to the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed.

With the exceptions noted in the table below regarding the solemnities of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation of the Lord, a solemnity that falls on the same day as a celebration of higher rank is transferred to the next day not occupied by a solemnity, a Sunday or a feast.

Among solemnities inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, those of the Lord have precedence over those of the Blessed Virgin and these latter over solemnities of other saints. Thus if, for instance, the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus coincides with that of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist or that of Saints Peter and Paul, it is these that are transferred to the next free day.

Among solemnities inscribed in particular calendars (proper solemnities) the order of precedence is:

# The solemnity of the principal patron of the place, city or state
# The solemnity of the dedication or anniversary of the dedication of one&#x27;s own church
# The solemnity of the title of one&#x27;s own church (the mystery or saint to which it is dedicated)
# The solemnity of either the title or the founder of a religious institute

==List and dates==
The solemnities inscribed in the General Roman Calendar and which are therefore observed throughout the Latin Church are indicated in the following list.

===Proper solemnities===
There are also solemnities not inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, which are observed in particular places, regions, churches or religious institutes. The optional memorial of Saint Patrick on 17 March is a solemnity in Ireland, the memorial of Saint Josemaría Escrivá on 26 June is a solemnity within the prelature of Opus Dei, and the optional memorial of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on 16 July is a solemnity for the Carmelites.

A partial list of proper solemnities follows below: 
==Observance==

Even if it is a weekday or within Advent and Lenten season, if the day is a Solemnity, then the Gloria is said or sung (except Good Friday which is the second day of the Paschal Triduum), as well as the saying of the Creed at Mass, and there are two scriptural readings, not one, before the Gospel. Also, there will sometimes be processional and recessional hymns, and use of incense.

Some but not all solemnities are also holy days of obligation, on which, as on Sundays, Catholics are required to attend Mass and to avoid work and business that hinder divine worship or suitable relaxation of mind and body. All holy days of obligation have the rank of solemnity at least at local level, though not necessarily holding that rank in the General Roman Calendar. With the exception of the solemnities of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Annunciation of the Lord and the Birth of John the Baptist, all the solemnities inscribed in the General Roman Calendar are mentioned as holy days of obligation in canon 1246 of the Code of Canon Law, but are not necessarily all observed in a particular country.

When a solemnity falls on a Friday, the obligation to abstain from meat or some other food as determined by the episcopal conference does not apply.

<text>A slush fund is a fund or account used for miscellaneous income and expenses, particularly when these are corrupt or illegal. Such funds may be kept hidden and maintained separately from money that is used for legitimate purposes. Slush funds may be employed by government or corporate officials in efforts to pay influential people in return for preferential treatment, advance information (such as non-public information in financial transactions), and other services. The funds themselves may not be kept secret but the source of the funds or how they were acquired or for what purposes they are used may be hidden. Use of slush funds to influence government activities may be viewed as subversive of the democratic process.

A slush fund can also be a reserve account used to reduce fluctuations in an organization&#x27;s earnings by withholding them when they are high and supplementing them when they are low. This type of slush fund is not inherently corrupt, but is nonetheless a form of earnings management that tends to mislead stakeholders about the organization&#x27;s financial condition.

== Examples ==
Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Checkers speech&quot; of 1952 was a somewhat successful effort to dispel a scandal concerning a slush fund of campaign contributions. Years later, Nixon&#x27;s presidential re-election campaign used slush funds to buy the silence of the &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;.

Financial derivative traders for Enron employed a slush fund system called &quot;prudency reserves,&quot; in which the department reported part of each trade&#x27;s profit or loss to the company and withheld the remainder. This system was originally used to regulate the trading department&#x27;s profits, but also enabled the company to conceal large profits during the 2000–01 California electricity crisis.

Hockey Canada maintained three slush funds to pay for sexual assault settlements perpetrated by ice hockey players and other uninsured claims. Membership fees from across Canada were used to fund at least one of these slush funds. The existence and purpose of these slush funds were discovered during the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal in 2022. $7.6 million in 11 sexual assault settlements were paid out by these funds between 1989 and 2022.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Slush fund&quot; was originally a nautical term for the cash that a ship&#x27;s crew raised by selling fat (slush) scraped from cooking pots to tallow makers. This cash was kept separate from the ship&#x27;s accounts and used to make small purchases for the crew.

<doc id="59152" wikidata="Q190212" url="?curid=59152" title="Asterisk">
<text>The asterisk ( ), from Late Latin , from Ancient Greek , , &quot;little star&quot;, is a typographical symbol. It is so called because it resembles a conventional image of a heraldic star.

Computer scientists and mathematicians often vocalize it as star (as, for example, in &quot;the A* search algorithm&quot; or &quot;C*-algebra&quot;). An asterisk is usually five- or six-pointed in print and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten, though more complex forms exist. Its most common use is to call out a footnote. It is also often used to censor offensive words.

In computer science, the asterisk is commonly used as a wildcard character, or to denote pointers, repetition, or multiplication.

==History==



The asterisk was already in use as a symbol in ice age cave paintings. There is also a two-thousand-year-old character used by Aristarchus of Samothrace called the , , which he used when proofreading Homeric poetry to mark lines that were duplicated. Origen is known to have also used the asteriskos to mark missing Hebrew lines from his Hexapla. The asterisk evolved in shape over time, but its meaning as a symbol used to correct defects remained.

In the Middle Ages, the asterisk was used to emphasize a particular part of text, often linking those parts of the text to a marginal comment. However, an asterisk was not always used.

One hypothesis to the origin of the asterisk is that it stems from the 5000-year-old Sumerian character dingir, , though this hypothesis seems to only be based on visual appearance.

==Usage==

===Censorship===

When toning down expletives, asterisks are often used to replace letters. For example, the word &quot;badword&quot; might become &quot;ba***rd&quot;, &quot;b*****d&quot;, &quot;b******&quot; or even &quot;*******&quot;. Vowels tend to be censored with an asterisk more than consonants, but the intelligibility of censored profanities with multiple syllables such as &quot;b*dw*rd&quot; and &quot;b*****d&quot; or &quot;ba****d&quot;, or uncommon ones is higher if put in context with surrounding text.

When a document containing classified information is published, the document may be &quot;sanitized&quot; () by replacing the classified information with asterisks. For example, the Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report.

===Competitive sports and games===
In colloquial usage, an asterisk attached to a sporting record indicates that it is somehow tainted. This is because results that have been considered dubious or set aside are recorded in the record books with an asterisk rendering to a footnote explaining the reason or reasons for concern.

====Baseball====
The usage of the term in sports arose during the 1961 baseball season in which Roger Maris of the New York Yankees was threatening to break Babe Ruth&#x27;s 34-year-old single-season home run record. Ruth had amassed 60 home runs in a season with only 154 games, but Maris was playing the first season in the American League&#x27;s newly expanded 162-game season. Baseball Commissioner Ford C. Frick, a friend of Ruth&#x27;s during the legendary slugger&#x27;s lifetime, held a press conference to announce his &quot;ruling&quot; that should Maris take longer than 154 games both records would be acknowledged by Major League Baseball, but that some &quot;distinctive mark&quot; [his term] be placed next to Maris&#x27;, which should be listed alongside Ruth&#x27;s achievement in the &quot;record books&quot;. The asterisk as such a mark was suggested at that time by New York Daily News sportswriter Dick Young, not Frick. The reality, however, was that MLB actually had no direct control over any record books until many years later, and it all was merely a suggestion on Frick&#x27;s part. Within a few years the controversy died down and all prominent baseball record keepers listed Maris as the single-season record holder for as long as he held the record.

Nevertheless, the stigma of holding a tainted record remained with Maris for many years, and the concept of a real or figurative asterisk denoting less-than-accepted &quot;official&quot; records has become widely used in sports and other competitive endeavors. A 2001 TV movie about Maris&#x27;s record-breaking season was called &quot;61*&quot; (pronounced &quot;sixty-one asterisk&quot;) in reference to the controversy.

Uproar over the integrity of baseball records and whether or not qualifications should be added to them arose again in the late 1990s, when a steroid-fueled power explosion led to the shattering of Maris&#x27; record. Even though it was obvious - and later admitted - by Mark McGwire that he was heavily on steroids when he hit 70 home runs in 1998, ruling authorities did nothing - to the annoyance of many fans and sportswriters. Three years later self-confessed steroid-user Barry Bonds pushed that record out to 73, and fans once again began to call for an asterisk in the sport&#x27;s record books.

Fans were especially critical and clamored louder for baseball to act during the 2007 season, as Bonds approached and later broke Hank Aaron&#x27;s career home run record of 755.

The Houston Astros&#x27; 2017 World Series win was marred after an investigation by MLB revealed the team&#x27;s involvement in a sign-stealing scheme during that season. Fans, appalled by what they perceived to be overly lenient discipline against the Astros players, nicknamed the team the &quot;Houston Asterisks&quot;.

In recent years, the asterisk has come into use on baseball scorecards to denote a &quot;great defensive play.&quot;

====Usage in anti-doping campaigns====
*By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the association of baseball and its records with doping had become so notorious that the term &quot;asterisk&quot; had become firmly associated with doping in sport. In February 2011 the United States Olympic Committee and the Ad Council launched an anti-steroid campaign called &quot;Play Asterisk Free&quot; aimed at teens. The campaign, whose logo uses a heavy asterisk(✱), first launched in 2008 under the name Don&#x27;t Be An Asterisk.

====Cricket====
* In cricket, it signifies a total number of runs scored by a batsman without losing his wicket; e.g. &quot;107*&quot; means &quot;107 not out&quot;.
* Where only the scores of the two batsmen that are currently in are being shown, an asterisk following a batsman&#x27;s score indicates that he is due to face the next ball to be delivered.
* When written before a player&#x27;s name on a scorecard, it indicates the captain of the team.
* It is also used on television when giving a career statistic during a match. For example, &quot;47*&quot; in a number of matches column means that the current game is the player&#x27;s 47th.

====Other sports====
During the first decades of the 21st century, the term &quot;asterisk&quot; to denote a tainted accomplishment caught on in other sports first in North America and then, due in part to North American sports&#x27; widespread media exposure, around the world.

===Computing===

====Computer science====
* In computer science, the asterisk is used in regular expressions to denote zero or more repetitions of a pattern; this use is also known as the &quot;Kleene star&quot; or &quot;Kleene closure&quot; after Stephen Kleene. In the Unified Modeling Language, the asterisk is used to denote zero to many classes.

====Computer interfaces====
* In some command line interfaces, such as the Unix shell and Microsoft&#x27;s CMD, the asterisk is the &quot;wildcard character&quot; and stands for any string of characters. This is also known as a wildcard symbol. A common use of the wildcard is in searching for files on a computer. For instance, if a user wished to find a document called codice_1, search terms such as codice_2 and codice_3 would return this file. Due to being a wildcard, they could also return files like codice_4 and (only the latter) codice_5. codice_6 would in fact return any file that begins with codice_7, and codice_3 any file that began with D and had &#x27;ment&#x27; somewhere in its name. 
* In some graphical user interfaces an asterisk is pre- or appended to the current working document name shown in a window&#x27;s title bar to indicate that unsaved changes exist.
* In many computing and Internet applications an asterisk, or another character, is displayed to indicate that a character of a password or other confidential information has been entered, without the risk of displaying the actual character. 
* In Commodore (and related) files systems, an asterisk appearing next to a filename in a directory listing denotes an improperly closed file, commonly called a &quot;splat file&quot;.
* In travel industry Global Distribution Systems, the asterisk is the display command to retrieve all or part of a Passenger Name Record.
* In HTML web forms, a (usually red) asterisk can be used to denote required fields.
* In Markdown, surrounding a set of characters or words in one asterisk italicizes, two asterisks bolds, and three asterisks both italicizes and bolds. See the table below for examples of all three uses of the asterisk in Markdown, including how it translates to HTML and how it renders. 

* Chat room etiquette calls on one asterisk to correct a misspelled word or typo that has already been submitted. For example, one could post codice_9, then follow it with codice_10 or codice_11 (the placement of the * on the left or right is a matter of personal style) to correct the word&#x27;s spelling, or if it&#x27;s someone else that notices the mistake, they might also use codice_10 or codice_11. This also applies to typos that result in a different word from the intended one but are correctly spelled.
** Enclosing a phrase between two asterisks is used to denote an action the user is &quot;performing&quot;, e.g. codice_14, although this usage is also common on forums, and less so on most chat rooms due to codice_15 or similar commands. Hyphens (codice_16) and double colons (codice_17) as well as the operator codice_15 are also used for similar purposes.

=====Adding machines and printing calculators=====
* Some models of adding machines and printing calculators use the asterisk to denote the &quot;total&quot;, or the terminal sum or difference of an addition or subtraction sequence, respectively. The symbol is sometimes given on the printout to indicate this total.

====Programming languages====
Many programming languages and calculators use the asterisk as a symbol for multiplication. It also has a number of special meanings in specific languages, for instance:
* In some programming languages such as the C, C++, and Go programming languages, the asterisk is used to dereference or declare a pointer variable.
* In the Common Lisp programming language, the names of global variables are conventionally set off with asterisks, codice_19.
* In the Ada, Fortran, Perl, Python, Ruby programming languages, in some dialects of the Pascal programming language, and many others, a double asterisk is used to signify exponentiation: codice_20 is 53 = 125.
* In the Perl programming language, the asterisk is used to refer to the &quot;typeglob&quot; of all variables with a given name.
* In the programming languages Ruby and Python, * has two specific uses. First, the unary * operator applied to a list object inside a function call will expand that list into the arguments of the function call. Second, a parameter preceded by * in the parameter list for a function will result in any extra positional parameters being aggregated into a tuple (Python) or array (Ruby), and likewise a parameter preceded by ** will result in any extra keyword parameters being aggregated into a dictionary (Python) or hash (Ruby).
* In the APL language, the asterisk represents the exponential and exponentiation functions, with codice_21 representing eX, and codice_22 representing YX.
* In IBM Job Control Language, the asterisk has various functions, including in-stream data in the DD statement, the default print stream as codice_23, and as a self-reference in place of a procedure step name to refer to the same procedure step where it appears.
* In Haskell, the asterisk represents the set of well-formed, fully applied types; that is, a 0-ary &quot;kind&quot; of types.
* In many markup languages, putting text between two asterisks makes the text bold or italic. For example, codice_24 will often turn into &quot;Hello world!&quot; or &quot;&quot;Hello world!&quot;.

=====Comments in programming languages=====

In the B programming language and languages that borrow syntax from it, such as C, PHP, Java, or C#, comments in the source code (for information to people, ignored by the compiler) are marked by an asterisk combined with the slash:
 /* This section displays message if user input was not valid
 (comment ignored by compiler) */
Some Pascal-like programming languages, for example, Object Pascal, Modula-2, Modula-3, and Oberon, as well as several other languages including ML, Wolfram Language (Mathematica), AppleScript, OCaml, Standard ML, and Maple, use an asterisk combined with a parenthesis:
 (* Do not change this variable - it is used later
 (comment ignored by compiler) *)
CSS also uses the slash-star comment format.

body {
 /* This ought to make the text more readable for far-sighted people */
 font-size: 24pt;


Each computing language has its own way of handling comments; and similar notations are not universal.

====History of information technology====
The asterisk was a supported symbol on the IBM 026 Keypunch (introduced in 1949 and used to create punch cards with data for early computer systems). It was also included in the FIELDATA character encoding and the ASCII standard.

===Economics===
* In economics, the use of an asterisk superscript indicates that the variable such as price, output, or employment is at its optimal level (that which is achieved in a perfect market situation). For instance, formula_1 is the price level formula_2 when output formula_3 is at its corresponding optimal level of formula_4.
* Also in international economics asterisks are commonly used to denote economic variables in a foreign country. So, for example, formula_2 is the price of the home good and formula_1 is the price of the foreign good, etc.

===Education===
* In the A-Level examinations in the United Kingdom and the PSLE in Singapore, A* (&quot;A&quot;-star&quot;) is a special top grade that is distinguished from grade A.
* In the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) examination in Hong Kong, 5** (5-star-star) and 5* (5-star) are two special top grades that are distinguished from Level 5. Level 5** is the highest level a candidate can attain in HKDSE.

===Fluid mechanics===
In fluid mechanics an asterisk in superscript is sometimes used to mean a property at sonic speed.

===Games===
*Certain categories of character types in role-playing games are called splats, and the game supplements describing them are called splatbooks. This usage originated with the shorthand &quot;*book&quot; for this type of supplement to various World of Darkness games, such as &quot;Clanbook: Ventrue&quot; (for &quot;&quot;) or &quot;Tribebook: Black Furies&quot; (for &quot;&quot;), and this usage has spread to other games with similar character-type supplements. For example, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Third Edition has had several lines of splatbooks: the &quot;X &amp; Y&quot; series including &quot;Sword &amp; Fist&quot; and &quot;Tome &amp; Blood&quot; prior to the &quot;3.5&quot; revision, the &quot;Complete X&quot; series including &quot;Complete Warrior&quot; and &quot;Complete Divine&quot;, and the &quot;Races of X&quot; series including &quot;Races of Stone&quot; and &quot;Races of the Wild&quot;.
*In many MUDs and MOOs, as well as &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, and other more esoteric genders, there is a gender called &quot;splat&quot;, which uses an asterisk to replace the letters that differ in standard English gender pronouns. For example, &quot;h*&quot; is used rather than &quot;him&quot; or &quot;her&quot;. Also, asterisks are used to signify doing an action, for example, &quot;*&quot;action&quot;*&quot;.
*Game show producer Mark Goodson used a six-pointed asterisk as his trademark. It is featured prominently on many set pieces from &quot;The Price Is Right.&quot;
*Scrabble players put an asterisk after a word to indicate that an illegal play was made.

*In human genetics, * is used to denote that someone is a member of a haplogroup and not any of its subclades (see * (haplogroup)).

===Linguistics===

In linguistics, an asterisk may be used for a range of purposes depending on what is being discussed. The symbol is used to indicate reconstructed words of proto-languages (for which there are no records). For modern languages, it may be placed before posited problematic word forms, phrases or sentences to flag that they are hypothetical, ungrammatical, unpronounceable, etc. 

Historical linguist August Schleicher is cited as first using the asterisk for linguistic purposes, specifically for unattested forms that are linguistic reconstructions.

Using the asterisk for descriptive and not just historical purposes arose in the 20th century. By analogy with its use in historical linguistics, the asterisk was variously prepended to &quot;hypothetical&quot; or &quot;unattested&quot; elements in modern language. Its usage also expanded to include &quot;non-existent&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot; forms. Leonard Bloomfield (1933) uses the asterisk with forms such as &quot;*cran,&quot; impossible to occur in isolation: &quot;cran-&quot; only occurs within the compound &quot;cranberry&quot;. Such usage for a &quot;non-existent form&quot; was also found in French, German and Italian works in the middle of the 20th century.

Asterisk usage in linguistics later came to include not just impossible forms, but &quot;ungrammatical sentences&quot;, those that are &quot;ill formed for the native speaker&quot;. The expansion of asterisk usage to entire sentences is often credited to Noam Chomsky, but Chomsky in 1968 already describes this usage as &quot;conventional&quot;. Linguist Fred Householder claims some credit, but Giorgio Graffi argues that using an asterisk for this purpose predates his works.

The meaning of the asterisk usage in specific linguistic works may go unelucidated so can be unclear. Linguistics sometimes uses double asterisks (), another symbol such as the question mark, or both symbols (e.g. ) to indicate degrees of unacceptability.

==== Historical linguistics ====
In historical linguistics, the asterisk marks words or phrases that are not directly recorded in texts or other media, and that are therefore reconstructed on the basis of other linguistic material by the comparative method.

In the following example, the Proto-Germanic word is a reconstructed form.
* → → &quot;eleven&quot;

A double asterisk () sometimes indicates an intermediary or proximate reconstructed form (e.g. a single asterisk for reconstructed thirteenth century Chinese and a double asterisk for reconstructions of older Ancient Chinese or a double asterisk for proto-Popolocan and a single asterisk for intermediary forms).

In other cases, the double asterisk denotes a form that would be expected according to a rule, but is not actually found. That is, it indicates a reconstructed form that is not found or used, and in place of which &quot;another&quot; form is found in actual usage:
* For the plural, * would be expected, but separate masculine plural and feminine plural are found as irregular forms.

==== Ungrammaticality ====

In most areas of linguistics, but especially in syntax, an asterisk in front of a word or phrase indicates that the word or phrase is not used because it is ungrammatical.
*wake her up / *wake up her
An asterisk before a parenthesis indicates that the lack of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical, while an asterisk after the opening bracket of the parenthesis indicates that the existence of the word or phrase inside is ungrammatical—e.g., the following indicates &quot;go the station&quot; would be ungrammatical:
*go *(to) the station

Use of an asterisk to denote forms or sentences that are ungrammatical is often complemented by the use of the question mark () to indicate a word, phrase or sentence that is avoided, questionable or strange, but not necessarily outright ungrammatical.

Other sources go further and use several symbols (e.g. the asterisk, question mark, and degree symbol ) to indicate gradations or a continuum of acceptability.

===== Ambiguity =====
Since a word marked with an asterisk could mean either &quot;unattested&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot;, it is important in some contexts to distinguish these meanings. In general, authors retain asterisks for &quot;unattested&quot;, and prefix , , , or for the latter meaning. An alternative is to append the asterisk (or another symbol, possibly to differentiate between even more cases) at the end.

====Optimality theory====
In optimality theory, asterisks are used as &quot;violation marks&quot; in tableau cells to denote a violation of a constraint by an output form.

==== Phonetic transcription ====
In phonetic transcription using the International Phonetic Alphabet and similar systems, an asterisk was historically used to denote that the word it preceded was a proper noun. See this example from W. Perrett&#x27;s 1921 transcription of Gottfried Keller&#x27;s :
:(&quot;&quot;)

This convention is no longer usual.

===Mathematics===
The asterisk has many uses in mathematics. The following list highlights some common uses and is not exhaustive.

;stand-alone:
* An arbitrary point in some set. Seen, for example, when computing Riemann sums or when contracting a simply connected group to the singleton set formula_7.
;as a unary operator, denoted in prefix notation:
* The Hodge star operator on vector spaces formula_8.
;as a unary operator, written as a subscript:
* The pushforward (differential) of a smooth map formula_9 between two smooth manifolds, denoted formula_10.
* And more generally the application of any covariant functor, where no doubt exists over which functor is meant. 
;as a unary operator, written as a superscript:
* The complex conjugate of a complex number (the more common notation is formula_11).
* The conjugate in a composition algebra
* The conjugate transpose, Hermitian transpose, or adjoint matrix of a matrix.
* Hermitian adjoint.
* The multiplicative group of the units of a ring; when the ring is a field, this is the group of all nonzero elements. For example, formula_12
* The dual space of a vector space formula_13, denoted formula_14.
* The combination of an indexed collection of objects into one example, e.g. the combination of all the cohomology groups formula_15 into the cohomology ring formula_16.
* The reflexive transitive closure of a binary relation.
* In statistics, formula_17 and formula_18 are given critical points for formula_19-distributions and formula_20-distributions, respectively.
;as a binary operator, in infix notation:
* A notation for an arbitrary binary operator.
* The free product of two groups.
* formula_21 is a convolution of formula_9 with formula_23.
* A notation for the horizontal composition of two natural transformations.
* A notation to denote a parallel sum of two operands (most authors, however, instead use a formula_24 or formula_25 sign for this purpose).

The asterisk is used in all branches of mathematics to designate a correspondence between two quantities denoted by the same letter – one with the asterisk and one without.

====Mathematical typography====
In fine mathematical typography, the Unicode character (in HTML, &amp;lowast;; not to be confused with ) is available. This character also appeared in the position of the regular asterisk in the PostScript symbol character set in the &quot;Symbol&quot; font included with Windows and Macintosh operating systems and with many printers. It should be used for a large asterisk that lines up with the other mathematical operators, sitting on the math centerline rather than on the text baseline.

===Music===
* In musical notation the sign () indicates when the sustain pedal of the piano should be lifted.
* In liturgical music, an asterisk is often used to denote a deliberate pause.

===Religious texts===
*In the Geneva Bible and the King James Bible, an asterisk is used to indicate a marginal comment or scripture reference.
*In the Leeser Bible, an asterisk is used to mark off the seven subdivisions of the weekly Torah portion. It is also used to mark the few verses to be repeated by the reader of the Haftara.
*In American printings of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, an asterisk is used to divide a verse of a Psalm in two portions for responsive reading. British printings use a spaced colon (&quot; : &quot;) for the same purpose.
*In pointed psalms, an asterisk is used to denote a break or breath.

===Star of Life===

A Star of Life, a six-bar asterisk overlaid with the Rod of Asclepius (the symbol of health), may be used as an alternative to cross or crescent symbols on ambulances.

===Statistical results===
In many scientific publications, the asterisk is employed as a shorthand to denote the statistical significance of results when testing hypotheses. When the likelihood that a result occurred by chance alone is below a certain level, one or more asterisks are displayed. Popular significance levels are &lt;0.05 (*), &lt;0.01 (**), and &lt;0.001 (***).

===Telephony ===
On a tone dialling telephone keypad, the asterisk (called &quot;star&quot;) is one of the two special keys (the other is the &#x27;square key almost invariably replaced by the number sign (called &#x27;pound sign&#x27; (US), &#x27;hash&#x27; (other countries), or &#x27;hex&#x27;), and is found to the left of the zero). They are used to navigate menus in systems such as voice mail, or in vertical service codes. Its codepoint in Unicode is as a valid alternative usage.

===Typography===

* The asterisk is used to call out a footnote, especially when there is only one on the page. Less commonly, multiple asterisks are used to denote different footnotes on a page (i.e., *, **, ***). Typically, an asterisk is positioned after a word or phrase and preceding its accompanying footnote. Other characters are also used for this purpose, such as dagger (†, ‡) or superscript letters and numbers (as in Wikipedia). In marketing and advertising, asterisks or other symbols are used to refer readers discreetly to terms or conditions for a certain statement, the &quot;small print&quot;.
* In English-language typography the asterisk is placed after all other punctuation marks (for example, commas, colons, or periods) except for the dash.

* Three spaced asterisks centered on a page is called a dinkus and may represent a jump to a different scene, thought, or section.
* A group of three asterisks arranged in a triangular formation is called an asterism. It may be used instead of a name on a title page.
* One or more asterisks may be used as censorship over all or part of a word.
* Asterisks are sometimes used as an alternative to typographical bullets to indicate items of a list.
* Asterisks can be used in textual media to represent *emphasis* when bold or italic text is not available (e.g., Twitter, text messaging).
* Asterisks may denote conversational repair, or corrections to misspelling or misstatements in previous electronic messages, particularly when replacement or retraction of a previous writing is not possible, such as with &quot;immediate delivery&quot; messages or &quot;instant messages&quot; that can not be edited. Usually this takes the form of a message consisting solely of the corrected text, with an asterisk placed before (or after) the correction. For example, one might send a message reading &quot;*morning&quot; or &quot;morning*&quot; to correct the misspelling in the message &quot;I had a good &quot;.
* Bounding asterisks as &quot;a kind of self-describing stage direction&quot;, as linguist Ben Zimmer has put it. For example, in &quot;Another gas station robbery *sigh*&quot;, the writer uses *sigh* to express disappointment (but does not necessarily literally sigh).

==Encodings==

The Unicode standard has a variety of asterisk-like characters, compared in the table below. (Characters will display differently in different browsers and fonts.) The reason there are so many is chiefly because of the controversial decision to include in Unicode the entire Zapf Dingbats symbol font.

<text>The ampersand, also known as the and sign, is the logogram , representing the conjunction &quot;and&quot;. It originated as a ligature of the letters of the word (Latin for &quot;and&quot;).

==Etymology==

Traditionally in English, when spelling aloud, any letter that could also be used as a word in itself (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;O&quot;) was referred to by the Latin expression (&#x27;by itself&#x27;), as in &quot;&quot;per se&quot; A&quot; or &quot;A &quot;per se&quot; A&quot;. The character &amp;, when used by itself as opposed to more extended forms such as &quot;&amp;c.&quot;, was similarly referred to as &quot;and &quot;per se&quot; and&quot;. This last phrase was routinely slurred to &quot;ampersand&quot;, and the term had entered common English usage by 1837.

It has been falsely claimed that André-Marie Ampère used the symbol in his widely read publications and that people began calling the new shape &quot;Ampère&#x27;s and&quot;.

==History==
The ampersand can be traced back to the 1st century AD and the old Roman cursive, in which the letters E and T occasionally were written together to form a ligature (Evolution of the ampersand – figure 1). In the later and more flowing New Roman Cursive, ligatures of all kinds were extremely common; figures 2 and 3 from the middle of 4th century are examples of how the et-ligature could look in this script. During the later development of the Latin script leading up to Carolingian minuscule (9th century) the use of ligatures in general diminished. The et-ligature, however, continued to be used and gradually became more stylized and less revealing of its origin (figures 4–6).

The modern italic type ampersand is a kind of &quot;et&quot; ligature that goes back to the cursive scripts developed during the Renaissance. After the advent of printing in Europe in 1455, printers made extensive use of both the italic and Roman ampersands. Since the ampersand&#x27;s roots go back to Roman times, many languages that use a variation of the Latin alphabet make use of it.

The ampersand often appeared as a character at the end of the Latin alphabet, as for example in Byrhtferð&#x27;s list of letters from 1011. Similarly, was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore&#x27;s 1863 book &quot;The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks&quot;. In her 1859 novel &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, George Eliot refers to this when she makes Jacob Storey say: &quot;He thought it [Z] had only been put to finish off th&#x27; alphabet like; though ampusand would ha&#x27; done as well, for what he could see.&quot; The popular nursery rhyme Apple Pie ABC finishes with the lines &quot;X, Y, Z, and ampersand, All wished for a piece in hand&quot;.
==Similar characters==
In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the character () is used in place of the ampersand. This character is a survival of Tironian notes, a medieval shorthand system. This character is known as the Tironian Et in English, the in Irish, and the in Scottish Gaelic.

The logical conjunction symbol, , is often pronounced &quot;and,&quot; but is not related to the ampersand.

==Writing the ampersand==
In everyday handwriting, the ampersand is sometimes simplified in design as a large lowercase epsilon or a reversed numeral , superimposed by a vertical line. The ampersand is also sometimes shown as an epsilon with a vertical line above and below it or a dot above and below it.

The plus sign (itself based on an et-ligature) is often informally used in place of an ampersand, sometimes with an added loop and resembling . Other times it is a single stroke with a diagonal line connecting the bottom to the left side. This was a version of shorthand for ampersand, and the stroke economy of this version provided ease of writing for workers while also assuring the character was distinct from other numeric or alphabetic symbols.

==Usage==
Ampersands are commonly seen in business names formed from a partnership of two or more people, such as &quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson&quot;, &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana&quot;, &quot;Marks &amp; Spencer&quot;, and &quot;Tiffany &amp; Co.&quot;, as well as some abbreviations containing the word &quot;and&quot;, such as &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; (American Telephone and Telegraph), &quot;A&amp;P&quot; (supermarkets), &quot;P&amp;O&quot; (originally &quot;Peninsular and Oriental&quot;, shipping and logistics company), &quot;R&amp;D&quot; (research and development), &quot;D&amp;B&quot; (drum and bass), &quot;D&amp;D&quot; (Dungeons &amp; Dragons), &quot;R&amp;B&quot; (rhythm and blues), &quot;B&amp;B&quot; (bed and breakfast), and &quot;P&amp;L&quot; (profit and loss).

In film credits for stories, screenplays, etc., &quot;&amp;&quot; indicates a closer collaboration than &quot;and&quot;. The ampersand is used by the Writers Guild of America to denote two writers collaborating on a specific script, rather than one writer rewriting another&#x27;s work. In screenplays, two authors joined with &quot;&amp;&quot; collaborated on the script, while two authors joined with &quot;and&quot; worked on the script at different times and may not have consulted each other at all. In the latter case, they both contributed enough significant material to the screenplay to receive credit but did not work together. As a result, both &amp; and &quot;and&quot; may appear in the same credit, as appropriate to how the writing proceeded.

In APA style, the ampersand is used when citing sources in text such as (Jones &amp; Jones, 2005). In the list of references, an ampersand precedes the last author&#x27;s name when there is more than one author. (This does not apply to MLA style, which calls for the &quot;and&quot; to be spelled.)

The phrase (&quot;and the rest&quot;), usually written as &quot;etc.&quot; can be abbreviated &quot;&amp;c.&quot; representing the combination &quot;et&quot; + &quot;c(etera)&quot;.

The ampersand can be used to indicate that the &quot;and&quot; in a listed item is a part of the item&#x27;s name and not a separator (e.g. &quot;Rock, pop, rhythm &amp; blues and hip hop&quot;).

The ampersand may still be used as an abbreviation for &quot;and&quot; in informal writing regardless of how &quot;and&quot; is used.

==Computing==

===Encoding and display===
The character in Unicode is ; this is inherited from the same value in ASCII.

Apart from this, Unicode also has the following variants:
* 
* 
* 
* 

The last six of these are carryovers from the Wingdings fonts, and are meant only for backward compatibility with those fonts.

On the QWERTY keyboard layout, the ampersand is . It is almost always available on keyboard layouts, sometimes on or . On the AZERTY keyboard layout, is an unmodified keystroke, positioned above .

In URLs, the ampersand must be replaced by codice_1 when representing a string character to avoid interpretation as a URL syntax character.

===Programming languages===

In the 20th century, following the development of formal logic, the ampersand became a commonly used logical notation for the binary operator or sentential connective &quot;AND&quot;. This usage was adopted in computing.

Many languages with syntax derived from C, including C++, Perl, and more differentiate between:
* for bitwise AND is zero, is 4.
* for short-circuit logical AND is true.

In C, C++, and Go, a prefix is a unary operator denoting the address in memory of the argument, e.g. .

In C++ and PHP, unary prefix before a formal parameter of a function denotes pass-by-reference.

In Pascal, the as the first character of an identifier prevents the compiler from treating it as a keyword, thus &quot;escaping&quot; it.

In Fortran, the ampersand forces the compiler to treat two lines as one. This is accomplished by placing an ampersand at the end of the first line and at the beginning of the second line.

In many implementations of ALGOL 60 the ampersand denotes the tens exponent of a real number.

In Common Lisp, the ampersand is the prefix for lambda list keywords.

Ampersand is the string concatenation operator in many BASIC dialects, AppleScript, Lingo, HyperTalk, and FileMaker. In Ada it applies to all one-dimensional arrays, not just strings.

BASIC-PLUS on the DEC PDP-11 uses the ampersand as a short form of the verb .

Applesoft BASIC used the ampersand as an internal command, not intended to be used for general programming, that invoked a machine language program in the computer&#x27;s ROM.

In some versions of BASIC, unary suffix &amp; denotes a variable is of type &quot;long&quot;, or 32 bits in length.

The ampersand was occasionally used as a prefix to denote a hexadecimal number, such as for decimal 255, for instance in BBC BASIC. (The modern convention is to use &quot;x&quot; as a prefix to denote hexadecimal, thus .) Some other languages, such as the Monitor built into ROM on the Commodore 128, used it to indicate octal instead, a convention that spread throughout the Commodore community and is now used in the VICE emulator.

In MySQL, has dual roles. As well as a logical AND, it serves as the bitwise operator of an intersection between elements.

Dyalog APL uses ampersand similarly to Unix shells, spawning a separate green thread upon application of a function.

In more recent years, the ampersand has made its way into the Haskell standard library, representing flipped function application: means the same thing as .

Perl uses the ampersand as a sigil to refer to subroutines:
* In Perl 4 and earlier, it was effectively required to call user-defined subroutines
* In Perl 5, it can still be used to modify the way user-defined subroutines are called
* In Raku (formerly known as Perl 6), the ampersand sigil is only used when referring to a subroutine as an object, never when calling it

In MASM 80x86 Assembly Language, is the Substitution Operator, which tells the assembler to replace a macro parameter or text macro name with its actual value.

Ampersand is the name of a reactive programming language, which uses relation algebra to specify information systems.

===Text markup===
In SGML, XML, and HTML, the ampersand is used to introduce an SGML entity, such as (for non-breaking space) or (for the Greek letter α). The HTML and XML encoding for the ampersand character is the entity . This can create a problem known as delimiter collision when converting text into one of these markup languages. For instance, when putting URLs or other material containing ampersands into XML format files such as RSS files the &amp; must be replaced with &amp;amp; or they are considered not well formed, and computers will be unable to read the files correctly. SGML derived the use from IBM Generalized Markup Language, which was one of many IBM-mainframe languages to use the ampersand to signal a text substitution, eventually going back to System/360 macro assembly language.

In the plain TeX markup language, the ampersand is used to mark tabstops. The ampersand itself can be applied in TeX with . The Computer Modern fonts replace it with an &quot;E.T.&quot; symbol in the (text italic) fonts, so it can be entered as in running text when using the default (Computer Modern) fonts.

In Microsoft Windows menus, labels, and other captions, the ampersand is used to denote the next letter as a keyboard shortcut (called an &quot;Access key&quot; by Microsoft). For instance setting a button label to makes it display as rint and for to be a shortcut equivalent to pressing that button. A double ampersand is needed in order to display a real ampersand. This convention originated in the first WIN32 api, and is used in Windows Forms, (but not WPF, which uses underscore for this purpose) and is also copied into many other toolkits on multiple operating systems. Sometimes this causes problems similar to other programs that fail to sanitize markup from user input, for instance Navision databases have trouble if this character is in either &quot;Text&quot; or &quot;Code&quot; fields.

===Unix shells===
Some Unix shells use the ampersand as a metacharacter:

Some Unix shells, like the POSIX standard codice_2 shell, use an ampersand to execute a process in the background and to duplicate file descriptors.
* In Bash, the ampersand can separate words, control the command history, duplicate file descriptors, perform logical operations, control jobs, and participate in regular expressions.

===Web standards===
The generic URL (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax allows for a query string to be appended to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, , is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different name–value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, . For example, .

<doc id="59155" wikidata="Q126731" url="?curid=59155" title="Bullet (typography)">
<text>In typography, a bullet or bullet point, , is a typographical symbol or glyph used to introduce items in a . For example:
* Red
* Green
* Blue

The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow. Typical word processor software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors. Several regular symbols, such as (asterisk), (hyphen), (period), and even (lowercase Latin letter O), are conventionally used in ASCII-only text or other environments where bullet characters are not available. Historically, the index symbol (representing a hand with a pointing index finger) was popular for similar uses.

Lists made with bullets are called bulleted lists. The HTML element name for a bulleted list is &quot;unordered list&quot;, because the list items are not arranged in numerical order (as they would be in a numbered list).

== &quot;Bullet points&quot; ==
Items—known as &quot;bullet points&quot;—may be short phrases, single sentences, or of paragraph length. Bulleted items are not usually terminated with a full stop unless they are complete sentences. In some cases, however, the style guide for a given publication may call for every item except the last one in each bulleted list to be terminated with a semicolon, and the last item with a full stop. It is correct to terminate any bullet point with a full stop if the text within that item consists of one full sentence or more. Bullet points are usually used to highlight list elements.

==History==
The 1950 &quot;New York News&quot; Type Book is credited as the first style guide to include a defined use for bullets. The Type Book described it as a typographic device to be used as an &quot;Accessory&quot; alongside asterisks, checks, and other marks available to people making advertisements for the &quot;News&quot;. The book &quot;neither discusses the function of bullets in advertisements nor distinguishes them from any of the other items in the &#x27;accessories&#x27; category&quot;, but can be seen to use them as a form of dinkus in an advertising panel.

=== Modern use===
Example: 
&quot;Bullets are often used in technical writing, reference works, notes, and presentations&quot;. This statement may be presented using bullets or other techniques.

Bullets are often used in:

* Technical writing
* Reference works
* Notes
* Presentations 

Alternatives to bulleted lists are numbered lists and outlines (lettered lists, hierarchical lists). They are used where either the order is important or to label the items for later referencing.

==Other uses==
The glyph is sometimes used as a way to hide passwords or confidential information. For example, the credit card number might be displayed as .

==Bullet operator==
A variant, the bullet operator () has a unicode code-point but its purpose does not appear to be documented. The glyph was transposed into Unicode from the original IBM PC character set, Code page 437, where it had the code-point F916 (24910).

== Computer usage ==
There have been different ways to encode bullet points in computer systems.

=== In historical systems ===
Glyphs such as , and their reversed variants , became available in text mode since early IBM PCs with MDA–CGA–EGA graphic adapters, because built-in screen fonts contained such forms at code points 7–10. These were not true characters because such points belong to the C0 control codes range; therefore, these glyphs required a special way to be placed on the screen (see code page 437 for discussion).

Prior to the widespread use of word processors, bullets were often denoted by an asterisk; several word processors automatically convert asterisks to bullets if used at the start of line. This notation was inherited by Setext and wiki engines.

=== In Unicode ===
There are a variety of Unicode bullet characters, including:
* 
* 
* for use in mathematical notation primarily as a dot product instead of interpunct.
* 
* 
* ; see Fleuron (typography)
* ; see Fleuron (typography)
* 
* used in Japan as a bullet, and called tainome.

=== In web pages ===
To create bulleted list items for a web page, the markup language HTML provides the list tag . The browser will display one bulleted list item for each item in an unordered list.

=== In Windows ===
When using the US keyboard, a bullet point character can be produced by pressing 7 on the numpad while keeping Alt pressed.

=== In MacOS ===
When using the US keyboard, a bullet point character can be produced by pressing 8 while keeping Option(Alt) pressed.

=== In LaTeX ===
To create bulleted list items for a document, the markup language LaTeX provides the item tag codice_1. Each item tag inside an itemized list will generate one bulleted list item.

=== Wiki markup ===
A list item on a wiki page is indicated using one or more leading asterisks in wiki markup as well as in many other wikis.

=== Other uses in computing ===
The bullet is often used for separating menu items, usually in the footer menu. It is common, for example, to see it in latest website designs and in many WordPress themes. It is also used by text editors, like Microsoft Word, to create lists.

<text>Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is commonly used for temporary refrigeration as CO2 does not have a liquid state at normal atmospheric pressure and sublimes directly from the solid state to the gas state. It is used primarily as a cooling agent, but is also used in fog machines at theatres for dramatic effects. Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods (such as ice cream) where mechanical cooling is unavailable.

Dry ice sublimes at at Earth atmospheric pressure. This extreme cold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection from frostbite injury. While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from it can cause hypercapnia (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) due to buildup in confined locations.

==Properties==

Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide (CO2), a molecule consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. Dry ice is colorless, odorless, and non-flammable, and can lower the pH of a solution when dissolved in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3).

At pressures below 5.13 atm and temperatures below (the triple point), CO2 changes from a solid to a gas with no intervening liquid form, through a process called sublimation. The opposite process is called deposition, where CO2 changes from the gas to solid phase (dry ice). At atmospheric pressure, sublimation/deposition occurs at .

The density of dry ice increases with decreasing temperature and ranges between about below . The low temperature and direct sublimation to a gas makes dry ice an effective coolant, since it is colder than water ice and leaves no residue as it changes state. Its enthalpy of sublimation is 571 kJ/kg (25.2 kJ/mol, 136.5 calorie/g).

Dry ice is non-polar, with a dipole moment of zero, so attractive intermolecular van der Waals forces operate. The composition results in low thermal and electrical conductivity.

==History==
It is generally accepted that dry ice was first observed in 1835 by French inventor Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier (1790–1844), who published the first account of the substance. In his experiments, he noted that when opening the lid of a large cylinder containing liquid carbon dioxide, most of the liquid carbon dioxide quickly evaporated. This left only solid dry ice in the container. In 1924, Thomas B. Slate applied for a US patent to sell dry ice commercially. Subsequently, he became the first to make dry ice successful as an industry. In 1925, this solid form of CO2 was trademarked by the DryIce Corporation of America as &quot;Dry ice&quot;, leading to its common name. That same year the DryIce Co. sold the substance commercially for the first time, marketing it for refrigeration purposes.

==Manufacture==
Dry ice is easily manufactured. The most common industrial method of manufacturing dry ice starts with a gas having a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.

Dry ice is typically produced in three standard forms: large blocks, small ( diameter) cylindrical pellets and tiny ( diameter) cylindrical, high surface to volume pellets that float on oil or water and do not stick to skin because of their high radii of curvature. Tiny dry ice pellets are used primarily for dry ice blasting, quick freezing, fire fighting, oil solidifying and have been found to be safe for experimentation by middle school students wearing appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves and safety glasses. A standard block weighing approximately covered in a taped paper wrapping is most common. These are commonly used in shipping, because they sublime relatively slowly due to a low ratio of surface area to volume. Pellets are around in diameter and can be bagged easily. This form is suited to small scale use, for example at grocery stores and laboratories where it is stored in a thickly insulated chest. Density of pellets is 60–70% of the density of blocks.

Dry ice is also produced as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation, an industry primarily concerned with manufacturing extremely cold liquids such as liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen. In this process, carbon dioxide liquefies or freezes at a far higher temperature compared to that needed to liquefy nitrogen and oxygen. The carbon dioxide must be removed during the process to prevent dry ice from fouling the equipment, and once separated can be processed into commercial dry ice in a manner similar to that described above.

==Applications==
===Commercial===
The most common use of dry ice is to preserve food, using non-cyclic refrigeration.


It is frequently used to package items that must remain cold or frozen, such as ice cream or biological samples, in the absence of availability or practicality of mechanical cooling.

Dry ice is critical in the deployment of some vaccines, which require storage at ultra-cold temperatures along their supply line.

Dry ice can be used to flash-freeze food or laboratory biological samples, carbonate beverages, make ice cream, solidify oil spills and stop ice sculptures and ice walls from melting.

Dry ice can be used to arrest and prevent insect activity in closed containers of grains and grain products, as it displaces oxygen, but does not alter the taste or quality of foods. For the same reason, it can prevent or retard food oils and fats from becoming rancid.

When dry ice is placed in water, sublimation is accelerated, and low-sinking, dense clouds of smoke-like fog are created. This is used in fog machines, at theatres, haunted house attractions, and nightclubs for dramatic effects. Unlike most artificial fog machines, in which fog rises like smoke, fog from dry ice hovers near the ground. Dry ice is useful in theatre productions that require dense fog effects. The fog originates from the bulk water into which the dry ice is placed, and not from atmospheric water vapor (as is commonly assumed).

It is occasionally used to freeze and remove warts. However, liquid nitrogen performs better in this role, as it is colder, thereby requiring less time to act, and needs less pressure to store. Dry ice has fewer problems with storage, since it can be generated from compressed carbon dioxide gas as needed.

In plumbing, dry ice is used to cut off water flow to pipes to allow repairs to be made without shutting off water mains. Pressurised liquid CO2 is forced into a jacket wrapped around a pipe, which in turn causes the water inside to freeze and block the pipe. When the repairs are done, the jacket is removed and the ice plug melts, allowing the flow to resume. This technique can be used on pipes up to 4 inches or 100 mm in diameter.

Dry ice can be used as bait to trap mosquitoes, bedbugs, and other insects, due to their attraction to carbon dioxide.

It can be used to exterminate rodents. This is done by dropping pellets into rodent tunnels in the ground and then sealing off the entrance, thus suffocating the animals as the dry ice sublimates.

Tiny dry ice pellets can be used to fight fire by both cooling fuel and suffocating the fire by excluding oxygen.

The extreme temperature of dry ice can cause viscoelastic materials to change to glass phase. Thus, it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives.

===Industrial===

Dry ice can be used for loosening asphalt floor tiles or car sound deadening material, making them easy to prise off, as well as freezing water in valveless pipes to enable repair.

One of the largest mechanical uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot from a nozzle with compressed air, combining the power of the speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.

Dry ice is also useful for the de-gassing of flammable vapours from storage tanks — the sublimation of dry ice pellets inside an emptied and vented tank causes an outrush of CO2 that carries with it the flammable vapours.

The removal and fitting of cylinder liners in large engines requires the use of dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely slides into the engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting interference fit holds it tightly in place. Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.

Dry ice has found its application in construction for freezing soil, serving as an effective alternative to liquid nitrogen. This method reduces the soil temperature to approximately -70 to -74 °C, rapidly freezing the groundwater. As a result, the soil&#x27;s strength and impermeability significantly increase, which is essential for the safe execution of underground construction projects.

It is also useful as a cutting fluid.

===Scientific===
In laboratories, a slurry of dry ice in an organic solvent is a useful freezing mixture for cold chemical reactions and for condensing solvents in rotary evaporators. Dry ice and acetone forms a cold bath of , which can be used for instance to prevent thermal runaway in a Swern oxidation.

The process of altering cloud precipitation can be done with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 1960s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic. Its main drawback is the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded.

===Dry ice bombs===

A &quot;dry ice bomb&quot; is a balloon-like device using dry ice in a sealed container such as a plastic bottle. Water is usually added to accelerate the sublimation of the dry ice. As the dry ice sublimes, pressure increases, causing the bottle to burst with a loud noise. The screw cap can be replaced with a rubber stopper to make a water rocket.

The dry ice bomb device was featured on &quot;MythBusters&quot;, episode 57 Mentos and Soda, which first aired on August 9, 2006. It was also featured in an episode of &quot;Time Warp&quot;, as well as in an episode of &quot;Archer&quot;.

==Extraterrestrial occurrence==
Following the Mars flyby of the Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1966, scientists concluded that Mars&#x27; polar caps consist entirely of dry ice. However, findings made in 2003 by researchers at the California Institute of Technology have shown that Mars&#x27; polar caps are almost completely made of water ice, and that dry ice only forms a thin surface layer that thickens and thins seasonally. A phenomenon named dry ice storms was proposed to occur over the polar regions of Mars. They are comparable to Earth&#x27;s thunderstorms, with crystalline CO2 taking the place of water in the clouds. Dry ice is also proposed as a mechanism for the geysers on Mars.

In 2012, the European Space Agency&#x27;s Venus Express probe detected a cold layer in the atmosphere of Venus where temperatures are close to the triple point of carbon dioxide and it is possible that flakes of dry ice precipitate.

Observations from the Uranus flyby by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; indicates that dry ice is present on the surface of its large moons Ariel, Umbriel and Titania. Scientists speculate that the magnetic field of Uranus contributes to the generation of CO2 ice on the surfaces of its moons. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observations of Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton suggested the presence of dry ice on the surface, though followup observations indicate that the carbon ices on the surface are carbon monoxide but that the moon&#x27;s crust is composed of a significant quantity of dry ice.

==Safety==
Prolonged exposure to dry ice can cause severe skin damage through frostbite, and the fog produced may also hinder attempts to withdraw from contact in a safe manner. Because it sublimes into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of hypercapnia, dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well-ventilated environment. For this reason, in the context of laboratory safety dry ice is assigned label precaution Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with food. Tiny dry ice pellets used in dry ice blast cleaning do not contain oily residues.

Dry ice is assigned a UN number, a code for hazardous substances: UN 1845. Dry ice is not classified as a dangerous substance by the European Union, or as a hazardous material by the United States Department of Transportation for ground transportation. However, in the US, it is regulated as a dangerous good when shipped by air or water. International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations require specific diamond-shaped black-and white labelling to be placed on the package. The package must have adequate ventilation so that it will not rupture from pressure in the event that the Dry Ice begins to sublime in the packaging. The Federal Aviation Administration in the US allows airline passengers to carry up to per person either as checked baggage or carry-on baggage, when used to refrigerate perishables.

At least one person has been killed by carbon dioxide gas subliming off dry ice in coolers placed in a car. In 2020, three people were killed at a party in Moscow after 25 kg of dry ice was dumped in a pool; carbon dioxide is heavier than air, and so can linger near the ground, just above water level.

===Drink===
Dry ice is sometimes used to give a fog effect to cocktails. One bar patron who accidentally ingested pellets from a drink suffered severe burns to his esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, causing permanent problems with eating. Rapid sublimation could cause gas buildup that ruptures digestive organs or suffocation. Products that contain dry ice and prevent it from being accidentally ingested eliminate these risks while producing the desired fog effect.

<text>The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought, the social context within which it arises, and the effects that prevailing ideas have on societies. It is not a specialized area of sociology. Instead, it deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individuals&#x27; lives and the social-cultural basis of our knowledge about the world. The sociology of knowledge has a subclass and a complement. Its subclass is sociology of scientific knowledge. Its complement is the sociology of ignorance.

The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologist Émile Durkheim at the beginning of the 20th century. His work deals directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic can be influenced by the societal milieu in which they arise. The 1903 essay &quot;Primitive Classification&quot;, by Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, invoked &quot;primitive&quot; group mythology to argue that classification systems are collectively based and that the divisions within these systems derive from social categories. In his 1912 &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;, Durkheim elaborated on his theory of knowledge. In this work, he examined how languages, concepts, and the categories (such as space and time) used in logical thought have a sociological origin. Neither Durkheim nor Mauss specifically coined the term &quot;sociology of knowledge&quot;. However, their work was an exceptional contribution to the subject.

The widespread use of the term &#x27;sociology of knowledge&#x27; emerged in the 1920s, when several German-speaking sociologists, most notably Max Scheler and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on sociological aspects of knowledge. This was followed in 1937 by a much-cited survey of the subject by Robert K. Merton, the American sociologist, &#x27;The sociology of knowledge&#x27;. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge remained on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. However, it was reinvented and applied closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot; (1966). It is still central for methods dealing with a qualitative understanding of human society (compare &quot;socially constructed reality&quot;). The &#x27;genealogical&#x27; and &#x27;archaeological&#x27; studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.

== History ==

=== The Enlightenment ===
Peter Hamilton argues that the thinkers of the Enlightenment produced a sociology of ideas and values when they turned their attention to the scientific analysis of society. He argues that specific values inherent in critical rationalism, such as anthropocentrism (i.e., the assumption that humans are the most crucial element in understanding reality), were central to these thinkers&#x27; understanding of society. Hamilton argues that these thinkers were committed to progress and the freedom of the individual to determine his own beliefs and values, which are at odds with traditional moral considerations in theology. The empirical method of cross-cultural comparison became a methodology for understanding society rather than the idea of revealed truth inherent in sociology, leading to a measure of cultural relativism.

He argues that some thinkers sought to change society based on their theories. These ideas play out in the French Revolution with its Reign of Terror. Hamilton argues that the Enlightenment can be seen as a critical response to the Christian theology used by the Jacobins, which manipulated people&#x27;s understanding of truth to maintain a feudal order.

=== Earlier viewpoints ===
The sociology of knowledge requires a particular viewpoint that Giambattista Vico first expounded in his &quot;New Science&quot; in the early 18th century, long before the first sociologists studied the relationship between knowledge and society. The book, a justification for a new historical and sociological methodology, suggests that the natural and social worlds are known in different ways. The former is known through external or empirical methods, while the latter can be known internally and externally. In other words, human history is a construct that creates a critical epistemological distinction between the natural and social worlds, a central concept in the social sciences. Primarily focused on historical methodology, Vico asserts that it is necessary to move beyond a chronicle of events to study a society&#x27;s history. He examined society&#x27;s cultural elements, which were termed the &quot;civil world&quot;. This &quot;civil world&quot;, made up of actions, thoughts, ideas, myths, norms, religious beliefs, and institutions, is the product of the human mind. These socially constructed elements can be better understood than the physical world, as it is in abstraction. Vico highlights that human nature and its products are not fixed entities. Therefore, it necessitates a historical perspective emphasizing the changes and developments implicit in individuals and societies. He also emphasizes the dialectical relationship between society and culture as key in this new historical perspective.

While permeated by his penchant for etymology, Vico&#x27;s ideas and a theory of cyclical history (&quot;corsi e ricorsi),&quot; are significant for the underlying premise about our understanding and knowledge of social structure. They are dependent upon the ideas and concepts we employ and the language used. Vico was primarily unknown in his own time. He was the first to establish the foundations of a sociology of knowledge, even though later writers did not necessarily pick up his concepts. There is evidence that Montesquieu and Karl Marx read Vico&#x27;s work. However, the similarities in their works are superficial, limited mainly to the overall conception of their projects. They were characterized by cultural relativism and historicism.

==Approaches to the sociology of knowledge==

===Émile Durkheim===

Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the University de Bordeaux in the 1890s. While his works deal with several subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.

While publishing short articles on the subject early in his career (for example, the essay &quot;De quelques formes primitives de classification&quot; written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim worked mainly out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how logical thought concepts and categories could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the types of space and time were not &quot;a priori&quot;. Instead, the category of space depends on a society&#x27;s social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group&#x27;s social rhythm determines our understanding of time. Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the &quot;tabula rasa&quot; empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal &quot;a priori&quot; truths (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.

Another key element to Durkheim&#x27;s theory of knowledge is his concept of (collective representations), which he outlined in 1912 in &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;. are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather, etc. As Durkheim elaborates, are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such, these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual&#x27;s participation within society). Language is an important , which, according to Durkheim, is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating alone. As Durkheim says, , and language in particular:&quot;Add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it, and transforms it.&quot;As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality, an idea developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault.

===Karl Mannheim===

The German political philosophers Karl Marx (1818–1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) argued in &quot;Die deutsche Ideologie&quot; (1846, &quot;The German Ideology&quot;) and elsewhere that people&#x27;s ideologies, including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their class interests and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live:
: &quot;It is men, who in developing their material inter-course, change, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Being is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by being.&quot; (&quot;Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe&quot; 1/5)

Under the influence of this doctrine and of phenomenology, the Hungarian-born German sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893–1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his &quot;Ideologie und Utopie&quot; (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as &quot;Ideology and Utopia&quot;), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist Max Scheler (1874–1928), in &quot;Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens&quot; (1924, &quot;Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge&quot;).

Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of relativism is self-defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that relativism was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth that was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with Plato) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from Marx). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of relationism. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by pragmatism) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a &quot;dynamic synthesis&quot; of the ideologies of other groups.

The sociology of Mannheim is specified with particular attention to the forms of transmission of culture and knowledge. It follows the constellations of senses and options that, through the generations, are related to the transmission and reproduction of values.

===Phenomenological sociology===

Phenomenological sociology is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The &quot;object&quot; of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the &quot;Lebenswelt&quot;, or life-world (Husserl:1889). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). The utilization of phenomenological methods is what makes such a description different from the &quot;naive&quot; subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist.

The leading proponent of phenomenological sociology was Alfred Schütz (1899–1959). Schütz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for the interpretive sociology of Max Weber (1864-1920) through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). Husserl&#x27;s work aimed at establishing the formal structures of intentional consciousness. Schütz&#x27;s work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Schütz:1980). Husserl&#x27;s work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Schütz&#x27;s work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies in the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis. Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and truth value (Sokolowski:2000).

The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for Mannheim&#x27;s analysis: 
# Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl&#x27;s phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; of 1900/1901 (Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: &quot;On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung&quot; (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 &amp; fn43) – this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim&#x27;s method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program.
# The concept of &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), who relied on Husserl&#x27;s theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38).

It is also noteworthy that Husserl&#x27;s analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Schütz&#x27;s analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations in consciousness for the understanding and interpretation of a social world that is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the facticity of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this facticity are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world.

Alternatively, if the facticity of the social world &quot;and&quot; the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world that is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter-subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group.

===Michel Foucault===

The work of Michel Foucault made a particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge. &quot;Madness and Civilization&quot; (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered &quot;reason&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; were themselves subject to major culture bias, in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by Thomas Szasz (1920-2012), at the time the foremost critic of psychiatry and subsequently an eminent psychiatrist. Foucault and Szasz agreed that sociological processes played a major role in defining &quot;madness&quot; as an &quot;illness&quot; and in prescribing &quot;cures&quot;. In &quot;The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception&quot; (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central conceptual metaphor of &quot;The Gaze&quot;, which had implications for medical education, prison design, and the carceral state as understood today. Concepts of criminal justice and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in the contributions of Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. Foucault&#x27;s &quot;The Order of Things&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Archeology of Knowledge&quot; (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective &#x27;ordering&#x27; of the human sciences. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th-century studies of &quot;general grammar&quot; into modern &quot;linguistics&quot;, &quot;natural history&quot; into modern &quot;biology&quot;, and &quot;analysis of wealth&quot; into modern &quot;economics&quot;—though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. Foucault believed that the 19th century transformed what knowledge was.

Foucault stated that &quot;Man did not exist&quot; before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of humanism as inventions of modernity. Accordingly, a cognitive bias had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist&#x27;s ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by Nietzsche – that philosopher declaring the &quot;death of God&quot; in the 19th century, and the anti-humanists proposing the &quot;death of Man&quot; in the 20th.

In &quot;Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison&quot; (1975), Foucault concentrates on the correlation between knowledge and power. According to him, knowledge is a form of power and can conversely be used against individuals as a form of power. As a result, knowledge is socially constructed. He argues that knowledge forms discourses, which, in turn, form the dominant ideological ways of thinking that govern human lives. For him, social control is maintained in &#x27;the disciplinary society&#x27; through codes of control over sexuality and the ideas/knowledge perpetuated through social institutions. In other words, discourses and ideologies subject us to authority and turn people into &#x27;subjected beings&#x27;, who are afraid of being punished if they sway from social norms. Foucault believes that institutions overtly regulate and control our lives. Institutions such as schools reinforce the dominant ideological forms of thinking in the populace and force us into becoming obedient and docile beings. Hence, the dominant ideology that serves the interests of the ruling class, all the while appearing as &#x27;neutral&#x27;, needs to be questioned and must not go unchallenged.

===Knowledge ecology===
Knowledge ecology is a concept originating from knowledge management that aims at &quot;bridging the gap between the static data repositories of knowledge management and the dynamic, adaptive behavior of natural systems&quot;, in particular relying on the concepts of interaction and emergence.
Knowledge ecology, and its related concept information ecology has been elaborated by different academics and practitioners, such as Thomas H. Davenport, Bonnie Nardi, or Swidler.

===New Sociology of Knowledge===

The New Sociology of Knowledge (a postmodern approach considering knowledge as culture by drawing upon Marxist, French structuralist, and American pragmatist traditions) introduces concepts that dictate how knowledge is socialized in the modern era by new kinds of social organizations and structures.

===Robert K. Merton===
American sociologist Robert K. Merton (1910–2003) dedicates a section of &quot;Social Theory and Social Structure&quot; (1949; revised and expanded, 1957 and 1968) to the study of the sociology of knowledge in Part III, titled &quot;The Sociology of Knowledge and Mass Communications&quot;. For the news in this prospect see Guglielmo Rinzivillo, &quot;Robert King Merton&quot; Utet, Turin, 2019.

===Legitimation Code Theory===
Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) emerged as a framework for the study of knowledge and education and is now being used to analyse a growing range of social and cultural practices across increasingly different institutional and national contexts, both within and beyond education. The approach primarily builds on the work of Basil Bernstein (1924-2000) and of Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002). It also integrates insights from sociology (including Durkheim, Marx, Weber and Foucault), systemic functional linguistics, philosophy (such as Karl Popper and critical realism), early cultural studies, anthropology (especially Mary Douglas and Ernest Gellner), and other approaches. The LCT-Centre for Knowledge-Building is at the University of Sydney.

===Southern Theory===

Southern theory is an approach to the sociology of knowledge that looks at the global production of sociological knowledge and the dominance of the global north. It was first developed by Australian sociologist Raewyn Connell in her book &quot;Southern Theory&quot;, with colleagues
 at the University of Sydney and elsewhere. Southern theory offers a decolonizing perspective within the sociology of knowledge that seeks to emphasize perspectives from the global south to counter bias towards the perspectives of theorists and social scientists from the global north.

<doc id="59160" wikidata="Q431498" url="?curid=59160" title="Confirmation bias">
<text>Confirmation bias (also confirmatory bias, myside bias or congeniality bias) is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one&#x27;s prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.

Biased search for information, biased interpretation of this information and biased memory recall, have been invoked to explain four specific effects:
# &quot;attitude polarization&quot; (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence)
# &quot;belief perseverance&quot; (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false)
# the &quot;irrational primacy effect&quot; (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series)
# &quot;illusory correlation&quot; (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

A series of psychological experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Another proposal is that people show confirmation bias because they are pragmatically assessing the costs of being wrong rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.

Flawed decisions due to confirmation bias have been found in a wide range of political, organizational, financial and scientific contexts. These biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. For example, confirmation bias produces systematic errors in scientific research based on inductive reasoning (the gradual accumulation of supportive evidence). Similarly, a police detective may identify a suspect early in an investigation but then may only seek confirming rather than disconfirming evidence. A medical practitioner may prematurely focus on a particular disorder early in a diagnostic session and then seek only confirming evidence. In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles, or &quot;algorithmic editing&quot;, which display to individuals only information they are likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views.

== Definition and context ==
Confirmation bias, previously used as a &quot;catch-all phrase&quot;, was refined by English psychologist Peter Wason, as &quot;a preference for information that is consistent with a hypothesis rather than information which opposes it.&quot;

Confirmation biases are effects in information processing. They differ from what is sometimes called the &quot;behavioral confirmation effect&quot;, commonly known as &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot;, in which a person&#x27;s expectations influence their own behavior, bringing about the expected result.

Some psychologists restrict the term &quot;confirmation bias&quot; to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion. Others apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one&#x27;s existing beliefs when searching for evidence, interpreting it, or recalling it from memory. Confirmation bias is a result of automatic, unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception.

== Types ==
=== Biased search for information ===

Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with their current hypothesis. Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence, they phrase questions to receive an affirmative answer that supports their theory. They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis was true, rather than what would happen if it was false. For example, someone using yes/no questions to find a number they suspect to be the number 3 might ask, &quot;Is it an odd number?&quot; People prefer this type of question, called a &quot;positive test&quot;, even when a negative test such as &quot;Is it an even number?&quot; would yield exactly the same information. However, this does not mean that people seek tests that guarantee a positive answer. In studies where subjects could select either such pseudo-tests or genuinely diagnostic ones, they favored the genuinely diagnostic.

The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias, since positive tests can be highly informative. However, in combination with other effects, this strategy can confirm existing beliefs or assumptions, independently of whether they are true. In real-world situations, evidence is often complex and mixed. For example, various contradictory ideas about someone could each be supported by concentrating on one aspect of his or her behavior. Thus any search for evidence in favor of a hypothesis is likely to succeed. One illustration of this is the way the phrasing of a question can significantly change the answer. For example, people who are asked, &quot;Are you happy with your social life?&quot; report greater satisfaction than those asked, &quot;Are you &quot;un&quot;happy with your social life?&quot;

Even a small change in a question&#x27;s wording can affect how people search through available information, and hence the conclusions they reach. This was shown using a fictional child custody case. Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways. Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities: a close relationship with the child but a job that would take them away for long periods of time. When asked, &quot;Which parent should have custody of the child?&quot; the majority of participants chose Parent B, looking mainly for positive attributes. However, when asked, &quot;Which parent should be denied custody of the child?&quot; they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that Parent B should be denied custody, implying that Parent A should have custody.

Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests. In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the introversion–extroversion personality dimension on the basis of an interview. They chose the interview questions from a given list. When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert, the participants chose questions that presumed introversion, such as, &quot;What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties?&quot; When the interviewee was described as extroverted, almost all the questions presumed extroversion, such as, &quot;What would you do to liven up a dull party?&quot; These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them. A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from, such as, &quot;Do you shy away from social interactions?&quot; Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions, showing only a weak bias towards positive tests. This pattern, of a main preference for diagnostic tests and a weaker preference for positive tests, has been replicated in other studies.

Personality traits influence and interact with biased search processes. Individuals vary in their abilities to defend their attitudes from external attacks in relation to selective exposure. Selective exposure occurs when individuals search for information that is consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their personal beliefs. An experiment examined the extent to which individuals could refute arguments that contradicted their personal beliefs. People with high confidence levels more readily seek out contradictory information to their personal position to form an argument. This can take the form of an &quot;oppositional news consumption&quot;, where individuals seek opposing partisan news in order to counterargue. Individuals with low confidence levels do not seek out contradictory information and prefer information that supports their personal position. People generate and evaluate evidence in arguments that are biased towards their own beliefs and opinions. Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals&#x27; personal beliefs.

Another experiment gave participants a complex rule-discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer. Objects on the computer screen followed specific laws, which the participants had to figure out. So, participants could &quot;fire&quot; objects across the screen to test their hypotheses. Despite making many attempts over a ten-hour session, none of the participants figured out the rules of the system. They typically attempted to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses, and were reluctant to consider alternatives. Even after seeing objective evidence that refuted their working hypotheses, they frequently continued doing the same tests. Some of the participants were taught proper hypothesis-testing, but these instructions had almost no effect.

=== Biased interpretation of information ===
Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence. Even if two individuals have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased.

A team at Stanford University conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment, with half in favor and half against it. Each participant read descriptions of two studies: a comparison of U.S. states with and without the death penalty, and a comparison of murder rates in a state before and after the introduction of the death penalty. After reading a quick description of each study, the participants were asked whether their opinions had changed. Then, they read a more detailed account of each study&#x27;s procedure and had to rate whether the research was well-conducted and convincing. In fact, the studies were fictional. Half the participants were told that one kind of study supported the deterrent effect and the other undermined it, while for other participants the conclusions were swapped.

The participants, whether supporters or opponents, reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read. Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies, they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided, pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary. Participants described studies supporting their pre-existing view as superior to those that contradicted it, in detailed and specific ways. Writing about a study that seemed to undermine the deterrence effect, a death penalty proponent wrote, &quot;The research didn&#x27;t cover a long enough period of time,&quot; while an opponent&#x27;s comment on the same study said, &quot;No strong evidence to contradict the researchers has been presented.&quot; The results illustrated that people set higher standards of evidence for hypotheses that go against their current expectations. This effect, known as &quot;disconfirmation bias&quot;, has been supported by other experiments.

Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the 2004 U.S. presidential election and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates. They were shown apparently contradictory pairs of statements, either from Republican candidate George W. Bush, Democratic candidate John Kerry or a politically neutral public figure. They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable. From these three pieces of information, they had to decide whether each individual&#x27;s statements were inconsistent. There were strong differences in these evaluations, with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory.

In this experiment, the participants made their judgments while in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner which monitored their brain activity. As participants evaluated contradictory statements by their favored candidate, emotional centers of their brains were aroused. This did not happen with the statements by the other figures. The experimenters inferred that the different responses to the statements were not due to passive reasoning errors. Instead, the participants were actively reducing the cognitive dissonance induced by reading about their favored candidate&#x27;s irrational or hypocritical behavior.

Biases in belief interpretation are persistent, regardless of intelligence level. Participants in an experiment took the SAT test (a college admissions test used in the United States) to assess their intelligence levels. They then read information regarding safety concerns for vehicles, and the experimenters manipulated the national origin of the car. American participants provided their opinion if the car should be banned on a six-point scale, where one indicated &quot;definitely yes&quot; and six indicated &quot;definitely no&quot;. Participants firstly evaluated if they would allow a dangerous German car on American streets and a dangerous American car on German streets. Participants believed that the dangerous German car on American streets should be banned more quickly than the dangerous American car on German streets. There was no difference among intelligence levels at the rate participants would ban a car.

Biased interpretation is not restricted to emotionally significant topics. In another experiment, participants were told a story about a theft. They had to rate the evidential importance of statements arguing either for or against a particular character being responsible. When they hypothesized that character&#x27;s guilt, they rated statements supporting that hypothesis as more important than conflicting statements.

=== Biased recall of information ===
People may remember evidence selectively to reinforce their expectations, even if they gather and interpret evidence in a neutral manner. This effect is called &quot;selective recall&quot;, &quot;confirmatory memory&quot;, or &quot;access-biased memory&quot;. Psychological theories differ in their predictions about selective recall. Schema theory predicts that information matching prior expectations will be more easily stored and recalled than information that does not match. Some alternative approaches say that surprising information stands out and so is memorable. Predictions from both these theories have been confirmed in different experimental contexts, with no theory winning outright.

In one study, participants read a profile of a woman which described a mix of introverted and extroverted behaviors. They later had to recall examples of her introversion and extroversion. One group was told this was to assess the woman for a job as a librarian, while a second group were told it was for a job in real estate sales. There was a significant difference between what these two groups recalled, with the &quot;librarian&quot; group recalling more examples of introversion and the &quot;sales&quot; groups recalling more extroverted behavior. A selective memory effect has also been shown in experiments that manipulate the desirability of personality types. In one of these, a group of participants were shown evidence that extroverted people are more successful than introverts. Another group were told the opposite. In a subsequent, apparently unrelated study, participants were asked to recall events from their lives in which they had been either introverted or extroverted. Each group of participants provided more memories connecting themselves with the more desirable personality type, and recalled those memories more quickly.

Changes in emotional states can also influence memory recall. Participants rated how they felt when they had first learned that O. J. Simpson had been acquitted of murder charges. They described their emotional reactions and confidence regarding the verdict one week, two months, and one year after the trial. Results indicated that participants&#x27; assessments for Simpson&#x27;s guilt changed over time. The more that participants&#x27; opinion of the verdict had changed, the less stable were the participant&#x27;s memories regarding their initial emotional reactions. When participants recalled their initial emotional reactions two months and a year later, past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals of emotion. People demonstrate sizable myside bias when discussing their opinions on controversial topics. Memory recall and construction of experiences undergo revision in relation to corresponding emotional states.

Myside bias has been shown to influence the accuracy of memory recall. In an experiment, widows and widowers rated the intensity of their experienced grief six months and five years after the deaths of their spouses. Participants noted a higher experience of grief at six months rather than at five years. Yet, when the participants were asked after five years how they had felt six months after the death of their significant other, the intensity of grief participants recalled was highly correlated with their current level of grief. Individuals appear to utilize their current emotional states to analyze how they must have felt when experiencing past events. Emotional memories are reconstructed by current emotional states.

One study showed how selective memory can maintain belief in extrasensory perception (ESP). Believers and disbelievers were each shown descriptions of ESP experiments. Half of each group were told that the experimental results supported the existence of ESP, while the others were told they did not. In a subsequent test, participants recalled the material accurately, apart from believers who had read the non-supportive evidence. This group remembered significantly less information and some of them incorrectly remembered the results as supporting ESP.

== Individual differences ==
Myside bias was once believed to be correlated with intelligence; however, studies have shown that myside bias can be more influenced by ability to rationally think as opposed to level of intelligence. Myside bias can cause an inability to effectively and logically evaluate the opposite side of an argument. Studies have stated that myside bias is an absence of &quot;active open-mindedness&quot;, meaning the active search for why an initial idea may be wrong. Typically, myside bias is operationalized in empirical studies as the quantity of evidence used in support of their side in comparison to the opposite side.

A study has found individual differences in myside bias. This study investigates individual differences that are acquired through learning in a cultural context and are mutable. The researcher found important individual difference in argumentation. Studies have suggested that individual differences such as deductive reasoning ability, ability to overcome belief bias, epistemological understanding, and thinking disposition are significant predictors of the reasoning and generating arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals.

A study by Christopher Wolfe and Anne Britt also investigated how participants&#x27; views of &quot;what makes a good argument?&quot; can be a source of myside bias that influences the way a person formulates their own arguments. The study investigated individual differences of argumentation schema and asked participants to write essays. The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their preferred side of an argument and were given research instructions that took either a balanced or an unrestricted approach. The balanced-research instructions directed participants to create a &quot;balanced&quot; argument, i.e., that included both pros and cons; the unrestricted-research instructions included nothing on how to create the argument.

Overall, the results revealed that the balanced-research instructions significantly increased the incidence of opposing information in arguments. These data also reveal that personal belief is not a &quot;source&quot; of myside bias; however, that those participants, who believe that a good argument is one that is based on facts, are more likely to exhibit myside bias than other participants. This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron&#x27;s article—that people&#x27;s opinions about what makes good thinking can influence how arguments are generated.

== Discovery ==
=== Informal observations ===

Before psychological research on confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed throughout history. Beginning with the Greek historian Thucydides ( – ), who wrote of misguided reason in &quot;The Peloponnesian War&quot;; &quot;... for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy&quot;. Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) noted it in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, in which St. Thomas Aquinas cautions Dante upon meeting in Paradise, &quot;opinion—hasty—often can incline to the wrong side, and then affection for one&#x27;s own opinion binds, confines the mind&quot;. Ibn Khaldun noticed the same effect in his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;:
 In the &quot;Novum Organum&quot;, English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon (1561–1626) noted that biased assessment of evidence drove &quot;all superstitions, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments or the like&quot;. He wrote:

In the second volume of his &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (1844), German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer observed that &quot;An adopted hypothesis gives us lynx-eyes for everything that confirms it and makes us blind to everything that contradicts it.&quot;

In his essay (1897) &quot;What Is Art?&quot;, Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote:
 In his essay (1894) &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;, Tolstoy had earlier written:
=== Hypothesis-testing (falsification) explanation (Wason) ===
In Peter Wason&#x27;s initial experiment published in 1960 (which does not mention the term &quot;confirmation bias&quot;), he repeatedly challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. They were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule. They generated triples, and the experimenter told them whether each triple conformed to the rule.

The actual rule was simply &quot;any ascending sequence&quot;, but participants had great difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as &quot;the middle number is the average of the first and last&quot;. The participants seemed to test only positive examples—triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, &quot;Each number is two greater than its predecessor,&quot; they would offer a triple that fitted (confirmed) this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violated (falsified) it, such as (11,12,19).

Wason interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence he coined the term &quot;confirmation bias&quot;. Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his selection task experiment. Participants repeatedly performed badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute (falsify) the specified rule.

=== Hypothesis testing (positive test strategy) explanation (Klayman and Ha) ===
Klayman and Ha&#x27;s 1987 paper argues that the Wason experiments do not actually demonstrate a bias towards confirmation, but instead a tendency to make tests consistent with the working hypothesis. They called this the &quot;positive test strategy&quot;. This strategy is an example of a heuristic: a reasoning shortcut that is imperfect but easy to compute. Klayman and Ha used Bayesian probability and information theory as their standard of hypothesis-testing, rather than the falsificationism used by Wason. According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person&#x27;s prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative. Klayman and Ha argued that when people think about realistic problems, they are looking for a specific answer with a small initial probability. In this case, positive tests are usually more informative than negative tests. However, in Wason&#x27;s rule discovery task the answer—three numbers in ascending order—is very broad, so positive tests are unlikely to yield informative answers. Klayman and Ha supported their analysis by citing an experiment that used the labels &quot;DAX&quot; and &quot;MED&quot; in place of &quot;fits the rule&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t fit the rule&quot;. This avoided implying that the aim was to find a low-probability rule. Participants had much more success with this version of the experiment.

In light of this and other critiques, the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification of an hypothesis, to examining whether people test hypotheses in an informative way, or an uninformative but positive way. The search for &quot;true&quot; confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information.

== Information processing explanations ==
There are currently three main information processing explanations of confirmation bias, plus a recent addition.

=== Cognitive versus motivational ===

According to Robert MacCoun, most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of &quot;cold&quot; (cognitive) and &quot;hot&quot; (motivated) mechanisms.

Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people&#x27;s ability to handle complex tasks, and the shortcuts, called &quot;heuristics&quot;, that they use. For example, people may judge the reliability of evidence by using the &quot;availability heuristic&quot; that is, how readily a particular idea comes to mind. It is also possible that people can only focus on one thought at a time, so find it difficult to test alternative hypotheses in parallel. Another heuristic is the positive test strategy identified by Klayman and Ha, in which people test a hypothesis by examining cases where they expect a property or event to occur. This heuristic avoids the difficult or impossible task of working out how diagnostic each possible question will be. However, it is not universally reliable, so people can overlook challenges to their existing beliefs.

Motivational explanations involve an effect of desire on belief. It is known that people prefer positive thoughts over negative ones in a number of ways: this is called the &quot;Pollyanna principle&quot;. Applied to arguments or sources of evidence, this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true. According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion, people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas. In other words, they ask, &quot;Can I believe this?&quot; for some suggestions and, &quot;Must I believe this?&quot; for others. Although consistency is a desirable feature of attitudes, an excessive drive for consistency is another potential source of bias because it may prevent people from neutrally evaluating new, surprising information. Social psychologist Ziva Kunda combines the cognitive and motivational theories, arguing that motivation creates the bias, but cognitive factors determine the size of the effect.

=== Cost-benefit ===
Explanations in terms of cost-benefit analysis assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way, but assess the costs of different errors. Using ideas from evolutionary psychology, James Friedrich suggests that people do not primarily aim at truth in testing hypotheses, but try to avoid the most costly errors. For example, employers might ask one-sided questions in job interviews because they are focused on weeding out unsuitable candidates. Yaacov Trope and Akiva Liberman&#x27;s refinement of this theory assumes that people compare the two different kinds of error: accepting a false hypothesis or rejecting a true hypothesis. For instance, someone who underestimates a friend&#x27;s honesty might treat him or her suspiciously and so undermine the friendship. Overestimating the friend&#x27;s honesty may also be costly, but less so. In this case, it would be rational to seek, evaluate or remember evidence of their honesty in a biased way. When someone gives an initial impression of being introverted or extroverted, questions that match that impression come across as more empathic. This suggests that when talking to someone who seems to be an introvert, it is a sign of better social skills to ask, &quot;Do you feel awkward in social situations?&quot; rather than, &quot;Do you like noisy parties?&quot; The connection between confirmation bias and social skills was corroborated by a study of how college students get to know other people. Highly self-monitoring students, who are more sensitive to their environment and to social norms, asked more matching questions when interviewing a high-status staff member than when getting to know fellow students.

=== Exploratory versus confirmatory ===
Psychologists Jennifer Lerner and Philip Tetlock distinguish two different kinds of thinking process. &quot;Exploratory thought&quot; neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position, while &quot;confirmatory thought&quot; seeks to justify a specific point of view. Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know, they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people, and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification. Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to others who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they do not already know. Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are using confirmatory thought most of the time.

=== Make-believe ===
Developmental psychologist Eve Whitmore has argued that beliefs and biases involved in confirmation bias have their roots in childhood coping through make-believe, which becomes &quot;the basis for more complex forms of self-deception and illusion into adulthood.&quot; The friction brought on by questioning as an adolescent with developing critical thinking can lead to the rationalization of false beliefs, and the habit of such rationalization can become unconscious over the years.

=== Optimal information acquisition ===

Recent research in economics has challenged the traditional view of confirmation bias as purely a cognitive flaw. Under conditions where acquiring and processing information is costly, seeking confirmatory evidence can actually be an optimal strategy. Instead of pursuing contrarian or disconfirming evidence, it may be more efficient to focus on sources likely to align with one&#x27;s existing beliefs, given the constraints on time and resources.

Economist Weijie Zhong has developed a model demonstrating that individuals who must make decisions under time pressure, and who face costs for obtaining more information, will often prefer confirmatory signals. According to this model, when individuals believe strongly in a certain hypothesis, they optimally seek information that confirms it, allowing them to build confidence more efficiently. If the expected confirmatory signals are not received, their confidence in the initial hypothesis will gradually decline, leading to belief updating. This approach shows that seeking confirmation is not necessarily biased but may be a rational allocation of limited attention and resources.

== Real-world effects ==
=== Social media ===
In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles, or &quot;algorithmic editing&quot;, which displays to individuals only information they are likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views. Some have argued that confirmation bias is the reason why society can never escape from filter bubbles, because individuals are psychologically hardwired to seek information that agrees with their preexisting values and beliefs. Others have further argued that the mixture of the two is degrading democracy—claiming that this &quot;algorithmic editing&quot; removes diverse viewpoints and information—and that unless filter bubble algorithms are removed, voters will be unable to make fully informed political decisions.

The rise of social media has contributed greatly to the rapid spread of fake news, that is, false and misleading information that is presented as credible news from a seemingly reliable source. Confirmation bias (selecting or reinterpreting evidence to support one&#x27;s beliefs) is one of three main hurdles cited as to why critical thinking goes astray in these circumstances. The other two are shortcut heuristics (when overwhelmed or short of time, people rely on simple rules such as group consensus or trusting an expert or role model) and social goals (social motivation or peer pressure can interfere with objective analysis of facts at hand).

In combating the spread of fake news, social media sites have considered turning toward &quot;digital nudging&quot;. This can currently be done in two different forms of nudging. This includes nudging of information and nudging of presentation. Nudging of information entails social media sites providing a disclaimer or label questioning or warning users of the validity of the source while nudging of presentation includes exposing users to new information which they may not have sought out but could introduce them to viewpoints that may combat their own confirmation biases.

=== Science and scientific research ===
A distinguishing feature of scientific thinking is the search for confirming or supportive evidence (inductive reasoning) as well as falsifying evidence (deductive reasoning).

Many times in the history of science, scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or ignoring unfavorable data. Several studies have shown that scientists rate studies that report findings consistent with their prior beliefs more favorably than studies reporting findings inconsistent with their previous beliefs.

However, assuming that the research question is relevant, the experimental design adequate and the data are clearly and comprehensively described, the empirical data obtained should be important to the scientific community and should not be viewed prejudicially, regardless of whether they conform to current theoretical predictions. In practice, researchers may misunderstand, misinterpret, or not read at all studies that contradict their preconceptions, or wrongly cite them anyway as if they actually supported their claims.

Further, confirmation biases can sustain scientific theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence. The discipline of parapsychology is often cited as an example.

An experimenter&#x27;s confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported. Data that conflict with the experimenter&#x27;s expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable, producing the so-called file drawer effect. To combat this tendency, scientific training teaches ways to prevent bias. For example, experimental design of randomized controlled trials (coupled with their systematic review) aims to minimize sources of bias.

The social process of peer review aims to mitigate the effect of individual scientists&#x27; biases, even though the peer review process itself may be susceptible to such biases Confirmation bias may thus be especially harmful to objective evaluations regarding nonconforming results since biased individuals may regard opposing evidence to be weak in principle and give little serious thought to revising their beliefs. Scientific innovators often meet with resistance from the scientific community, and research presenting controversial results frequently receives harsh peer review.

=== Finance ===
Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident, ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money. In studies of political stock markets, investors made more profit when they resisted bias. For example, participants who interpreted a candidate&#x27;s debate performance in a neutral rather than partisan way were more likely to profit. To combat the effect of confirmation bias, investors can try to adopt a contrary viewpoint &quot;for the sake of argument&quot;. In one technique, they imagine that their investments have collapsed and ask themselves why this might happen.

=== Medicine and health ===
Cognitive biases are important variables in clinical decision-making by medical general practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists. Two important ones are confirmation bias and the overlapping availability bias. A GP may make a diagnosis early on during an examination, and then seek confirming evidence rather than falsifying evidence. This cognitive error is partly caused by the availability of evidence about the supposed disorder being diagnosed. For example, the client may have mentioned the disorder, or the GP may have recently read a much-discussed paper about the disorder. The basis of this cognitive shortcut or heuristic (termed anchoring) is that the doctor does not consider multiple possibilities based on evidence, but prematurely latches on (or anchors to) a single cause. In emergency medicine, because of time pressure, there is a high density of decision-making, and shortcuts are frequently applied. The potential failure rate of these cognitive decisions needs to be managed by education about the 30 or more cognitive biases that can occur, so as to set in place proper debiasing strategies. Confirmation bias may also cause doctors to perform unnecessary medical procedures due to pressure from adamant patients.

Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist, blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the arrival of scientific medicine. If a patient recovered, medical authorities counted the treatment as successful, rather than looking for alternative explanations such as that the disease had run its natural course. Biased assimilation is a factor in the modern appeal of alternative medicine, whose proponents are swayed by positive anecdotal evidence but treat scientific evidence hyper-critically.

Cognitive therapy was developed by Aaron T. Beck in the early 1960s and has become a popular approach. According to Beck, biased information processing is a factor in depression. His approach teaches people to treat evidence impartially, rather than selectively reinforcing negative outlooks. Phobias and hypochondria have also been shown to involve confirmation bias for threatening information.

=== Politics, law and policing ===

Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased, favoring conclusions that judges, juries or governments have already committed to. Since the evidence in a jury trial can be complex, and jurors often reach decisions about the verdict early on, it is reasonable to expect an attitude polarization effect. The prediction that jurors will become more extreme in their views as they see more evidence has been borne out in experiments with mock trials. Both inquisitorial and adversarial criminal justice systems are affected by confirmation bias.

Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts, from emotionally charged debates to wars: by interpreting the evidence in their favor, each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position. On the other hand, confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict. For example, psychologists Stuart Sutherland and Thomas Kida have each argued that U.S. Navy Admiral Husband E. Kimmel showed confirmation bias when playing down the first signs of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

A two-decade study of political pundits by Philip E. Tetlock found that, on the whole, their predictions were not much better than chance. Tetlock divided experts into &quot;foxes&quot; who maintained multiple hypotheses, and &quot;hedgehogs&quot; who were more dogmatic. In general, the hedgehogs were much less accurate. Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias, and specifically on their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories.

In police investigations, a detective may identify a suspect early in an investigation, but then sometimes largely seek supporting or confirming evidence, ignoring or downplaying falsifying evidence.

=== Social psychology ===
Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves. &quot;Self-verification&quot; is the drive to reinforce the existing self-image and &quot;self-enhancement&quot; is the drive to seek positive feedback. Both are served by confirmation biases. In experiments where people are given feedback that conflicts with their self-image, they are less likely to attend to it or remember it than when given self-verifying feedback. They reduce the impact of such information by interpreting it as unreliable. Similar experiments have found a preference for positive feedback, and the people who give it, over negative feedback.

=== Mass delusions ===
Confirmation bias can play a key role in the propagation of mass delusions. Witch trials are frequently cited as an example.

For another example, in the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic, there seemed to be a &quot;pitting epidemic&quot; in which windshields were damaged due to an unknown cause. As news of the apparent wave of damage spread, more and more people checked their windshields, discovered that their windshields too had been damaged, thus confirming belief in the supposed epidemic. In fact, the windshields were previously damaged, but the damage went unnoticed until people checked their windshields as the delusion spread.

=== Paranormal beliefs ===
One factor in the appeal of alleged psychic readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic&#x27;s statements to their own lives. By making a large number of ambiguous statements in each sitting, the psychic gives the client more opportunities to find a match. This is one of the techniques of cold reading, with which a psychic can deliver a subjectively impressive reading without any prior information about the client. Investigator James Randi compared the transcript of a reading to the client&#x27;s report of what the psychic had said, and found that the client showed a strong selective recall of the &quot;hits&quot;.

As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world, Nickerson mentions numerological pyramidology: the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids. There are many different length measurements that can be made of, for example, the Great Pyramid of Giza and many ways to combine or manipulate them. Hence it is almost inevitable that people who look at these numbers selectively will find superficially impressive correspondences, for example with the dimensions of the Earth.

=== Recruitment and selection ===
Unconscious cognitive bias (including confirmation bias) in job recruitment affects hiring decisions and can potentially prohibit a diverse and inclusive workplace. There are a variety of unconscious biases that affects recruitment decisions but confirmation bias is one of the major ones, especially during the interview stage. The interviewer will often select a candidate that confirms their own beliefs, even though other candidates are equally or better qualified.

== Associated effects and outcomes ==
=== Polarization of opinion ===

When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way, their views can move even further apart. This is called &quot;attitude polarization&quot;. The effect was demonstrated by an experiment that involved drawing a series of red and black balls from one of two concealed &quot;bingo baskets&quot;. Participants knew that one basket contained 60 percent black and 40 percent red balls; the other, 40 percent black and 60 percent red. The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn, a sequence that does not favor either basket. After each ball was drawn, participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket. These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw—whether they initially thought the basket with 60 percent black balls or the one with 60 percent red balls was the more likely source, their estimate of the probability increased. Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls, rather than after each ball. They did not show the polarization effect, suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions, but rather when they openly commit to them.

A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment, in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence. Twenty-three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme, and this self-reported shift correlated strongly with their initial attitudes. In later experiments, participants also reported their opinions becoming more extreme in response to ambiguous information. However, comparisons of their attitudes before and after the new evidence showed no significant change, suggesting that the self-reported changes might not be real. Based on these experiments, Deanna Kuhn and Joseph Lao concluded that polarization is a real phenomenon but far from inevitable, only happening in a small minority of cases, and it was prompted not only by considering mixed evidence, but by merely thinking about the topic.

Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team&#x27;s result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response. The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of gun control and affirmative action. They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate. Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization: those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable. In part of this study, participants chose which information sources to read, from a list prepared by the experimenters. For example, they could read arguments on gun control from the National Rifle Association of America and the Brady Anti-Handgun Coalition. Even when instructed to be even-handed, participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not. This biased search for information correlated well with the polarization effect.

The is a name for the finding that given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly. The phrase was coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler in 2010. However, subsequent research has since failed to replicate findings supporting the backfire effect. One study conducted out of the Ohio State University and George Washington University studied 10,100 participants with 52 different issues expected to trigger a backfire effect. While the findings did conclude that individuals are reluctant to embrace facts that contradict their already held ideology, no cases of backfire were detected. The backfire effect has since been noted to be a rare phenomenon rather than a common occurrence (compare the boomerang effect).

=== Persistence of discredited beliefs ===


Confirmation biases provide one plausible explanation for the persistence of beliefs when the initial evidence for them is removed or when they have been sharply contradicted. This belief perseverance effect has been first demonstrated experimentally by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter. These psychologists spent time with a cult whose members were convinced that the world would end on 21 December 1954. After the prediction failed, most believers still clung to their faith. Their book describing this research is aptly named &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot;.

The term &quot;belief perseverance&quot;, however, was coined in a series of experiments using what is called the &quot;debriefing paradigm&quot;: participants read fake evidence for a hypothesis, their attitude change is measured, then the fakery is exposed in detail. Their attitudes are then measured once more to see if their belief returns to its previous level.

A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debriefing. In one experiment, participants had to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes. The feedback was random: some were told they had done well while others were told they had performed badly. Even after being fully debriefed, participants were still influenced by the feedback. They still thought they were better or worse than average at that kind of task, depending on what they had initially been told.

In another study, participants read job performance ratings of two firefighters, along with their responses to a risk aversion test. This fictional data was arranged to show either a negative or positive association: some participants were told that a risk-taking firefighter did better, while others were told they did less well than a risk-averse colleague. Even if these two case studies were true, they would have been scientifically poor evidence for a conclusion about firefighters in general. However, the participants found them subjectively persuasive. When the case studies were shown to be fictional, participants&#x27; belief in a link diminished, but around half of the original effect remained. Follow-up interviews established that the participants had understood the debriefing and taken it seriously. Participants seemed to trust the debriefing, but regarded the discredited information as irrelevant to their personal belief.

The continued influence effect is the tendency for misinformation to continue to influence memory and reasoning about an event, despite the misinformation having been retracted or corrected. This occurs even when the individual believes the correction.

=== Preference for early information ===
Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series, even when the order is unimportant. For example, people form a more positive impression of someone described as &quot;intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious&quot; than when they are given the same words in reverse order. This &quot;irrational primacy effect&quot; is independent of the primacy effect in memory in which the earlier items in a series leave a stronger memory trace. Biased interpretation offers an explanation for this effect: seeing the initial evidence, people form a working hypothesis that affects how they interpret the rest of the information.

One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns. Participants were told the color distributions of the urns, and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them. In fact, the colors appeared in a prearranged order. The first thirty draws favored one urn and the next thirty favored the other. The series as a whole was neutral, so rationally, the two urns were equally likely. However, after sixty draws, participants favored the urn suggested by the initial thirty.

Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object, seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide. After each slide, participants had to state their best guess of what the object was. Participants whose early guesses were wrong persisted with those guesses, even when the picture was sufficiently in focus that the object was readily recognizable to other people.

=== Illusory association between events ===

Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non-existent correlations in a set of data. This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s. In one experiment, participants read a set of psychiatric case studies, including responses to the Rorschach inkblot test. The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set were more likely to report seeing buttocks, anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the inkblots. In fact the fictional case studies had been constructed so that the homosexual men were no more likely to report this imagery or, in one version of the experiment, were less likely to report it than heterosexual men. In a survey, a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality.

Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients, along with weather conditions over a 15-month period. Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions, although the real correlation was zero.
This effect is a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs. It is also related to biases in hypothesis-testing behavior. In judging whether two events, such as illness and bad weather, are correlated, people rely heavily on the number of &quot;positive-positive&quot; cases: in this example, instances of both pain and bad weather. They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain or good weather). This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing. It may also reflect selective recall, in that people may have a sense that two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together.

<text>A dagger, obelisk, or obelus is a typographical mark that usually indicates a footnote if an asterisk has already been used. The symbol is also used to indicate death (of people) or extinction (of species or languages). It is one of the modern descendants of the obelus, a mark used historically by scholars as a critical or highlighting indicator in manuscripts. In older texts, it is called an &quot;obelisk&quot;.

A double dagger, or diesis, is a variant with two hilts and crossguards that usually marks a third footnote after the asterisk and dagger. The triple dagger is a variant with three crossguards and is used by medievalists to indicate another level of notation.

==History==

The dagger symbol originated from a variant of the obelus, originally depicted by a plain line or a line with one or two dots . It represented an iron roasting spit, a dart, or the sharp end of a javelin, symbolizing the skewering or cutting out of dubious matter.

The obelus is believed to have been invented by the Homeric scholar Zenodotus as one of a system of editorial symbols. They marked questionable or corrupt words or passages in manuscripts of the Homeric epics. The system was further refined by his student Aristophanes of Byzantium, who first introduced the asterisk and used a symbol resembling a for an obelus; and finally by Aristophanes&#x27; student, in turn, Aristarchus, from whom they earned the name of &quot;Aristarchian symbols&quot;.

While the asterisk (&quot;asteriscus&quot;) was used for corrective additions, the obelus was used for corrective deletions of invalid reconstructions. It was used when non-attested words are reconstructed for the sake of argument only, implying that the author did not believe such a word or word form had ever existed. Some scholars used the obelus and various other critical symbols, in conjunction with a second symbol known as the &quot;metobelos&quot; (&quot;end of obelus&quot;), variously represented as two vertically arranged dots, a -like symbol, a mallet-like symbol, or a diagonal slash (with or without one or two dots). They indicated the end of a marked passage.

It was used much in the same way by later scholars to mark differences between various translations or versions of the Bible and other manuscripts. The early Christian Alexandrian scholar Origen ( AD) used it to indicate differences between different versions of the Old Testament in his &quot;Hexapla&quot;. Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310–320 – 403) used both a horizontal slash or hook (with or without dots) and an upright and slightly slanting dagger to represent an obelus. St. Jerome (c. 347–420) used a simple horizontal slash for an obelus, but only for passages in the Old Testament. He describes the use of the asterisk and the dagger as: &quot;an asterisk makes a light shine, the obelisk cuts and pierces&quot;.

Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) described the use of the symbol as follows: &quot;The obelus is appended to words or phrases uselessly repeated, or else where the passage involves a false reading, so that, like the arrow, it lays low the superfluous and makes the errors disappear ... The obelus accompanied by points is used when we do not know whether a passage should be suppressed or not.&quot;

Medieval scribes used the symbols extensively for critical markings of manuscripts. In addition to this, the dagger was also used in notations in early Christianity, to indicate a minor intermediate pause in the chanting of Psalms, equivalent to the quaver rest notation or the trope symbol in Hebrew cantillation. It also indicates a breath mark when reciting, along with the asterisk, and is thus frequently seen beside a comma.

In the 16th century, the printer and scholar Robert Estienne (also known as Stephanus in Latin and Stephens in English) used it to mark differences in the words or passages between different printed versions of the Greek New Testament (&quot;Textus Receptus&quot;).

Due to the variations as to the different uses of the different forms of the obelus, there is some controversy as to which symbols can actually be considered an obelus. The symbol and its variant, the , is sometimes considered to be different from other obeli. The term &#x27;obelus&#x27; may have referred strictly only to the horizontal slash and the dagger symbols.

== Modern usage ==
The dagger usually indicates a footnote if an asterisk has already been used. A third footnote employs the double dagger. Additional footnotes are somewhat inconsistent and represented by a variety of symbols, e.g., parallels ( ), section sign , and the pilcrow some of which were nonexistent in early modern typography. Partly because of this, superscript numerals have increasingly been used in modern literature in the place of these symbols, especially when several footnotes are required. Some texts use asterisks and daggers alongside superscripts, using the former for per-page footnotes and the latter for endnotes.

The dagger is also used to indicate death, extinction, or obsolescence. The asterisk and the dagger, when placed beside years, indicate year of birth and year of death respectively. This usage is particularly common in German. When placed immediately before or after a person&#x27;s name, the dagger indicates that the person is deceased. In this usage, it is referred to as the &quot;death dagger&quot;. Death-related usages include:
*In biology, the dagger next to a taxon name indicates that the taxon is extinct.
*In chemistry, the double dagger is used in chemical kinetics to indicate a short-lived transition state species.
*In genealogy, the dagger is used traditionally to mark a death in genealogical records.
*In chess notation, the dagger may be suffixed to a move to signify the move resulted in a check, and a double dagger denotes checkmate. This is a stylistic variation on the more common (plus sign) for a check and (number sign) for checkmate.
*In linguistics, the dagger placed after a language name indicates an extinct language.
*In philology, the dagger indicates an obsolete form of a word or phrase. As language that has become obsolete in everyday use tends to live on elsewhere, the dagger can indicate language only occurring in poetical texts or &quot;restricted to an archaic, literary style&quot;.
* In the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the dagger symbol indicates an obsolete word.

Non-death usages include:
*The asteroid 37 Fides, the last asteroid to be assigned an astronomical symbol before the practice faded, was assigned the dagger.
*In Anglican chant pointing, the dagger indicates a verse to be sung to the second part of the chant.
*In some early printed Bible translations, a dagger or double dagger indicates that a literal translation of a word or phrase is to be found in the margin. 
*In library cataloging, a double dagger delimits MARC subfields.
*On a cricket scorecard or team list, the dagger indicates the team&#x27;s wicket-keeper.
*Some logicians use the dagger as an affirmation (&#x27;it is true that ...&#x27;) operator.
*The palochka is transliterated to a double dagger in the ISO 9 standard for converting Cyrillic to Latin
*In psychological statistics the dagger indicates that a difference between two figures is not significant to a &quot;p&quot;&lt;0.05 level, however is still considered a &quot;trend&quot; or worthy of note. Commonly this will be used for a p-value between 0.1 and 0.05.
*In mathematics and, more often, physics, a dagger denotes the Hermitian adjoint of an operator; for example, &quot;A&quot;† denotes the adjoint of &quot;A&quot;. This notation is sometimes replaced with an asterisk, especially in mathematics. An operator is said to be Hermitian if &quot;A&quot;† = &quot;A&quot;.
*In textual criticism and in some editions of works written before the invention of printing, daggers enclose text that is believed not to be original.


While daggers are freely used in English-language texts, they are often avoided in other languages because of their similarity to the Christian cross.

<text>Cassowaries (; Biak: &quot;man suar&quot; ; ; Papuan: &quot;kasu weri&quot; ) are flightless birds of the genus Casuarius, in the order Casuariiformes. They are classified as ratites, flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bones. Cassowaries are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea (Western New Guinea and Papua New Guinea), the Moluccas (Seram and Aru Islands), and northeastern Australia.

Three cassowary species are extant. The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. The other two species are the northern cassowary and the dwarf cassowary; the northern cassowary is the most recently discovered and the most threatened. A fourth, extinct, species is the pygmy cassowary.

Cassowaries are very wary of humans, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries. They are known to attack both dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labelled &quot;the world&#x27;s most dangerous bird&quot;, although in terms of recorded statistics, it pales in comparison to the common ostrich, which kills two to three humans per year in South Africa.

== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==
The genus &quot;Casuarius&quot; was erected by French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his published in 1760. The type species is the southern cassowary (&quot;Casuarius casuarius&quot;). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus &quot;Casuarius&quot; in the sixth edition of his published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the southern cassowary together with the common ostrich and the greater rhea in the genus &quot;Struthio&quot;. As the publication date of Linnaeus&#x27;s sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson, and not Linnaeus, is considered the authority for the genus.

Cassowaries (from cognate of several related languages spoken around the Moluccas and New Guinea) are part of the ratite group, which also includes the emu, rheas, ostriches, and kiwi, as well as the extinct moas and elephant birds. These species are recognised:




Most authorities consider the taxonomic classification above to be monotypic, but several subspecies of each have been described, and some of them have even been suggested as separate species, e.g., &quot;C. (b) papuanus&quot;. The taxonomic name &quot;C. (b) papuanus&quot; also may be in need of revision to &quot;Casuarius (bennetti) westermanni&quot;. Validation of these subspecies has proven difficult due to individual variations, age-related variations, the scarcity of specimens, the stability of specimens (the bright skin of the head and neck—the basis of describing several subspecies—fades in specimens), and the practice of trading live cassowaries for thousands of years, some of which are likely to have escaped or been deliberately introduced to regions away from their origin.

The evolutionary history of cassowaries, as of all ratites, is not well known. Genetic evidence suggests that their closest living relatives are emus, and that the dwarf cassowary is more closely related to the Northern Cassowary than either is to the Southern cassowary. A fossil species was reported from Australia, but for reasons of biogeography, this assignment is not certain, and it might belong to the prehistoric &quot;Emuarius&quot;, which was a genus of cassowary-like primitive emus.

== Description ==

Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they are there. The southern cassowary of the far north Queensland rain forests is not well studied, and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males. Adult southern cassowaries are tall, although some females may reach , and weigh . However, it is not uncommon to see exceptionally large females topping the scales beyond , with the largest maximum recorded being a southern cassowary at and tall. 

Hence, by technicality, all three species of cassowaries are considered as Asia&#x27;s largest bird since the extinction of the Arabian ostrich. Moreover, not only is the cassowary Asia&#x27;s largest bird, within New Guinea, the cassowary is the island&#x27;s second largest terrestrial animal after the introduction of Cervidaes such as the rusa deer, chital, and fallow deer.

All cassowaries&#x27; feathers consist of a shaft and loose barbules. They do not have rectrices (tail feathers) or a preen gland. Cassowaries have small wings with five or six large remiges. These are reduced to stiff, keratinous quills, resembling porcupine quills, with no barbs. The furcula and coracoid are degenerate, and their palatal bones and sphenoid bones touch each other. These, along with their wedge-shaped body, are thought to be adaptations to ward off vines, thorns, and saw-edged leaves, allowing them to run quickly through the rainforest.

Unlike the majority of birds, cassowaries lack a tongue. Their beaks are pointed, sharp and robust but not serrated, which allows them to pick up fruit more easily than the short bills of an emu or an ostrich.

Cassowaries have three-toed feet with sharp claws. The inner (first) toe has a dagger-like claw that may be long. This claw is particularly fearsome, since cassowaries sometimes kick humans and other animals with their powerful legs. Cassowaries can run at up to through the dense forest and can jump up to . They are good swimmers, crossing wide rivers and swimming in the sea.

All three species have a keratinous, skin-covered casque on their heads that grows with age. The casque&#x27;s shape and size, up to , is species-dependent. &quot;C. casuarius&quot; has the largest and &quot;C. bennetti&quot; the smallest (tricorn shape), with &quot;C. unappendiculatus&quot; having variations in between. Contrary to earlier findings, the hollow inside of the casque is spanned with fine fibres.

Several functions for the casque have been proposed. One is that they are a secondary sexual characteristic. Other suggested functions include batting through the underbrush, as a weapon in dominance disputes, or pushing aside leaf litter during foraging. The latter three are disputed by biologist Andrew Mack, whose personal observation suggests that the casque amplifies deep sounds. This is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf cassowary and southern cassowary produce very low-frequency sounds, which may aid in communication in dense rainforests. The &quot;boom&quot; vocalization that cassowaries produce is the lowest-frequency bird call known and is at the lower limit of human hearing. Recent study suggests that casque acts as a thermal radiator, offloading heat at high temperatures and restricting heat loss at low temperatures.

The average lifespan of wild cassowaries is approximately 18–20 years, with those held in captivity living up to 40 years.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Cassowaries are solitary birds except during courtship, egg-laying, and sometimes around ample food supplies. Males and females each maintain separate territories that overlap, of a size of approximately 3 square kilometres in one study. While females move among satellite territories of different males, they appear to remain within the same territories for most of their lives, mating with the same, or closely related, males over the course of their lives.

Courtship and pair-bonding rituals begin with the vibratory sounds broadcast by females. Males approach and run with their necks parallel to the ground while making dramatic movements of their heads, which accentuate the frontal neck region. The female approaches drumming slowly. The male crouches on the ground, and the female either steps on the male&#x27;s back for a moment before crouching beside him in preparation for copulation, or she may attack. This is often the case with the females pursuing the males in ritualistic chasing behaviours that generally terminate in water. The male cassowary dives into water and submerges himself up to his upper neck and head. The female pursues him into the water, where he eventually drives her to the shallows, where she crouches making ritualistic motions of her head. The two may remain in copulation for extended periods of time. In some cases, another male may approach and run off the first male. He will climb onto her to copulate, as well.

Both male and female cassowaries do not tolerate the presence of others of the same sex, but females are more prone to fight than males, which will generally flee when encountering another male. While males and females may also be territorial and confrontational, this decreases during the mating season

=== Reproduction ===

The cassowary breeding season starts in May to June. Females lay three to eight large, bright green or pale green-blue eggs in each clutch into a heap of leaf litter prepared by the male. The eggs measure about – only ostrich and emu eggs are larger.

The male incubates those eggs for 50–52 days, removing or adding litter to regulate the temperature, then protects the chicks, which stay in the nest for about 9 months. He defends them fiercely against all potential predators, including humans. The young males later go off to find a territory of their own.

The female does not care for the eggs or the chicks, but rather moves on within her territory to lay eggs in the nests of several other males. Young cassowaries are brown and have buffy stripes. They are often kept as pets in native villages (in New Guinea), where they are permitted to roam like barnyard fowl until nearing maturity. Caged birds are regularly bereft of their fresh plumes.

=== Diet ===

Fruit from at least 26 plant families has been documented in the diet of cassowaries. Fruits from the laurel, podocarp, palm, wild grape, nightshade, and myrtle families are important items in the diet. The poisonous cassowary plum takes its name from the bird. The bird avoids the poisons of these fruits due to the presence of their incredibly short gastrointestinal tract, the shortest of all ratites in relation to their size. The cassowary&#x27;s incredibly short and simple digestive tract leads to a short gut retention time which allow seeds to remain unharmed during the comparatively soft digestion process and allows them to consume fruits that contain toxins such as cyanogens. This short gut length also allows the birds to eat a wider variety of protein source, which is unsurprising given their omnivorous diet.

Where trees are dropping fruit, cassowaries come in and feed, with each bird defending a tree from others for a few days. They move on when the fruit is depleted. Fruit, even items as large as bananas and apples, is swallowed whole. Cassowaries are a keystone species of rain forests because they eat fallen fruit whole and distribute seeds across the jungle floor via excrement.

Adult and young cassowaries also practice coprophagia. As adult waste often contain half-digested fruit which still has nutritional value, so the birds would devour each other&#x27;s as well as their own droppings.

In more urbanised areas, especially in Queensland, Australia, &#x27;urbanised&#x27; cassowaries have adopted to also feed on picnic blankets, tables and baskets or backyard bird feeders and compost heaps, thereby consuming a wide range of non-natural and non-native foods as well. In fact, cassowaries are known to eat non-edible items—in one case, collection of urban cassowary droppings resulted in many unusual items. Outside of the skeletal remains of a honeyeater, researchers also found remains of a child’s coloured building blocks, various sized marbles and a very small plastic car that came from a cereal packet. In terms of roadkill, discarded fish was reported; another type of roadkill reported eaten by cassowaries is the bandicoot. 

In captivity, cassowaries get the majority of their protein source from dog or monkey food. In fact, captive cassowaries consume almost of a protein source (such as dog food) in conjunction with of fruit a day, which results in 5% of their overall diet.

=== Role in seed dispersal and germination ===

Cassowaries feed on the fruit of several hundred rainforest species and usually pass viable seeds in large, dense scats. They are known to disperse seeds over distances greater than a kilometre, thus playing an important role in the ecosystem. Germination rates for seeds of the rare Australian rainforest tree &quot;Ryparosa&quot; were found to be much higher after passing through a cassowary&#x27;s gut (92% versus 4%).

In its main home of New Guinea, cassowaries are the island&#x27;s largest and most dominant and formidable bird, as well as being one of the largest terrestrial endemic animals in New Guinea. As such, adult cassowaries have no natural enemies other than humans (and even then, the birds are rarely hunted due to their reputation, speed, wariness and self-defence, with juveniles being preferred over adults for ceremonial purposes - on average, it is considered very fortunate for a human hunter to kill one in every five years). With regards to their relationship with the New Guinea singing dogs - one of Papua&#x27;s only obligate terrestrial apex predator, with the other being the crocodile monitor - adult birds generally ignore them, with some even believing that the dogs take full advantage of the birds&#x27; foraging behaviour, as both species share and use the same feeding trail through the forests. It was believed that these dogs follow adult birds to catch small prey attracted to the dropped fruits on the rainforest floor. Nevertheless, there was a report from a native hunter of an exceptionally rare case of a singing dog attacking the dwarf species. The incident ended with the singing dog being disemboweled and ripped open by the bird. But generally speaking, both animals mutually keep their distance and avoid one another.

The same cannot be said with their chicks, however, as they are vulnerable to large pythons, monitor lizards, New Guinea singing dogs, and Papuan eagles. When threatened, it is known that cassowary chicks emit different vocalisation calls to indicate the specific threat, such as a hawk for example, before running underneath their father. Adult males aggressively defend their chicks. While adult males usually scare off or kill most predators, a chick will occasionally be separated in the chaos and become a potential target. 

However, in the relic populations of north-eastern Australia, the cassowary population faces threats from vehicles, and are in danger of being outcompeted by wild boars, with their eggs being most vulnerable to boar predation. Their chicks also face dangers and predation from domesticated dogs, which results in a widespread decline in the Australian mainland. Because of such frequent inter-species conflicts, hunting dogs are one of the biggest enemies for cassowaries, and it is not unheard of for hunting dogs to accidentally kill cassowary chicks instead of feral pigs, with the dogs in-turn, being killed by the nearby adult rooster. Outside of threats from invasive species, the birds are also vulnerable to being unintentionally poisoned as well. It is unknown why the cassowary population in Australia is in decline, as the New Guinea population has dealt with introduced wild boars, dogs and feral cats for thousands of years longer with little to no impact on its population, suggesting that either the cassowaries of New Guinea had long adapted to human-introduced species or that the rich biodiversity of New Guinea allowed for additional niche partitioning.

As for eating the cassowary, it is supposed to be quite tough. Australian administrative officers stationed in New Guinea were advised that it &quot;should be cooked with a stone in the pot: when the stone is ready to eat, so is the cassowary&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Cassowaries are native to the humid rainforests of New Guinea, nearby smaller islands, East Nusa Tenggara, the Maluku Islands, and northeastern Australia. They do, however, venture out into palm scrub, grassland, savanna, and swamp forest. The wild population of cassowaries is threatened by deforestation, hunting, and habitat destruction. Human presence and agricultural activities have also contributed to the decline of their population in some areas. To protect this species, various conservation efforts have been carried out, including preserving natural habitat and enforcing regulations against illegal hunting. In Indonesia, cassowaries are predominantly found in the rainforests of Papua, particularly in lowland and montane areas. In addition, cassowaries are known to inhabit protected areas such as Wasur National Park in Merauke and Lorentz National Park, which is the largest national park in Southeast Asia, encompassing a vast range of ecosystems from coastal to alpine environments. These birds play a critical ecological role in seed dispersal, contributing to the regeneration of forests in these protected areas. They can also be easily spotted in some national parks such as Mellwraith Range National Park, Paluma Range National Park, and Jardine National Park in Australia.

== Status and conservation ==
The southern cassowary is endangered in Queensland. Kofron and Chapman, when they assessed the decline of this species, found that of the former cassowary habitat, only 20–25% remains. Habitat loss and fragmentation is the primary cause of decline. They then studied 140 cases of cassowary mortality, and found that motor-vehicle strikes accounted for 55% of the deaths, and dog attacks produced another 18%. Remaining causes of death included hunting (five cases), entanglement in wire (one case), the removal of cassowaries that attacked humans (four cases), and natural causes (18 cases), including tuberculosis (four cases). The cause for 14 cases was indicated as &quot;for unknown reasons&quot;.

Hand feeding cassowaries poses a significant threat to their survival because it lures them into suburban areas. There, the birds are more susceptible to encounters with vehicles and dogs. Contact with humans encourages cassowaries to take food from picnic tables. Feral pigs also are a significant threat to their survival. They destroy nests and eggs of cassowaries, but their worst effect is as competitors for food, which may be catastrophic for the cassowaries during lean times.

In February 2011, Cyclone Yasi destroyed a large area of cassowary habitat, endangering 200 of the birds – about 10% of the total Australian population.

The Mission Beach community in far north Queensland holds an annual Cassowary Festival in September, where funds are raised to map the bird&#x27;s habitat.

Ironically, despite being a threatened species in Queensland, concerns also mount on cassowaries being itself, a potential invasive species on the island of Tasmania. According to the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment from Hobart, risk assessments on the cassowary as a potential invasive pest states that whilst the birds may have trouble establishing a stable population on the island, they would nonetheless, be considered a destructive element to Tasmania&#x27;s ecological diversity and recommends strict imports on these birds. Reasons are many. The most notable are the birds&#x27; size. Cassowaries would automatically become the island&#x27;s largest and most dominant terrestrial animal that could bully smaller animals in the same ecological niche. Frugivores such as the common brushtail possum, common ringtail possum, eastern pygmy possum and the little pygmy possum would be denied access to fruit of which they depend upon.

However, since Tasmania lack the same levels of fruit diversity as Queensland and New Guinea, assessments believe that the birds would adapt by also eating invertebrates and small vertebrates. This may lead to some competition with the island&#x27;s endemic insectivores such as the eastern quoll, southern brown bandicoot, and eastern barred bandicoot.

== In captivity ==
The cassowary has solitary habits and breeds less frequently in zoos than other ratites such as ostrich and emu. Unlike other ratites, it lives exclusively in tropical rainforest, and reproducing this habitat carefully is essential. Unlike the emu, which will live with other sympatric species, such as kangaroos, in &quot;mixed Australian fauna&quot; displays, the cassowary does not cohabit well among its own kind. Individual specimens must even be kept in separate enclosures, due to their solitary and aggressive nature. Territoriality is one of their most important characteristics.

The double-wattled cassowary (&quot;C. casuarius&quot;) is the most popular species in captivity, and it is fairly common in European and American zoos, where it is known for its unmistakable appearance. , only Weltvogelpark Walsrode in Germany has all three species of cassowaries in its collection: single-wattled cassowary (&quot;Casuarius unappendiculatus&quot;) and Bennett&#x27;s cassowary (&quot;Casuarius bennetti&quot;). If subspecies are recognised, Weltvogelpark Walsrode has &quot;C. b. westermanni&quot; and &quot;C. u. rufotinctus&quot;.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Role in Papuan cultures and semi-domestication ===

There is evidence that the cassowary may have been domesticated by humans thousands of years before the chicken. Some New Guinea Highlands societies capture cassowary chicks and raise them as semi-tame poultry, for use in ceremonial gift exchanges and as food. They are the only indigenous Australasian animal known to have been partly domesticated by people prior to European arrival and colonization and by definition, the oldest form of domesticated animal and the largest domesticated bird. The Maring people of Kundagai sacrificed cassowaries (&quot;C. bennetti&quot;) in certain rituals. The Kalam people considered themselves related to cassowaries, and did not classify them as birds, but as kin. Consequently, they use the Pandanus register of the Kalam language when eating cassowary meat.

Studies on Pleistocene/early Holocene cassowary remains in Papua suggest that indigenous people at the time preferred to harvest eggs rather than adults. They seem to have regulated their consumption of these birds, possibly even collecting eggs and rearing young birds as one of the earliest forms of domestication.

=== Urbanisation of local cassowary population ===

In extremely urbanised areas where cassowaries used to naturally live such as in Queensland, Australia or in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the local cassowary population had adapted to its less forested grounds. Increasing urbanisation has increased the likelihood of human-cassowary interaction, a potentially dangerous mix. Although cassowary populations have faced challenges in these urban areas in Northeastern Australia and parts of New Guinea, the cassowaries have proven to be surprisingly quite adaptable in contrast to the kiwis of New Zealand, potentially making them the largest urbanised birds in the world. 

It was found that cassowaries in these urban environments changed their diets accordingly, with urbanised cassowaries actually consuming an even greater proportion of fruits from exotic plants (~30%) but still incorporating a significant proportion of fruits from native plants in their diet. Likewise, as aforementioned, the high concentration of human activity in the urban ecology also equates to a higher concentration of food diversity and food waste, with these &#x27;urbanised&#x27; cassowaries foraging for food scraps, bird feeders and outdoor picnic/food venues without fear from humans or domesticated animals due to the birds&#x27; size and reputation. 

Due to their omnivorous nature, cassowaries are able to eat all types of human food, including processed ones if interested, although fruit still remains their favourite choosings. A 2013 study from post-mortem investigations found that a combination of fruit scarcity and abundancy in human waste saw the diet of the cassowary intaking vast quantities of non-fruit items, this include fungus, carrion, meat, cheese, bones, pasta, chilli and tomato. The high concentration of human activity as well as vehicles, mixed with domesticated animals and less forest coverage, had also changed their behaviours. These &#x27;city&#x27; cassowaries were shown to exist in a higher state of activity and rested less than individuals inhabiting more intact swathes of rainforest, actively moving between urban gardens and the rainforest. The study give evidence that these birds showed a surprising amount of flexible foraging strategy that has enabled them to persist in rainforest-fragmented landscapes.

=== Attacks ===
Cassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals. During World War II, American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of them. In his 1958 book &quot;Living Birds of the World&quot;, ornithologist Ernest Thomas Gilliard wrote:

The inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird.

This assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors, including Gregory S. Paul and Jared Diamond. A 2003 historical study of 221 cassowary attacks showed that 150 had been against humans; 75% of these had been from cassowaries that had been fed by people, 71% of the time the bird had chased or charged the victim, and 15% of the time they kicked. Of the attacks, 73% involved the birds expecting or snatching food, 5% involved defending their natural food sources, 15% involved defending themselves, and 7% involved defending their chicks or eggs. Only one human death was reported among those 150 attacks.

The first documented human death caused by a cassowary was on April 6, 1926. In Australia, 16-year-old Phillip McClean and his brother, age 13, came across a cassowary on their property and decided to try to kill it by striking it with clubs. The bird kicked the younger boy, who fell and ran away as his older brother struck the bird. The older McClean then tripped and fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, the cassowary kicked him in the neck, opening a wound that severed his jugular vein. The boy died of his injuries shortly thereafter.

Cassowary strikes to the abdomen are among the rarest of all, but in one case in 1995, a dog was kicked in the belly. The blow left no puncture, but severe bruising occurred. The dog later died from an apparent intestinal rupture.

Another human death due to a cassowary was recorded in Florida on April 12, 2019. The bird&#x27;s owner, a 75-year-old man who had raised the animal, was apparently clawed to death after he fell to the ground.

<doc id="59171" wikidata="Q176741" url="?curid=59171" title="Mumps">
<text>Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus. Initial symptoms of mumps are non-specific and include fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, and loss of appetite. These symptoms are usually followed by painful swelling around the side of the face (the parotid glands, called parotitis), which is the most common symptom of a mumps infection. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure to the virus. About one-third of people with a mumps infection do not have any symptoms (asymptomatic).

Complications are rare but include deafness and a wide range of inflammatory conditions, of which inflammation of the testes, breasts, ovaries, pancreas, meninges, and brain are the most common. Viral meningitis can occur in 1/4 of people with mumps. Testicular inflammation may result in reduced fertility and, rarely, sterility.

Humans are the only natural hosts of the mumps virus. The mumps virus is an RNA virus in the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;. The virus is primarily transmitted by respiratory secretions such as droplets and saliva, as well as via direct contact with an infected person. Mumps is highly contagious and spreads easily in densely populated settings. Transmission can occur from one week before the onset of symptoms to eight days after. During infection, the virus first infects the upper respiratory tract. From there, it spreads to the salivary glands and lymph nodes. Infection of the lymph nodes leads to the presence of the virus in the blood, which spreads the virus throughout the body. In places where mumps is common, it can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation. In places where mumps is less common, however, laboratory diagnosis using antibody testing, viral cultures, or real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction may be needed. 

There is no specific treatment for mumps, so treatment is supportive and includes rest and pain relief. Mumps infection is usually self-limiting, coming to an end as the immune system clears the infection. Infection can be prevented with vaccination. The MMR vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine to prevent mumps infections and is used widely around the world. The MMR vaccine also protects against measles and rubella. The spread of the disease can also be prevented by isolating infected individuals.

Mumps historically has been a highly prevalent disease, commonly occurring in outbreaks in densely crowded spaces. In the absence of vaccination, infection normally occurs in childhood, most frequently at the ages of 5–9. Symptoms and complications are more common in males and more severe in adolescents and adults. Infection is most common in winter and spring in temperate climates, whereas no seasonality is observed in tropical regions. Written accounts of mumps have existed since ancient times, and the cause of mumps, the mumps virus, was discovered in 1934. By the 1970s, vaccines had been created to protect against infection, and countries that have adopted mumps vaccination have seen a near-elimination of the disease. In the 21st century, however, there has been a resurgence in the number of cases in many countries that vaccinate, primarily among adolescents and young adults, due to multiple factors such as waning vaccine immunity and opposition to vaccination.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mumps&quot; was first attested circa 1600 and is the plural form of &quot;mump&quot;, meaning &quot;grimace&quot;, originally a verb meaning &quot;to whine or mutter like a beggar&quot;. The disease was likely called mumps due to the swelling caused by mumps parotitis, reflecting its impact on facial expressions and the painful, difficult swallowing that it causes. &quot;Mumps&quot; was also used starting from the 17th century to mean &quot;a fit of melancholy, sullenness, silent displeasure&quot;. Mumps is sometimes called &quot;epidemic parotitis&quot;.

==History==
According to Chinese medical literature, mumps was recorded as far back as 640 B.C. The Greek physician Hippocrates documented an outbreak on the island of Thasos in approximately 410 B.C. and provided a fuller description of the disease in the first book of &quot;Epidemics&quot; in the Corpus Hippocraticum. In modern times, the disease was first described scientifically in 1790 by British physician Robert Hamilton in &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot;. During the First World War, mumps was one of the most debilitating diseases among soldiers. In 1934, the etiology of the disease, the mumps virus, was discovered by Claude D. Johnson and Ernest William Goodpasture. They found that rhesus macaques exposed to saliva taken from humans in the early stages of the disease developed mumps. Furthermore, they showed that mumps could then be transferred to children via filtered and sterilized, bacteria-less preparations of macerated monkey parotid tissue, showing that it was a viral disease.

In 1945, the mumps virus was isolated for the first time. Just a few years later, in 1948, an inactivated vaccine using killed viruses was invented. This vaccine provided only short-term immunity and was later discontinued. It was replaced in the 1970s with vaccines that have live but weakened viruses, which are more effective at providing long-term immunity than the inactivated vaccine. The first of these vaccines was Mumpsvax, licensed on 30 March 1967, which used the Jeryl Lynn strain. Maurice Hilleman created this vaccine using the strain taken from his five-year-old daughter, Jeryl Lynn. Mumpsvax was recommended for use in 1977, and the Jeryl Lynn strain continues to be used.

Hilleman worked to combine the attenuated mumps vaccines with the measles and rubella vaccines, creating the MMR-1 vaccine. In 1971, a newer version, MMR-2, was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the 1980s, the benefit of multiple doses was recognized, so a two-dose immunization schedule was widely adopted. With MMR-2, four other MMR vaccines have been created since the 1960s: Triviraten, Morupar, Priorix, and Trimovax. Since the mid-2000s, two MMRV vaccines have been in use: Priorix-Tetra and ProQuad.

The United States began to vaccinate against mumps in the 1960s, with other countries following suit. From 1977 to 1985, 290 cases per 100,000 people were diagnosed each year worldwide. Although few countries recorded mumps cases after they began vaccination, those that did reported dramatic declines. From 1968 to 1982, cases declined by 97% in the U.S., and in Finland cases were reduced to less than one per 100,000 people per year, and a decline from 160 cases per 100,000 to 17 per 100,000 per year in England was observed from 1989 to 1995. By 2001, there had been a 99.9% reduction in the number of cases in the U.S. and similar near-elimination in other vaccinating countries.

In Japan in 1993, concerns over the rates of aseptic meningitis following MMR vaccination with the Urabe strain prompted the removal of MMR vaccines from the national immunization program, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of cases. Japan provides voluntary mumps vaccination separately from measles and rubella. Starting in the mid-1990s, controversies surrounding the MMR vaccine emerged. One paper connected the MMR vaccine to Crohn&#x27;s disease in 1995, and another in 1998 connected it to autism spectrum disorders and inflammatory bowel disease. These papers are now considered to be fraudulent and incorrect, and no association between the MMR vaccine and the aforementioned conditions has been identified. Despite this, their publication led to a significant decline in vaccination rates, ultimately causing measles, mumps, and rubella to reemerge in places with lowered vaccination rates.

Outbreaks in the 21st century include more than 300,000 cases in China in 2013 and more than 56,000 cases in England and Wales in 2004–2005. In the latter outbreak, most cases were reported in 15–24 year olds who were attending colleges and universities. This age group was thought to be vulnerable to infection because of the MMR vaccine controversies when they should have been vaccinated or MMR vaccine shortages that had also occurred at that time. Similar outbreaks in densely crowded environments have frequently occurred in many other countries, including the U.S., the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium.

===Resurgence===
In the 21st century, mumps has reemerged in many places that vaccinate against it, causing recurrent outbreaks. These outbreaks have largely affected adolescents and young adults in densely crowded spaces, such as schools, sports teams, religious gatherings, and the military, and it is expected that outbreaks will continue to occur. The cause of this reemergence is subject to debate, and various factors have been proposed, including waning immunity from vaccination, low vaccination rates, vaccine failure, and potential antigenic variation of the mumps virus.

Waning immunity from vaccines is likely the primary cause of the mumps resurgence. In the past, subclinical natural infections provided boosts to immunity similar to vaccines. As time went on with vaccine use, these asymptomatic infections declined in frequency, likely leading to a reduction in long-term immunity against mumps. With less long-term immunity, the effects of waning vaccine immunity became more prominent, and vaccinated individuals have frequently fallen ill from mumps. A third dose of the vaccine provided in adolescence has been considered to address this as some studies support this. Other research indicates that a third dose may be useful only for short-term immunity in responding to outbreaks, which is recommended for at-risk persons by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Low vaccination rates have been implicated as the cause of some outbreaks in the UK, Canada, Sweden, and Japan, whereas outbreaks in other places, such as the U.S., the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands, have occurred mainly among the vaccinated. Compared to the measles and rubella vaccines, mumps vaccines appear to have a relatively high failure rate, varying depending on the vaccine strain. This has been addressed by providing two vaccine doses, supported by recent outbreaks among the vaccinated having primarily occurred among those who received only one dose. Lastly, certain mumps virus lineages are highly divergent genetically from vaccine strains, which may cause a mismatch between protection against vaccine strains and non-vaccine strains, though research is inconclusive on this matter.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Common symptoms===
The incubation period, the time between the start of an infection and when symptoms begin to show, is about 7–25 days, averaging 16–18 days. 20–40% of infections are asymptomatic or are restricted to mild respiratory symptoms, sometimes with a fever. Over the course of the disease, three distinct phases are recognized: prodromal, early acute, and established acute. The prodromal phase typically has non-specific, mild symptoms such as a low-grade fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and sore throat. In the early acute phase, as the mumps virus spreads throughout the body, systemic symptoms emerge. Most commonly, parotitis occurs during this time period. During the established acute phase, orchitis, meningitis, and encephalitis may occur, and these conditions are responsible for the bulk of mumps morbidity.

The parotid glands are salivary glands situated on the sides of the mouth in front of the ears. Inflammation of them, called parotitis, is the most common mumps symptom and occurs in about 90% of symptomatic cases and 60–70% of total infections. During mumps parotitis, usually both the left and right parotid glands experience painful swelling, with unilateral swelling in a small percentage of cases. Parotitis occurs 2–3 weeks after exposure to the virus, within two days of developing symptoms, and usually lasts 2–3 days, but it may last as long as a week or longer.

In 90% of parotitis cases, swelling on one side is delayed rather than both sides swelling in unison. The parotid duct, which is the opening that provides saliva from the parotid glands to the mouth, may become red, swollen, and filled with fluid. Parotitis is usually preceded by local tenderness and occasionally earache. Other salivary glands, namely the submandibular, and sublingual glands, may also swell. Inflammation of these glands is rarely the only symptom.

===Complications===
Outside of the salivary glands, inflammation of the testes, called orchitis, is the most common symptom of infection. Pain, swelling, and warmness of a testis appear usually 1–2 weeks after the onset of parotitis but can occur up to six weeks later. During mumps orchitis, the scrotum is tender and inflamed. It occurs in 10–40% of pubertal and post-pubertal males who contract mumps. Usually, mumps orchitis affects only one testis but in 10–30% of cases both are affected. Mumps orchitis is accompanied by inflammation of the epididymis, called epididymitis, about 85% of the time, typically occurring before orchitis. The onset of mumps orchitis is associated with a high-grade fever, vomiting, headache, and malaise. In prepubertal males, orchitis is rare as symptoms are usually restricted to parotitis.

A variety of other inflammatory conditions may also occur as a result of mumps virus infection, including:
* Mastitis, inflammation of the breasts, in up to about 30% of post-pubertal women
* Oophoritis, inflammation of an ovary, in 5–10% of post-pubertal women, which usually presents as pelvic pain
* Aseptic meningitis, inflammation of the meninges, in 5–10% of cases and 4–6% of those with parotitis, typically occurring 4–10 days after the onset of symptoms. Mumps meningitis can also occur up to one week before parotitis as well as in the absence of parotitis. It is commonly accompanied by fever, headache, vomiting, and neck stiffness.
* Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, in about 4% of cases, which causes severe pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen below the ribs
* Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, in less than 0.5% of cases. People who experience mumps encephalitis typically experience a fever, altered consciousness, seizures, and weakness. Like meningitis, mumps encephalitis can occur in the absence of parotitis.
* Meningoencephalitis, inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes. Mumps meningoencephalitis is commonly accompanied by fever 97% of the time, vomiting 94% of the time, and headache 88.8% of the time.
* Nephritis, inflammation of the kidneys, which is rare because kidney involvement in mumps is usually benign but leads to presence of the virus in urine
* Inflammation of the joints (arthritis), which may affect at least five joints (polyarthritis), multiple nerves in the peripheral nervous system (polyneuritis), pneumonia, gallbladder without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis), cornea and uveal tract (keratouveitis), thyroids (thyroiditis), liver (hepatitis), retina (retinitis), and corneal endothelium (corneal endothelitis), all of which are rare
* Recurrent sialadenitis, inflammation of the salivary glands, which is frequent

A relatively common complication is deafness, which occurs in about 4% of cases. Mumps deafness is often accompanied by vestibular symptoms such as vertigo and repetitive, uncontrolled eye movements. Based on electrocardiographic abnormalities in the infected, MuV also likely infects cardiac tissue, but this is usually asymptomatic. Rarely, myocarditis and pericarditis can occur. Fluid buildup in the brain, called hydrocephalus, has also been observed. In the first trimester of pregnancy, mumps may increase the risk of miscarriage. Otherwise, mumps is not associated with birth defects.

Other rare complications of infection include: paralysis, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, cerebellar ataxia, transverse myelitis, ascending polyradiculitis, a polio-like disease, arthropathy, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Guillain–Barré syndrome, post-infectious encephalitis encephalomyelitis, and hemophagocytic syndrome. At least one complication occurs in combination with the standard mumps symptoms in up to 42% of cases. Mumps has also been connected to the onset of type 1 diabetes, and, relatedly, the mumps virus is able to infect and replicate in insulin-producing beta cells. Among children, seizures occur in about 20–30% of cases involving the central nervous system.

==Cause==
Mumps is caused by the mumps virus (MuV), scientific name &quot;Mumps orthorubulavirus&quot;, which belongs to the &quot;Orthorubulavirus&quot; genus in the &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; family of viruses. Humans are the only natural host of the mumps virus. MuV&#x27;s genome is made of RNA and contains seven genes that encode nine proteins. In MuV particles, the genome is encased by a helical capsid. The capsid is surrounded by a viral envelope that has spikes protruding from its surface. MuV particles are pleomorphic in shape and range from 100 to 600 nanometers in diameter.

The replication cycle of MuV begins when the spikes on its surface bond to a cell, which then causes the envelope to fuse with the host cell&#x27;s cell membrane, releasing the capsid into the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. Upon entry, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) transcribes messenger RNA (mRNA) from the genome, which is then translated by the host cell&#x27;s ribosomes to synthesize viral proteins. RdRp then begins replicating the viral genome to produce progeny. Viral spike proteins fuse into the host cell&#x27;s membrane, and new virions are formed at the sites beneath the spikes. MuV then utilizes host cell proteins to leave the host cell by budding from its surface, using the host cell&#x27;s membrane as the viral envelope.

Twelve genotypes of MuV are recognized, named genotypes A to N, excluding E and M. These genotypes vary in frequency from region to region. For example, genotypes C, D, H, and J are more common in the western hemisphere, whereas genotypes F, G, and I are more common in Asia, although genotype G is considered to be a global genotype. Genotypes A and B have not been observed in the wild since the 1990s. MuV has just one serotype, so antibodies to one genotype are functional against all genotypes. MuV is a relatively stable virus and is unlikely to experience antigenic shifting that may cause new strains to emerge.

==Transmission==
The mumps virus is mainly transmitted by inhalation or oral contact with respiratory droplets or secretions. In experiments, mumps could develop after inoculation either via the mouth or the nose. Respiratory transmission is also supported by the presence of MuV in cases of respiratory illness without parotitis, detection in nasal samples, and transmission between people in close contact. MuV is excreted in saliva from approximately one week before to eight days after the onset of symptoms, peaking at the onset of parotitis, though it has also been identified in the saliva of asymptomatic individuals.

Mother-to-child transmission has been observed in various forms. In non-human primates, placental transmission has been observed, which is supported by the isolation of MuV from spontaneous and planned aborted fetuses during maternal mumps. MuV has also been isolated from newborns whose mother was infected. While MuV has been detected in breast milk, it is unclear if the virus can be transmitted through it. Other manners of transmission include direct contact with infected droplets or saliva, fomites contaminated by saliva and possibly urine. Most transmissions likely occur before the development of symptoms and up to five days after such time.

In susceptible populations, a single case can cause up to twelve new ones. The period when a person is contagious lasts from two days before the onset of symptoms to nine days after symptoms have ceased. Asymptomatic carriers of the mump virus can also transmit the virus. These factors are thought to be reasons why controlling the spread of mumps is difficult. Furthermore, reinfection can occur after natural infection or vaccination, indicating that lifelong immunity is not guaranteed after infection. Vaccinated individuals who are infected appear to be less contagious than the unvaccinated.

The average number of new cases generated from a single case in a susceptible population called the basic reproduction number, is 4–7. Given this, it is estimated that a vaccination rate between 79 and 100% is needed to achieve herd immunity. Outbreaks continue to occur in places that have vaccination rates exceeding 90%, however, suggesting that other factors may influence disease transmission. Outbreaks that have occurred in these vaccinated communities typically occur in highly crowded areas such as schools and military dormitories.

==Pathogenesis==
Many aspects of the pathogenesis of mumps are poorly understood and are inferred from clinical observations and experimental infections in laboratory animals. These animal studies may be unreliable due to unnatural methods of inoculation. Following exposure, the virus infects epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract that express sialic acid receptors on their surface. After infection, the virus spreads to the parotid glands, causing the signature parotitis. It is thought that shortly after infection the virus spreads to lymph nodes, in particular T-cells and viruses in the blood, called viremia. Viremia lasts for 7–10 days, during which MuV spreads throughout the body.

In mumps orchitis, infection leads to: parenchymal edema; congestion, or separation, of the seminiferous tubules; and perivascular infiltration by lymphocytes. The tunica albuginea forms a barrier against edema, causing an increase in intratesticular pressure that causes necrosis of the seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules also experience hyalinization, i.e. degeneration into a translucent glass-like substance, which can cause fibrosis and atrophy of the testes.

In up to half of cases, MuV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS), where it may cause meningitis, encephalitis, or hydrocephalus. Mumps is rarely fatal, so few post-mortem analyses have been done to analyze CNS involvement. Of these, fluid buildup, congestion, and hemorrhaging in the brain, white blood cell infiltration in the perivascular spaces in the brain, reactive changes to glial cells and damage to the myelin sheaths surrounding neurons were observed. Neurons appear to be relatively unaffected.

In laboratory tests on rodents, MuV appears to enter the CNS first through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), then spreading to the ventricular system. There, MuV replicates in ependymal cells that line the ventricles, which allows the virus to enter the brain parenchyma. This often leads to MuV infecting pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Infected ependymal cells become inflamed, lose their cilia, and collapse into CSF, which may be the cause of the narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct thought to cause mumps hydrocephalus.

In humans, mumps hydrocephalus may be due to obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct with dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, obstruction of the interventricular foramina, or obstruction of the median and lateral apertures. Ependymal cells have been isolated from CSF of mumps patients, suggesting that animals and humans share hydrocephalus pathogenesis. Hydrocephalus has also been observed in the absence of canal obstruction, however, indicating that obstruction may be a result of external compression by edematous tissue and not related to hydrocephalus.

Deafness from mumps may be caused by MuV infection in CSF, which has contact with the perilymph of the inner ear, possibly leading to infection of the cochlea, or it may occur as a result of inner ear infection via viremia that leads to inflammation in the endolymph. Hearing loss may also be caused indirectly by the immune response. In animal studies, MuV has been isolated from the vestibular ganglion, which may explain vestibular symptoms such as vertigo that often co-occur with deafness.

==Immune response==
Even though MuV has just one serotype, significant variation in the quantity of genotype-specific sera needed to neutralize different genotypes &quot;in vitro&quot; has been observed. Neutralizing antibodies in the salivary glands may be important in restricting MuV replication and transmission via saliva, as the level of viral secretion in saliva inversely correlates to the quantity of MuV-specific IgA produced. The neutralizing ability of salivary IgA appears to be greater than serum IgG and IgM.

It has been proposed that symptomatic infections in the vaccinated may be because memory T lymphocytes generated as a result of vaccination may be necessary but insufficient for protection. The immune system in general appears to have a relatively weak response to the mumps virus, indicated by various measures: antibody production appears to be predominately directed toward non-neutralizing viral proteins, and there may be a low quantity of MuV-specific memory B lymphocytes. The amount of antibodies needed to confer immunity is unknown.

==Diagnosis==
In places where mumps is widespread, diagnosis can be made based on the development of parotitis and a history of exposure to someone with mumps. In places where mumps is less common because parotitis has other causes, laboratory diagnosis may be needed to verify mumps infection. A differential diagnosis may be used to compare symptoms to other diseases, including allergic reaction, mastoiditis, measles, and pediatric HIV infection and rubella. MuV can be isolated from saliva, blood, the nasopharynx, salivary ducts, and seminal fluid within one week of the onset of symptoms, as well as from cell cultures. In meningitis cases, MuV can be isolated from CSF. In CNS cases, a lumbar puncture may be used to rule out other potential causes, which shows normal opening pressure, more than ten leukocytes per cubic millimeter, elevated lymphocyte count in CSF, polymorphonuclear leukocytes up to 25% of the time, often a mildly elevated protein level, and a slightly reduced CSF glucose to blood glucose ratio up to 30% of the time.

Mumps-specific IgM antibodies in serum or oral fluid specimens can be used to identify mumps. IgM quantities peak up to eight days after the onset of symptoms, and IgM can be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 7–10 days after the onset of symptoms. Sensitivity to IgM testing is variable, ranging from as low as 24–51% to 75% in the first week and 100% thereafter. Throughout infection, IgM titers increase four-fold between the acute phase and recovery. False negatives can occur in people previously infected or vaccinated, in which case a rise of serum IgG may be more useful for diagnosis. False positives can occur after infection of parainfluenza viruses1 and 3 and Newcastle disease virus as well as recently after mumps vaccination.

Antibody titers can also be measured with complement fixation tests, hemagglutination assays, and neutralization tests. In vaccinated people, antibody-based diagnosis can be difficult since IgM oftentimes cannot be detected in acute-phase serum samples. In these instances, it is easier to identify MuV RNA from oral fluid, a throat swab, or urine. In meningitis cases, MuV-specific IgM can be found in CSF in half of cases, and IgG in 30–90%, sometimes lasting for more than a year with increased white blood cell count. These findings are not associated with an increased risk of long-term complications. Most parotitis cases have elevated white blood cell count in CSF.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be used to detect MuV RNA from the first day symptoms appear, declining over the next 8–10 days. rRT-PCR of saliva is typically positive from 2–3 days before parotitis develops to 4–5 days after and has a sensitivity of about 70%. Since MuV replicates in kidneys, viral culture and RNA detection in urine can be used for diagnosis up to two weeks after symptoms begin, though rRT-PCR used to identify the virus in urine has a very low sensitivity compared to virus cultures at below 30%. In meningoencephalitis cases, a nested RT-PCR can detect MuV RNA in CSF up to two years after infection.

In sialadenitis cases, imaging shows an enlargement of the salivary glands, fat stranding, and thickening of the superficial cervical fascia and platysma muscles, which are situated on the front side of the neck. If parotitis occurs only on one side, then detection of mumps-specific IgM antibodies, IgG titer, or PCR is required for diagnosis. In cases of pancreatitis, there may be elevated levels of lipase or amylase, an enzyme found in saliva and the pancreas.

Mumps orchitis is usually diagnosed by white blood cell count, with normal differential white blood cell counts. A complete blood count can show above or below-average white blood cell count and an elevated C-reactive protein level. Urine analysis can exclude bacterial infections. If orchitis is present with normal urine analysis, negative urethral cultures, and negative midstream urine, then that can indicate mumps orchitis. Ultrasounds typically show diffuse hyper-vascularity, increased volume of the testes and epididymis, lower than usual ability to return ultrasound signals, swelling of the epididymis, and formation of hydroceles. Echo color Doppler ultrasound is more effective at detecting orchitis than ultrasound alone.

==Prevention==
Mumps is preventable with vaccination. Mumps vaccines use live attenuated viruses. Most countries include mumps vaccination in their immunization programs, and the MMR vaccine, which also protects against measles and rubella, is the most commonly used mumps vaccine. Mumps vaccination can also be done on its own and as a part of the MMRV vaccine, which also protects against measles, rubella, chickenpox, and shingles. More than 120 countries have adopted mumps vaccination, but coverage remains low in most African, South Asian, and Southeast Asian countries. In countries that have implemented mumps vaccination, significant declines in mumps cases and complications caused by infection such as encephalitis have been observed. Mumps vaccines are typically administered in early childhood, but may also be given in adolescence and adulthood if need be. Vaccination is expected to be capable of neutralizing wild-type MuVs, which are not included in the vaccine, since they do not appear to evade vaccine-derived immunity.

A variety of virus strains have been used in mumps vaccines, including the Jeryl Lynn (JL), Leningrad-3, Leningrad-3-Zagreb (L-Zagreb), Rubini, and Urabe AM9 strains. Some other less prominent strains exist that are typically confined to individual countries. These include the Hoshino, Miyahara, Torii, and NK M-46 strains that have been produced in Japan and the S-12 strain, which is used by Iran. Mild adverse reactions are relatively common, including fever and rash, but aseptic meningitis also occurs at varying rates. Other rare adverse reactions include meningoencephalitis, parotitis, deafness from inner ear damage, orchitis, and pancreatitis. Safety and effectiveness vary by vaccine strain:
* Rubini is safe but because of its low effectiveness in outbreaks, its use has been abandoned.
* JL is relatively safe and has a relatively high effectiveness. However, the effectiveness is significantly lower in outbreaks. A modified version of JL vaccines is RIT 4385, which is also considered safe.
* Urabe and Leningrad-3 are both at least as effective as JL, but are less safe.
* L-Zagreb, a modified version of Leningrad-3, is considered safe and effective, including in outbreaks.

Mumps protection from the MMR vaccine is higher after two doses than one and is estimated to be between 79% and 95%, lower than the degree of protection against measles and rubella. This, however, has still been sufficient to nearly eliminate mumps in countries that vaccinate against it as well as significantly reduce frequencies of complications among the vaccinated. If at least one dose is received, then hospitalization rates are reduced by an estimated 50% among the infected. Compared to the MMR vaccine, the MMRV vaccine appears to be less effective in terms of providing mumps protection. A difficulty in assessing vaccine effectiveness is that there is no clear correlate of immunity, so it is not possible to predict if a person has acquired immunity from the vaccine.

There is a lack of data on the effectiveness of a third dose of the MMR vaccine. In an outbreak in which a third dose was administered, it was unclear if it had any effect on reducing disease incidence, and it only appeared to boost antibodies in those who previously had little or no antibodies to mumps. Contraindications for mumps vaccines include prior allergic reaction to any ingredients or to neomycin, pregnancy, immunosuppression, a moderate or severe illness, having received a blood product recently, and, for MMRV vaccines specifically, a personal or familial history of seizures. It is also advised that women not become pregnant in the four weeks after MMR vaccination. No effective prophylaxis exists for mumps after one has been exposed to the virus, so vaccination or receiving immunoglobulin after exposure does not prevent progression to illness.

For people who are infected or suspected to be infected, isolation is important in preventing the spread of the disease. This includes abstaining from school, childcare, work, and other settings in which people gather together. In healthcare settings, it is recommended that healthcare workers use precautions such as face masks to reduce the likelihood of infection and to abstain from work if they develop mumps. Additional measures taken in health care facilities include reducing wait times for mumps patients, having mumps patients wear masks, and cleaning and disinfecting areas that mumps patients use. The virus can be inactivated using formalin, ether, chloroform, heat, or ultraviolet light.

==Treatment==
Mumps is usually self-limiting, and no specific antiviral treatments exist for it, so treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. Non-medicinal ways to manage the disease include bed rest, using ice or heat packs on the neck and scrotum, consuming more fluids, eating soft food, and gargling with warm salt water. Anti-fever medications may be used during the febrile period, excluding aspirin when given to children, which may cause Reye syndrome. Analgesics may also be provided to control pain from mumps inflammatory conditions. For seizures, anticonvulsants may be used. In severe neurological cases, ventilators may be used to support breathing.

Intramuscular mumps immunoglobulin may be of benefit when administered early in some cases, but it has not shown benefit in outbreaks. Although not recommended, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may reduce the rates of some complications. Antibiotics may be used as a precaution in cases in which bacterial infection cannot be ruled out as well as to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Autoimmune-based disorders connected to mumps are treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin.

Various types of treatment for mumps orchitis have been used, but no specific treatment is recommended due to each method&#x27;s limitations. These measures are primarily based on relieving testicular pain and reducing intratesticular pressure to reduce the likelihood of testicular atrophy. Interferon-α2α interferes with viral replication, so it has been postulated to be useful in preventing testicular damage and infertility. Interferon alfa-2b may reduce the duration of symptoms and incidence of complications. In cases of hydrocele formation, excess fluid can be removed.

Acupuncture has been used fairly widely in China to treat children who have mumps, however, no high-quality trials have been conducted to determine the safety or effectiveness of this treatment approach.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for most people who experience mumps is excellent as long-term complications and death are rare. Hospitalization is typically not required. Mumps is usually self-limiting and symptoms resolve spontaneously within two weeks as the immune system clears the virus from the body. In high-risk groups such as immunocompromised persons, the prognosis is considered to be the same as for other groups. For most people, infection leads to lifelong immunity against future infection. Reinfections appear to be more mild and atypical than the first infection. The overall case-fatality rate of mumps is 1.6–3.8 people per 10,000, and these deaths typically occur in those who develop encephalitis.

Mumps orchitis typically resolves within two weeks. In 20% of cases, the testicles may be tender for a few more weeks. Atrophy, or reduction of size, of the involved testicle occurs in 30–50% of orchitis cases, which may lead to abnormalities in sperm creation and fertility such as low sperm count, absence of sperm in semen, reduced sperm motility, reduced fertility (hypofertility) in 13% of cases, and rarely sterility. Hypofertility can, however, occur in cases without atrophy. Abnormalities in sperm creation can persist for months to years after recovery from the initial infection, the length of which increases as the severity of orchitis increases. Examination of these cases shows decreased testicular volume, tenderness of the testicles, and a feeling of inconsistency when handling the testicles. Infertility is linked to severe cases of orchitis affecting both testes followed by testicular atrophy, which may develop up to one year after the initial infection. Of bilateral orchitis cases, 30–87% experience infertility. There is a weak association between orchitis and later development of epididymitis and testicular tumors.

Mumps meningitis typically resolves within 3–10 days without long-term complications. In meningoencephalitis cases, higher protein levels in CSF and a lower CSF glucose to blood glucose ratio are associated with longer periods of hospitalization. Approximately 1% of those whose CNS is affected die from mumps. Post-infectious encephalitis tends to be relatively mild, whereas post-infectious encephalomyelitis has a case-fatality rate of up to ten percent. Most cases of mumps deafness affect just one ear and are temporary, but permanent hearing loss occurs in 0.005% of infections. Myocarditis and pericarditis that occur as a result of mumps may lead to endocardial fibroelastosis, i.e. thickening of the endocardium. With extreme rarity, infertility and premature menopause have occurred as a result of mumps oophoritis.

==Epidemiology==

=== Clinical age and immunity ===
Mumps is found worldwide. In the absence of vaccination against mumps there are between 100 and 1,000 cases per 100,000 people each year, i.e. 0.1% to 1.0% of the population are infected each year. The number of cases peaks every 2–5 years, with incidence highest in children 5–9 years old. According to seroconversion surveys done before the start of mumps vaccination, a sharp increase in mumps antibody levels at age 2–3 was observed.

Furthermore, 50% of 4–6 year olds, 90% of 14–15 year olds, and 95% of adults had tested positive to prior exposure to mumps, indicating that nearly all people are eventually infected in unvaccinated populations.

Prior to the start of vaccination, mumps accounted for ten percent of meningitis cases and about a third of encephalitis cases. Worldwide, mumps is the most common cause of inflammation of the salivary glands. In children, mumps is the most common cause of deafness in one ear in cases when the inner ear is damaged. Asymptomatic infections are more common in adults, and the rate of asymptomatic infections is very high, up to two-thirds, in vaccinated populations. Mumps vaccination has the effect of increasing the average age of the infected in vaccinated populations that have not previously experienced a mumps outbreak. While infection rates appear to be the same in males and females, males appear to experience symptoms and complications, including neurological involvement, at a higher rate than females. Symptoms are more severe in adolescents and adults than in children.

=== Settings of outbreaks ===
It is common for outbreaks of mumps to occur. These outbreaks typically occur in crowded spaces where the virus can spread from person to person easily, such as schools, military barracks, prisons, and sports clubs. Since the introduction of vaccines, the frequency of mumps has declined dramatically, as have complications caused by mumps. The epidemiology in countries that vaccinate reflects the number of doses administered, age at vaccination, and vaccination rates. If vaccine coverage is insufficient, then herd immunity may be unobtainable and the average age of infection will increase, leading to an increase in the prevalence of complications. Risk factors include age, exposure to a person with mumps, compromised immunity, time of year, travel history, and vaccination status. Mumps vaccination is less common in developing countries, which consequently have higher rates of mumps.

Cases peak in different seasons of the year in different regions. In temperate climates, cases peak in winter and spring, whereas in tropical regions no seasonality is observed. Additional research has shown that mumps increases in frequency as temperature and humidity increase. The seasonality of mumps is thought to be caused by several factors: fluctuation in the human immune response due to seasonal factors, such as changes in melatonin levels; behavior and lifestyle changes, such as school attendance and indoor crowding; and meteorological factors such as changes in temperature, brightness, wind, and humidity.

<doc id="59172" wikidata="Q81018" url="?curid=59172" title="Judas Iscariot">
<text>Judas Iscariot (; ; died AD) was, according to Christianity&#x27;s four canonical gospels, one of the original Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. Judas betrayed Jesus to the Sanhedrin in the Garden of Gethsemane, in exchange for 30 pieces of silver, by kissing him on the cheek and addressing him as &quot;master&quot; to reveal his identity in the darkness to the crowd who had come to arrest him. In modern times, his name is often used synonymously with betrayal or treason.

The Gospel of Mark gives no motive for Judas&#x27;s betrayal but does present Jesus predicting it at the Last Supper, an event also described in all the other gospels. The Gospel of Matthew states that Judas committed the betrayal in exchange for thirty pieces of silver. The Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John suggest that he was possessed by Satan. According to , after learning that Jesus was to be crucified, Judas attempted to return the money he had been paid for his betrayal to the chief priests and hanged himself. The priests used the money to buy a field to bury strangers in, which was called the &quot;Field of Blood&quot; because it had been bought with blood money. The Book of Acts quotes Peter as saying that Judas used the money to buy the field himself and, he &quot;[fell] headlong... burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.&quot; His place among the Twelve Apostles was later filled by Matthias.

Due to his notorious role in all the gospel narratives, Judas remains a controversial figure in Christian history. His betrayal is seen as setting in motion the events that led to Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and resurrection, which, according to traditional Christian theology brought salvation to humanity. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas—rejected by the proto-orthodox Church as heretical—portrays Judas&#x27;s actions as done in obedience to instructions given to him by Jesus, and that he alone amongst the disciples knew Jesus&#x27;s true teachings. Since the Middle Ages, Judas has sometimes been portrayed as a personification of the Jewish people, and his betrayal has been used to justify Christian antisemitism.

==Historicity==
Although Judas Iscariot&#x27;s historical existence is generally widely accepted among secular historians, this relative consensus has not gone entirely unchallenged. The earliest possible allusion to Judas comes from the First Epistle to the Corinthians , in which Paul the Apostle does not mention Judas by name but uses the passive voice of the Greek word &quot;paradídōmi&quot; (παραδίδωμι), which most Bible translations render as &quot;was betrayed&quot;: &quot;...the Lord Jesus on the night when he &quot;was betrayed&quot; took a loaf of bread...&quot; Nonetheless, some biblical scholars argue that the word &quot;paradídōmi&quot; should be translated as &quot;was handed over&quot;. This translation could still refer to Judas, but it could also instead refer to God metaphorically &quot;handing Jesus over&quot; to the Romans.

In his book &quot;Antisemitism and Modernity&quot; (2006), the Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby suggests that, in the New Testament, the name &quot;Judas&quot; was constructed as an attack on the Judaeans or on the Judaean religious establishment held responsible for executing Jesus. In his book &quot;The Sins of Scripture&quot; (2009), John Shelby Spong concurs with this argument, insisting, &quot;The whole story of Judas has the feeling of being contrived ... The act of betrayal by a member of the twelve disciples is not found in the earliest Christian writings. Judas is first placed into the Christian story by the Gospel of Mark (), who wrote in the early 70s AD.&quot;

Most scholars reject these arguments for non-historicity, noting that there is nothing in the gospels to associate Judas with Judeans except his name, which was an extremely common one for Jewish men during the first century, and that numerous other figures named &quot;Judas&quot; are mentioned throughout the New Testament, none of whom are portrayed negatively. Positive figures named Judas mentioned in the New Testament include the prophet Judas Barsabbas (Acts 15:22–33), Jesus&#x27;s brother Jude (Mark 6:3; Matt 13:55; Jude 1), and the apostle Judas the son of James (Luke 6:14–16; Acts 1:13; John 14:22).

==Life==

===Name and background=== 
The name &quot;Judas&quot; () is a Greek rendering of the Hebrew name Judah (, , Hebrew for &quot;praise or praised&quot;), which was an extremely common name for Jewish men during the first century AD, due to the renowned hero Judas Maccabeus. Consequently, numerous other figures with this name are mentioned throughout the New Testament. In the Gospel of Mark , which was written in the mid-60s or early 70s AD, Judas Iscariot is the only apostle named &quot;Judas&quot;. shares this portrayal. The Gospel of Luke , however, replaces the apostle whom Mark and Matthew call &quot;Thaddeus&quot; with &quot;Judas son of James&quot;. Peter Stanford suggests that this renaming may represent an effort by the author of the Gospel of Luke to create a &quot;good Judas&quot; in contrast to the betrayer Judas Iscariot.

Judas&#x27;s epithet &quot;Iscariot&quot; ( or ), which distinguishes him from the other people named &quot;Judas&quot; in the gospels, is usually thought to be a Greek rendering of the Hebrew phrase , (), meaning &quot;the man from Kerioth&quot;. This interpretation is supported by the statement in the Gospel of John that Judas was &quot;the son of Simon Iscariot&quot;. Nonetheless, this interpretation of the name is not fully accepted by all scholars. One of the most popular alternative explanations holds that &quot;Iscariot&quot; (, in Syriac Aramaic, per the Peshitta text) may be a corruption of the Latin word , meaning &quot;dagger man&quot;, which referred to a member of the Sicarii ( in Aramaic), a group of Jewish rebels who were known for assassinating people in crowds using long knives hidden under their cloaks. This interpretation is problematic, however, because there is nothing in the gospels to associate Judas with the Sicarii, and there is no evidence that the cadre existed during the 30s AD when Judas was alive.

A possibility advanced by Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg is that &quot;Iscariot&quot; means &quot;the liar&quot; or &quot;the false one&quot;, from the Hebrew . C. C. Torrey suggests instead the Aramaic form or , with the same meaning. Stanford rejects this, arguing that the gospel writers follow Judas&#x27;s name with the statement that he betrayed Jesus, so it would be redundant for them to call him &quot;the false one&quot; before immediately stating that he was a traitor. Some have proposed that the word derives from an Aramaic word meaning &quot;red color&quot;, from the root . Another hypothesis holds that the word derives from one of the Aramaic roots or . This would mean &quot;to deliver&quot;, based on the Septuagint rendering of Isaiah 19:4—a theory advanced by J. Alfred Morin. The epithet could also be associated with the manner of Judas&#x27;s death, hanging. This would mean Iscariot derives from a kind of Greek-Aramaic hybrid: , , meaning &quot;chokiness&quot; or &quot;constriction&quot;. This might indicate that the epithet was applied posthumously by the remaining disciples, but Joan E. Taylor has argued that it was a descriptive name given to Judas by Jesus, since other disciples such as Simon Peter/Cephas (&quot;Kephas&quot; &quot;rock&quot;) were also given such names.

===Role as an apostle===
Although the canonical gospels frequently disagree on the names of some of the minor apostles, all four of them list Judas Iscariot as one of them. The Synoptic Gospels state that Jesus sent out &quot;the twelve&quot; (including Judas) with power over unclean spirits and with a ministry of preaching and healing: Judas clearly played an active part in this apostolic ministry alongside the other eleven. However, in the Gospel of John, Judas&#x27;s outlook was differentiated—many of Jesus&#x27;s disciples abandoned him because of the difficulty of accepting his teachings, and Jesus asked the twelve if they would also leave him. Simon Peter spoke for the twelve: &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,&quot; but Jesus observed then that although he himself had chosen the twelve, one of them (unnamed by Jesus, but identified by the narrator) was &quot;a devil&quot; who would betray him.

One of the best-attested and most reliable statements made by Jesus in the gospels comes from the Gospel of Matthew , in which Jesus tells his apostles: &quot;in the new world, when the Son of Man shall sit on his glorious throne, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel.&quot; New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman concludes, &quot;This is not a tradition that was likely to have been made up by a Christian later, after Jesus&#x27;s death—since one of these twelve had abandoned his cause and betrayed him. No one thought that &quot;Judas Iscariot&quot; would be seated on a glorious throne in the Kingdom of God. That saying, therefore appears to go back to Jesus, and indicates, then, that he had twelve close disciples, whom he predicted would reign in the coming Kingdom.&quot;
Matthew directly states that Judas betrayed Jesus for a bribe of &quot;thirty pieces of silver&quot; by identifying him with a kiss—&quot;the kiss of Judas&quot;—to arresting soldiers of the High Priest Caiaphas, who then turned Jesus over to Pontius Pilate&#x27;s soldiers. Mark&#x27;s Gospel states that the chief priests were looking for a way to arrest Jesus. They decided not to do so during the feast [of the Passover], since they were afraid that people would riot; instead, they chose the night before the feast to arrest him. According to Luke&#x27;s account, Satan entered Judas at this time.

According to the account in the Gospel of John, Judas carried the disciples&#x27; money bag or box (, ), but the Gospel of John makes no mention of the thirty pieces of silver as a fee for betrayal. The evangelist comments in John 12:5–6 that Judas spoke fine words about giving money to the poor, but the reality was &quot;not that he cared for the poor, but [that] he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.&quot; However, in John 13:27–30, when Judas left the gathering of Jesus and his disciples with betrayal in mind, some [of the disciples] thought that Judas might have been leaving to buy supplies or on a charitable errand.

Ehrman argues that Judas&#x27;s betrayal &quot;is about as historically certain as anything else in the tradition&quot;, pointing out that the betrayal is independently attested in the Gospel of Mark, in the Gospel of John, and in the Book of Acts. Ehrman also contends that it is highly unlikely that early Christians would have made up the story of Judas&#x27;s betrayal, since it reflects poorly on Jesus&#x27;s judgment in choosing him as an apostle. Nonetheless, Ehrman argues that what Judas actually told the authorities was not Jesus&#x27;s location, but rather Jesus&#x27;s secret teaching that he was the Messiah. This, he holds, explains why the authorities did not try to arrest Jesus prior to Judas&#x27;s betrayal. John P. Meier sums up the historical consensus, stating, &quot;We only know two basic facts about [Judas]: (1) Jesus chose him as one of the Twelve, and (2) he handed over Jesus to the Jerusalem authorities, thus precipitating Jesus&#x27;s execution.&quot;

===Death===
Many different accounts of Judas&#x27;s death have survived from antiquity, both within and outside the New Testament. states that after learning that Jesus was to be crucified, Judas was overcome by remorse and attempted to return the 30 pieces of silver to the priests, but they would not accept them because they were blood money, so he threw them on the ground and left. Afterwards, he committed suicide by hanging himself in accordance with Mosaic law (). The priests then used the money to buy a potter&#x27;s field, which became known as Akeldama (חקל דמא – &quot;khakel dama&quot;) – the Field of Blood – because it had been bought with blood money. states that Judas used the money to buy a field, and &quot;[fell] headlong... burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.&quot; In this account, Judas&#x27;s death is apparently by accident, and he shows no signs of remorse.

The early Church Father Papias of Hierapolis records in his &quot;Expositions of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; (which was probably written around 100 AD) that Judas was afflicted by God&#x27;s wrath; his body became so enormously bloated that he could not pass through a street with buildings on either side. His face became so swollen that a doctor could not even identify the location of his eyes using an optical instrument. Judas&#x27;s genitals became enormously swollen and oozed with pus and worms. Finally, he killed himself on his own land by pouring out his innards onto the ground, which stank so horribly that, even in Papias&#x27;s own time a century later, people still could not pass the site without holding their noses. This story was well known among Christians in antiquity and was often told in competition with the two conflicting stories from the New Testament.

According to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, which was probably written in the fourth century AD, Judas was overcome with remorse and went home to tell his wife, who was roasting a chicken on a spit over a charcoal fire, that he was going to kill himself, because he knew Jesus would rise from the dead and, when he did, he would punish him. Judas&#x27;s wife laughed and told him that Jesus could no more rise from the dead than he could resurrect the chicken she was cooking. Immediately, the chicken was restored to life and began to crow. Judas then ran away and hanged himself. In the apocryphal Gospel of Judas, Judas has a vision of the disciples stoning and persecuting him.

The discrepancy between the two different accounts of Judas&#x27;s death in and has proven to be a serious challenge to those who support the idea of Biblical inerrancy. This problem was one of the points leading C. S. Lewis, for example, to reject the view &quot;that every statement in Scripture must be historical truth&quot;. Nonetheless, various attempts at harmonization have been suggested. Generally they have followed literal interpretations such as that of Augustine of Hippo, which suggest that these simply describe different aspects of the same event—that Judas hanged himself in the field, and the rope eventually snapped and the fall burst his body open, or that the accounts of Acts and Matthew refer to two different transactions. Some have taken the descriptions as figurative: that the &quot;falling prostrate&quot; was Judas in anguish, and the &quot;bursting out of the bowels&quot; is pouring out emotion.

Modern scholars reject these approaches. Arie W. Zwiep states &quot;neither story was meant to be read in light of the other&quot; and &quot;the integrity of both stories as complete narratives in themselves is seriously disrespected when the two separate stories are being conflated into a third, harmonized version.&quot; David A. Reed argues that the Matthew account is a midrashic exposition that allows the author to present the event as a fulfillment of prophetic passages from the Old Testament. They argue that the author adds imaginative details such as the thirty pieces of silver, and the fact that Judas hangs himself, to an earlier tradition about Judas&#x27;s death.

Matthew&#x27;s description of the death as fulfilment of a prophecy &quot;spoken through Jeremiah the prophet&quot; has caused difficulties, since it does not clearly correspond to any known version of the Book of Jeremiah but does appear to refer to a story from the Book of Zechariah which describes the return of a payment of thirty pieces of silver. Even writers such as Jerome and John Calvin conclude that this was obviously an error. Evangelical theologian James R. White has suggested the misattribution arises from a supposed Jewish practice of using the name of a major prophet to refer to the whole content of the scroll group, including books written by minor prophets placed in the same grouping.

Some scholars have suggested that the writer may also have had a passage from Jeremiah in mind, such as chapters and which refer to a potter&#x27;s jar and a burial place, and chapter which refers to a burial place and an earthenware jar. Raymond Brown suggests &quot;the most plausible [explanation] is that Matthew 27:9–10 is presenting a mixed citation with words taken both from Zechariah and Jeremiah, and ... he refers to that combination by one name. Jeremiah 18–9 concerns a potter (18:2–; 19:1), a purchase (19:1), the Valley of Hinnom (where the Field of Blood is traditionally located, 19:2), &#x27;innocent blood&#x27; (19:4), and the renaming of a place for burial (19:6, 11); and Jer 32:6–5 tells of the purchase of a field with silver.&quot;

Classicist Glenn W. Most suggests that Judas&#x27;s death in Acts can be interpreted figuratively, writing that πρηνὴς γενόμενος should be translated as saying his body went prone, rather than falling headlong, and the spilling of the entrails is meant to invoke the imagery of dead snakes and their burst-open bellies. Hence Luke was stating that Judas took the body posture of a snake and died like one. However, the Catholic biblical scholar John L. McKenzie states &quot;This passage probably echoes the fate of the wicked in...&quot; the Deuterocanonical book &quot;Wisdom of Solomon&quot; 4:19: &quot;... [the Lord] will dash them speechless to the ground, and shake them from the foundations; they will be left utterly dry and barren, and they will suffer anguish, and the memory of them will perish.&quot;

==Betrayal of Jesus==

There are several explanations as to why Judas betrayed Jesus. In the earliest account, in the Gospel of Mark, when he goes to the chief priests to betray Jesus, he is offered money as a reward, but it is not clear that money is his motivation. In the Gospel of Matthew account, on the other hand, he asks what they will pay him for handing Jesus over. In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, the devil enters into Judas, causing him to offer to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John account has Judas complaining that money has been spent on expensive perfumes to anoint Jesus which could have been spent on the poor, but adds that he was the keeper of the apostles&#x27; purse and used to steal from it. According to some, Judas thought he could get the money for betraying Jesus without Jesus being killed as he would escape like he had done many times before.

One suggestion has been that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus not so much because he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.

The gospels suggest that Jesus foresaw (, ) and allowed Judas&#x27;s betrayal (). One explanation is that Jesus allowed the betrayal because it would allow God&#x27;s plan to be fulfilled. Another is that regardless of the betrayal, Jesus was ultimately destined for crucifixion. In April 2006, a Coptic papyrus manuscript titled the Gospel of Judas from 200 AD was translated, suggesting that Jesus told Judas to betray him, although some scholars question the translation. Some scholars believe that it contains no historical information.

Judas is the subject of philosophical writings. Origen of Alexandria, in his &quot;Commentary on John&#x27;s Gospel&quot;, reflects on Judas&#x27;s interactions with the other apostles and Jesus&#x27;s confidence in him prior to his betrayal. Other philosophical reflections on Judas include &quot;The Problem of Natural Evil&quot; by Bertrand Russell and &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot;, a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. They allege various problematic ideological contradictions with the discrepancy between Judas&#x27;s actions and his eternal punishment. Bruce Reichenbach argues that if Jesus foresees Judas&#x27;s betrayal, then the betrayal is not an act of free will and therefore should not be punishable. Conversely, it is argued that just because the betrayal was foretold, it does not prevent Judas from exercising his own free will in this matter. Other scholars argue that Judas acted in obedience to God&#x27;s will. The gospels suggest that Judas is apparently bound up with the fulfillment of God&#x27;s purposes (, , , , , , ), yet &quot;woe is upon him&quot;, and he would &quot;have been better unborn&quot; (). The difficulty inherent in the saying is its paradox: if Judas had not been born, the Son of Man would apparently no longer do &quot;as it is written of him.&quot; The consequence of this apologetic approach is that Judas&#x27;s actions come to be seen as necessary and unavoidable, yet leading to condemnation. Another explanation is that Judas&#x27;s birth and betrayal did not necessitate the only way the Son of Man could have suffered and been crucified. The earliest churches believed &quot;as it is written of him&quot; to be prophetic, fulfilling Scriptures such as that of the suffering servant in Isaiah 52–53 and the righteous one in Psalm 22, which do not require betrayal (at least by &quot;Judas&quot;) as the means to the suffering. Regardless of any necessity, Judas is held responsible for his act (Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22; Matt 26:24).

In his 1965 book &quot;The Passover Plot&quot;, British New Testament scholar Hugh J. Schonfield suggests that the crucifixion of Christ was a conscious re-enactment of Biblical prophecy and that Judas acted with the full knowledge and consent of Jesus in &quot;betraying&quot; him to the authorities. The book has been variously described as &quot;factually groundless&quot;, based on &quot;little data&quot; and &quot;wild suppositions&quot;, &quot;disturbing&quot;, and &quot;tawdry&quot;.

==Judas&#x27; eternal destination==
The nature of Judas&#x27; eternal destination has been a matter of debate within Christian theology. Some have argued that Judas was damned due to the despair which caused him to subsequently commit suicide. An example of this view is from Cornelius à Lapide, &quot;Judas then added to his former sin the further sin of despair. It was not a more heinous sin, but one more fatal to himself, as thrusting him down to the very depths of hell. He might, on his repentance, have asked (and surely have obtained) pardon of Christ. But, like Cain, he despaired of forgiveness.&quot; The Theophylact presents a different view, stating that Judas &quot;hanged himself thinking to precede Jesus into hades and there to plead for his own salvation.&quot;

===Protestant theologians===
The Catholic theologian Erasmus believed that Judas was free to change his intention, but Martin Luther argued in rebuttal that Judas&#x27; will was immutable. John Calvin states that Judas was predestined to damnation but writes on the question of Judas&#x27; guilt: &quot;surely in Judas&#x27;s betrayal, it will be no more right, because God himself willed that his son be delivered up and delivered him up to death, to ascribe the guilt of the crime to God than to transfer the credit for redemption to Judas.&quot; Karl Daub, in his book &quot;Judas Ischariot&quot;, writes that Judas should be considered &quot;an incarnation of the devil&quot; for whom &quot;mercy and blessedness are alike impossible.&quot;

The Geneva Bible contains several additional notes concerning Judas Iscariot within its commentaries. In the Gospel of Matthew, after the Sanhedrin condemns Jesus Christ to death, are added the comments concerning Judas: &quot;...late repentance brings desperation&quot; (cf. Mat. 27:3), and &quot;Although he abhor his sins, yet is he not displeased there with, but despairs in God&#x27;s mercies, and seeks his own destruction&quot; (cf. Mat. 27:4). Furthermore, within Acts of the Apostles is the comment, &quot;Perpetual infamy is the reward of all such as by unlawfully gotten goods buy anything&quot; when Judas purchased the &quot;Field of Blood&quot; with the 30 pieces of silver (cf Acts 1:18). 

===Catholic doctrine===
The Catholic Church took no specific view concerning the damnation of Judas during Vatican II; speaking in generalities, that Council stated, &quot;[We] must be constantly vigilant so that ... we may not be ordered to go into the eternal fire (cf. Mk. 25, 41) like wicked and slothful servants (cf. Mk. 25, 26), into the exterior darkness where &#x27;there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&#x27; (Mt. 22, 13 and 25, 30).&quot; The Vatican only proclaims individuals&#x27; Eternal Salvation through the Canon of Saints. There is no &#x27;Canon of the Damned.&#x27;

Thus, there is a school of thought within the Catholic Church that it is unknown whether Judas Iscariot is in Hell; for example, David Endres, writing in The Catholic Telegraph, cites &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; §597 for the inability to make any determination whether Judas is in Hell. However, while that section of the catechism does instruct Catholics that the personal sin of Judas is unknown but to God, that statement is within the context that the Jewish people have no collective responsibility for Jesus&#x27;s death: &quot;... the Jews should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed as if this followed from holy Scripture.&quot; This seems to be defining a different doctrinal point (i.e., the relationship of Catholics with Jewish people), rather than making any sort of decision concerning Judas&#x27;s particular judgment.

Ludwig Ott&#x27;s reference book &quot;Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma&quot; identifies Judas Iscariot as an example of a person receiving punishment as a particular judgment.

The Catechism of the Council of Trent, which mentions Judas Iscariot several times, wrote that he possessed &quot;motive unworthy&quot; when he entered the priesthood and was thus sentenced to &quot;eternal perdition&quot;. Furthermore, Judas is given as an example of a sinner that will &quot;despair of mercy&quot; because he looked &quot;...on God as an avenger of crime and not, also, as a God of clemency and mercy.&quot; All of the council&#x27;s decrees were confirmed by Pope Pius IV on 28 January 1564. Thus, an ecumenical council, confirmed by the Magisterium of a Pope, affirmed that Judas Iscariot was condemned to Hell. The Council of Trent continued the tradition of the early Church fathers, such as Pope Leo I (&quot;...had [Judas] not thus denied His omnipotence, he would have obtained His mercy...&quot;), and Pope Gregory I (&quot;The godless betrayer, shutting his mind to all these things, turned upon himself, not with a mind to repent, but in a madness of self destruction: ... even in the act of dying sinned &quot;unto the increase&quot; of his own eternal punishment.&quot;)

Also, the &quot;Decree of Justification&quot;, promulgated during Session VI of the Council of Trent, states in Cannon 6, &quot;If anyone shall say that it is not in the power of man to make his ways evil, but that God produces evil as well as the good works, not only by permission, but also properly and of Himself, so that the betrayal of Judas is not less His own proper work than the vocation of Paul; let him be anathema.&quot; Here, the Council is making it clear that Judas exercised his own free will to commit the betrayal of Jesus Christ, rather than being predestined by God. Also, by contrasting the actions of Judas to those of Paul, the implication is that Judas is the opposite of a saint (i.e., damned).

Liturgical institutions are part of the expressions of Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church. Within the 1962 &quot;Roman Missal&quot; for the Tridentine Latin Mass, the &quot;Collect&quot; for Holy Thursday states: &quot;O God, from whom Judas received the punishment of his guilt, and the thief the reward of his confession ... our Lord Jesus Christ gave to each a different recompense according to his merits...&quot; In his commentary on the Liturgical Year, Abbot Gueranger, O.S.B. states that the &quot;Collect&quot; reminds Catholics that both Judas and the good thief are guilty, &quot;...and yet, the one is condemned, the other pardoned.&quot; Thus, the Tridentine Latin Mass, as currently celebrated, continues to foster the tradition within the Catholic Church that Judas was punished.

===Other===
In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante Alighieri, Judas is punished for all eternity in the ninth circle of Hell: in it, he is devoured by Lucifer, alongside Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus (leaders of the group of senators that assassinated Julius Caesar). The innermost region of the ninth circle is reserved for traitors of masters and benefactors and is named Judecca, after Judas.

In his 1969 book &quot;Theologie der Drei Tage&quot; (English translation: &quot;Mysterium Paschale&quot;), Hans Urs von Balthasar emphasizes that Jesus was not betrayed but surrendered and delivered up by himself, since the meaning of the Greek word used by the New Testament, &quot;paradidonai&quot; (παραδιδόναι, ), is unequivocally &quot;handing over of self&quot;. In the &quot;Preface to the Second Edition&quot;, Balthasar takes a cue from Revelation (Vulgate: &quot;agni qui occisus est ab origine mundi&quot;, NIV: &quot;the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world&quot;) to extrapolate the idea that God as &quot;immanent Trinity&quot; can endure and conquer godlessness, abandonment, and death in an &quot;eternal super-kenosis&quot;. A Catholic priest, Richard Neuhaus, an admitted student of Balthasar, argues that it is unknown if Judas is in Hell, and it is also possible that Hell could be empty. However, French monsignor Léon Cristiani considers that Balthasar and Neuhaus are merely recycling the error of Origenism which includes denying the eternity of Hell &quot;...by a general rehabilitation of the damned, including, apparently, Satan.&quot; This error, while not considered a formal heresy, was condemned at a synod in 548 AD, which was subsequently confirmed by Pope Vigilius.

==Role in apocrypha==
Judas has been a figure of great interest to esoteric groups, such as many Gnostic sects. Irenaeus records the beliefs of one Gnostic sect, the Cainites, who believed that Judas was an instrument of the Sophia, Divine Wisdom, thus earning the hatred of the Demiurge. His betrayal of Jesus thus was a victory over the materialist world. The Cainites later split into two groups, disagreeing over the ultimate significance of Jesus in their cosmology.

===Syriac Infancy Gospel===
The Syriac Infancy Gospel borrows from some of the different versions of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. However, it adds many of its own tales, probably from local legends, including one of Judas. This pseudepigraphic work tells how Judas, as a boy, was possessed by Satan, who caused him to bite himself or anyone else present. In one of these attacks, Judas bit the young Jesus in the side; and, by touching Him, Satan was exorcised. It further states that the side which Judas supposedly bit was the same side that was pierced by the Holy Lance at the Crucifixion.

===Gospel of Judas===

During the 1970s, a Coptic papyrus codex (book) was discovered near Beni Masah, Egypt. It appeared to be a 3rd- or 4th-century-AD copy of a 2nd-century original, relating a series of conversations in which Jesus and Judas interact and discuss the nature of the universe from a Gnostic viewpoint. The discovery was given dramatic international exposure in April 2006 when the US &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine published a feature article entitled &quot;The Gospel of Judas&quot; with images of the fragile codex and analytical commentary by relevant experts and interested observers (but not a comprehensive translation). The article&#x27;s introduction stated: &quot;An ancient text lost for 1,700 years says Christ&#x27;s betrayer was his truest disciple.&quot; The article points to some evidence that the original document was extant in the 2nd century: &quot;Around A.D. 180, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in what was then Roman Gaul, wrote a massive treatise called &quot;Against Heresies&quot; [in which he attacked] a &#x27;fictitious history,&#x27; which &#x27;they style the Gospel of Judas.

Before the magazine&#x27;s edition was circulated, other news media gave exposure to the story, abridging and selectively reporting it.

In December 2007, April DeConick asserted that the &quot;National Geographic&quot;″s translation is badly flawed: &quot;For example, in one instance the &quot;National Geographic&quot; transcription refers to Judas as a &#x27;daimon,&#x27; which the society&#x27;s experts have translated as &#x27;spirit.&#x27; However, the universally accepted word for &#x27;spirit&#x27; is &#x27;pneuma&#x27;—in Gnostic literature &quot;daimon&quot; is always taken to mean &#x27;demon. The National Geographic Society responded that &quot;Virtually all issues April D. DeConick raises about translation choices are addressed in footnotes in both the popular and critical editions.&quot; In a later review of the issues and relevant publications, critic Joan Acocella questioned whether ulterior intentions had not begun to supersede historical analysis, e.g., whether publication of The Gospel of Judas could be an attempt to roll back ancient anti-semitic imputations. She concluded that the ongoing clash between scriptural fundamentalism and attempts at revision were childish because of the unreliability of the sources. Therefore, she argued, &quot;People interpret, and cheat. The answer is not to fix the Bible but to fix ourselves.&quot; Other scholars have questioned the initial translation and interpretation of the Gospel of Judas by the &quot;National Geographic&quot; team of experts.

===Gospel of Barnabas===
According to medieval copies (the earliest copies from the 15th century) of the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas&#x27;s appearance was transformed to that of Jesus, when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then was ascended to the heavens. This transformation of appearance was so identical that the masses, followers of Christ, and even the Mother of Jesus, Mary, initially thought that the one arrested and crucified was Jesus himself. The gospel then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas&#x27;s body was stolen from his grave, and then the rumors spread of Jesus being risen from the dead. When Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened, he prayed to God to be sent back to the earth, and descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers, and told them the truth of what happened. He then ascended back to the heavens, and will come back at the end of times as a just king.

This gospel is considered by the majority of Christians to be late and pseudepigraphical; however, some academics suggest that it may contain some remnants of an earlier apocryphal work (perhaps Gnostic, Ebionite, or Diatessaronic), redacted to bring it more in line with Islamic doctrine. Some Muslims consider the surviving versions as transmitting a suppressed apostolic original. Some Islamic organizations cite it in support of the Islamic view of Jesus.

==Representations and symbolism==
Although the sanctification of the instruments of the Passion of Jesus (the so-called &quot;Arma Christi&quot;), that slowly accrued over the course of the Middle Ages in Christian symbolism and art, also included the head and lips of Judas, the term &quot;Judas&quot; has entered many languages as a synonym for &quot;betrayer&quot;, and Judas has become the archetype of the traitor in Western art and literature. Judas is given some role in virtually all literature telling the Passion story and appears in numerous modern novels and movies.

In the Eastern Orthodox hymns of Holy Wednesday (the Wednesday before Pascha), Judas is contrasted with the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume and washed his feet with her tears. The hymns of Holy Wednesday contrast these two figures, encouraging believers to avoid the example of the fallen disciple and instead to imitate Mary&#x27;s example of repentance. Also, Wednesday is observed as a day of fasting from meat, dairy products, and olive oil throughout the year in memory of the betrayal of Judas. The prayers of preparation for receiving the Eucharist also make mention of Judas&#x27;s betrayal: &quot;I will not reveal your mysteries to your enemies, neither like Judas will I betray you with a kiss, but like the thief on the cross I will confess you.&quot;

Judas Iscariot is often shown with red hair in Spanish culture and by William Shakespeare. The practice is comparable to the Renaissance portrayal of Jews with red hair, which was then regarded as a negative trait and which may have been used to correlate Judas Iscariot with contemporary Jews.

In paintings depicting the Last Supper, Judas is occasionally depicted with a dark-colored halo (contrasting with the lighter halos of the other apostles) to signify his former status as an apostle. More commonly, however, he is the only one at the table without one. Some church stained-glass windows show him with a dark halo such as in one of the windows of the Church of St John the Baptist, Yeovil.

==Art and literature==

* &quot;Tres versiones de Judas&quot; (English title: &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot;) is a short story by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges; it was included in Borges&#x27;s anthology &quot;Ficciones&quot;, published in 1944, and revolves around the main character&#x27;s doubts about the canonical story of Judas who instead creates three alternative versions.
* In &quot;The Last Days of Judas Iscariot&quot; (2005), a critically acclaimed play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, Judas is given a trial in Purgatory.
* &quot;The Book of Longings&quot; by Sue Monk Kidd features Judas as the adopted brother of the fictional protagonist, Ana. Judas is reimagined as a Zealot extremist who only betrays Jesus in the belief that he will resist the authorities and trigger a Judean revolution against Rome.

<text>The id, ego, and superego are the three different, functionally interlocking main components of the human soul, as investigated and defined by Sigmund Freud. They represent the structural [[model]] of psychoanalysis. Freud himself used the German terms &quot;das Es&quot;, &quot;Ich&quot;, and &quot;Über-Ich&quot;. The Latin terms id, ego and superego were chosen by his original translators and have remained in use. The terms soul and psyche here are synonymous in the sense of the human organism as a whole, focussing on the mental aspect without any option of concrete separability from matter and therefore in strict distinction to the religious concept of &quot;soul&quot;.

The structural model of the soul was introduced in Freuds essay &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&quot; (1920). It describes the innate needs of the id located in the unconscious as a primary process, which the conscious mind - the secondary process - evaluates with participation of its socialisation and strives to satisfy via appropriate objects of external reality. This model - further refined and formalised in subsequent essays as The Ego and the Id - represents a response to the ambiguous/contradictory use of the terms conscious and unconscious in the topological model, the first one.

According to Freud as well as ego psychology the id is a set of uncoordinated instinctual needs; the superego plays the judgemental role via internalized experiences; and the ego is the perceiving, logically organizing agent that mediates between the id&#x27;s innate desires, the demands of external reality and those of the critical superego; Freud compared the ego - in its relation to the id - to a man on horseback: the rider must restrain and direct the superior energy of his animal and at times allow for a satisfaction of its urges if he wants to keep it alive and the species healthy. The ego is thus &quot;in the habit of transforming the id&#x27;s will into action, as if it were its own.&quot;

==Psychic apparatus ==
In order to overcome difficulties of understanding as far as possible, Freud formulated his &quot;metapsychology&quot; which for Lacan represents a &quot;technical elaboration&quot; of the concepts of the soul model: dividing the organism into three instances the id is regarded as the germ from which the ego and the superego develop. Driven by an energy that Freud calls &quot;libido&quot; in direct reference to Plato&#x27;s Eros, the instances complement each other through their specific functions in a similar way to the organelles of a cell or parts of a technical apparatus. 
Further distinctions (as the coordinates of &quot;topology&quot;, &quot;dynamics&quot; and &quot;economy&quot;) encouraged Freud to assume that the metapsychological elaboration of the structural model would make it fully compatible with biological sciences such as evolutionary theory and enable a well-founded concept of mental health including a theory of human development, which naturally completed in three successive stages: the oral, anal and genital phase. However, as important as this is for the diagnostic process (illness can only be realised as a deviation from the optimal cooperation of all psycho-organic functions), Freud had to be modest and leave structural model in the unfinished state of a &quot;torso&quot; because - as he stated one last time in Moses and Monotheism - there was no well-founded primate research at the time. Without knowledge of the instinctive social behaviour with the corresponding structure of cohabitation of our genetically closest relatives in realm of primates, Freud&#x27;s thesis of Darwin&#x27;s primordial horde (as presented for discussion in Totem and Taboo) can&#x27;t be tested and, if possible, replaced by a realistic model. Horde life and its violent abolition through introduction of mononogamy (as an agreement between the sons who murdered the horde&#x27;s polygamous father) embody the evolutionary as well as cultural-prehistorical core of psychoanalysis. It stands in contrast to the religiously enigmatic reports about the origin of monogamous couples on earth as an expression of divine will, but closer to the ancient trap to pacify political conflicts among the groups of Neolithic mankind. (See Prometheus&#x27; uprising against Zeus, who created Pandora as a fatal wedding gift for Epimetheus to divide and rule the titanic brothers; Plato&#x27;s myth of spherical men cut into isolated individuals for the same reason; and the similarly resolved revolt of inferior gods in the Flood epic Atra-Hasis). Additional important assumptions are based on it, such as the Oedipus complex, the origin of moral-totemic rules like Incest taboo and, not least, Freud&#x27;s &quot;Unease in Culture&quot;. Nonetheless, due to the lack of ethological primate research, these ideas remained an unproven belief of palaeo-anthropological science – only a hypothesis or &quot;&quot;just so story&quot; as a not unpleasant English critic wittily called it. But I mean it honours a hypothesis if it shows capable of creating context and understanding in new areas.&quot;

=== Id ===
Freud conceived the id as the unconscious source of all innate needs, emotional impulses and desires, including the sexual drive. The id acts driven by aggression (energy), it&#x27;s &quot;the dark, inaccessible part of our personality&quot;. It seems limited to analysis of dreams and neurotic symptoms, and can only be described in terms of its contrast with the ego. It has no organisation and no collective will: It only demands immediate gratification of its instincts according to the pleasure principle. It is oblivious to reason and the presumptions of ordinary conscious life: &quot;contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other. . . There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation. . . nothing which corresponds to the idea of time.&quot; The id &quot;knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual cathexes seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id.&quot; 

Developmentally, the id precedes the ego. The id consists of the basic instinctual drives that are present at birth, inherent in the somatic organization, and governed only by the pleasure principle. The psychic apparatus begins as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured &quot;ego&quot;, a concept of self that takes the principle of reality into account.

Freud understands the id as &quot;the great reservoir of libido&quot;, the energy of desire as expressed, for example, in the behaviours of sexuality, the incorporation of food or the baby-care (maternal love). In general, the nature of libido is that of Platonic Eros, a universal desire that is inherent in all life instincts. They constantly strive to compensate for the processes of biological decay, rejuvenating the species of living beings by means of their metabolism and reproduction. 

Complementing this constructive aspect of the libido, the author later postulated an inherent death drive, the Thanatos that has a decomposing effect and seeks &quot;to lead organic life back into the inanimate state. For Freud, &quot;the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an &quot;instinct of destruction&quot; directed against the external world and other organisms&quot; through aggression. Since libido energy encompasses all instinctive impulses, Eros and Thanatos are regarded as fundamental forces of the id, which co-operate despite their apparent incompatibility: The organism has the urge to &#x27;synthetically&#x27; regenerate by integration of suitable molecules or energy into itself, for this purpose it must first deconstruct the ingested food complexes: the ‘analytical’ effect of stomach acid.

=== Ego ===
The ego acts according to the reality principle. It analyses complex perceptions (things, ideas, dreams), synthesises the appropriate parts into logically coherent interpretations (also models) and rules the muscular apparatus. Since the id&#x27;s drives are frequently incompatible with the moral prescriptions and religious illusions of contemporary cultures, the ego attempts to direct the libidinal energy and satisfy its demands in accordance with the imperatives of that reality. According to Freud the ego, in its role as mediator between the id and reality, is often &quot;obliged to cloak the (unconscious) commands of the id with its own preconscious rationalizations, to conceal the id&#x27;s conflicts with reality, to profess...to be taking notice of reality even when the id has remained rigid and unyielding.&quot;

Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean the sense of self, but later expanded it to include psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory. The ego is the organizing principle upon which thoughts and interpretations of the world are based.

According to Freud, &quot;the ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions... it is like a tug of war... with the difference that in the tug of war the teams fight against one another in equality, while the ego is against the much stronger &#x27;id&#x27;.&quot; In fact, the ego is required to serve &quot;three severe masters...the external world, the superego and the id.&quot; It seeks to find a balance between the natural drives of the id, the limitations imposed by reality, and the strictures of the superego. It is concerned with self-preservation: it strives to keep the id&#x27;s instinctive needs within limits, adapted to reality and submissive to the superego.

Thus &quot;driven by the id, confined by the superego, repulsed by reality&quot; the ego struggles to bring about harmony among the competing forces. Consequently, it can easily be subject to &quot;realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the superego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id.&quot; The ego may wish to serve the id, trying to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts, while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the superego is constantly watching every one of the ego&#x27;s moves and punishes it with feelings of guilt, anxiety, and inferiority.

To overcome this the ego employs defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms reduce the tension and anxiety by disguising or transforming the impulses that are perceived as threatening. Denial, displacement, intellectualization, fantasy, compensation, projection, rationalization, reaction formation, regression, repression, and sublimation were the defense mechanisms Freud identified. His daughter Anna Freud identified the concepts of undoing, suppression, dissociation, idealization, identification, introjection, inversion, somatization, splitting, and substitution.

In a diagram of the Structural and Topographical Models of Mind, the ego is depicted as being half in the conscious, a quarter in the preconscious, and the other quarter in the unconscious.

=== Superego ===
The superego reflects the internalization of cultural rules, mainly as absorbed from parents, but also other authority figures, and the general cultural ethos. Freud developed his concept of the superego from an earlier combination of the ego ideal and the &quot;special psychical agency which performs the task of seeing that narcissistic satisfaction from the ego ideal is ensured...what we call our &#x27;conscience&#x27;.&quot; For him the superego can be described as &quot;a successful instance of identification with the parental agency&quot;, and as development proceeds it also absorbs the influence of those who have &quot;stepped into the place of parents — educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models&quot;.
The superego aims for perfection. It is the part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual&#x27;s ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency, commonly called &quot;conscience&quot;, that criticizes and prohibits the expression of drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. Thus the superego works in contradiction to the id. It is an internalized mechanism that operates to confine the ego to socially acceptable behaviour, whereas the id merely seeks instant self-gratification.

The superego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the Oedipus complex. In the case of the little boy, it forms during the dissolution of the Oedipus complex, through a process of identification with the father figure, following the failure to retain possession of the mother as a love-object out of fear of castration. Freud described the superego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:
In &quot;The Ego and the Id&quot;, Freud presents &quot;the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal — its dictatorial &quot;Thou shalt&quot;&quot;. The earlier in the child&#x27;s development, the greater the estimate of parental power. 
Thus when the child is in rivalry with the parental imago it feels the dictatorial &quot;Thou shalt&quot;—the manifest power that the imago represents—on four levels: (i) the auto-erotic, (ii) the narcissistic, (iii) the anal, and (iv) the phallic. Those different levels of mental development, and their relations to parental imagos, correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection.

The concept of the Oedipus complex internalised in the superego - anchored by Freud in the hypothetical murder of the forefather of the Darwinian horde by his sons - has been criticised for its supposed sexism. Women, who cannot develop a fear of castration due to their different genital make-up, do not identify with the father. Therefore, ‘their superego is never as implacable, as impersonal, as independent of its emotional origins as we demand of men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility.’ - not by fear of castration, as was the case with ‘Little Hans’ in his conflict with his father over his wife and mother. However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect &quot;that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics.&quot;

== Structural model and neuropsychoanalysis ==

Freud&#x27;s basic metapsychological thesis is that the living &quot;soul&quot; with their needs, consciousness and memory resembles a psychological apparatus to which &quot;spatial extension and composition of several pieces&quot; can be attributed (...) and wich &quot;locus ... is the brain (nervous system)&quot;. 

Modern technology has made possible to observe the bioelectrical activity of neurones in the living brain. This led to the realisation in which area of the brain the needs for food, skin desire etc. begin to show themselves neuronally; where the highest performances of consciously thinking ego take place (s. frontal lobe); and that other parts of the brain are specialised in storing memories: one of the main function of the superego. 

Decisive for this view was Freuds Project for a Scientific Psychology. Written in 1895, it develops the thesis that experiences are stored into the neuronal network through &quot;a permanent change after an event&quot;. Freud soon abandoned this attempt and left it unpublished. Insights into the neuronal processes that permanently store experiences in the brain – like engraving the proverbial tabula rasa with some code – belongs to the physiological branch of science and lead in a different direction of research than the psychological question of what the differences between consciousness and unconsciousness are. Freud&#x27;s point of view was that &quot;consciousness&quot; is directly given – cannot be explained by insights into physiological details. Essentially, two things were known about the living soul: The brain with its nervous system extending over the entire organism and the acts of consciousness. According to Freud, therefore haphazard phenomena can be integrated between &quot;&quot;both endpoints of our knowledge&quot; (findings of modern neurology just as well as the position of our planet in the universe, for example), but this only contribute to the spatial &quot;localisation of the acts of consciousness&quot;&quot;, not to their understanding.

== Advantages of the structural model ==
In the topographic model of the soul, his first one, Freud divided mental phenomena into three regions: the Conscious, of whose contents the mind is aware at every moment, including information and stimuli from internal and external sources; the preconscious, whose material is merely latent (not directly present to thinking and feeling, but capable of becoming so without great effort); and the unconscious, which consists of biological needs and impulses that are made inaccessible to the conscious mind as a result of traumatic experiences in such a way that Freud describes this process as the pathological act of repression. With the introduction of the structural model, Freud intended to separate the terms unconscious and conscious from their spatially opposing meanings by formulating the three instances of id, ego and superego, which interlock with each other through their specific functions in a similar way to the organelles of a cell or parts of a machine, for example. The subdivision of the psyche outlined in the structural model is not a replacement for the topological division into ‘conscious vs. unconscious’, but rather a supplement.&quot;

Freud conceptualised the structural model because it allowed for a greater degree of precision and diversification. While the need contents of the id are initially unconscious (can become unconscious again as a result of an act of repression), the contents of the ego (such as thinking, perception) and the superego (memory; imprinting) can be both conscious and unconscious. Freud argued that his new model included the option of scientifically describing the structure and functions of the mentally healthy living being and therefore represented an effective diagnostic tool for clarifying the causes of mental disorders: 

The three newly presented entities, however, remained closely connected to their previous conceptions, including those that went under different names – the systematic unconscious for the id, and the conscience/ego ideal for the superego. Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though he noted that &quot;the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement.&quot;

The iceberg metaphor shows nothing of the physiological (real) structure of the brain, the possible organic correspondences of the three psychic instances or their functions. Instead it is a commonly used visual metaphor depicting the relationship between the ego, id and superego agencies (structural model) and the conscious and unconscious psychic systems (topographic model). In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego are submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious region of the psyche. The remaining portions of the ego and superego are displayed above water in the conscious region.

==History and translation of the terms==
The terms &quot;id&quot;, &quot;ego&quot;, and &quot;superego&quot; are not Freud&#x27;s own; they are Latinizations by his translator James Strachey. Freud himself wrote of &quot; &quot;, &quot;das &quot;, and &quot;das Ich&quot;—respectively, &quot;the It&quot;, &quot;the I&quot;, and &quot;the Over-I&quot;. Thus, to the German reader, Freud&#x27;s original terms are to some degree self-explanatory. The term &quot;das Es&quot; was originally used by Georg Groddeck, a physician whose unconventional ideas were of interest to Freud (Groddeck&#x27;s translators render the term in English as &quot;the It&quot;). The word &quot;&quot; is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as &quot;I myself&quot; to express emphasis.
Figures like Bruno Bettelheim have criticised the way &quot;the English translations impeded students&#x27; efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud&quot; by substituting the formalised language of the elaborated code for the quotidian immediacy of Freud&#x27;s own language.

<doc id="59176" wikidata="Q320348" url="?curid=59176" title="Widukind">
<text>Widukind, also known as Wittekind and Wittikund, was a leader of the Saxons and the chief opponent of the Frankish king Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785. Charlemagne ultimately prevailed, organized Saxony as a Frankish province, massacred thousands of Saxon nobles, and ordered conversions of the pagan Saxons to Christianity. In later times, Widukind became a symbol of Saxon independence and a figure of legend. He is also venerated as a blessed in the Catholic Church.

==Life==
Very little is known about Widukind&#x27;s life. His name literally translates as &quot;child of the forest&quot;. In the chronicles he is accompanied by Abbi who may have been a close relative. However, it is uncertain how they were related because all sources about him stem from his enemies, the Franks, who painted a negative picture representing him as an &quot;insurgent&quot; and a &quot;traitor&quot;. While Widukind was considered the leader of the Saxon resistance by the Franks, his exact role in the military campaigns is unknown.

According to the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;, the Franks campaigned in Saxony in 772, when Charlemagne ordered the destruction of the Irminsul sanctuary. The Saxon Wars continued when Westphalian tribes devastated the church of Deventer and the Angrarii laid siege to the Frankish court at Fritzlar. The king retaliated against the local nobility, enforcing the decree to incorporate the Saxon lands as a Frankish march.

Widukind was first mentioned by the &quot;Annals&quot; in 777 when he was the only one of the Saxon nobles not to appear at Charlemagne&#x27;s court in Paderborn. Instead, he stayed with the Danish king Sigfred (possibly Sigurd Hring). The next year, the Westphalians again invaded the Frankish Rhineland and subsequently fought a running battle against the Franks and their local allies while Charlemagne was busy in Spain.

By 782, Widukind had returned from Denmark and goaded the Saxon nobles into rebellion. From 782 to 784, battles between Saxons and Franks occurred annually, while Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons executed at the Massacre of Verden. Widukind allied himself with the Frisians but Charlemagne&#x27;s winter attacks of 784/785 were nevertheless successful, and the &quot;dux&quot; and his allies were pushed back to their homelands. Charlemagne, leading an expedition towards the mouth of the Elbe, learned that Widukind was in the land of the Nordalbingians, on the right bank of the river. In the Bardengau in 785, Widukind agreed to surrender in return for a guarantee that no bodily harm would be done to him. He and his allies were then baptized, possibly in Attigny, with Charlemagne as his godfather. Widukind thereby reached a peace agreement and the acknowledgement of the Saxon noble rank by their Frankish overlords.

There are no contemporary sources about Widukind&#x27;s life or death after his baptism. Historian Gerd Althoff assumed that he was imprisoned at a monastery—a fate that happened to other rulers deposed by Charlemagne. He tried to identify Reichenau Abbey as a likely location where Widukind may have spent the rest of his life, but his results are inconclusive and widely rejected. Alternatively, he may have received a position in the administration of occupied Saxony. The &quot;Vita Liudgeri&quot; biography of Saint Ludger mentions him accompanying Charlemagne on his campaign against the Veleti leader Dragovit. According to the 12th-century &quot;Kaiserchronik&quot;, he was slain by Charlemagne&#x27;s brother-in-law Gerold of Baar.

==Legend==

Numerous legends developed around Widukind&#x27;s life; he eventually appeared as a saintly figure (becoming &quot;Blessed Widukind&quot;) and the builder of many churches. He was later assumed to have died in 807 or 808; his feast day is commemorated on January 7.

According to legend, Widukind experienced a vision that led to his conversion. Disguised as a beggar, he was spying on Charlemagne&#x27;s troop camp during Easter. He witnessed a priest performing a Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the priest was holding a beautiful child during the consecration. To his astonishment, people would receive communion and the priest would give the same child to each person. Widukind was dumbfounded by this scene and went to beg outside after the mass. One of the emperor&#x27;s servants recognized Widukind behind his disguise—due to an odd formation of one of his fingers—and Widukind was captured. He was interrogated and confessed to spying on Charlemagne&#x27;s camp for the purpose of becoming better acquainted with the Christian faith. He later confessed the divine vision he had seen. The emperor concluded that God had given Widukind the grace of witnessing the divine child, Jesus, behind the Sacred Host of the Mass. Widukind then renounced his worship of pagan idols.

==Later perception==

===Medieval===
Since the 9th century, Widukind had been idolized as a mythical hero. Around 1100, a tomb for him was made in Enger; recent excavations have found that the contents of the tomb are indeed early medieval, but are the remains of a young woman. In 1971, archaeologists discovered three graves in a prominent place in front of the altar. The remains of three men who had died in the early 9th century, two of them about sixty-year-old warriors, the third a young man, were identified after a DNA analysis in 2002 as half-brothers or maternal cousins and a nephew. The man buried in front of the altar is assumed to be Widukind. When in the 10th century Saxon kings (of the Ottonian dynasty) replaced the Frankish kings in East Francia (the later Holy Roman Empire), these kings proudly claimed descent from Widukind: Matilda, the wife of King Henry I, was apparently a great-great-great-granddaughter of Widukind. The House of Billung, to which several Dukes of Saxony belonged, had Matilda&#x27;s sister among its ancestors and thus also claimed descent from Widukind. The Italian family Del Carretto (and its supposed French branch, family de Charette) also claimed to descend from the hero.

===In German nationalism===
Widukind became a hero for German nationalists in the early 20th century. German neo-pagans saw him as an heroic defender of Germany&#x27;s traditional beliefs and their gods, resisting the Middle Eastern religion of Christianity. Christian nationalists also lauded him, linking Charlemagne with the humiliation of French domination after World War I, especially the occupation of the Rhineland, portraying Charlemagne as a &quot;French&quot; invader.

After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, so many plays and other works were written about Widukind that there were complaints that he was becoming a cliché. Alfred Rosenberg praised him as a hero of German freedom, who finally joined with the founder of the German Reich (Charlemagne). Two important plays about the Saxon leader were produced in 1934, &quot;Der Sieger&quot; by Friedrich Forster and &quot;Wittekind&quot; by Edmund Kiss. The first celebrated the conversion of Widukind, but the second caused controversy because of its explicit anti-Christian message. In that play after the massacre of Verden, Saxon leaders say, &quot;That is what the Christians have done; they feign love, but bring murder!&quot;—a line that led to protests from the audience. The play portrays Catholic church leaders planning to destroy German freedom by forcing racial mixture on them, thus turning them into pliable &quot;Untermenschen&quot;. Thousands of German maidens are captured and will be forced to mate with &quot;Jews and Moors&quot; unless Widukind converts, which he does only to avoid this horrifying prospect. He gives a speech saying that the survival of the German race was his principal concern, and that future generations will praise him for this when the true spirit of the German people arises once more.

===Present===
Many buildings are named after him in the area of Enger, including the Widukind-Gymnasium Enger.

== Sainthood ==
He is called &#x27;Blessed Wittikund&#x27; in the Catholic Church and his feast day is celebrated on 7 January. Wittikund apparently saw an apparition of the child Jesus at Christmas mass one time. Following his baptism in 785 AD he forfeited engaging in warfare and became a prolific founder/restorer of churches; it was for this reason that he is regarded as a holy person.

<doc id="59180" wikidata="Q501242" url="?curid=59180" title="Caroline County, Maryland">
<text>Caroline County is a rural county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 33,293. Its county seat is Denton. The county is part of the Mid-Eastern Shore region of the state.

Caroline County is bordered by Queen Anne&#x27;s County to the north, Talbot County to the west, Dorchester County to the south, Kent County, Delaware, to the east, and Sussex County, Delaware, to the southeast.

==History==
Caroline County was created via 1773 Maryland General Assembly legislation from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne&#x27;s counties. The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland&#x27;s last colonial governor, Robert Eden. Seven commissioners were originally appointed: Charles Dickinson, Benson Stainton, Thomas White, William Haskins, Richard Mason, Joshua Clark, and Nathaniel Potter. These men bought of land at Pig Point (now Denton) on which to build a courthouse and jail.

Until the completion of these buildings, court was held at Melvill&#x27;s Warehouse, approximately north of Pig Point. Elections and other business transactions were completed there. The first commissioner meeting was held on March 15, 1774, at Melvill&#x27;s Warehouse. In 1777, court was moved to Bridgetown (now Greensboro), but in the interest of convenience, court was moved back to Melvill&#x27;s.

Disagreements arose concerning the permanent location of the county seat. The General Assembly reached a compromise in 1785 and ordered that of land at Melvill&#x27;s Landing should be purchased for a courthouse and jail. In 1790, the county court and its belongings moved to Pig Point. The Caroline County Courthouse was completed in 1797.

The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service is developing a site in the southern half of Caroline County dedicated to interpreting the Underground Railroad as part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument.

==Government==
Caroline County was granted home rule in 1984 under state code in an initiative led by County Commissioner Charles T. Dean, Sr.

*The County Commissioners as of 2022 are:
** Frank Bartz - Republican
** J. Travis Breeding - Republican
** Larry C. Porter - Republican
*County Administrator: Jeremy Goldman 
*Executive Assistant to the County Commissioners: Kaleigh Leager

Growth is a major issue faced by Caroline County and several other Mid-Shore counties. Retirees and workers willing to commute across the Chesapeake Bay to the western shore are increasingly attracted by the rural environment and low cost of living.

From 1994 to 2014 Caroline was the only county in the state not represented by a resident legislator in the Maryland General Assembly. Redistricting and a sparse population were the chief causes.

===Law enforcement===
The Sheriff of Caroline County is Donnie Baker, who has held the position since 2022.

==Politics==












At a Presidential level, Caroline is the “reddest” county on the mostly Republican Eastern Shore, and rivals Carroll County as the most Republican county in the state outside of Appalachian Western Maryland. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Caroline County since Lyndon Johnson’s landslide in 1964, and before then it had last gone Democratic in 1940 with Franklin D. Roosevelt. Indeed, the last Democrat to reach forty percent of the county’s vote was Jimmy Carter in 1980. In earlier times Caroline was a swing county, less secessionist than Wicomico, Worcester, Queen Anne’s or Cecil.

===Voter registration===
==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water. It is the second-smallest county by total area in Maryland. Notable waterways include the Choptank River and Tuckahoe Creek, as well as the man-made Williston Lake.

Caroline County currently ranks seventh nationally in terms of land protected under the Ag Preservation Program.

Its eastern border is the Mason–Dixon line.

Caroline is the only Eastern Shore county not to touch either the Chesapeake Bay or Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, it is the only county on the Eastern Shore without an Interstate or United States Highway within its borders.

Tuckahoe State Park, Holiday Park Campgrounds and Martinak State Park are located in Caroline County.

The American Discovery Trail runs through the county.

<text>Transactional analysis is a psychoanalytic theory and method of therapy wherein social interactions (or &quot;transactions&quot;) are analyzed to determine the ego state of the communicator (whether parent-like, childlike, or adult-like) as a basis for understanding behavior. In transactional analysis, the communicator is taught to alter the ego state as a way to solve emotional problems. The method deviates from Freudian psychoanalysis, which focuses on increasing awareness of the contents of subconsciously held ideas. Eric Berne developed the concept and paradigm of transactional analysis in the late 1950s.

==History==
Eric Berne presented Transactional Analysis to the world as a phenomenological approach, supplementing Freud&#x27;s philosophical construct with observable data. His theory built on the science of Wilder Penfield and René Spitz along with the neo-psychoanalytic thought of people such as Paul Federn, Edoardo Weiss, and Erik Erikson. By moving to an interpersonal motivational theory, he placed it both in opposition to the psychoanalytic traditions of his day and within what would become the psychoanalytic traditions of the future. From Berne, transactional analysts have inherited a determination to create an accessible and user-friendly system, an understanding of script or life-plan, ego states, transactions, and a theory of groups.

Berne&#x27;s theory was based on the ideas of Freud but with distinct differences. Freudian psychotherapists focused on client personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing a client&#x27;s social transactions. Berne mapped interpersonal relationships to three ego-states of the individuals involved: the &quot;Parent, Adult&quot;, and &quot;Child&quot; state. He then investigated communications between individuals based on the current state of each. He called these interpersonal interactions &quot;transactions&quot; and used the label &quot;games&quot; to refer to certain patterns of transactions which popped up repeatedly in everyday life in every human interaction.

The origins of transactional analysis can be traced to the first five of Berne&#x27;s six articles on intuition, which he began writing in 1949. Even at this early juncture and while still working to become a psychoanalyst, his writings challenged Freudian concepts of the unconscious.

In 1956, after 15 years of psychoanalytic training, Berne was refused admission to the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute as a fully-fledged psychoanalyst. He interpreted the request for several more years of training as a rejection and decided to walk away from psychoanalysis. 
Before the end of the year, he had written two seminal papers, both published in 1957. 
#In the first article, &quot;Intuition V: The Ego Image&quot;, Berne referenced P. Federn, E. Kahn, and H. Silberer, and indicated how he arrived at the concept of ego states, including his idea of separating &quot;adult&quot; from &quot;child&quot;. 
#The second paper, &quot;Ego States in Psychotherapy&quot;, was based on material presented earlier that year at the Psychiatric Clinic, Mt. Zion Hospital, San Francisco, and at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Clinic, UCSF School of Medicine. In that second article, he developed the tripartite scheme used today (Parent, Adult, and Child), introduced the three-circle method of diagramming it, showed how to sketch contaminations, labeled the theory, &quot;structural analysis&quot;, and termed it &quot;a new psychotherapeutic approach&quot;.

A few months later, he wrote a third article, titled &quot;Transactional Analysis: A New and Effective Method of Group Therapy&quot;, which was presented by invitation at the 1957 Western Regional Meeting of the American Group Psychotherapy Association of Los Angeles. With the publication of this paper in the 1958 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Psychotherapy&quot;, Berne&#x27;s new method of diagnosis and treatment, transactional analysis, became a permanent part of the psychotherapeutic literature. In addition to restating his concepts of ego states and structural analysis, the 1958 paper added the important new features of transactional analysis proper (i.e. the analysis of transactions), games, and scripts.

His seminar group from the 1950s developed the term &quot;transactional analysis (TA)&quot; to describe therapies based on his work.
By 1964, this expanded into the International Transactional Analysis Association. While still largely ignored by the psychoanalytic community, many therapists have put his ideas in practice.

In the early 1960s, he published both technical and popular accounts of his conclusions. His first full-length book on TA was published in 1961, titled &quot;Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy&quot;. &quot;Structures and Dynamics of Organizations and Groups&quot; (1963) examined the same analysis in a broader context than one-on-one interaction.

===Overview===
TA (Transactional Analysis) is not only post-Freudian, but, according to its founder&#x27;s wishes, consciously extra-Freudian. That is to say that, while it has its roots in psychoanalysis, since Berne was a psychoanalytically-trained psychiatrist, it was designed as a dissenting branch of psychoanalysis in that it put its emphasis on transactional rather than &quot;psycho-&quot; analysis.

With its focus on transactions, TA shifted the attention from internal psychological dynamics to the dynamics contained in people&#x27;s interactions. Rather than believing that increasing awareness of the contents of unconsciously held ideas was the therapeutic path, TA concentrated on the content of people&#x27;s interactions with each other. Changing these interactions was TA&#x27;s path to solving emotional problems.

TA also differs from Freudian analysis in explaining that an individual&#x27;s final emotional state is the result of inner dialogue between different parts of the psyche, as opposed to the Freudian hypothesis that imagery is the overriding determinant of inner emotional state. (For example, depression may be due to ongoing critical verbal messages from the inner Parent to the inner Child.) Berne believed that it is relatively easy to identify these inner dialogues and that the ability to do so is parentally suppressed in early childhood.

In addition, Berne believed in making a commitment to &quot;curing&quot; his clients, rather than just understanding them. To that end he introduced one of the most important aspects of TA: the contract—an agreement entered into by both client and therapist to pursue specific changes that the client desires.

Revising Freud&#x27;s concept of the human psyche as composed of the id, ego, and super-ego, Berne postulated in addition three &quot;ego states&quot;—the Parent, Adult, and Child states—which were largely shaped through childhood experiences. These three are all part of Freud&#x27;s ego; none represent the id or the superego.

Unhealthy childhood experiences can lead to being pathologically fixated in the Child and Parent ego states, bringing discomfort to an individual and/or others in a variety of forms, including many types of mental illness.

Berne considered how individuals interact with one another, and how the ego states affect each set of transactions. Unproductive or counterproductive transactions were considered to be signs of ego state problems. Analyzing these transactions according to the person&#x27;s individual developmental history would enable the person to &quot;get better&quot;. Berne thought that virtually everyone has something problematic about their ego states and that negative behaviour would not be addressed by &quot;treating&quot; only the problematic individual.

Berne identified a typology of common counterproductive social interactions, identifying these as &quot;games&quot;.

Berne presented his theories in two popular books on transactional analysis: &quot;Games People Play&quot; (1964) and &quot;What Do You Say After You Say Hello?&quot; (1975).

By the 1970s, because of TA&#x27;s non-technical and non-threatening jargon and model of the human psyche, many of its terms and concepts were adopted by eclectic therapists as part of their individual approaches to psychotherapy. It also served well as a therapy model for groups of patients, or marital/family counselees, where interpersonal (rather than intrapersonal) disturbances were the focus of treatment.

TA&#x27;s popularity in the U.S. waned in the 1970s. The more dedicated TA purists banded together in 1964 with Berne to form a research and professional accrediting body, the International Transactional Analysis Association, or ITAA.

===Fifty years later===
Within the framework of transactional analysis, more recent transactional analysts have developed different and overlapping theories of transactional analysis: cognitive, behavioural, relational, redecision, integrative, constructivist, narrative, body-work, positive psychological, personality adaptational, self-reparenting, psychodynamic and neuroconstructivist.

Some transactional analysts highlight the many things they have in common with cognitive behavioral therapy: the use of contracts with clear goals, the attention to cognitive distortions (called &quot;adult decontamination&quot; or &quot;child deconfusion&quot;), the focus on the client&#x27;s conscious attitudes and behaviours and the use of &quot;strokes&quot;.

Cognitive-based transactional analysts use ego state identification to identify communication distortions and teach different functional options in the dynamics of communication.
Some make additional contracts for more profound work involving life plans or scripts or with unconscious processes, including those which manifest in the client-therapist relationship as transference and countertransference, and define themselves as psychodynamic or relational transactional analysts. Some highlight the study and promotion of subjective well-being and optimal human functioning rather than pathology and so identify with positive psychology. Some are increasingly influenced by current research in attachment, mother-infant interaction and by the implications of interpersonal neurobiology and non-linear dynamic systems.

==Outline==
Transactional analysis integrates the theories of psychology and psychotherapy because it has elements of psychoanalytic, humanist and cognitive ideas.

According to the International Transactional Analysis Association, TA &quot;is a theory of personality and a systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and personal change.&quot;

# As a theory of personality, TA describes how people are structured psychologically. It uses what is perhaps its best known model, the ego-state (Parent-Adult-Child) model, to do this. The same model helps explain how people function and express their personality in their behaviour 
# As Berne set up his psychology, there are four life positions that a person can hold, and holding a particular psychological position has profound implications for how an individual operationalizes his or her life. The positions are stated as:
## I&#x27;m OK and you are OK. This is the healthiest position about life and it means that I feel good about myself and that I feel good about others and their competence.
## I&#x27;m OK and you are not OK. In this position I feel good about myself but I see others as damaged or less than me and this is usually not healthy.
## I&#x27;m not OK and you are OK. In this position the person sees him/herself as the weak partner in relationships as the others in life are definitely better than the self. The person who holds this position will unconsciously accept abuse as OK.
## I&#x27;m not OK and you are not OK. This is the worst position to be in as it means that I believe that I am in a terrible state and the rest of the world is as bad. Consequently, there is no hope for any ultimate supports. 
# It is a theory of communication that can be extended to the analysis of systems and organisations.
# It offers a theory for child development by explaining how our adult patterns of life originated in childhood. This explanation is based on the idea of a &quot;Life (or Childhood) Script&quot;: the assumption that we continue to re-play childhood strategies, even when this results in pain or defeat. Thus it claims to offer a theory of psychopathology.
# In practical application, it can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of many types of psychological disorders and provides a method of therapy for individuals, couples, families and groups.
# Outside the therapeutic field, it has been used in education to help teachers remain in clear communication at an appropriate level, in counselling and consultancy, in management and communications training and by other bodies.

Philosophy
* People are OK; thus each person has validity, importance, equality of respect. 
* Positive reinforcement increases feelings of being OK.
* All people have a basic lovable core and a desire for positive growth.
* Everyone (with only few exceptions, such as the severely brain-damaged) has the capacity to think.
* All of the many facets of an individual have a positive value for them in some way.
* People decide their story and destiny, therefore these decisions can be changed.
* All emotional difficulties are curable.

Freedom from historical maladaptations embedded in the childhood script is required in order to become free of inappropriate, inauthentic and displaced emotions which are not a fair and honest reflection of here-and-now life (such as echoes of childhood suffering, pity-me and other mind games, compulsive behaviour and repetitive dysfunctional life patterns). The aim of change under TA is to move toward autonomy (freedom from childhood script), spontaneity, intimacy, problem &quot;solving&quot; as opposed to &quot;avoidance&quot; or &quot;passivity&quot;, cure as an ideal rather than merely making progress and learning new choices.

==Ego-state or Parent–Adult–Child (PAC) models==

Many of the core TA models and concepts can be categorised into
* Structural analysis – analysis of the individual psyche
* Transactional analysis proper – analysis of interpersonal transactions based on structural analysis of the individuals involved in the transaction
* Game analysis – repeating sequences of transactions that lead to a result subconsciously agreed to by the parties involved in the game
* Script analysis – a life plan that may involve long-term involvement in particular games in order to reach the life pay-off of the individual

At any given time, a person experiences and manifests his or her personality through a mixture of behaviours, thoughts, and feelings. Typically, according to TA, there are three ego-states that people consistently use:

* &quot;Parent&quot; (&quot;exteropsyche&quot;): a state in which people behave, feel, and think in response to an unconscious mimicking of how their parents (or other parental figures) acted, or how they interpreted their parent&#x27;s actions. For example, a person may shout at someone out of frustration because they learned from an influential figure in childhood the lesson that this seemed to be a way of relating that worked.
* &quot;Adult&quot; (&quot;neopsyche&quot;): a state of the ego which is most like an artificially intelligent system processing information and making predictions about major emotions that could affect its operation. Learning to strengthen the Adult is a goal of TA. While people are in the Adult ego state, they are directed towards an objective appraisal of reality.
* &quot;Child&quot; (&quot;archaeopsyche&quot;): a state in which people behave, feel, and think similarly to how they did in childhood. For example, a person who receives a poor evaluation at work may respond by looking at the floor and crying or pouting, as when scolded as a child. Conversely, a person who receives a good evaluation may respond with a broad smile and a joyful gesture of thanks. The Child is the source of emotions, creation, recreation, spontaneity, and intimacy.

Berne differentiated his Parent, Adult, and Child ego states from actual adults, parents, and children, by using capital letters when describing them. These ego states may or may not represent the relationships that they act out. For example, in the workplace, an adult supervisor may take on the Parent role, and scold an adult employee as though he were a Child. Or a child, using the Parent ego-state, could scold her actual parent as though the parent were a Child.

Within each of these ego states are subdivisions. Thus Parental figures are often either

* more &quot;nurturing&quot; (permission-giving, security-giving) or
* more &quot;criticising&quot; (comparing to family traditions and ideals in generally negative ways);

Childhood behaviours are either 

* more &quot;natural&quot; (&quot;free&quot;) or 
* more &quot;adapted&quot; to others. 

These subdivisions categorize individuals&#x27; patterns of behaviour, feelings, and ways of thinking, which can be functional (beneficial or &quot;positive&quot;) or dysfunctional/counterproductive (&quot;negative&quot;).

Berne states that there are four types of diagnosis of ego states. They are: &quot;behavioural&quot; diagnosis, &quot;social&quot; diagnosis, &quot;historical&quot; diagnosis, and &quot;phenomenological&quot; diagnosis. A complete diagnosis would include all four types. It has subsequently been demonstrated that there is a fifth type of diagnosis, namely &quot;contextual&quot;, because the same behaviour will be diagnosed differently according to the context of the behaviour.

Ego states do not correspond directly to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s ego, superego, and id, although there are obvious parallels: Superego/Parent; Ego/Adult; Id/Child. Ego states are consistent for each person, and (argue TA practitioners) are more observable than the components of Freud&#x27;s model. In other words, the ego state from which someone is communicating is evident in their behavior, manner and expression.

==Emotional blackmail==

Emotional blackmail is a term coined by psychotherapist Dr. Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that fear, obligation, and guilt (FOG) are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics are useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.

Forward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:
There are different levels of demands—demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.

==Effectiveness==

A 1995 research article by the staff of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, with Martin Seligman as consultant, assessed that psychotherapy conducted by a group of Transactional Analysts is more effective than that of groups of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, marriage counselors, and physicians; and that psychotherapy lasting more than six months is 40% more effective than that lasting less than six months.

A 2010 review found 50 studies on transactional analysis that concluded it had a positive effect, and 10 where no positive effect was found. No studies that concluded a negative effect were found.

==Criticism==

The three major limitations of Berne&#x27;s work are: 
*Berne&#x27;s emphasis on structural explanation (rather than on those derived from an energy theory)
*His failure to develop a script reversal technique which would satisfy his own criteria of conciseness and theoretical consistency
*An apparent dependence upon content analysis

==In popular culture==

Thomas Harris&#x27;s successful popular work from the late 1960s, &quot;I&#x27;m OK, You&#x27;re OK&quot;, is largely based on transactional analysis. A fundamental divergence, however, between Harris and Berne is that Berne postulates that everyone starts life in the &quot;I&#x27;m OK&quot; position, whereas Harris believes that life starts out &quot;I&#x27;m not OK, you&#x27;re OK&quot;.

New Age author James Redfield has acknowledged Harris and Berne as important influences in his best-seller &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; (1993). The protagonists in the novel survive by striving (and succeeding) in escaping from &quot;control dramas&quot; that resemble the games of TA.

Singer/songwriter Warren Zevon mentions transactional analysis in his 1980 song &quot;Gorilla, You&#x27;re a Desperado&quot; from the album &quot;Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Joe South&#x27;s 1968 song, &quot;Games People Play&quot;, was based directly on transactional-analytic concepts and Berne&#x27;s book of the same name.

TA makes an appearance in Antonio Campos&#x27; 2016 biographical drama &quot;Christine&quot;, a film covering the events that led TV journalist Christine Chubbuck to die by suicide on TV. She is brought to a transactional analysis therapy session by a colleague, where they introduce her to the &quot;Yes, But...&quot; technique.

Singer John Denver references transactional analysis in his autobiography. His wife at the time, Annie Denver, was getting into the movement. John says he tried it but found it wanting.

Eric Berne&#x27;s &quot;Games People Play&quot; was featured prominently on an episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot;. The book was seen in Season 4, Episode 11, titled &quot;Chinese Wall&quot;. The approximate time period for this episode is September 1965. By late September 1965, &quot;Games People Play&quot; had been on the &quot;New York Times&quot; non-fiction bestseller list for nine weeks already.

<doc id="59184" wikidata="Q312386" url="?curid=59184" title="Widukind of Corvey">
<text>Widukind of Corvey (c. 925after 973; , in italian &quot;Vitichindo Sacco di Corvey&quot;, in Latin VVITICHINDI SAXO) was a medieval Saxon chronicler. His three-volume &quot;Res gestae Saxonicae sive annalium libri tres&quot; is an important chronicle of 10th-century Germany (Germania) during the rule of the Ottonian dynasty.

==Life==

In view of his name, he possibly was a descendant of the Saxon leader and national hero Widukind, mentioned in the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;, who had battled Charlemagne in the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785. Widukind the Chronicler entered the Benedictine abbey of Corvey in the Westphalian part of Saxony around 940/42, probably to become a tutor. It is widely assumed that he had reached the age of 15 upon his access, though it has been recently suggested that he may have joined the Order as a child. In 936 Henry the Fowler, the first East Frankish king of the Saxon ducal Ottonian dynasty had died and was succeeded by his son Otto the Great.

Otto&#x27;s rise as undisputed ruler of a German kingdom against the reluctant dukes made great impression on the Benedictine monk. By his own admission, Widukind first wrote several Christian hagiographies before he began his &quot;Res gestae Saxonicae&quot;. He dedicated the chronicles to Abbess Matilda of Quedlinburg (c. 955999), daughter of Emperor Otto the Great, like himself a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind. The annals were written after Otto&#x27;s coronation by Pope John XII on 2 February 962; however, though both Otto and his father Henry the Fowler are named &quot;Imperatores&quot;, this incident is not mentioned. After the elevation of Matilda&#x27;s brother Otto II as co-emperor in 967 and the death of her half-brother Archbishop William of Mainz one year later, the abbess remained the only important member of the Ottonian dynasty in the Saxon lands under regent Hermann Billung; therefore, Widukind may have begun the writing – or started all over again – to create a kind of mirror for princes.

The annals were continued until Otto&#x27;s death on 7 May 973. Widukind probably died thereafter at Corvey Abbey.

==Work==

The &quot;Res gestae Saxonicae&quot; are significant historical accounts of the times of Otto the Great and Henry the Fowler, modelled on the works of the Roman historian Sallust and the deuterocanonical Books of the Maccabees. Widukind wrote as a Saxon, proud of his people and history, beginning his narration not with the Roman Empire but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the Saxons and their struggles with the Franks, with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret.

Widukind of Corvey starts with the wars between Theuderich I, King of Austrasia, and the Thuringii, in which the Saxons played a large part. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne brings him to the early Saxon dukes and details of the reign of Henry the Fowler, whose campaigns are referred to in some detail. He omitted Italian events in tracing the career of Henry, nor does he ever mention a pope, but one of the three surviving manuscripts of his &quot;Gesta&quot; was transcribed in Benevento, the Lombard duchy south of Rome. The second book opens with the election of Otto the Great as German king, treats of the risings against his authority, again omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his first wife Edith of England in 946. In the third book the historian deals with Otto&#x27;s expedition into France, his troubles with his son Liudolf and his son-in-law, Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, and the various wars in Germany.

A manuscript of &quot;Res gestae Saxonicae sive annalium libri tres&quot; was first published in Basel in 1532 and is today in the British Library. There are two other surviving manuscripts. The best edition was published in 1935 by Paul Hirsch and Hans-Eberhard Lohmann in the series &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores rerum Germanicarum in usum scholarum editi&quot;. A German translation appears in the &quot;Quellen zur Geschichte der sächsischen Kaiserzeit&quot; published by Albert Bauer and Reinhold Rau in 1971. An English translation is found in an unprinted doctoral dissertation: Raymond F. Wood, &quot;The three books of the deeds of the Saxons, by Widukind of Corvey, translated with introduction, notes, and bibliography&quot; (University of California, Los Angeles, 1949).

Widukind is also credited with &quot;vitae&quot; of St Paul and St Thecla doubtless based on the 2nd century &quot;Acts of Paul and Thecla&quot;, but no traces of them now remain.

<text>Carroll County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 172,891. Its county seat is Westminster. The county is part of the Central Maryland region of the state. Carroll County is included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area. While predominantly rural, the county has become increasingly suburban in recent years.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the land that now makes up Carroll County was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Numerous Native American archaeological sites and archeological artifacts have been located across the county. Native Americans used the land for permanent settlements, seasonal visits and journeys, and as hunting grounds. At the time of European colonization, the Susquehannock and the Lenape were the predominant indigenous nations in the area. What is now the city of Manchester was inhabited by the Susquehannock nation until around 1750 and was the location of the intersection of two important Native American trails. An ancient trail that was used by Algonquian and Iroquois nations, named the &quot;Patapsco-Conewago (Hanover) Road&quot; by colonists, stretched from the Susquehanna River to the Potomac River. Main Street in Westminster was built over a portion of the trail between the two rivers. By the end of the 1700s, most roads in Carroll County were trails established by Native Americans. Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) was built over top what was originally a Native American trail. This trail passed through the Freedom area of southern Carroll County and was used by Native Americans to travel from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay. The trail was transformed into a road and renamed &quot;Liberty&quot; by an act of the Maryland General Assembly in the early 1800s. The land of what is now Sykesville was used by the Susquehannock and the Lenape as hunting grounds. Taneytown was inhabited by the Tuscarora people during the early to mid-1700s. The Tuscarora hunted deer, wolves, wildcats, and otters in the woodlands of what is now Taneytown. Due to the Six Nations land cessions, the Tuscarora were expelled westward across the South Mountain of the Cumberland Valley.
Carroll County was created in 1837 from parts of Baltimore and Frederick Counties, see Hundred (division). It was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), signer of the American Declaration of Independence.

The earliest European settlers in Carroll County were predominantly Pennsylvania Dutch from southeast Pennsylvania and English from the Tidewater region of Maryland. German was the predominant language of Carroll County until the Civil War. German was most heavily spoken in the northern and western parts of the county. The towns of Hampstead, Manchester, and Taneytown had German majorities. English-speakers were a minority and were concentrated in southern Carroll.

During the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy. In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the Gettysburg campaign. On June 29, 1863, the cavalry skirmish known as Corbit&#x27;s Charge was fought in the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General J.E.B. Stuart.

During the 1970s, Carroll County was a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan and the Klan regularly held rallies and cross-burnings. The KKK held rallies and handed out leaflets on Main Street in Westminster and in Manchester until the late 1980s. In 2012, two minors were charged for a cross-burning in Westminster. In 2018, the KKK distributed fliers in southern Carroll County.

In 2013 the Carroll County Board of Commissioners voted to make English the official language of the county. In 2018, the Carroll County Public Schools announced that Confederate flags and Nazi swastikas would be banned from Carroll County schools, along with Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation symbolism and other messages that promote hatred or intolerance.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water.

Topographically, Carroll County is located within the Piedmont Plateau region, with characteristic upland terrain of rolling hills and deciduous forest. The most prominent relief is Parr&#x27;s Ridge, which bisects the county from southwest to northeast. The highest point is an unnamed hilltop a half-mile south of the Pennsylvania state line in the northeastern part of the county off Harvey Yingling Road.

Carroll County is bordered on the north by the Mason–Dixon line with Pennsylvania, and on the south by Howard County across the South Branch of the Patapsco River. About half of the eastern border, with Baltimore County, is formed by the North Branch of the Patapsco River and by Liberty Reservoir, though the northern half near Manchester and Hampstead is a land border. Carroll County is bordered on the west by Frederick County, across the Monocacy River and Sam&#x27;s Creek. Other major streams in the county include Big Pipe Creek, Little Pipe Creek, and Double Pipe Creek, Bear Branch, and the headwaters of the Gunpowder Falls. The Piney Run Reservoir is in the southern part of the county.

Three railroad lines cross Carroll County. The old Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Old Main Line crosses the southern part of the county from east to west, with former stations in Sykesville and Mount Airy. The original Western Maryland Railway (WM) main line track runs southeast to northwest through Carrollton, Westminster, New Windsor, and Union Bridge. The old Baltimore and Hanover Railroad (later acquired by WM) runs further to the east through Hampstead, Millers, and Lineboro. Two of these railroad lines are now operated by CSX Transportation; the former WM main line is now operated by Maryland Midland Railway.

Carroll County has two water reservoirs at present, Liberty and Piney Run; the county has also proposed a Union Mills Reservoir and Gillis Falls Reservoir.

===Climate===
The county is divided by the January freezing isotherm into a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;.) The hardiness zones are 6b and 7a.

==Politics and government==
Carroll County differs from most counties in the Baltimore-Washington area in that it is strongly Republican. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Carroll County since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1964 landslide, and even LBJ won by a mere 119 votes out of 16,783 cast in that election; none have even won 40% of the county&#x27;s vote. Since World War I ended, the only other Democrat to carry Carroll County has been Franklin D. Roosevelt, who managed to achieve this only during his initial 1932 campaign. Before World War I Carroll County had considerable Confederate sympathy and hence leaned Democratic, although it did vote twice for William McKinley.

In the 2012 presidential election, 65 percent of the county&#x27;s vote went for Republican candidate Mitt Romney. In Maryland&#x27;s 2014 gubernatorial race, Carroll County voted for Republican Larry Hogan over Democrat Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown by sixty-six percentage points (82 to 16 percent).

Carroll County is governed by five county commissioners, a &quot;commission&quot; being the traditional form of county government in Maryland.

Several times in the past, Carroll County voters have rejected charter amendments that would call for a government consisting of a County Executive and a County Council.

Carroll Transit Service offers five fixed-deviated routes that were previously operated by CATS, as well as demand-response, door-to-door service.

The Owings Mills station of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink in nearby Owings Mills, Baltimore County, is a short drive by car from Carroll County and provides subway access to downtown Baltimore. Due to longstanding opposition to mass transit from local residents and politicians, there is no inter-county bus or rail transit linking Carroll County to nearby suburban communities of Baltimore County. Due to a resolution passed by the Carroll County Board of Commissioners, the Carroll Transit System is prohibited from offering bus services into or out of the county. The Baltimore Sun editorial board has condemned Carroll County&#x27;s &quot;transit phobia&quot; and excoriated the mass transit resolution as &quot;thinly veiled racist provocation.&quot; The Baltimore City Paper declared the resolution &quot;racist&quot; and suggested adding toll booths for cars entering Baltimore County from Carroll County.

==Education==
The Carroll County Public Schools School system is the ninth largest school district in the state of Maryland.

McDaniel College, a small private liberal arts college, is located in Westminster.

Carroll Community College is a two-year community college serving the residents of Carroll County. It is located in Westminster, Maryland.

==Media==
The newspaper of record is the &quot;Carroll County Times&quot;.
Carroll County has one AM radio station, WTTR, located in Westminster.

==Infrastructure==

===Law enforcement===
Law enforcement services for the county are provided by the Carroll County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, Maryland State Police, as well as several municipalities having their own police forces. In addition to providing police services, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office also acts as an agent of the courts: serving warrants, enforcing child support laws, ensuring courthouse security, transporting prisoners, etc. On October 4, 2007, the County Commissioners voted to create a police department for the county. The police department would handle primary law enforcement duties while the Sheriff&#x27;s office would continue to act under the arm of the courts. This move would give the Commissioners power to appoint or fire the chief of police instead of having a popularly elected Sheriff being in charge of all law enforcement. This move falls in line with Maryland&#x27;s more populated counties who have such a dual system of law enforcement (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince George&#x27;s, Howard and Baltimore Counties), as Carroll County has begun to have a population increase. Municipal departments, such as Westminster Police, would be unaffected by the change.
