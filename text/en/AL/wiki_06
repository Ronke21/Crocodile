<text>A honey bee (also spelled honeybee) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus &quot;Apis&quot; of the bee clade, all native to mainland Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).

Honey bees are known for their construction of colonial nests from wax, the large size of their colonies, and surplus production and storage of honey, distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. Only 8 surviving species of honey bees are recognized, with a total of 43 subspecies, though historically 7 to 11 species are recognized. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees.

The best-known honey bee is the western honey bee, (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;), which was domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. The only other domesticated bee is the eastern honey bee (&quot;Apis cerana&quot;), which occurs in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Only members of the genus &quot;Apis&quot; are true honey bees, but some other types of bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees belonging to the genus &quot;Melipona&quot; and the Indian stingless or dammar bee &quot;Tetragonula iridipennis&quot;. Modern humans also use beeswax in making candles, soap, lip balms and various cosmetics, as a lubricant and in mould-making using the lost wax process.

==Etymology and name==
The genus name &quot;Apis&quot; is Latin for &quot;bee&quot;. Although modern dictionaries may refer to &quot;Apis&quot; as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass asserts that correct usage requires two words, i.e., &quot;honey bee&quot;, because it is a kind or type of bee. It is incorrect to run the two words together, as in &quot;dragonfly&quot; or &quot;butterfly&quot;, which are appropriate because dragonflies and butterflies are not flies. Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.

==Origin, systematics, and distribution==

Honey bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines), as all the extant species except &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; are native to that region. Notably, living representatives of the earliest lineages to diverge (&quot;Apis florea&quot; and &quot;Apis andreniformis&quot;) have their center of origin there.

The first &quot;Apis&quot; bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (34 mya), in European deposits. The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied.

No &quot;Apis&quot; species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of &quot;A. mellifera&quot; by Europeans. Only one fossil species is documented from the New World, &quot;Apis nearctica&quot;, known from a single 14 million-year-old specimen from Nevada.

The close relatives of modern honey bees – e.g., bumblebees and stingless bees – are also social to some degree, and social behavior is considered to be a trait that predates the origin of the genus. Among the extant members of &quot;Apis&quot;, the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.

===Species===
While about 20,000 species of bees exist, only eight species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 43 subspecies, although historically seven to 11 species are recognized: &quot;Apis andreniformis&quot; (the black dwarf honey bee); &quot;Apis cerana&quot; (the eastern honey bee); &quot;Apis dorsata&quot; (the giant honey bee); &quot;Apis florea&quot; (the red dwarf honey bee); &quot;Apis koschevnikovi&quot; (Koschevnikov&#x27;s honey bee); &quot;Apis laboriosa&quot; (the Himalayan giant honey bee); &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; (the western honey bee); and &quot;Apis nigrocincta&quot; (the Philippine honey bee).

Honey bees are the only extant members of the tribe Apini. Today&#x27;s honey bees constitute three clades: &quot;Micrapis&quot; (the dwarf honey bees), &quot;Megapis&quot; (the giant honey bee), and &quot;Apis&quot; (the western honey bee and its close relatives).

Most species have historically been cultured or at least exploited for honey and beeswax by humans indigenous to their native ranges. Only two species have been truly domesticated: &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; and &quot;Apis cerana&quot;. &quot;A. mellifera&quot; has been cultivated at least since the time of the building of the Egyptian pyramids, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.

===&quot;Micrapis&quot;===
&quot;Apis florea&quot; and &quot;Apis andreniformis&quot; are small honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms can be handled with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and are probably the result of allopatric speciation, their distribution later converging.

Given that &quot;A. florea&quot; is more widely distributed and &quot;A. andreniformis&quot; is considerably more aggressive, honey is, if at all, usually harvested from the former only. They are the most ancient extant lineage of honey bees, maybe diverging in the Bartonian (some 40 million years ago or slightly later) from the other lineages, but do not seem to have diverged from each other a long time before the Neogene. &quot;Apis florea&quot; have smaller wing spans than its sister species. &quot;Apis florea&quot; are also completely yellow except the scutellum of workers, which is black.

===&quot;Megapis&quot;===
Two species are recognized in the subgenus &quot;Megapis&quot;. They usually build single or a few exposed combs on high tree limbs, on cliffs, and sometimes on buildings. They can be very fierce. Periodically robbed of their honey by human &quot;honey hunters&quot;, colonies are easily capable of stinging a human being to death if provoked.

*&quot;Apis dorsata&quot;, the giant honey bee, is native and widespread across most of South and Southeast Asia.
**&quot;A. d. binghami&quot;, the Indonesian giant honey bee, is classified as the Indonesian subspecies of the giant honey bee or a distinct species; in the latter case, &quot;A. d. breviligula&quot; and/or other lineages would probably also have to be considered species.
*&quot;Apis laboriosa&quot;, the Himalayan giant honey bee, was initially described as a distinct species. Later, it was included in &quot;A. dorsata&quot; as a subspecies based on the biological species concept, though authors applying a genetic species concept have suggested it should be considered a separate species and more recent research has confirmed this classification. Essentially restricted to the Himalayas, it differs little from the giant honey bee in appearance but has extensive behavioral adaptations that enable it to nest in the open at high altitudes despite low ambient temperatures. It is the largest living honey bee.

===&quot;Apis&quot;===

Eastern &quot;Apis&quot; species include three or four species, including &quot;A. koschevnikovi&quot;, &quot;A. nigrocincta&quot;, and &quot;A. cerana&quot;. The genetics of the western honey bee (&quot;A. mellifera&quot;) are unclear.

====Koschevnikov&#x27;s honey bee====
Koschevnikov&#x27;s honey bee (&quot;Apis koschevnikovi&quot;) is often referred to in the literature as the &quot;red bee of Sabah&quot;; however, &quot;A. koschevnikovi&quot; is pale reddish in Sabah State, Borneo, Malaysia, but a dark, coppery colour in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, Indonesia. Its habitat is limited to the tropical evergreen forests of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra and they do not live in tropical evergreen rain forests which extend into Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.

====Philippine honey bee====
&quot;Apis nigrocincta&quot; is a cavity-nesting species. The species has rust-coloured scapes, legs, and clypeuses, with reddish-tan hair colour that covers most of the body.

====Eastern honey bee====
&quot;Apis cerana&quot;, the eastern honey bee proper, is the traditional honey bee of southern and eastern Asia. One of its subspecies, the Indian honey bee (&quot;A. c. indica&quot;), was domesticated and kept in hives in a fashion similar to &quot;A. mellifera&quot;, though on a more limited, regional scale.

It has not been possible yet to resolve its relationship to the Bornean honey bee &quot;A. c. nuluensis&quot; and &quot;Apis nigrocincta&quot; from the Philippines to satisfaction; some researchers argue that these are indeed distinct species, but that &quot;A. cerana&quot; as defined is still paraphyletic, consisting of several separate species, though other researchers argue &quot;cerana&quot; is a single monophyletic species.

====Western honey bee====

&quot;A. mellifera&quot;, the most common domesticated species, was first domesticated before 2600 BC and was the third insect to have its genome mapped. It seems to have originated in eastern tropical Africa and spread from there to Europe and eastwards into Asia to the Tian Shan range. It is variously called the European, western, or common honey bee in different parts of the world. Many subspecies have adapted to the local geographic and climatic environments; in addition, breeds such as the Buckfast bee have been bred. Behavior, colour, and anatomy can be quite different from one subspecies or even strain to another.

&quot;A. mellifera&quot; phylogeny is the most enigmatic of all honey bee species. It seems to have diverged from its eastern relatives only during the Late Miocene. This would fit the hypothesis that the ancestral stock of cave-nesting honey bees was separated into the western group of East Africa and the eastern group of tropical Asia by desertification in the Middle East and adjacent regions, which caused declines of food plants and trees that provided nest sites, eventually causing gene flow to cease.

The diversity of &quot;A. mellifera&quot; subspecies is probably the product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age. That the western honey bee has been intensively managed by humans for many millennia – including hybridization and introductions – has apparently increased the speed of its evolution and confounded the DNA sequence data to a point where little of substance can be said about the exact relationships of many &quot;A. mellifera&quot; subspecies.

&quot;Apis mellifera&quot; is not native to the Americas, so it was not present when the European explorers and colonists arrived. However, other native bee species were kept and traded by indigenous peoples. In 1622, European colonists brought the German honey bee (&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) to the Americas first, followed later by the Italian honey bee (&quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;) and others. Many of the crops that depend on western honey bees for pollination have also been imported since colonial times. Escaped swarms (known as &quot;wild&quot; honey bees, but actually feral) spread rapidly as far as the Great Plains, usually preceding the colonists. Honey bees did not naturally cross the Rocky Mountains; they were transported by the Mormon pioneers to Utah in the late 1840s, and by ship to California in the early 1850s.

====Africanized honey bee====
Africanized honey bees (known colloquially as &quot;killer bees&quot;) are hybrids between European stock and the East African lowland subspecies &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;. They are often more aggressive than European honey bees and do not create as much of a honey surplus, but are more resistant to disease and are better foragers. Accidentally released from quarantine in Brazil, they have spread to North America and constitute a pest in some regions. However, these strains do not overwinter well, so they are not often found in the colder, more northern parts of North America. The original breeding experiment for which the East African lowland honey bees were brought to Brazil in the first place has continued (though not as originally intended). Novel hybrid strains of domestic and re-domesticated Africanized honey bees combine high resilience to tropical conditions and good yields. They are popular among beekeepers in Brazil.

==Life cycle==
As in a few other types of eusocial bees, a colony generally contains one queen bee, a female; seasonally up to a few thousand drone bees, or males; and tens of thousands of female worker bees. Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:
#Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax honeycomb, produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on which cell she is laying it into. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and pupating.
#Young worker bees, sometimes called &quot;nurse bees&quot;, clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flight and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.
#Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of &quot;dancing&quot; (known as the bee dance or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of &quot;Apis&quot; exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the &quot;round dance&quot;.
#Honey bees also perform tremble dances, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.
#Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.
#Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as &quot;swarms&quot;, which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves &quot;en masse&quot; to a nest site that was scouted by worker bees beforehand and whose location is communicated with a special type of dance. Once the swarm arrives, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise a new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of vespid wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, stingless bees will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true &quot;swarm&quot;.

===Winter survival===
In cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a &quot;winter cluster&quot;. The worker bees huddle around the queen bee at the center of the cluster, shivering to keep the center between at the start of winter (during the broodless period) and once the queen resumes laying. The worker bees rotate through the cluster from the outside to the inside so that no bee gets too cold. The outside edges of the cluster stay at about . The colder the weather is outside, the more compact the cluster becomes. During winter, they consume their stored honey to produce body heat. The amount of honey consumed during the winter is a function of winter length and severity but ranges in temperate climates from . In addition, certain bees, including the western honey bee as well as &quot;Apis cerana&quot;, are known to engage in effective methods of nest thermoregulation during periods of varying temperature in both summer and winter. During the summer, however, this is achieved through fanning and water evaporation from water collected in various fields.
==Pollination==


Of all the honey bee species, only &quot;A. mellifera&quot; has been used extensively for commercial pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. The scale of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars, credited with adding about 9% to the value of crops across the world. However, despite contributing substantially to crop pollination, there is debate about the potential spillover to natural landscapes and competition between managed honey bees and many of the ~20,000 species of wild pollinators.

Species of &quot;Apis&quot; are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants, but because of their &quot;generalized&quot; nature, they often do so inefficiently. Without specialized adaptations for specific flowers, their ability to reach pollen and nectar is often limited. This combined with their behavioural flexibility may be why they are the most commonly documented pollen thieves. Indeed, for plant species with more specialized pollinators, experiments show that increased honeybee visitation can reduce pollination, both where honey bees are non-native and even where they are native. What&#x27;s more, their tendency to visit all species in a given area means that the pollen they carry for any one species is often very diluted. As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, but most plants have some native pollinator that is more effective at pollinating that species. When honey bees are present as an invasive species in an area, they compete for flowers with native pollinators, which can actually push out the native species.

===Claims of human dependency===
Western honey bees have been described as essential to human food production, leading to claims that without their pollination humanity would starve or die out. Apples, blueberries, and cherries, for example, are 90 percent dependent on honeybee pollination. Albert Einstein is sometimes misquoted as saying &quot;If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live&quot;&quot;.&quot; Einstein did not say this and there is no science to support this prediction.

Many important crops need no insect pollination at all. The ten most important crops, comprising 60% of all human food energy, fall into this category: plantains are sterile and propagated by cuttings, as are cassava; potatoes, yams, and sweet potatoes are root vegetables propagated by tubers; soybeans are self-pollinated; and rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize, are wind-pollinated, as are most other grasses.

No crops originating in the New World depend on the western honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) at all, as the bee is an invasive species brought over with colonists in the last few centuries. Tomatoes, peppers, squash, and all other New World crops evolved with native pollinators such as squash bees, bumble bees, and other native bees. The stingless bees mentioned by Jefferson are distant relatives of the honey bees, in the genus &quot;Melipona&quot;.

Still, honey bees are considered &quot;crucial to the food supply, pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus and melons.&quot; The USDA reports &quot;Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce&quot; and honey bees &quot;pollinate 80 percent of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and vegetables.&quot;

==Nutrition==

Honey bees obtain all of their nutritional requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4–4.3 mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66–74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5 mg pollen or 25–37.5 mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require the highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however, elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with the lowest concentrations found in May and the highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.

Pollen is also a lipid source for honey bees ranging from 0.8% to 18.9%. Lipids are metabolized during the brood stage for precursors required for future biosynthesis. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are not considered essential but have been shown to significantly improve the number of brood reared. Honey bees ingest phytosterols from pollen to produce 24-methylene cholesterol and other sterols as they cannot directly synthesize cholesterol from phytosterols. Nurse bees can selectively transfer sterols to larvae through brood food.

Nectar is collected by foraging worker bees as a source of water and carbohydrates in the form of sucrose. The dominant monosaccharides in honey bee diets are fructose and glucose but the most common circulating sugar in hemolymph is trehalose which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. Adult worker honey bees require 4 mg of utilizable sugars per day and larvae require about 59.4 mg of carbohydrates for proper development.

Honey bees require water to maintain osmotic homeostasis, prepare liquid brood food, and cool the hive through evaporation. A colony&#x27;s water needs can generally be met by nectar foraging as it has high water content. Occasionally on hot days or when nectar is limited, foragers will collect water from streams or ponds to meet the needs of the hive.

==Beekeeping==

The only domesticated species of honey bee are &quot;A. mellifera&quot; and &quot;A. cerana&quot;, and they are often maintained, fed, and transported by beekeepers. In Japan, where &quot;A. mellifera&quot; is vulnerable to local hornets and disease, the Japanese honey bee &quot;A. cerana japonica&quot; is used in its place. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations. Bees of various types other than honey bees are also domesticated and used for pollination or other means around the world, including &quot;Tetragonula iridipennis&quot; in India, the blue orchard bee for tree nut and fruit pollination in the United States, and several species of &quot;Bombus&quot; (bumblebees) for pollination in various regions globally, such as tomatoes, which are not effectively pollinated by honey bees.

===Colony collapse disorder===
Primarily in places where western honey bees were imported by humans, periodic collapses in western honey bee populations have occurred at least since the late 19th century.

However, as humans continued to manipulate the western honey bee and deliberately transferred them on a global scale, diseases simultaneously spread and harmed managed colonies. Colony losses have occurred periodically throughout history. Fungus, mites, and starvation have all been thought to be the cause of the deaths. Limited occurrences resembling CCD were documented as early as 1869. Colony collapses were called &quot;May Disease&quot; in Colorado in 1891 and 1896.

Starting in the first decade of the 21st century, abnormally high die-offs (30–70% of hives) of western honey bee colonies have occurred in North America. This has been dubbed &quot;colony collapse disorder&quot; (CCD) and was at first unexplained. It seems to be caused by a combination of factors rather than a single pathogen or poison, possibly including neonicotinoid pesticides or Israeli acute paralysis virus.

A survey by the University of Maryland and Auburn University published in 2023 found the number of United States honeybee colonies &quot;remained relatively stable&quot; although 48% of colonies were lost in the year that ended April 1, 2023, with a 12-year average annual mortality rate of 39.6%. The previous year (2021-2022) the loss was 39% and the 2020-2021 loss was 50.8%. Beekeepers told the surveying scientists that a 21% loss over the winter is acceptable and more than three-fifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were higher than that in 2022-2023.

=== Parasites ===
====Acarapis woodi====
&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; (or &quot;tracheal mites&quot;) are parasitic mites that live and reproduce in adult bees&#x27; tracheae, or respiratory tubes, piercing the tube walls with their mouthparts to feed on haemolymph. To infest new hosts, the mites must find newly emerged bees; after three days, the bristles (setae) guarding the spiracles are firm enough to prevent the mites&#x27; entry into the tracheae. Mite infestations are known as acarine and have been called &quot;Isle of Wight disease&quot;.

====&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;====
Larval stages of the moth &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; parasitize both wild and cultivated honey bees, in particular &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; and &quot;Apis cerana&quot;. Eggs are laid within the hive and the larvae that hatch tunnel through and destroy the honeycombs that contain bee larva and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees. Destruction of honeycombs also results in honey leaking and being wasted. Both &quot;G. mellonella&quot; adults and larvae are possible vectors for pathogens that can infect bees, including the Israeli acute paralysis virus and the black queen cell virus.

To manage the mites, temperature treatments are possible, but also distort the wax of the honeycombs. Chemical fumigants, particularly CO2, are also used.

====&quot;Varroa&quot; mites====
&quot;Varroa&quot; mites are arguably the biggest threat to honey bees in the United States. These mites invade hives and reproduce by laying eggs on the pupa. The hatching mites eat away at the pupa, causing deformities as well as spreading disease. If not detected and treated early on, the mite population may increase to such an extent that the hive will succumb to the diseases and deformities caused by the mites. It was widely believed that the mites drank the blood of bees. However, a 2018 study Article in PNAS: &quot;Linking pesticides and gut health in bees&quot; showed that they feed on the fat body tissue of live bees, not the blood.

Mite treatment is accomplished by several methods, including treatment strips and acid vaporization.

==Bee products==
===Honey===

Honey is a complex substance made when bees ingest nectar, process it, and store the substance in honeycombs. All living species of &quot;Apis&quot; have had their honey gathered by indigenous peoples for consumption. &quot;A. mellifera&quot; and &quot;A. cerana&quot; are the only species that have had their honey harvested for commercial purposes.

===Beeswax===
Worker bees of a certain age secrete beeswax from a series of exocrine glands on their abdomens. They use the wax to form the walls and caps of the comb. As with honey, beeswax is gathered by humans for various purposes such as candle making, waterproofing, soap and cosmetics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, art, furniture polish, and more.

===Bee bread===

Bees collect pollen in their pollen baskets and carry it back to the hive.

Worker bees combine pollen, honey, and glandular secretions and allow them to ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The fermentation process releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by nurse bees (younger workers) which produce the protein-rich royal jelly needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.

In the hive, pollen is used as a protein source necessary during brood-rearing. In certain environments, excess pollen can be collected from the hives of &quot;A. mellifera&quot; and &quot;A. cerana&quot;. The product is used as a health supplement. It has been used with moderate success as a source of pollen for hand pollination.

===Bees as food===
Bee brood&quot; &quot;– the eggs, larvae or pupae of honey bees&quot; &quot;– is nutritious and seen as a delicacy in countries such as Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and many African countries; it has been consumed since ancient times by the Chinese and Egyptians.

Adult wild honeybees are also consumed as food in parts of China, including Yunnan. According to a worker at a Yunnan-based specialty restaurant, the bees are best served &quot;deep-fried with salt and pepper&quot;, and they are &quot;naturally sweet and tasty&quot;. Kellie Schmitt of CNN described the dish as one of &quot;Shanghai&#x27;s weirdest foods&quot;.

===Propolis===
Propolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Propolis may cause severe allergic reactions and have adverse interactions with prescription drugs in some individuals. Propolis is also used in wood finishes on string instruments.

===Royal jelly===
Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion used to nourish the larvae. It is marketed for its alleged but unsupported claims of health benefits. On the other hand, it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals.

==Sexes and castes==
Honey bees have three castes: drones, workers, and queens. Drones are male, while workers and queens are female.

===Drones===
Drones are typically haploid, having only one set of chromosomes, and primarily exist for reproduction. They are produced by the queen if she chooses not to fertilize an egg or by an unfertilized laying worker. There are rare instances of diploid drone larvae. This phenomenon usually arises when there are more than two generations of brother-sister mating. Sex determination in honey bees is initially due to a single locus, called the complementary sex determiner (&quot;csd&quot;) gene. In developing bees, if the conditions are that the individual is heterozygous for the &quot;csd&quot; gene, they will develop into females. If the conditions are so that the individual is hemizygous or homozygous for the &quot;csd&quot; gene, they will develop into males. The instances where the individual is homozygous at this gene are the instances of diploid males. Drones take 24 days to develop and may be produced from summer through to autumn, numbering as many as 500 per hive. They are expelled from the hive during the winter months when the hive&#x27;s primary focus is warmth and food conservation. Drones have large eyes used to locate queens during mating flights. They do not defend the hive or kill intruders and do not have a stinger.

===Workers===

Workers have two sets of chromosomes. They are produced from an egg that the queen has selectively fertilized from stored sperm. Workers typically develop in 21 days. A typical colony may contain as many as 60,000 worker bees. Workers exhibit a wider range of behaviors than either queens or drones. Their duties change with age in the following order (beginning with cleaning out their cell after eating through their capped brood cell): feed brood, receive nectar, clean hive, guard duty, and forage. Some workers engage in other specialized behaviors, such as &quot;undertaking&quot; (removing corpses of their nestmates from inside the hive).

Workers have morphological specializations, including the pollen basket &quot;(corbicula)&quot;, abdominal glands that produce beeswax, brood-feeding glands, and barbs on the sting. Under certain conditions (for example, if the colony becomes queenless), a worker may develop ovaries.

Worker honey bees perform different behavioural tasks that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. The gut microbial composition of workers varies according to the landscape and plant species they forage, such as differences in rapeseed crops, and with different hive tasks, such as nursing or food processing.

===Queens===

Queen honey bees are created when worker bees feed a single female larva an exclusive diet of a food called &quot;royal jelly&quot;. Queens are produced in oversized cells and develop in only 16 days; they differ in physiology, morphology, and behavior from worker bees. In addition to the greater size of the queen, she has a functional set of ovaries, and a spermatheca, which stores and maintains sperm after she has mated. &quot;Apis&quot; queens practice polyandry, with one female mating with multiple males. The highest documented mating frequency for an &quot;Apis&quot; queen is in &quot;Apis nigrocincta&quot;, where queens mate with an extremely high number of males with observed numbers of different matings ranging from 42 to 69 drones per queen. The sting of queens is not barbed like a worker&#x27;s sting, and queens lack the glands that produce beeswax. Once mated, queens may lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. They produce a variety of pheromones that regulate the behavior of workers and help swarms track the queen&#x27;s location during the swarming.

=== Queen-worker conflict ===

When a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen. The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers. This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as &quot;worker policing&quot;. In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen&#x27;s sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen&#x27;s offspring maximized.

In very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers; this is known as anarchic syndrome. Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones&#x27; mother would increase. The anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive.

Under ordinary circumstances, the death (or removal) of a queen increases reproduction in workers, and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen. The workers of the hive produce the last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses. Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues.

According to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times. Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in relationship between the sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease. The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.

== Timeline of reproduction ==
For &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, queens are the central reproducers among their colonies. Although reproduction may occur around the calendar, it may stop in the late fall due to falling temperatures. If a colony does not have a queen or she is unable to reproduce, workers can lay unfertilized eggs that may develop into males. The queens, however, do not reach this point immediately. Typically, it takes a queen 16 days to reach adulthood, with an additional week to begin developing and laying eggs. To begin the process of reproduction in a honeybee colony, workers begin to produce queen larvae while simultaneously finding a place to create a new hive. The queen larvae will then hatch at the old hive, and the queens will fight one another until there is only a single queen left to begin reproducing.

== Reproductive strategies ==
Once a queen matures and is ready to begin reproducing, she will begin making flights to orient to mating in free flight and finding mates before actually beginning to mate. Queens that are ready to mate take between 1 and 6 flights across multiple consecutive days, called nuptial flights. Throughout their nuptial flights, queens engage with multiple mates and have little control over the number of times they do so.

The process of queens engaging with their mates is not widely understood because the process takes place in free flight, so it is difficult to observe despite various advances in technology and observation techniques. It begins with drones flying in the same area where they know the queen will soon arrive, waiting for her to join them. When the queen arrives, she is crowded immediately by the drones who are eager to mate with her. The drones receive a signal from the queen that her &quot;sting chamber&quot; is open, which induces the drones to mate with her and bring forward their physical contact which warrants reproduction. A successful drone clasps onto the queen and releases seminal fluid and spermatozoa into the queen. After this process is complete, the drone typically remains inside of the queen, which is indicative of the drone&#x27;s desire to deter other drones from engaging with the queen and reproducing. This behavior also indicates that if the drone blocks other drones from mating with the queen, it will allow the mating drone to fertilize a greater number of the queen&#x27;s eggs. If the drone does not remain within the queen and removes itself from her, the drone can reproduce again with slim chances. Finally, the drone will die after mating with the queen within minutes or hours after reproduction is complete.

==Defense==
All honey bees live in colonies where the workers sting intruders as a form of defense, and alarmed bees release a pheromone that stimulates the attack response in other bees. The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.

The sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of &quot;Apis cerana japonica&quot;, defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian giant hornet) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (&quot;balling&quot;). Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the lethal effect. This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as &#x27;balling the queen&#x27;, named for the ball of bees formed.

Defense can vary based on the habitat of the bee. In the case of those honey bee species with open combs (e.g., &quot;A. dorsata&quot;), would-be predators are given a warning signal that takes the form of a &quot;wave&quot; that spreads as a ripple across a layer of bees densely packed on the surface of the comb when a threat is perceived and consists of bees momentarily arching their bodies and flicking their wings. In cavity dwelling species such as &quot;Apis cerana&quot;, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, and &quot;Apis nigrocincta&quot;, entrances to these cavities are guarded and checked for intruders in incoming traffic. Another act of defense against nest invaders, particularly wasps, is &quot;body shaking&quot;, a violent and pendulum-like swaying of the abdomen, performed by worker bees.

A 2020 study of &quot;Apis cerana&quot; in Vietnam found that they use feces and even human urine to defend their hives against raids by hornets (&quot;Vespa soror&quot;), a strategy not replicated by their European and North American counterparts, though collection and use of feces in nest construction is well-known in stingless bees.

===Venom===
The stings of honey bees are barbed and therefore embed themselves into the sting site, and the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion which keep delivering venom even after detachment. The gland which produces the alarm pheromone is also associated with the sting apparatus. The embedded stinger continues to emit additional alarm pheromones after it has torn loose; other defensive workers are thereby attracted to the sting site. The worker dies after the sting becomes lodged and is subsequently torn loose from the bee&#x27;s abdomen. The honey bee&#x27;s venom, known as apitoxin, carries several active components, the most abundant of which is melittin, and the most biologically active are enzymes, particularly phospholipase A2.

Honey bee venom is under laboratory and clinical research for its potential properties and uses in reducing risks for adverse events from bee venom therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, and use as an immunotherapy for protection against allergies from insect stings. Bee venom products are marketed in many countries, but, as of 2018, there are no approved clinical uses for these products which carry various warnings for potential allergic reactions.

==Competition==

With an increased number of honey bees in a specific area due to beekeeping, Western honey bees (as an invasive species) and native wild bees often have to compete for the limited habitat and food sources available, and Western honey bees may become defensive in response to the seasonal arrival of competition from other colonies, particularly Africanized bees which may be on the offence and defence year round due to their tropical origin.

==Communication==

Honey bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects. They also rely on a sophisticated dance language that conveys information about the distance and direction to a specific location (typically a nutritional source, e.g., flowers or water). The dance language is also used during the process of colony fission, or swarming, when scouts communicate the location and quality of nesting sites.

The details of the signalling being used vary from species to species; for example, the two smallest species, &quot;Apis andreniformis&quot; and &quot;A. florea&quot;, dance on the upper surface of the comb, which is horizontal (not vertical, as in other species), and worker bees orient the dance in the actual compass direction of the resource to which they are recruiting.

Carniolan honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera carnica&quot;) use their antennae asymmetrically for social interactions, with a strong lateral preference to use their right antennae.

There has been speculation as to honey bee consciousness. While honey bees lack the parts of the brain that a human being uses for consciousness like the cerebral cortex or even the cerebrum itself, when those parts of a human brain are damaged, the midbrain seems able to provide a small amount of consciousness. Honey bees have a tiny structure that appears similar to a human midbrain, so if it functions the same way they may be able to achieve a small amount of simple awareness of their bodies.

==Symbolism==
The bee was used as a symbol of government by Emperor Napoleon I of France. Both the Hindu &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; and the ancient Greeks associated lips anointed with honey with the gift of eloquence and even of prescience. The priestess at Delphi was the &quot;Delphic Bee&quot;.

The &quot;Quran&quot; has a Sura (chapter) titled &quot;The Bee&quot;. It is named after honey bees and contains a comparison of the industry and adaptability of honey bees to the industry of man.

In ancient Egyptian mythology, honey bees were believed to be born from the tears of the Sun God, Ra. Because of their divine origin, they were used to represent the Pharaoh. They were also used as a symbol of Lower Egypt in conjunction with the sedge, which represented Upper Egypt.

In Joseph and Asenath, a work composed by ancient Egyptian Jews who may have been affiliated with the Leontopolis temple, bee and honey imagery appears when Asenath converts and is visited by an angel. If the work was indeed connected to the Leontopolis temple, the bees likely represent Levite priests, and the imagery intends to signify the legitimacy of a Jewish temple in Egypt.

A community of honey bees has often been employed by political theorists as a model of human society, from Aristotle and Plato to Virgil. Honey bees, signifying immortality and resurrection, were royal emblems of the Merovingians. The state of Utah is called the &quot;Beehive State&quot;, the state emblem is the beehive, the state insect is the honey bee, and a beehive and the word &quot;industry&quot; appear on both the state flag and seal.

<doc id="58263" wikidata="Q558695" url="?curid=58263" title="List of counties in Alabama">
<text>The U.S. state of Alabama has 67 counties. Each county serves as the local level of government within its borders. The land enclosed by the present state borders was joined to the United States of America gradually. Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory. The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. In 1814, the Treaty of Fort Jackson opened the territory to American settlers, which in turn led to a more rapid rate of county creation. Alabama was admitted to the Union as the 22nd state in 1819. The Alabama state legislature formed additional counties from former native lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama. In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36 and Native Americans still occupied large areas of land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903. Houston County was the last county created in the state, on February 9, 1903.

According to 2023 U.S. Census data, the average population of Alabama&#x27;s 67 counties is 76,246, with Jefferson County as the most populous (662,895), and Greene County (7,341) the least. The average land area is 756 sq mi (1,958 km2). The largest county is Baldwin (1,590 sq mi, 4,118 km2) and the smallest is Etowah (535 sq mi, 1,386 km2). The Constitution of Alabama requires that any new county in Alabama cover at least in area, effectively limiting the creation of new counties in the state.

The Alabama Department of Revenue&#x27;s Motor Vehicle Division issues standard automobile license plates that bear a one- or two-digit number identifying the county in which the vehicle is registered. This number is given in the fourth column in the table below. The first three prefixes are reserved for the state&#x27;s historically most populous counties, and thereafter proceed alphabetically. Individual license plate numbers are assigned sequentially in each licensing office. The numbers are in the format &quot;XAA1111&quot; or &quot;XXAA111&quot;, depending on whether the prefix is one or two digits. Overflow registrations are accommodated by substituting a letter for one of the registration numbers, such that XXZ999Z is followed by XXA0A0A.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code links in the table point to U.S. Census &quot;quick facts&quot; pages for each county. Alabama&#x27;s FIPS state code is 01.

<text>Fig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside fig syconia. Some are pollinators but others simply feed off the plant. The non-pollinators belong to several groups within the superfamily Chalcidoidea, while the pollinators are in the family Agaonidae. Pollinating fig wasps are all gall-makers, non-pollinating fig wasps either make their own galls or usurp the galls of other fig wasps. The lifestyles of these fig wasps rely on the fruit of fig trees to reproduce, with pollinating fig wasps acting as mutualists, and non-pollinating fig wasps as parasitoids.

== History ==
Aristotle recorded in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; that the fruits of the wild fig (the caprifig) contain &quot;psenes&quot; (fig wasps); these begin life as grubs (larvae), and the adult &quot;psen&quot; splits its &quot;skin&quot; (pupa) and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig, saving it from dropping. He believed that the &quot;psen&quot; was generated spontaneously; he did not recognise that the fig was reproducing sexually and that the &quot;psen&quot; was assisting in that process.

==Taxonomy==
The fig wasps are a polyphyletic group, including several lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs. In 2022, family Agaonidae was updated to include only the pollinating fig wasps. Other fig wasps are now included in the families Epichrysomallidae, Eurytomidae, Melanosomellidae, Ormyridae, Pteromalidae, and Torymidae.

==Morphological adaptations==
In the Agaonidae, the female (as in most Hymenoptera) has four wings, whereas the males are wingless. The primary functions of agaonid males are to mate with the females while still within the fig syconium (inverted flower) and to chew a hole for the females to escape from the fig interior. This is the reverse of sex-linked functions in Strepsiptera and bagworms, where the male has wings and the female never leaves the host.

The non-pollinating fig wasps have developed several impressive morphological adaptations in order to oviposit eggs within the fig syconium. Many species have extremely long ovipositors, so that they can deposit eggs from the outside of the syconium (Subtribe Sycoryctina of Otitesellini and Subfamily Sycophaginae). Others have evolved to enter the syconium in the same way as the Agaonidae, and now resemble the pollinators morphologically (Subtribe Sycoecina of Otitesellini).

Most figs (more than 600 species) have syconia that contain three types of flowers: male, short female, and long female. Female fig wasps can reach the ovaries of short female flowers with their ovipositors, but not long female flowers. Thus, the short female flowers grow wasps, and the long flowers only seeds. Contrary to popular belief, ripe figs are not full of dead wasps and the &quot;crunchy bits&quot; in the fruit are only seeds. The fig actually produces an enzyme called ficain (also known as ficin) which digests the dead wasps and the fig absorbs the nutrients to create the ripe fruits and seeds. Several commercial and ornamental varieties of fig are parthenocarpic and do not require pollination to produce (sterile) fruits; these varieties need not be visited by fig wasps to bear fruit.

==Life cycle==


The life cycle of the fig wasp is closely intertwined with that of the fig tree it inhabits. The wasps that inhabit a particular tree can be divided into two groups; pollinating and non-pollinating. The pollinating wasps are part of an obligate nursery pollination mutualism with the fig tree, while the non-pollinating wasps feed off the plant without benefiting it. The life cycles of the two groups, however, are similar.

Though the lives of individual species differ, a typical pollinating fig wasp life cycle is as follows. At the beginning of the cycle, a mated mature female pollinator wasp enters the immature &quot;fruit&quot; (actually a stem-like structure known as a syconium) through a small natural opening (the ostiole) and deposits her eggs in the cavity. 

Forcing her way through the ostiole, the mated mature female often loses her wings and most of her antennae. To facilitate her passage through the ostiole, the underside of the female&#x27;s head is covered with short spines that provide purchase on the walls of the ostiole. 

In depositing her eggs, the female also deposits pollen she picked up from her original host fig. This pollinates some of the female flowers on the inside surface of the fig and allows them to mature. After the female wasp lays her eggs and follows through with pollination, she dies.

After pollination, there are several species of non-pollinating wasps that deposit their eggs before the figs harden. These wasps act as parasites to either the fig or possibly the pollinating wasps. 

As the fig develops, the wasp eggs hatch and develop into larvae. After going through the pupal stage, the mature male’s first act is to mate with a female - before the female hatches. Consequently, the female will emerge pregnant. The males of many species lack wings and cannot survive outside the fig for a sustained period of time. After mating, a male wasp begins to dig out of the fig, creating a tunnel through which the females escape.

Once out of the fig, the male wasps quickly die. The females find their way out, picking up pollen as they do. They then fly to another tree of the same species, where they deposit their eggs and allow the cycle to begin again.

== Coevolution ==
The fig–wasp mutualism originated between 70 and 90 million years ago as the product of a unique evolutionary event. Since then, cocladogenesis and coadaptation on a coarse scale between wasp genera and fig sections have been demonstrated by both morphological and molecular studies. This illustrates the tendency towards coradiation of figs and wasps. Such strict cospeciation should result in identical phylogenetic trees for the two lineages and recent work mapping fig sections onto molecular phylogenies of wasp genera and performing statistical comparisons has provided strong evidence for cospeciation at that scale.

Groups of genetically well-defined pollinator wasp species coevolve in association with groups of genetically poorly defined figs. The constant hybridization of the figs promotes the constant evolution of new pollinator wasp species. Host switching and pollinator host sharing may contribute to the incredible diversity of figs and fig wasp species like &quot;Pegoscapus&quot; as they result in hybridization and introgression&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="58265" wikidata="Q606191" url="?curid=58265" title="List of counties in Delaware">
<text>The U.S. state of Delaware is divided into three counties, the fewest of any state in the United States: New Castle, Kent and Sussex. The origin of the county boundaries goes back to their former court districts.

==Politics and government==
Each county elects a legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as the &quot;County Council&quot;, and in Kent County as the &quot;Levy Court&quot;). The counties are able to raise taxes and borrow money. They also have control over garbage disposal, water supply, sewerage, zoning, development, and building codes.

Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s. However, the hundreds now serve no administrative role; their only current official legal use is in real-estate title descriptions.

==History==
Following the English conquest of 1664, all of the land on the western side of the Delaware River and Delaware Bay was governed as part of the New York Colony and administered from the town of New Castle. During the brief recapture of the colony by the Dutch in 1673, additional court districts were created around Upland and Whorekill. The latter was also known as Hoornkill, and is now the town of Lewes. The court at New Castle was left with the central portion of the colony. The jurisdiction left to the court at became New Castle County, and the county seat remained at New Castle until 1881 when it was moved to Wilmington. In 1680, Whorekill District was divided into Deale County and St. Jones County. After this division, Lewes became the county seat of Deale, which was later renamed &quot;Sussex County&quot;. The former Upland District was named after the New Sweden settlement of Upland, and was renamed Chester County in 1682. Chester County is now located within the present boundaries of Pennsylvania.

Lord Baltimore, the Proprietor of Maryland, claimed all present-day Delaware, and organized its northern and eastern portions as Durham County, Maryland. However, this county existed only on paper. The southern and western portions of present-day Sussex County were organized as portions of several adjacent Maryland counties and were not recognized as part of Delaware until the Mason-Dixon Survey was run in 1767. In 1791, with the expansion of Sussex County to the south and west, the county seat was moved to Georgetown. The county seat of St. Jones (renamed &quot;Kent County&quot; in 1681) is at Dover.

After 2000, a fourth &quot;Appoquinimink County&quot; was proposed to be carved out of New Castle County. The effort intended to end the zoning restrictions of the Unified Development Code on the undeveloped farmland.

==County list==
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

<doc id="58267" wikidata="Q2268965" url="?curid=58267" title="Conceptual schema">
<text>A conceptual schema or conceptual data model is a high-level description of informational needs underlying the design of a database. It typically includes only the core concepts and the main relationships among them. This is a high-level model with insufficient detail to build a complete, functional database. It describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users. The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets the description of entities, datatypes, relationships and constraints.

== Overview ==

A conceptual schema is a map of concepts and their relationships used for databases. This describes the semantics of an organization and represents a series of assertions about its nature. Specifically, it describes the things of significance to an organization (&quot;entity classes&quot;), about which it is inclined to collect information, and their characteristics (&quot;attributes&quot;) and the associations between pairs of those things of significance (&quot;relationships&quot;).

Because a conceptual schema represents the semantics of an organization, and not a database design, it may exist on various levels of abstraction. The original ANSI four-schema architecture began with the set of &quot;external schemata&quot; that each represents one person&#x27;s view of the world around him or her. These are consolidated into a single &quot;conceptual schema&quot; that is the superset of all of those external views. A data model can be as concrete as each person&#x27;s perspective, but this tends to make it inflexible. If that person&#x27;s world changes, the model must change. Conceptual data models take a more abstract perspective, identifying the fundamental things, of which the things an individual deals with are just examples.

The model does allow for what is called inheritance in object oriented terms. The set of instances of an entity class may be subdivided into entity classes in their own right. Thus, each instance of a &quot;sub-type&quot; entity class is also an instance of the entity class&#x27;s &quot;super-type&quot;. Each instance of the super-type entity class, then is also an instance of one of the sub-type entity classes.

Super-type/sub-type relationships may be &quot;exclusive&quot; or not. A methodology may require that each instance of a super-type may &quot;only&quot; be an instance of &quot;one&quot; sub-type. Similarly, a super-type/sub-type relationship may be &quot;exhaustive&quot; or not. It is exhaustive if the methodology requires that each instance of a super-type &quot;must be&quot; an instance of a sub-type. A sub-type named &quot;Other&quot; is often necessary.

==Example relationships==
* Each PERSON may be &quot;the vendor in&quot; one or more ORDERS.
* Each ORDER must be &quot;from&quot; one and only one PERSON.
* PERSON is &quot;a sub-type of&quot; PARTY. (Meaning that every instance of PERSON is also an instance of PARTY.)
* Each EMPLOYEE may have a &quot;supervisor&quot; who is also an EMPLOYEE.

== Data structure diagram ==

A data structure diagram (DSD) is a data model or diagram used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them.

<doc id="58268" wikidata="Q932261" url="?curid=58268" title="Sydney, Nova Scotia">
<text>Sydney is a former city and urban community on the east coast of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada within the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.

Sydney served as the Cape Breton Island&#x27;s colonial capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to Halifax.

A rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney became home to one of North America&#x27;s main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound convoys. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to nationalize it in 1967 to save the region&#x27;s biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the Sydney Steel Corporation. The city&#x27;s population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant&#x27;s fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with Sydney Mines, North Sydney, New Waterford, and Glace Bay, Sydney forms the region traditionally referred to as Industrial Cape Breton.

==History==
===Early history 1700s to 1899===
Prior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. 
During the American Revolution, on 1 November 1776, John Paul Jones – the father of the American Navy – set sail in command of &quot;Alfred&quot; to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the &quot;Mellish&quot;, a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for John Burgoyne&#x27;s troops in Canada.

A few years into the war (1781) there was a naval engagement between two French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River, Cape Breton. The convoy, which consisted of 18 merchant vessels, including nine colliers and four supply ships, was bound for Spanish River on Cape Breton Island to pick up coal for delivery to Halifax. The British convoy escorts suffered considerable damage with one ship, &quot;Jack&quot; captured. The French ships also suffered damage. In the end the convoy was still able to load coal and transport it to Halifax. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.

Sydney was founded after the war by Colonel Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres, and named in honour of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, who was serving as the Home Secretary in the British cabinet. Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of Cape Breton Island. In November 1784 the 600-ton ship &quot;Blenheim&quot; landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of Loyalists from the state of New York (which included David Mathews, the former mayor of New York City under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the American Revolution, were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of Nova Scotia. DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785. He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken. The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour, a drowned valley of the Sydney River, which forms part of Spanish Bay. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island. The vice regal residence was located to the east of military grounds along DesBarres Street (and since re-developed as a residential area). The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government&#x27;s desire to develop the abundant coal fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the Duke of York. In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.

Sydney was incorporated as a town in 1885.

===Steel city 1900–1945===
By the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world&#x27;s largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation. Sydney&#x27;s economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of Glace Bay, New Waterford, Sydney Mines and Reserve Mines. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1904. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the Great Depression causing a slowdown in production and growth. World War Two brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.

Sydney Harbour played an important role during World War II. Once a Royal Canadian Navy base, , was established to stage supply convoys bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy. Convoy SC 7 typified the dangers inherent with the Nazi U-boats off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the Battle of the Atlantic, when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to Port aux Basques, Newfoundland; and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS &quot;Shawinigan&quot; on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island. Sydney&#x27;s coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the Allied war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, C. D. Howe favoured Central Canada&#x27;s steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.

===Post-war years 1950–2014===
By the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times. Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as &quot;Black Friday,&quot; so named after Hawker Siddeley Canada, the plant&#x27;s owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968. Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant&#x27;s owners, when Cape Breton&#x27;s citizens held the largest protest in the city&#x27;s history on 19 November 1967: &quot;The Parade of Concern.&quot; Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant&#x27;s gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant. Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier G.I. Smith and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, Allan J. MacEachen spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help. Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.

Both the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.
Forced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic Sydney Tar Ponds it left behind in Muggah&#x27;s Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed. The tar pond cleanup was completed in 2013 with the opening of Open Hearth Park, which sits on the direct site of the former steel plant and has hosted events such as an Aerosmith concert in September 2014.

==Geography==

Sydney is on the east bank of the Sydney River where it discharges into South Arm of Sydney Harbour. Elevation ranges from sea level to above sea level.

The majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network. The central business district is located on a peninsula extending into South Arm formed by Sydney River on the west side and Muggah Creek on the east side. The largest park within the former city limits is Open Hearth Park.

Distinctive neighbourhoods include Whitney Pier in the north east end next to the former steel plant site, Ashby in the east end, Hardwood Hill in the south end and the &quot;North End&quot; located on the peninsula which contains the Holy Angels convent and the Sydney Garrison known as Victoria Park, headquarters of the Cape Breton Highlanders reserve infantry regiment. The former city completely encircles the Membertou First Nation (First Nations Reserve 28A and 28B).

===Climate===
Sydney experiences a cool summer, and windy, wet and stormy winter, version of a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) that is significantly moderated by the community&#x27;s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded in Sydney was on 18 August 1935. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 31 January 1873, 29 January 1877 and 15 February 1916.

Due to the relatively strong influence from large bodies of water, Sydney experiences strong seasonal lag, meaning February is the year&#x27;s coldest month on average, and August is the year&#x27;s warmest month on average. By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.

In other respects, too, Sydney&#x27;s climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the Baltic Sea in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney&#x27;s seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor&#x27;easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to February. Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States&#x27; central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On 8 August 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.

While occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney&#x27;s driest months on average. Sydney&#x27;s average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year&#x27;s driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is 1481.4 mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia. Snowfall is heavy, averaging 281.1 cm per winter season. However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow. As such, actual snow accumulation is variable. A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation. Overall, Sydney&#x27;s climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).

==Demographics==

Statistics Canada classifies Sydney as a medium population centre, which for census purposes includes the neighbouring communities of Westmount, a significant portion of Sydney River, and other portions of the former Cape Breton County. The 2011 population of the Sydney census area, was 31,597, making it the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.

==Economy==
Sydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local coal and steel industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the Sydney Steel Corporation&#x27;s steel mill and the Cape Breton Development Corporation&#x27;s coal mines in 2000–2001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.

At the start of the 21st century, Sydney faced a significant challenge in the cleanup of the Sydney Tar Ponds, a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million CAD cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments has been completed and the Open Hearth Park opened in its place.

In one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.

High unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate, have affected the area&#x27;s economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in Alberta and Ontario.

Sydney&#x27;s economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of Highway 125 and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby Cape Breton University, which draws hundreds of international students each year.

===Tourism===

Cape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island&#x27;s largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. With its economy being dominated by the steel industry until the early 2000s, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of Baddeck being a preferred location for tourists transiting the Cabot Trail. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in cruise ship facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world&#x27;s largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.

Sydney&#x27;s tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney&#x27;s accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in Louisbourg (home of the Fortress of Louisbourg), Glace Bay (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), Baddeck (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, Cape Breton Highlands National Park, and Bras d&#x27;Or Lake.

==Arts and culture==
===Music===
The annual Celtic Colours International Festival is held throughout Cape Breton Island in October, with some of the concerts taking place in Sydney.

Sydney was selected to host the 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016 ECMA Galas.

==Sports==
Semi-professional hockey has a long tradition in Sydney. In December 1912, a group formed a professional hockey club to challenge for the Stanley Cup. The short-lived Sydney Millionaires, who received that nickname because the players were the highest paid in the Maritimes, won the 1913 Maritime Professional Hockey League championship. Their victory allowed them to challenge the Quebec Bulldogs, the then current cup holder, in Quebec City. On 10 March 1913, the Millionaires lost the second and final game of the Stanley Cup, and folded shortly thereafter.

From 1988 to 1996, Sydney was home to the Cape Breton Oilers of the American Hockey League, the primary farm team of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers. They won that league&#x27;s championship, the Calder Cup, in 1993. The franchise moved to Hamilton, Ontario, after the 1995–96 season, becoming the Hamilton Bulldogs.

Founded in 1997, the Cape Breton Eagles of the QMJHL play their home games at Centre 200. Eagles alumni include three-time Stanley Cup champion Marc-André Fleury.

The Cape Breton Highlanders of the National Basketball League of Canada played from 2016 to 2019.

Sydney hosted events for the 1987 Canada Winter Games, held throughout Cape Breton County.

The 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were co-hosted by Sydney and Halifax.

Tennis has a long history in Sydney. The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club (now the Cromarty Tennis Club) was incorporated by an Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature on 28 April 1893. The Cape Breton Junior Regionals, Masters Championships, and the Cape Breton Open tennis tournaments are held annually.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Sydney is served by Highway 125 which connects to Highway 105 and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus. Trunk 4 forms an important secondary road in Sydney running along the Sydney River, connecting to Glace Bay. Trunk 22, connecting to Louisbourg, and Trunk 28, connecting Whitney Pier through to New Waterford, form minor secondary roads.

====Public transportation====
Transit Cape Breton is owned and operated by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and provides bus services in the eastern part of the municipality, which includes Sydney.

Transit Cape Breton also operates &quot;Handi-Trans&quot; for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using regular bus services.

Transit fares are $1.25 per zone travelled, or $1.00 for seniors 55 &amp; up and children 5–12. Depending on the number of zones travelled, the cost of riding the bus can range from $1.00 to $5.00.

====Rail====
Sydney is home to two private freight railway companies. The Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway makes Sydney its eastern terminus and provides rail connections to CN in Truro via Port Hawkesbury. The Sydney Coal Railway connects a bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier with the Lingan Generating Station in Lingan. Daily passenger rail service was provided by Via Rail Canada until budget cuts on 15 January 1990. A weekly tourist train, the &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot; was operated by Via Rail Canada from 2000 to 2004 until being discontinued.

====Sea====
Sydney&#x27;s port facilities include the privately owned bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier as well as the publicly owned Sydney Marine Terminal at the northern edge of the central business district. A recently opened cruise ship pavilion welcomes several dozen cruise ships every year, with the majority visiting in late summer or early fall to take in fall foliage tours. Other port facilities on Sydney Harbour are located outside the former city limits in Point Edward (Sydport) and North Sydney (Marine Atlantic ferry terminal).

====Airport====
The JA Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport is located several kilometres outside the former city limits in the neighbouring community of Reserve Mines. The regional airport is served by Air Canada and Pascan Aviation.

Occasionally, travellers intending to go to Sydney, Australia mistakenly arrived in Sydney, Nova Scotia. This mistake is usually due to confusion of the two destinations in flight ticket bookings.

===Health care===
The Cape Breton Regional Hospital is located in Sydney.

==Education==
Sydney is part of the Cape Breton – Victoria Regional School Board and is home to one public English language secondary school: Sydney Academy, which is linked to several elementary and intermediate schools. Holy Angels, a female-only Catholic high school founded in the late 1800s, closed at the end of the 2011 school year. A French language school, Étoile de l&#x27;Acadie, is also located in Sydney and is part of the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial school board.

In 1951, the original campus of what became Cape Breton University was founded as the Xavier Junior College, affiliated with St. Francis Xavier University and was located in Sydney.
Sydney also has other post secondary and private career colleges, including the Cape Breton Business College founded in 1958 and the Canadian Coast Guard College founded in 1965.

==Media==
Sydney is the island&#x27;s largest commercial centre and home to the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot; daily newspaper, as well as one television station, CJCB-TV, a member of the CTV Television Network. CJCB was the first television station in Nova Scotia, going on air on 9 October 1954. It was also the eastern terminus of the original country-wide microwave network that went live on 1 July 1958, with the Canada&#x27;s first coast to coast television broadcast. From its beginnings until 1972, CJCB-TV was the area&#x27;s CBC affiliate.

Sydney&#x27;s first radio station was CJCB-AM, founded by Nate Nathanson, and went on the air on 14 February 1929. The Nathanson family would go on to open an FM radio station in 1957, CJCB-FM, and the above-mentioned television station. CBC began operating its own station, CBI (AM), in November 1948. It was part of the CBC&#x27;s Trans-Canada Network, while CJCB became a CBC affiliate for its Dominion Network. In 1962, the CBC combined the two networks, making CBI the only CBC station, and CJCB became an independent. In 1978, the CBC opened CBI-FM, which belonged to the CBC Stereo network. Since 1997, CBI-AM belongs to CBC Radio One and CBI-FM belongs to CBC Music. In addition to the CBC and CJCB stations, there are other FM radio stations serving the area, most coming into the market in the early 21st century.

<doc id="58273" wikidata="Q839066" url="?curid=58273" title="List of counties in Florida">
<text>There are 67 counties in the U.S. state of Florida, which became a territory of the U.S. in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory, Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east. The two counties were divided by the Suwannee River. All of the other counties were created later from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County. Florida&#x27;s counties are subdivisions of the state government. Florida&#x27;s most populous county is Miami-Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the nation, with a population of 2,701,767 as of the 2020 census.

In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters. All but two of Florida&#x27;s county seats are incorporated municipalities: the exceptions are Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County, and East Naples, located outside Naples city limits in Collier County.

The names of Florida&#x27;s counties reflect its cultural heritage. Some are named for Confederate political leaders and Spanish explorers, marking the influence of Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Christian saints, Native American sites, as well as political leaders of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants on both sides of the Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for the war&#x27;s native Muscogee-Seminole resistance leader Osceola.

Population figures are based on the 2023 vintage Census population estimates. The population of Florida is 22,610,726, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. The average population of Florida&#x27;s counties is 337,474; Miami-Dade County is the most populous (2,686,867) and Liberty County is the least (7,706). The average land area is 805 sq mi (2,085 km2). The largest county is Collier County as per 2020 Census bureau of 1,998.32 sq mi.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties and is provided for each entry. These codes link to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s &quot;quick facts&quot; for each county. Florida&#x27;s FIPS code of 12 is used to distinguish from counties in other states. For example, Orange County&#x27;s unique nationwide identifier is 12095.

Under the Florida Constitution the state government has the power to create and abolish counties. Each county in Florida is required to have a county seat under the state constitution.

==Former counties==
Fayette County was created in 1832 from the portion of Jackson County east of the Chipola River, with its county seat at Ochesee (now in Calhoun County east of Altha). In 1834, it was merged back into Jackson County.

==Renamed counties==
Five counties in Florida have been renamed. Most renamings occurred between 1845 and 1861, during the first sixteen years of Florida&#x27;s statehood. One occurred in 1997, when Dade County changed its name to Miami-Dade County.

<doc id="58275" wikidata="Q749406" url="?curid=58275" title="List of counties in Idaho">
<text>There are 44 counties in the U.S. state of Idaho.

The Idaho Territory was organized in March 1863, and Owyhee County was the first county in the territory to be organized, in December of that year. Oneida County was organized in January 1864, while Missoula County was adopted the same month, before becoming part of the new Montana Territory in May. Shoshone, Nez Perce, Idaho and Boise Counties were recognized in February 1864; Alturas County was organized the same month. In December 1864, Kootenai and Ada Counties were created; Lah-Toh County was also created at this time but was abolished in 1867.

Idaho&#x27;s present-day boundaries were established in 1868, and Lemhi County was created the following year. By the time Idaho was admitted to the Union as the 43rd state in 1890, a further eight counties had been created, bringing the total to 18. After Canyon, Fremont and Bannock Counties had been created, Alturas and Logan Counties were merged to form Blaine County in March 1895; Lincoln County was formed out of Blaine County later the same month. Bonner and Twin Falls Counties were created in 1907, before a further 21 counties were created between 1911 and 1919, bringing the total to the present-day 44.

Since 1945, each county has used a code on its license plates that features the first letter of the county&#x27;s name. Where the names of two or more counties start with the same letter, in each of these counties the letter is preceded by a number indicating that county&#x27;s order in the alphabetical list. For instance, the four counties beginning with &#x27;L&#x27; in alphabetical order are Latah, Lemhi, Lewis and Lincoln; the codes for these counties are thus 1L, 2L, 3L and 4L respectively. Elmore, Idaho, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone, Valley, and Washington Counties are the only ones in the state with their respective first letters; in these counties, the letter alone serves as the code.

==Alphabetical list==
















===Extinct counties===
*Alturas County created February 4, 1864, and abolished March 5, 1895.
*Logan County created February 7, 1889, and abolished March 5, 1895.

<text>There are 92 counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. Each county serves as the local level of government within its borders. Although Indiana was organized into the United States since the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, its land was not always available for settlement. The Vincennes Tract, Clark&#x27;s Grant and an area known as &quot;The Gore&quot; in southeastern Indiana (resulting from the Treaty of Greenville 1795) existed during the Northwest Territory. The remainder of Indiana land was acquired by Indian Removal Act and purchases by treaty between 1804 and 1840. The largest purchase (called &quot;Delaware New Purchase&quot; or just &quot;New Purchase&quot;) resulted from the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s (1818) which acquired about 1/3 of the state in the central portion. All or most of 35 counties were eventually carved from the area. The oldest counties are generally in the south near the Ohio River, whereas newer ones were in the north in territory acquired later. Many of the final counties were formed subsequent to the acquisition and break up of the Big Miami Reserve (encompassing present day Howard County and parts of surrounding counties) between 1834 and 1840. The oldest and newest counties in Indiana are Knox County, created in 1790, and Newton County, created in 1859.

As of the 2023 Census estimates, the population of Indiana was 6,862,199, the average population of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties is 74,589, with Marion County as the most populous (968,460), and Ohio County (6,004) the least. 54 counties have 30,000 or more people; 17 counties have populations exceeding 100,000, five of which exceed 250,000; and only five counties have fewer than 10,000 people. The average land area is . The largest county is Allen (657 sq. mi., 1,702 km2) and the smallest is Ohio (86 sq. mi., 223 km2). According to the Constitution of Indiana, no county may be created of less than , nor may any county smaller than this be further reduced in size, which precludes any new counties.

County government in Indiana consists of two bodies, the county council and the commissioners.

Many Indiana counties are named for United States Founding Fathers and personalities of the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and Battle of Tippecanoe; early leaders of Indiana Territory and Indiana, as well as surrounding states like Michigan and Kentucky; plus Native American tribes and geographical features.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Indiana&#x27;s code is 18, which when combined with any county code would be written as 18XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

In Indiana, the most commonly seen number associated with counties is the state county code, which is a sequential number based on the alphabetical order of the county.
It has been used on automobile license plates since 1963. It first held a prominent place on the left side of the plates as part of the license plate number until the year 2008 when it was moved above the serial number and 2012 when it was moved to the lower right corner. On license plates, county codes 93, 95, and 97-99 were also used for Marion County in addition to 49. 94 and 96 were used for Lake County in addition to 45. These additional numbers ceased to be used as of 2008. In addition these codes are also used by INDOT for structure IDs on objects such as bridges and overpasses.

<text>There are 99 counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The first two counties, Des Moines County and Dubuque County, were created in 1834 when Iowa was still part of the Michigan Territory. In preparation for Michigan&#x27;s statehood, part of Michigan Territory was formed into Wisconsin Territory in 1836. Two years later, the western portion was split off to become Iowa Territory. The south-eastern part of Iowa Territory became Iowa, the 29th state in the union, on December 28, 1846, by which point 44 counties had been created. Counties continued to be created by the state government until 1857, when the last county, Humboldt County, was created. One of the most significant days in Iowa county history was January 15, 1851, on which 49 counties were created.

The Iowa Constitution of 1857, which is still in effect today, states that counties must have an area of at least , and no county may be reduced below that size by boundary changes. However, exceptions to this rule were granted, as ten counties have areas below this size. (The table below shows land area, but the Constitution deals with total area.) The smallest county (Dickinson) has a land area of , while the largest (Kossuth) has an area 973 sq mi (2,520 km2). Polk County is the most densely populated county at , an increase in density from 2010 when it was . Polk County contains the state&#x27;s capital and largest city, Des Moines. In addition, Iowa has one of the smallest percentages of counties whose boundaries are dictated by natural means, the vast majority of which are being formed by lines of survey instead, resulting in many &quot;box counties&quot;.

==County information==
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.
The column labeled &#x27;#&#x27; is the official county number when listed alphabetically. This number is used for many governmental and organizational purposes, including state income tax preparation. From 1922 to 1978, it was also used on Iowa license plates until it was replaced by the full county name.
Finally, the number in the column headed &quot;Map #&quot; is used by the National Atlas of the United States, shown on the left; for purposes of the National Atlas, counties are numbered in geographical order beginning in the NW corner of the map.

<text>This is a list of counties in the U.S. state of Kansas. Select from the links at right to go directly to an article, or browse the listing below for additional information. Every license plate issued by the state contains the same two-letter abbreviation for the county in which its vehicle is registered.

==Overview==
Kansas has 105 counties, the fifth-highest total of any state. The first counties were established while Kansas was a Territory from May 30, 1854, until January 29, 1861, when Kansas became a state. Many of the counties in the eastern part of the state are named after prominent Americans from the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, while those in the central and western part of the state are named for figures in the American Civil War. Several counties throughout the state bear names of Native American origin.

Wyandotte County and the city of Kansas City, and Greeley County and the city of Tribune, operate as unified governments.

The FIPS state code for Kansas is 20.

==Former counties of Kansas==


St. John County was established in 1871, and formed from the area to the east of range 38 in what was then part of Wallace County. In 1885, the name was changed to Logan County.

Kearney County was established on March 6, 1873, and was dissolved in 1883, with the land area being split between Hamilton and Finney counties. It was reestablished with its original borders in 1887, and organized on March 27, 1888. In 1889, the name was corrected to Kearny County (without an extra &quot;e&quot;) to match the last name of Philip Kearny.

<text>Diffusivity is a rate of diffusion, a measure of the rate at which particles or heat or fluids can spread.

It is measured differently for different mediums.

Diffusivity may refer to:
*Thermal diffusivity, diffusivity of heat
*Diffusivity of mass:
** Mass diffusivity, molecular diffusivity (often called &quot;diffusion coefficient&quot;)
** Eddy diffusion, eddy diffusivity
*Kinematic viscosity, characterising momentum diffusivity
*Magnetic diffusivity

<text>This is a list of the 16 counties in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820, as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the 16 counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.

The first county to be created was York County, created as York County, Massachusetts, by the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1652 to govern territories it claimed in southern Maine. No new counties have been created since 1860, when Knox County and Sagadahoc County were created. The most populous counties tend to be located in the southeastern portion of the state, along the Atlantic seaboard. The largest counties in terms of land area are inland and further north. Maine&#x27;s county names come from a mix of British, American, and Native American sources, reflecting Maine&#x27;s pre-colonial, colonial, and national heritage.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Maine&#x27;s code is 23, which when combined with any county code would be written as 23XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

* is specific heat capacity (J/(kg·K))
* is density (kg/m3)
Together, can be considered the volumetric heat capacity (J/(m3·K)).

Thermal diffusivity is a positive coefficient in the heat equation:
formula_3
One way to view thermal diffusivity is as the ratio of the time derivative of temperature to its curvature, quantifying the rate at which temperature concavity is &quot;smoothed out&quot;. In a substance with high thermal diffusivity, heat moves rapidly through it because the substance conducts heat quickly relative to its volumetric heat capacity or &#x27;thermal bulk&#x27;.

Thermal diffusivity and thermal effusivity are related concepts and quantities used to simulate non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Diffusivity is the more fundamental concept and describes the stochastic process of heat spread throughout some &quot;local volume&quot; of a substance. Effusivity describes the corresponding transient process of heat flow through some &quot;local area&quot; of interest. In special cases of steady state, the thermal conductivity () may be sufficient to describe heat transfers inside solid or rigid bodies by applying Fourier&#x27;s law.

Thermal diffusivity is often measured with the flash method. It involves heating a strip or cylindrical sample with a short energy pulse at one end and analyzing the temperature change (reduction in amplitude and phase shift of the pulse) a short distance away.

<text>The Prandtl number (Pr) or Prandtl group is a dimensionless number, named after the German physicist Ludwig Prandtl, defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. The Prandtl number is given as:{\mbox{thermal diffusivity}} = \frac{\mu / \rho}{k / (c_p \rho)} = \frac{c_p \mu}{k} &lt;/math&gt;|border colour=#0073CF|background colour=#F5FFFA}}where:
* formula_1 : momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity), formula_2, (SI units: m2/s)
* formula_3 : thermal diffusivity, formula_4, (SI units: m2/s)
* formula_5 : dynamic viscosity, (SI units: Pa s = N s/m2)
* formula_6 : thermal conductivity, (SI units: W/(m·K))
* formula_7 : specific heat, (SI units: J/(kg·K))
* formula_8 : density, (SI units: kg/m3).

Note that whereas the Reynolds number and Grashof number are subscripted with a scale variable, the Prandtl number contains no such length scale and is dependent only on the fluid and the fluid state. The Prandtl number is often found in property tables alongside other properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.

The mass transfer analog of the Prandtl number is the Schmidt number and the ratio of the Prandtl number and the Schmidt number is the Lewis number.

== Experimental values ==

=== Typical values ===
For most gases over a wide range of temperature and pressure, is approximately constant. Therefore, it can be used to determine the thermal conductivity of gases at high temperatures, where it is difficult to measure experimentally due to the formation of convection currents.

Typical values for are:
* 0.003 for molten potassium at 975 K
* around 0.015 for mercury
* 0.065 for molten lithium at 975 K
* around 0.16–0.7 for mixtures of noble gases or noble gases with hydrogen
* 0.63 for oxygen
* around 0.71 for air and many other gases
* 1.38 for gaseous ammonia
* between 4 and 5 for R-12 refrigerant
* around 7.56 for water (At 18 °C)
* 13.4 and 7.2 for seawater (At 0 °C and 20 °C respectively)
* 50 for &quot;n&quot;-butanol
* between 100 and 40,000 for engine oil
* 1000 for glycerol
* 10,000 for polymer melts
* around 1 for Earth&#x27;s mantle.

=== Formula for the calculation of the Prandtl number of air and water ===
For air with a pressure of 1 bar, the Prandtl numbers in the temperature range between −100 °C and +500 °C can be calculated using the formula given below. The temperature is to be used in the unit degree Celsius. The deviations are a maximum of 0.1% from the literature values.

formula_9,
where formula_10 is the temperature in Celsius.

The Prandtl numbers for water (1 bar) can be determined in the temperature range between 0 °C and 90 °C using the formula given below. The temperature is to be used in the unit degree Celsius. The deviations are a maximum of 1% from the literature values.

formula_11

== Physical interpretation ==
Small values of the Prandtl number, , means the thermal diffusivity dominates. Whereas with large values, , the momentum diffusivity dominates the behavior.
For example, the listed value for liquid mercury indicates that the heat conduction is more significant compared to convection, so thermal diffusivity is dominant.
However, engine oil with its high viscosity and low heat conductivity, has a higher momentum diffusivity as compared to thermal diffusivity.

The Prandtl numbers of gases are about 1, which indicates that both momentum and heat dissipate through the fluid at about the same rate. Heat diffuses very quickly in liquid metals () and very slowly in oils () relative to momentum. Consequently thermal boundary layer is much thicker for liquid metals and much thinner for oils relative to the velocity boundary layer.

In heat transfer problems, the Prandtl number controls the relative thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layers. When is small, it means that the heat diffuses quickly compared to the velocity (momentum). This means that for liquid metals the thermal boundary layer is much thicker than the velocity boundary layer.

In laminar boundary layers, the ratio of the thermal to momentum boundary layer thickness over a flat plate is well approximated by
: formula_12
where formula_13 is the thermal boundary layer thickness and formula_14 is the momentum boundary layer thickness.

For incompressible flow over a flat plate, the two Nusselt number correlations are asymptotically correct:
: formula_15
: formula_16

where formula_17 is the Reynolds number. These two asymptotic solutions can be blended together using the concept of the Norm (mathematics):
: formula_18

<text>In thermal fluid dynamics, the Nusselt number (, after Wilhelm Nusselt) is the ratio of total heat transfer to conductive heat transfer at a boundary in a fluid. Total heat transfer combines conduction and convection. Convection includes both advection (fluid motion) and diffusion (conduction). The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the convective but for a hypothetically motionless fluid. It is a dimensionless number, closely related to the fluid&#x27;s Rayleigh number.

A Nusselt number of order one represents heat transfer by pure conduction. A value between one and 10 is characteristic of slug flow or laminar flow. A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100–1000 range. 

A similar non-dimensional property is the Biot number, which concerns thermal conductivity for a solid body rather than a fluid. The mass transfer analogue of the Nusselt number is the Sherwood number.

==Definition==
The Nusselt number is the ratio of total heat transfer (convection + conduction) to conductive heat transfer across a boundary. The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case.

:formula_1

where &quot;h&quot; is the convective heat transfer coefficient of the flow, &quot;L&quot; is the characteristic length, and &quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.

* Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer; some examples of characteristic length are: the outer diameter of a cylinder in (external) cross flow (perpendicular to the cylinder axis), the length of a vertical plate undergoing natural convection, or the diameter of a sphere. For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area.
* The thermal conductivity of the fluid is typically (but not always) evaluated at the film temperature, which for engineering purposes may be calculated as the mean-average of the bulk fluid temperature and wall surface temperature.

In contrast to the definition given above, known as &quot;average Nusselt number&quot;, the local Nusselt number is defined by taking the length to be the distance from the surface boundary to the local point of interest.

:formula_2

The &quot;mean&quot;, or &quot;average&quot;, number is obtained by integrating the expression over the range of interest, such as:

:formula_3

==Context==
An understanding of convection boundary layers is necessary to understand convective heat transfer between a surface and a fluid flowing past it. A thermal boundary layer develops if the fluid free stream temperature and the surface temperatures differ. A temperature profile exists due to the energy exchange resulting from this temperature difference.
The heat transfer rate can be written using Newton&#x27;s law of cooling as

:formula_4,

where &quot;h&quot; is the heat transfer coefficient and &quot;A&quot; is the heat transfer surface area. Because heat transfer at the surface is by conduction, the same quantity can be expressed in terms of the thermal conductivity &quot;k&quot;:

:formula_5.

These two terms are equal; thus

:formula_6.

Rearranging,

:formula_7.

Multiplying by a representative length &quot;L&quot; gives a dimensionless expression:

:formula_8.

The right-hand side is now the ratio of the temperature gradient at the surface to the reference temperature gradient, while the left-hand side is similar to the Biot modulus. This becomes the ratio of conductive thermal resistance to the convective thermal resistance of the fluid, otherwise known as the Nusselt number, Nu.

:formula_9.

==Derivation==
The Nusselt number may be obtained by a non-dimensional analysis of Fourier&#x27;s law since it is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface:

:formula_10, where &quot;q&quot; is the heat transfer rate, &quot;k&quot; is the constant thermal conductivity and &quot;T&quot; the fluid temperature.
Indeed, if: formula_11 and formula_12

we arrive at

:formula_13

then we define

:formula_14

so the equation becomes

:formula_15

By integrating over the surface of the body:

formula_16,

where formula_17.

==Empirical correlations==
Typically, for free convection, the average Nusselt number is expressed as a function of the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, written as:

:formula_18

Otherwise, for forced convection, the Nusselt number is generally a function of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, or

:formula_19

 correlations for a wide variety of geometries are available that express the Nusselt number in the aforementioned forms.

=== Free convection ===

====Free convection at a vertical wall====
Cited as coming from Churchill and Chu:

:formula_20

====Free convection from horizontal plates====
If the characteristic length is defined

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the surface area of the plate and formula_23 is its perimeter.

Then for the top surface of a hot object in a colder environment or bottom surface of a cold object in a hotter environment

:formula_24

:formula_25

And for the bottom surface of a hot object in a colder environment or top surface of a cold object in a hotter environment

:formula_26

====Free convection from enclosure heated from below====
Cited as coming from Bejan:

:formula_27

This equation &quot;holds when the
horizontal layer is sufficiently wide so that the effect of the short vertical sides
is minimal.&quot;

It was empirically determined by Globe and Dropkin in 1959: &quot;Tests were made in cylindrical containers having copper tops and bottoms and insulating walls.&quot; The containers used were around 5&quot; in diameter and 2&quot; high.

===Flat plate in laminar flow===

The local Nusselt number for laminar flow over a flat plate, at a distance formula_28 downstream from the edge of the plate, is given by

:formula_29

The average Nusselt number for laminar flow over a flat plate, from the edge of the plate to a downstream distance formula_28, is given by

:formula_31

===Sphere in convective flow===

In some applications, such as the evaporation of spherical liquid droplets in air, the following correlation is used:
:formula_32

===Forced convection in turbulent pipe flow===

====Gnielinski correlation====
Gnielinski&#x27;s correlation for turbulent flow in tubes:

:formula_33

where f is the Darcy friction factor that can either be obtained from the Moody chart or for smooth tubes from correlation developed by Petukhov:

:formula_34

The Gnielinski Correlation is valid for:

:formula_35
:formula_36

====Dittus–Boelter equation====
The Dittus–Boelter equation (for turbulent flow) as introduced by W.H. McAdams is an explicit function for calculating the Nusselt number. It is easy to solve but is less accurate when there is a large temperature difference across the fluid. It is tailored to smooth tubes, so use for rough tubes (most commercial applications) is cautioned. The Dittus–Boelter equation is:

:formula_37

where:
:formula_38 is the inside diameter of the circular duct
:formula_39 is the Prandtl number
:formula_40 for the fluid being heated, and formula_41 for the fluid being cooled.

The Dittus–Boelter equation is valid for
:formula_42
:formula_43
:formula_44

The Dittus–Boelter equation is a good approximation where temperature differences between bulk fluid and heat transfer surface are minimal, avoiding equation complexity and iterative solving. Taking water with a bulk fluid average temperature of , viscosity and a heat transfer surface temperature of (viscosity , a viscosity correction factor for formula_45 can be obtained as 1.45. This increases to 3.57 with a heat transfer surface temperature of (viscosity ), making a significant difference to the Nusselt number and the heat transfer coefficient.

====Sieder–Tate correlation====
The Sieder–Tate correlation for turbulent flow is an implicit function, as it analyzes the system as a nonlinear boundary value problem. The Sieder–Tate result can be more accurate as it takes into account the change in viscosity (formula_46 and formula_47) due to temperature change between the bulk fluid average temperature and the heat transfer surface temperature, respectively. The Sieder–Tate correlation is normally solved by an iterative process, as the viscosity factor will change as the Nusselt number changes.

:formula_48

where:
:formula_46 is the fluid viscosity at the bulk fluid temperature
:formula_47 is the fluid viscosity at the heat-transfer boundary surface temperature

The Sieder–Tate correlation is valid for

:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_44

===Forced convection in fully developed laminar pipe flow===
For fully developed internal laminar flow, the Nusselt numbers tend towards a constant value for long pipes.

For internal flow:

:formula_54

where:

:&quot;Dh&quot; = Hydraulic diameter
:&quot;kf&quot; = thermal conductivity of the fluid
:&quot;h&quot; = convective heat transfer coefficient

====Convection with uniform temperature for circular tubes====
From Incropera &amp; DeWitt,

:formula_55

OEIS sequence gives this value as formula_56.

====Convection with uniform heat flux for circular tubes====
For the case of constant surface heat flux,

:formula_57

<text>Native American gaming comprises casinos, bingo halls, slots halls and other gambling operations on Indian reservations or other tribal lands in the United States. Because these areas have tribal sovereignty, states have limited ability to forbid gambling there, as codified by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. As of 2011, there were 460 gambling operations run by 240 tribes, with a total annual revenue of $27 billion.

==History==
In the early 1970s, Russell and Helen Bryan, a married Chippewa couple living in a mobile home on Indian lands in northern Minnesota, received a property tax bill from the local county, Itasca County. The Bryans had never received a property tax bill from the county before. Unwilling to pay it, they took the tax notice to local legal aid attorneys at Leech Lake Legal Services, who brought suit to challenge the tax in the state courts. The Bryans lost their case in the state district court, and they lost again on appeal in a unanimous decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court. They then sought review at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court granted review, and in a sweeping and unanimous decision authored by Justice Brennan, the Supreme Court held not only that states do not have authority to tax Natives on their reservations, but that they also lack the authority to &quot;regulate&quot; Native activities on their reservations. Within a few years, enterprising Natives and tribes began to operate Indian bingo operations in numerous different locations around the United States.

Under the leadership of Howard Tommie, the Seminole Tribe of Florida built a large high-stakes bingo building on their reservation near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The tribe planned for the bingo hall to be open six days a week, contrary to Florida state law which only allows two days a week for bingo halls to be open, as well as going over the maximum limit of $100 jackpots. The law was enacted from the charity bingo limits set by Catholic Churches. The sheriff of Broward County, where the Native reservation lies, made arrests the minute the bingo hall opened, and the tribe sued the county (&quot;Seminole Tribe v. Butterworth&quot;), stating that Native tribes have sovereignty rights that are protected by the federal government from interference by state government. A District Court ruled in favor of the Natives, citing Chief Justice John Marshall in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;.
Controversy arose when Natives began putting private casinos, bingo rooms, and lotteries on reservation lands and began setting gaming prizes which were above the maximum legal limit of the state. The Natives argued for sovereignty over their reservations to make them immune from state laws such as Public Law 280, which granted states to have criminal jurisdiction over Native reservations. States were afraid that Natives would have a significant competitive advantage over other gambling establishments in the state which was regulated, which would thus generate a vast amount of income for tribes.

In the late 1970s and continuing into the next decade, the delicate question concerning the legality of tribal gaming and immunity from state law hovered over the Supreme Court. The Court addressed the potential gambling had for organized crime through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. A report by the Department of Justice presented to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on March 18, 1992, concluded that through several years of FBI investigation, organized crime had failed to infiltrate Native gaming and that there was no link between criminal activity in Native gaming and organized crime.

A Supreme Court ruling issued on July 9, 2020, which expanded tribal jurisdiction for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma also opened the possibility for Native Americans to have more power to regulate casino gambling.

===Cabazon Band, 1980===
In the early 1960s, the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, near Indio, California, were extremely poor and did not have much land because of neglected treaties in the 1850s by state senators. Historian Stuart Banner stated that the Cabazon Band and the neighboring Morongo Reservation had &quot;some HUD buildings and a few trailers, but that was about it. There was nothing really there. The people simply didn&#x27;t have a lot.&quot; The Cabazon Band turned to casino operations, opening bingo and poker halls in 1980. Shortly thereafter, the Indio police and the Riverside County Sheriff shut down the gambling halls and arrested numerous Natives while seizing any cash and merchandise held in the tribe&#x27;s possession. The Cabazon Band sued in federal court (&quot;California v. Cabazon Band&quot;) and won, as did the Seminole Tribe in Florida.
The Supreme Court reviewed the case in 1986 to reach a decision over whether Native reservations are controlled by state law. The Court again ruled that Native gaming was to be regulated exclusively by Congress and the federal government, not state government. With tribal sovereignty upheld, the benefits of gaming became available to many tribes.

===Indian Gaming Regulatory Act===

In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (signed by President Ronald Reagan) which kept tribal sovereignty to create casino-like halls, but the states and Natives must be in Tribal-State compacts and the federal government has the power to regulate the gaming. These compacts have been used by state officials to confiscate Native casino revenue which serves as a &quot;special&quot; tax on Native reservations. Essentially, the tribes still have &quot;exclusive right&quot; to all classes of gaming except when states do not accept that class or it clashes with federal law.

Class III Native gaming became a large issue for the states and federal government, because of these court cases, as Congress debated over a bill for Native gaming called the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

Currently, all attempts to challenge the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act on constitutional grounds have failed.

After President Reagan signed the IGRA, Native gaming revenue skyrocketed from $100 million in 1988 to $16.7 billion in 2006. Following the IGRA, the National Indian Gaming Commission was created as a federal agency in 1988 to regulate high-stakes Native gaming.

The Commission consists of three members: a chairman who is appointed by the US president with the consent of the Senate, and two associate members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. Each member serves a three-year term and must pass a detailed background check by the US Attorney General.

The NIGC withholds certain powers over Class II and Class III gaming. These include budget approval, civil fines, fees, subpoenas, and permanent orders. The NIGC monitors Class II gaming on Native lands on a continuing basis through inspection, investigation, access to records, and contracts. As for Class III gaming, all contracts must be approved by the chairman of the NIGC. 200 of the 562 federally recognized tribes created Class III gaming of large casinos and high jackpots.

This rise of gaming not only brought great revenue but also corruption. In January 2006, a court case involving lobbyists convicted of felonies such as conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion. This was known as the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. These lobbyists, Jack Abramoff, Ralph Reed, Grover Norquist, and Michael Scanlon, bribed members of Congress when lobbying for Native casinos, then overcharged their Native clients; this generated around $90 million in fees from the Natives.

===2006 legislation===

In 2006, Congress introduced legislation to protect their own casino interests from those tribes that are outside reservations. Further, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has faced increasing pressure to tighten regulatory policy and oversight of casino approvals. In particular, the BIA has been instructed by Congress to implement new procedures after two decades of IGRA&#x27;s existence. These procedures would allow local communities to have more influence in the siting of casinos in their community and would make the process of casino approval more transparent. To many tribes, however, the proposed regulations will further encroach on tribal sovereignty.

==Regulatory schemes==
Statistics provided by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), indicate that there are 460 Native gaming establishments in the US. These casinos are operated by 240 federally recognized tribes and offer Class I, Class II and Class III gaming. Gaming is divided into 3 classes with a different regulatory scheme for each:

=== Class I ===
Class I gaming is defined as (1) traditional Indian gaming, which may be part of tribal ceremonies and celebrations, and (2) social gaming for minimal prizes. Regulatory authority over class I gaming is vested exclusively in tribal governments and is not subject to IGRA&#x27;s requirements.

=== Class II ===
Class II gaming is defined as the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith) and, if played in the same location as the bingo, pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank. The Act specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of any game of chance from the definition of class II games.

Tribes retain their authority to conduct, license, and regulate class II gaming so long as the state in which the Tribe is located permits such gaming for any purpose, and the Tribal government adopts a gaming ordinance approved by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). Tribal governments are responsible for regulating class II gaming with Commission oversight. Only Hawaii and Utah continue to prohibit all types of gaming.

=== Class III ===
The definition of class III gaming is broad. It includes all forms of gaming that are neither class I nor II. Games commonly played at casinos, such as slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette, clearly fall in the class III category, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. Generally, class III is often referred to as casino-style gaming. As a compromise, the Act restricts Tribal authority to conduct class III gaming.

Before a Tribe may lawfully conduct class III gaming, the following conditions must be met:

* The Particular form of class III gaming that the Tribe wants to conduct must be permitted in the state in which the tribe is located.
* The Tribe and the state must have negotiated a compact that has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary must have approved regulatory procedures.
* The Tribe must have adopted a Tribal gaming ordinance that has been approved by the chairman of the commission.

The regulatory scheme for class III gaming is more complex than a casual reading of the statute might suggest. Although Congress clearly intended regulatory issues to be addressed in Tribal-State compacts, it left a number of key functions in federal hands, including approval authority over compacts, management contracts, and Tribal gaming ordinances. Congress also vested the commission with broad authority to issue regulations in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the Commission plays a key role in the regulation of class II and III gaming.

The revenue generated in these establishments was close to $27.1 billion in 2011 up from $12.8 billion in 2001. The regions with largest revenues in 2011 were Sacramento ($6.9 billion) and Washington State ($6.7 billion). The Native American gaming industry has been described as &quot;recession-resistant&quot;, although tribes in many states (including Arizona, California, Connecticut and New Mexico) saw revenues fall at a similar rate to commercial casinos during the Great Recession of 2007–2009.
Tribal casinos in the eastern US generated roughly $3.8 billion in FY02. Those in the Central US recorded gross revenues of approximately $5.9 billion, while those in the Western US generated nearly $4.8 billion. Most of the revenues generated in the Native gaming are from casinos located in or near large metropolitan areas. Currently, 12% of Native gaming establishments generate 65% of Native gaming revenues. Native gaming operations located in the populous areas of the West Coast (primarily California) represent the fastest growing sector of the Native gaming industry. As suggested by the above figures, the vast majority of tribal casinos are much less financially successful, particularly those in the Midwest and Great Plains. Many tribes see this limited financial success as being tempered by decreases in reservation unemployment and poverty rates, although socioeconomic deficits remain.
As of 2008 there are 562 federally recognized tribes in the United States, many of which have chosen not to enter the gambling industry.

==By state==
===California===
The largest casino in the state of California is the Yaamava&#x27; Resort &amp; Casino in Highland, with over 7,000 slot machines and 290,000 square feet of gaming area. Other large gaming operations include the Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, with 3,000+ slot machines and approximately of gaming space, Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa, Chumash Casino Resort, Harrah&#x27;s Resort Southern California, Barona Casino, Pala Casino Resort and Spa, Thunder Valley Casino Resort, Graton Resort &amp; Casino and Cache Creek Casino Resort. In fiscal year 2022, tribal casinos in California generated over $11 billion in revenue, exceeding that of the Las Vegas Strip.

===Connecticut===
The Foxwoods Resort Casino opened in 1992 in Ledyard, Connecticut. Operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and earning $1.5 billion, it was more profitable than any one casino in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. With 7,200 slot machines and 380 table games, the Foxwoods Resort Casino is the largest casino in the US and second largest in the world after Venetian Macao. Today, the property spans 1.5 miles from end to end, with 6 casinos, four hotels, more than 30 restaurants, two theaters, two spas, and more than one hundred retailers. The agreement between the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the State of Connecticut promises the state $80 million or 25% of their annual slot revenue. Since Foxwoods opened in 1992, the state of Connecticut has received more than $4 billion in slot revenue from Foxwoods alone.
The Mohegan Sun Resort &amp; Casino is also located in Connecticut, and is owned and operated by the Mohegan Tribe. The Mohegan Tribe approached the Mashantucket Pequots in the early 1990s for permission to pursue gaming. Although doing so would relinquish their gaming monopoly in Connecticut, the Mashantuckets granted the Mohegans their request, who then opened Mohegan Sun in 1996. This enterprise is and consists of 6,500 slot machines and 180 table games. It is the second largest casino in the United States, located 7 miles away from Foxwoods in Uncasville, Connecticut. Since opening in 1996, the state of Connecticut has received more than $3 billion in slot revenue from Mohegan Sun alone.
The success of both casinos is due in no small part to their location roughly halfway between New York City and Boston.
The economic recession that began in 2007 took a heavy toll of receipts, and by 2012 both Foxwoods in Connecticut and its nearby rival the Mohegan Sun were deeply in debt. &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; said &quot;Foxwoods is fighting for its life&quot;, with debts of $2.3 billion. In August 2012, the tribe owning the Foxwoods Casino restructured over a billion dollars in debt in an attempt to remain profitable.

=== Florida ===
The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, also known as &quot;The Guitar Hotel&quot;, is a hotel and casino resort near Hollywood, Florida, United States, located on 100 acres (40 ha) of the Hollywood Reservation of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The property currently has one hotel tower, a 140,000 sq ft (13,000 m2) casino, large poker room, a 4 acres (1.6 ha) lagoon-style pool facility with a center bar and many private cabanas, restaurants, shops, spa, bars and nightclubs, and the Hard Rock Event Center. A large expansion was completed in October 2019.

===Idaho===
The Coeur d’Alene Casino is located in Idaho, US. Founded in 1993, the establishment consists the Circling Raven Golf Club, two luxury hotels, 100,000 square feet of casino space, and various restaurants. The Coeur d’Alene Casino currently employs an average of 1000 local residents, making it one of the largest employers in the region. A part of the casino&#x27;s profits are invested back to the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people in education and various investment projects.

The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe also operates a slots-only casino in Fort Hall, Idaho, located just outside Pocatello, Idaho.

===Indiana===
The state of Indiana&#x27;s first tribal casino was opened on 16 January 2017. The 175,000-square-foot Four Winds Casino is located in South Bend and is operated by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians.

=== Minnesota ===
The biggest casino in Minnesota is Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. Mystic Lake Casino Hotel is owned and operated by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) in Prior Lake, Minnesota, United States, southwest of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. With 4,100 employees, the SMSC – including Mystic Lake Casino Hotel and Little Six Casino – is the largest employer in Scott County. The casino&#x27;s gambling options include slots, bingo, video roulette, pulltabs, and live dealer blackjack. Mystic Lake also offers bars, restaurants, shows, special events, and accommodations.

The Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino is a tribal gaming facility owned and operated by the Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC) in Welch, MN – Goodhue County. It is the only casino resort in southern Minnesota located on the Mississippi River. The casino&#x27;s gaming options include slot machines; video roulette, blackjack and keno; live dealer blackjack, poker and other table games; and bingo. Additional amenities to the property include a hotel, the Island Event Center, a marina, RV-park, a cruise yacht, a 24-lane bowling center, several restaurants; and a water park and spa. Employing nearly 1,500 people, Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino is the largest employer in Goodhue County.

===New York===
In March 1994 the Mohawk people created a joint venture with Alpha Hospitality to develop and operate a gaming facility on tribal lands. In January 1996 they entered into a memorandum with Robert A. Berman&#x27;s Catskill Development, L.L.C. regarding the development and management of a casino adjacent to the Monticello Raceway. The project received approval from the National Indian Gaming Commission.
In 1999, however, the Mohawk tribe signed an agreement to build the casino with Park Place Entertainment instead. The Akwesasne Mohawk Casino (AMC) was inaugurated that same year in Hogansburg, New York. The facility comprises 140,000 square feet of casino floor space that includes over 1,800 slot machines and 30 table games, as well as a luxury hotel, spas, restaurants, and a number of entertainment venues. The casino is managed by the Mohawk Nation.

===Oklahoma===
Native gaming revenues in Oklahoma rose to $3.23 billion in 2010, representing 44 percent of all U.S. casinos. Oklahoma surpassed Connecticut as second in the United States for gaming revenue, according to Alan Meister, an economist with Nathan Associates Inc.
Oklahoma has 113 tribal casinos, more than any other state in the U.S. A 2015 report on U.S. Gaming says that Oklahoma has the most gaming machines. WinStar World Casino in Thackerville, Oklahoma, is the third largest casino in North America with more than 500,000 square feet of gaming floor. Much of this success is due to geography: the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is roughly an hour&#x27;s drive from the Oklahoma state line, and Texas does not permit casino gambling. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 mandates that net revenues of such gaming be directed to tribes for government, economic development and general welfare use; to charitable organizations and to help fund local governments. Approved by voters in 2004, Oklahoma&#x27;s State-Tribal Gaming Act created a tribal gaming compact allowing federally recognized American Indian tribes to operate, electronic bonanza-style bingo games, electronic amusement games, electronic instant bingo games and non house-banked card games. The current compact automatically renews on Jan. 1, 2020. The Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act allowed any recognized tribe in Oklahoma to be federally incorporated, have the right to self-determination and make their own bylaws.

=== South Dakota ===
Tribal gaming in South Dakota is regulated through tribal-state compacts negotiated with individual tribes, with the oversight of the South Dakota Commission on Gambling. Casino games in Class II and Class III are permitted. Sports betting is legal in tribal casinos but mobile sports betting is not currently allowed. Among the 12 tribal casinos operated by 7 South Dakota Native American tribes, the Sioux-owned Royal River Casino in Flandreau is the largest, featuring 400 slot machines, a dozen gambling tables, and two restaurants.

=== Wyoming ===
The development of Indian gaming in Wyoming experienced significant challenges. The Northern Arapaho Tribe, after several unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a compact with the state, initiated a lawsuit in federal court. Their claim was rooted in the assertion that Wyoming&#x27;s refusal to negotiate constituted bad faith, especially considering that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 permitted casino-style gaming on tribal lands, as such gaming was already allowed within Wyoming for fundraising purposes.

In 2005, a pivotal court decision favored the Northern Arapaho Tribe, granting them the right to offer comprehensive casino-style Class III gambling on their lands. This ruling was a consequence of Wyoming&#x27;s actions, which ultimately led to the state forfeiting any claim to revenue sharing from Class III gaming income generated by the tribe.

Following this judicial outcome, in May 2006, Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe entered into the state’s first Class III gaming compact. This agreement, negotiated in April 2006, was made possible after the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that all types of Class III gaming were accessible to tribes within the state. Both the Northern Arapaho Tribe and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe have since operated casinos near their shared Wind River Indian Reservation.

In Wyoming, while there are no commercial casinos, tribal gaming is conducted by the Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho Tribes with casinos located on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Fremont County near Lander and Riverton. The Eastern Shoshone Tribe operates under a state compact, while the Northern Arapaho Tribe&#x27;s gaming activities are authorized by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). When interacting with these tribes for business purposes, it is crucial to adhere to each tribe’s specific policies and procedures, as well as any additional tribal laws or regulations.

==Impact on Native American economics==
Native American gaming has, in some instances, changed the face of tribal economies, but it has also proven to be very ineffective in other situations. Although tribal victories over the governmental and cultural oppression in the 1950s yielded a dynamic transformation, economic success fell short in comparison. Unemployment was down and personal income had increased, but only a handful of tribes had made economic changes. Their strides were spotty and fluctuated greatly from each Native reservation. This was happening because, for most tribes, their lands were not economically productive, infrastructure was poor, and they were far away from prospering markets of large populations. In order to address the issue of poverty, Native tribes were required to fuel some type of economic development. Natives sold some of their tribal land to prospecting non-Natives in order to stimulate economic growth, but tribal gaming has proved to be the single largest source of income in the Native community. However, the United States government intervened in tribal affairs throughout the rise of Native gaming.

Many tribal governments have seen substantial improvements in their ability to provide public services to their members, such as building schools, improving infrastructure, and shoring up the loss of native traditions. Tribal gaming operations have not been without controversy, however. A small number of tribes have been able to distribute large per-capita payments, generating considerable public attention. Additionally, the national expansion of Native gaming has led to a practice critics call &quot;reservation shopping&quot;. This term describes tribes that, with the backing of casino investors, attempt to locate a casino off their reservation, usually near a large urban center. However, although authorized by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, only three &quot;off-reservation&quot; casinos have been built to date.

<doc id="58287" wikidata="Q868719" url="?curid=58287" title="Grashof number">
<text>In fluid mechanics (especially fluid thermodynamics), the Grashof number (, after Franz Grashof) is a dimensionless number which approximates the ratio of the buoyancy to viscous forces acting on a fluid. It frequently arises in the study of situations involving natural convection and is analogous to the Reynolds number ().

==Definition==
===Heat transfer===
Free convection is caused by a change in density of a fluid due to a temperature change or gradient. Usually the density decreases due to an increase in temperature and causes the fluid to rise. This motion is caused by the buoyancy force. The major force that resists the motion is the viscous force. The Grashof number is a way to quantify the opposing forces.

The Grashof number is:

:formula_1 for vertical flat plates
:formula_2 for pipes and bluff bodies

where:
* is gravitational acceleration due to Earth
* is the coefficient of volume expansion (equal to approximately for ideal gases)
* is the surface temperature
* is the bulk temperature
* is the vertical length
* is the diameter
* is the kinematic viscosity.

The and subscripts indicate the length scale basis for the Grashof number.

The transition to turbulent flow occurs in the range for natural convection from vertical flat plates. At higher Grashof numbers, the boundary layer is turbulent; at lower Grashof numbers, the boundary layer is laminar, that is, in the range .

===Mass transfer===
There is an analogous form of the Grashof number used in cases of natural convection mass transfer problems. In the case of mass transfer, natural convection is caused by concentration gradients rather than temperature gradients.

formula_3

where

formula_4

and:

* is gravitational acceleration due to Earth
* is the concentration of species at surface
* is the concentration of species in ambient medium
* is the characteristic length
* is the kinematic viscosity
* is the fluid density
* is the concentration of species 
* is the temperature (constant)
* is the pressure (constant).

==Relationship to other dimensionless numbers==
The Rayleigh number, shown below, is a dimensionless number that characterizes convection problems in heat transfer. A critical value exists for the Rayleigh number, above which fluid motion occurs.

formula_5

The ratio of the Grashof number to the square of the Reynolds number may be used to determine if forced or free convection may be neglected for a system, or if there&#x27;s a combination of the two. This characteristic ratio is known as the Richardson number (). If the ratio is much less than one, then free convection may be ignored. If the ratio is much greater than one, forced convection may be ignored. Otherwise, the regime is combined forced and free convection.

:formula_6 

:formula_7

:formula_8

==Derivation==
The first step to deriving the Grashof number is manipulating the volume expansion coefficient, formula_9 as follows.

formula_10

The formula_11 in the equation above, which represents specific volume, is not the same as the formula_11 in the subsequent sections of this derivation, which will represent a velocity. This partial relation of the volume expansion coefficient, formula_9, with respect to fluid density, formula_14, given constant pressure, can be rewritten as

formula_15

where:
* formula_16 is the bulk fluid density
* formula_17 is the boundary layer density
* formula_18, the temperature difference between boundary layer and bulk fluid.

There are two different ways to find the Grashof number from this point. One involves the energy equation while the other incorporates the buoyant force due to the difference in density between the boundary layer and bulk fluid.

=== Energy equation ===
This discussion involving the energy equation is with respect to rotationally symmetric flow. This analysis will take into consideration the effect of gravitational acceleration on flow and heat transfer. The mathematical equations to follow apply both to rotational symmetric flow as well as two-dimensional planar flow.

formula_19

where:

* formula_20 is the rotational direction, i.e. direction parallel to the surface
* formula_21 is the tangential velocity, i.e. velocity parallel to the surface
* formula_22 is the planar direction, i.e. direction normal to the surface
* formula_11 is the normal velocity, i.e. velocity normal to the surface
* formula_24 is the radius.

In this equation the superscript is to differentiate between rotationally symmetric flow from planar flow. The following characteristics of this equation hold true.

* formula_25 = 1: rotationally symmetric flow
* formula_25 = 0: planar, two-dimensional flow
* formula_27 is gravitational acceleration

This equation expands to the following with the addition of physical fluid properties:

formula_28

From here we can further simplify the momentum equation by setting the bulk fluid velocity to 0 (formula_29).

formula_30

This relation shows that the pressure gradient is simply a product of the bulk fluid density and the gravitational acceleration. The next step is to plug in the pressure gradient into the momentum equation.

formula_31

where the volume expansion coefficient to density relationship formula_32 found above and the kinematic viscosity relationship formula_33 were substituted into the momentum equation.formula_34

To find the Grashof number from this point, the preceding equation must be non-dimensionalized. This means that every variable in the equation should have no dimension and should instead be a ratio characteristic to the geometry and setup of the problem. This is done by dividing each variable by corresponding constant quantities. Lengths are divided by a characteristic length, formula_35. Velocities are divided by appropriate reference velocities, formula_36, which, considering the Reynolds number, gives formula_37. Temperatures are divided by the appropriate temperature difference, formula_38. These dimensionless parameters look like the following:

* formula_39,
* formula_40,
* formula_41,
* formula_42, and
* formula_43.

The asterisks represent dimensionless parameter. Combining these dimensionless equations with the momentum equations gives the following simplified equation.

:formula_44

:formula_45

where:

:formula_46 is the surface temperature
:formula_47 is the bulk fluid temperature
:formula_35 is the characteristic length.

The dimensionless parameter enclosed in the brackets in the preceding equation is known as the Grashof number:

:formula_49

===Buckingham π theorem===
Another form of dimensional analysis that will result in the Grashof number is known as the Buckingham π theorem. This method takes into account the buoyancy force per unit volume, formula_50 due to the density difference in the boundary layer and the bulk fluid.

formula_51

This equation can be manipulated to give,

formula_52

The list of variables that are used in the Buckingham π method is listed below, along with their symbols and dimensions.

With reference to the Buckingham π theorem there are dimensionless groups. Choose , formula_53 , and formula_54 as the reference variables. Thus the formula_55 groups are as follows:

:formula_56,

:formula_57,

:formula_58,

:formula_59.

Solving these formula_60 groups gives:

:formula_61,

:formula_62,

:formula_63,

:formula_64

From the two groups formula_65 and formula_66 the product forms the Grashof number:

:formula_67

Taking formula_33 and formula_69 the preceding equation can be rendered as the same result from deriving the Grashof number from the energy equation.

:formula_70

In forced convection the Reynolds number governs the fluid flow. But, in natural convection the Grashof number is the dimensionless parameter that governs the fluid flow. Using the energy equation and the buoyant force combined with dimensional analysis provides two different ways to derive the Grashof number.

=== Physical Reasoning ===
It is also possible to derive the Grashof number by physical definition of the number as follows:

formula_71

However, above expression, especially the final part at the right hand side, is slightly different from Grashof number appearing in literature. Following dimensionally correct scale in terms of dynamic viscosity can be used to have the final form.

formula_72Writing above scale in Gr gives;

formula_73Physical reasoning is helpful to grasp the meaning of the number. On the other hand, following velocity definition can be used as a characteristic velocity value for making certain velocities nondimensional.

formula_74

==Effects of Grashof number on the flow of different fluids==
In a recent research carried out on the effects of Grashof number on the flow of different fluids driven by convection over various surfaces. Using slope of the linear regression line through data points, it is concluded that increase in the value of Grashof number or any buoyancy related parameter implies an increase in the wall temperature and this makes the bond(s) between the fluid to become weaker, strength of the internal friction to decrease, the gravity to becomes stronger enough (i.e. makes the specific weight appreciably different between the immediate fluid layers adjacent to the wall). The effects of buoyancy parameter are highly significant in the laminar flow within the boundary layer formed on a vertically moving cylinder. This is only achievable when the prescribed surface temperature (PST) and prescribed wall heat flux (WHF) are considered. It can be concluded that buoyancy parameter has a negligible positive effect on the local Nusselt number. This is only true when the magnitude of Prandtl number is small or prescribed wall heat flux (WHF) is considered. Sherwood number, Bejan Number, Entropy generation, Stanton Number and pressure gradient are increasing properties of buoyancy related parameter while concentration profiles, frictional force, and motile microorganism are decreasing properties.

<text>Louse (: lice) is the common name for any member of the clade Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless parasitic insects. Phthiraptera has variously been recognized as an order, infraorder, or a parvorder, as a result of developments in phylogenetic research.

Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, and bats. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.

Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, whereas sucking lice pierce the host&#x27;s skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs, called [[Head louse#Eggs/Nits|nits]], to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.
Genetic evidence indicates that lice are a highly modified lineage of Psocoptera (now called Psocodea), commonly known as booklice, barklice or barkflies. The oldest known fossil lice are from the Cretaceous.

Humans host two species of louse—the head louse and the body louse are subspecies of &quot;Pediculus humanus&quot;; and the pubic louse, &quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;. The body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.
Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as &quot;The Kilkenny Louse House&quot;, and novels such as James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke&#x27;s 1667 book, &quot;Micrographia&quot;.

==Morphology and diversity==

Lice are divided into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their nourishment from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host&#x27;s body. Many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co-evolved with it. In some cases, they live on only a particular part of the body. Some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host.

Sucking lice range in length from . They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no ocelli, and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their antennae are short with three to five segments, and their mouthparts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for piercing and sucking. There is a cibarial pump at the start of the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, containing a salivary canal (ventrally) and a food canal (dorsally). The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.

Chewing lice are also flattened and can be slightly larger than sucking lice, ranging in length from . They are similar to sucking lice in form but the head is wider than the thorax and all species have compound eyes. There are no ocelli and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The antennae have three to five segments and are slender in the suborder Ischnocera, but club-shaped in the suborder Amblycera. The legs are short and robust, and terminated by one or two claws. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die.
Lice are usually cryptically coloured to match the fur or feathers of the host. A louse&#x27;s colour varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker.

Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse&#x27;s egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts&#x27; hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.

Humans host three different kinds of lice: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice. Head lice and body lice are subspecies of &quot;Pediculus humanus&quot;, and pubic lice are a separate species, &quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;. Lice infestations can be controlled with lice combs, and medicated shampoos or washes.

==Ecology==

The average number of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an aggregated distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.
Host organisms that dive under water to feed on aquatic prey harbour fewer taxa of lice.
Bird taxa that are capable of exerting stronger antiparasitic defence—such as stronger T cell immune response or larger uropygial glands—harbour more taxa of Amblyceran lice than others.
Reductions in the size of host populations may cause a long-lasting reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.

Lice may reduce host life expectancy if the infestation is heavy, but most seem to have little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably an attempt by the birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.
Lice infestation is a disadvantage in the context of sexual rivalry.

==Evolution==
Phthiraptera lice are members of Psocodea (formerly Psocoptera), the order that contains booklice, barklice and barkflies. Within Psocodea, lice are within the suborder Troctomorpha, and most closely related to the family Liposcelididae. The oldest confirmed fossil louse is &quot;Archimenopon myanmarensis&quot;, an amblyceran from the Cretaceous amber from Myanmar. Another early representative of the group is a bird louse, &quot;Megamenopon rasnitsyni&quot;, from Eckfelder Maar, Germany, which dates to the Eocene, around 44 million years ago. &quot;Saurodectes vrsanskyi&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) Zaza Formation of Buryatia, Russia, has also been suggested to be a louse, but this is tentative.

Placental mammal lice had a single common ancestor that lived on Afrotheria with this arising from host-switching from an ancient avian host.

===Classification===
Phthiraptera is clearly a monophyletic grouping, united as the members are by a number of derived features including their parasitism on warm-blooded vertebrates and the combination of their metathoracic ganglia with their abdominal ganglia to form a single ventral nerve junction. The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders, the sucking lice (Anoplura) and the chewing lice (Mallophaga); however, subsequent classifications suggest that the Mallophaga are paraphyletic and four suborders were then recognized:

* Anoplura: sucking lice, occurring on mammals exclusively
* Rhynchophthirina: parasites of elephants and warthogs
* Ischnocera: mostly avian chewing lice, with one family parasitizing mammals
* Amblycera: a primitive suborder of chewing lice, widespread on birds, and also occurring on South American and Australian mammals

Upon finding that Phthiraptera was nested within Psocoptera, Phthiraptera, in 2021 de Moya et al. proposed reducing the rank of Phthiraptera to infraorder, and the four suborders to parvorder. These changes were accepted by Psocodea Species File and others, with the exception of placing Phthiraptera under the infraorder Nanopsocetae, as a parvorder, with the four subgroups listed above. These classifications are likely to change in the future as a result of ongoing phylogenetic research.

Nearly 5,000 species of louse have been identified, about 4,000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent in all the habitats that their host animals occupy. They are found even in the Antarctic, where penguins carry 15 species of lice (in the genera &quot;Austrogonoides&quot; and &quot;Nesiotinus&quot;). The oldest known record of the group is &quot;Megamenopon rasnitsyni&quot; from the Eocene of Germany, but it is essentially a modern form, belonging to Amblycera, so the group as a whole likely has an origin in the Mesozoic.

===Phylogeny===

Lice have been the subject of significant DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, &quot;Pediculus&quot; and &quot;Pthirus&quot;: head lice (&quot;Pediculus humanus capitis&quot;), body lice (&quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;), and pubic lice (&quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;). Human head and body lice (genus &quot;Pediculus&quot;) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus &quot;Pthirus&quot;) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that &quot;Pediculus&quot; and &quot;Pthirus&quot; are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between &quot;Pediculus&quot; and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, hostparasite cospeciation events are likely.

Genetic evidence suggests that human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus &quot;Pediculus&quot;, the divergence in &quot;Pthirus&quot; does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a &quot;Pthirus&quot; species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it is difficult to determine if a parasitehost switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).

Additionally, the DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and feed on the scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides an estimate of the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.

The mitochondrial genome of the human species of the body louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;), the head louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus capitis&quot;) and the pubic louse (&quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;) fragmented into a number of minichromosomes, at least seven million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice. Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in prehistory. The dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is the Out of Africa Hypothesis. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.

==In human culture==

===In social history===

Lice have been intimately associated with human society throughout history. In the Middle Ages, they were essentially ubiquitous. At the death of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1170, it was recorded that &quot;The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and the onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughing&quot;. The clergy often saw lice and other parasites as a constant reminder of human frailty and weakness. Monks and nuns would purposely ignore grooming themselves and suffer from infestations to express their religious devotion. A mediaeval treatment for lice was an ointment made from pork grease, incense, lead, and aloe.

Robert Hooke&#x27;s 1667 book, &quot;Micrographia: or some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses with observations and Inquiries thereupon&quot;, illustrated a human louse, drawn as seen down an early microscope.

Margaret Cavendish&#x27;s satirical &quot;The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World&quot; (1668) has &quot;Lice-men&quot; as &quot;mathematicians&quot;, investigating nature by trying to weigh the air like the real scientist Robert Boyle.

In 1935 the Harvard medical researcher Hans Zinsser wrote the book &quot;Rats, Lice and History&quot;, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view is that only the body louse can transmit the disease.

Soldiers in the trenches of the First World War suffered severely from lice, and the typhus they carried. The Germans boasted that they had lice under effective control, but themselves suffered badly from lice in the Second World War on the Eastern Front, especially in the Battle of Stalingrad. &quot;Delousing&quot; became a euphemism for the extermination of Jews in concentration camps such as Auschwitz under the Nazi regime.

In the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis, patients express a persistent irrational fear of animals such as lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with &quot;an unshakable false belief that live organisms are present in the skin&quot;.

===In science===

The human body louse &quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot; has (2010) the smallest insect genome known. This louse can transmit certain diseases while the human head louse (&quot;P. h. capitis&quot;), to which it is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.

===In literature and folklore===
James Joyce&#x27;s 1939 book &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; has the character Shem the Penman infested with &quot;foxtrotting fleas, the lieabed lice, ... bats in his belfry&quot;.

Clifford E. Trafzer&#x27;s &quot;A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe&quot; retells the story of Sinawavi (Coyote)&#x27;s love for Poowavi (Louse). Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world&#x27;s first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.

The Irish songwriter John Lyons (b. 1934) wrote the popular song &quot;The Kilkenny Louse House&quot;. The song contains the lines &quot;Well we went up the stairs and we put out the light, Sure in less than five minutes, I had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch&quot;. It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on &quot;From Puck to Appleby&quot; (2003), and the Dubliners on &quot;Double Dubliners&quot; (1972) among others.

Robert Burns dedicated a poem to the louse, inspired by witnessing one on a lady&#x27;s bonnet in church: &quot;Ye ugly, creepin, blastid wonner, Detested, shunn&#x27;d, by saint and sinner, How dare ye set your fit upon her, sae fine lady! Gae somewhere else, and seek your dinner on some poor body.&quot; John Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; mentioned the biblical plague of lice visited upon pharaoh: &quot;Frogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion, and filled all the land.&quot; John Ray recorded a Scottish proverb, &quot;Gie a beggar a bed and he&#x27;ll repay you with a Louse.&quot;
In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, Thersites compares Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon, to a louse: &quot;Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus.&quot;

=== Woodlouse ===
The name woodlouse or wood-louse is given to crustaceans of the suborder Oniscidea within the order Isopoda, unrelated to lice. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;″s earliest citation of this usage is from 1611.

<text>The Pequot () are a Native American people of Connecticut. The modern Pequot are members of the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, four other state-recognized groups in Connecticut including the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, or the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin. They historically spoke Pequot, a dialect of the Mohegan-Pequot language, which became extinct by the early 20th century. Some tribal members are undertaking revival efforts.

The Pequot and the Mohegan were formerly a single group, but the Mohegan split off in the 17th century as the Pequot came to control much of Connecticut. Simmering tensions with the New England Colonies led to the Pequot War of 1634–1638, which some historians consider to be a genocide under modern day terms, which dramatically reduced the population and influence of the Pequot; many members were killed, enslaved, or dispersed. Small numbers of Pequots remain in Connecticut, receiving reservations at Mashantucket in 1666 and at the Pawcatuck River in 1683; others lived in different areas and with other tribes. In the 18th century, some Christian Pequot joined members of several other groups to form the Brothertown Indians in western New Hampshire. They relocated to western New York in the 19th century, where they were allowed land by the Oneida people of the Iroquois League, and later to Wisconsin, where they were granted a reservation.

The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe received federal recognition in 1983 through a settlement of a land claim. In 1986, they founded the Foxwoods Resort Casino on their land. Located in proximity to the New York City metropolitan area, it has become one of the country&#x27;s most successful Native American casinos.

The Pawcatuck River Pequot formed the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is recognized by Connecticut but is not federally recognized. Additionally, Pequot descendants are enrolled in the federally recognized Mohegan Tribe, as well as the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation and Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation of Connecticut, and the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin, which also have degrees of state recognition. The Poospatuck Reservation on Long Island is home to a few hundred self-identified Pequot descendants.

==History==

===Etymology===
&quot;Pequot&quot; is an Algonquian word whose meaning is disputed among language specialists. Considerable scholarship on the Pequot claims that the name came from &quot;Pequttôog&quot;, meaning &quot;the destroyers&quot; or &quot;the men of the swamp&quot;. Frank Speck was a leading specialist of the Mohegan-Pequot language in the early twentieth century, and he believed that another term was more plausible, meaning &quot;the shallowness of a body of water&quot;, given that the Pequot territory was along the coast of Long Island Sound.

Historians have debated whether the Pequot migrated about 1500 from the upper Hudson River Valley toward central and eastern Connecticut. The theory of Pequot migration to the Connecticut River Valley can be traced to Rev. William Hubbard, who claimed in 1677 that the Pequot had invaded the region sometime before the establishment of Plymouth Colony, rather than originating in the region. In the aftermath of King Philip&#x27;s War, Hubbard detailed in his &quot;Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New-England&quot; the ferocity with which some of New England&#x27;s tribes responded to the English. Hubbard described the Pequot as &quot;foreigners&quot; to the region; not invaders from another shore, but &quot;from the interior of the continent&quot; who &quot;by force seized upon one of the goodliest places near the sea, and became a Terror to all their Neighbors.&quot;

Much of the archaeological, linguistic, and documentary evidence now available demonstrates that the Pequot were not invaders to the Connecticut River Valley but were indigenous in that area for thousands of years. By the time of the founding of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, the Pequot had already attained a position of political, military, and economic dominance in central and eastern Connecticut. They occupied the coastal area between the Niantic tribe of the Niantic River of Connecticut and the Narragansett in western Rhode Island. The Pequot numbered some 16,000 persons in the most densely inhabited portion of southern New England.

The smallpox epidemic of 1616–1619 killed many of the Native Americans of the eastern coast of New England, but it did not reach the Pequot, Niantic, and Narragansett tribes. In 1633, the Dutch established a trading post called the House of Good Hope at Hartford. They executed the principal Pequot &quot;sachem&quot; Tatobem because of a violation of an agreement. After the Pequot paid the Dutch a large ransom, they returned Tatobem&#x27;s body to his people. His successor was Sassacus.

In 1633, an epidemic devastated all of the region&#x27;s tribes, and historians estimate that the Pequot suffered the loss of 80 percent of their population. At the outbreak of the Pequot War, Pequot survivors may have numbered only about 3,000.

===Pequot War===
Members of the Pequot tribe killed a resident of Connecticut Colony in 1636, John Oldham, and war erupted as a result. The Mohegan and the Narragansett tribes sided with the colonists. Around 1,500 Pequot warriors were killed in battles or hunted down, and others were captured and distributed as slaves or household servants. A few escaped to join the Mohawk and the Niantic tribes on Long Island. Eventually, some returned to their traditional lands, where family groups of friendly Pequots had stayed. Of those enslaved, most were awarded to the allied tribes, but many were also sold as slaves in Bermuda. The Mohegans treated their Pequot captives so severely that officials of Connecticut Colony eventually removed them. Connecticut established two reservations for the Pequots in 1683: the Eastern Pequot Reservation in North Stonington, Connecticut and the Western Pequots (or Mashantucket Pequot Reservation) in Ledyard.

=== 19th century ===
The poor treatment the Pequot received at the hands of the colonists was remembered almost two centuries later by other Native American tribes such as some groups of Shawnees. It was commonly thought that they had disappeared entirely due to violence against Native Americans provoked by American colonists, although this was not true.

===Modern history===
The 1910 census numbered the Pequot population at 66, and they reached their lowest number several decades later. Pequot numbers grew significantly during the 1970s and 1980s, especially the Mashantucket Pequot tribe which opened a casino in the same timeframe, and tribal chairman Richard A. Hayward encouraged them to return to their tribal homeland. He worked for Federal recognition and economic development.

In 1976, the Pequots filed suit with the assistance of the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) and the Indian Rights Association against landowners and residents of North Stonington to get their land, which the Pequots claimed had been illegally sold in 1856 by the State of Connecticut, and they settled after seven years. The Connecticut Legislature passed legislation to petition the federal government to grant tribal recognition to the Mashantucket Pequots, and the &quot;Mashantucket Pequot Indian Land Claims Settlement Act&quot; was enacted by Congress and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 18, 1983. This settlement granted federal recognition to the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, enabling them to buy the land covered in the Settlement Act and place it in trust with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for reservation use. In 1986, they opened a bingo operation, followed by the first phase of Foxwoods Resort Casino in 1992. Revenue from the casino has enabled the development and construction of a cultural museum which opened on August 11, 1998, on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation where many members of the tribe continue to live.

The Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation was recognized in 2002. Since the 1930s, both Pequot tribes had serious tension over racial issues, with some people claiming that darker-skinned descendants should not be considered fully Pequot. Two groups of Eastern Pequots filed petitions for recognition with the BIA, and they agreed to unite to achieve recognition. The state immediately challenged the decision, and the Department of the Interior revoked their recognition in 2005. That same year, it revoked recognition for the Schaghticoke tribe who had gained recognition in 2004. The Connecticut state government and Congressional delegation opposed the BIA&#x27;s recognition because residents were worried that the newly recognized tribes would establish gaming casinos.

==Geography==
The 1130-member Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation has a reservation called &quot;Lantern Hill.&quot; The Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation is recognized by the state of Connecticut.

The 800+ Mashantucket Pequot or Western Pequot gained federal recognition in 1983 and have a reservation in Ledyard.

The Poospatuck Reservation on Long Island is also home to a few hundred self-identified Pequot descendants.

Nearly all individuals who are identified as Pequot live in the two above-named communities.

==Language==
Historically, the Pequots spoke a dialect of the Mohegan-Pequot language, an Eastern Algonquian language. The Treaty of Hartford concluded the Pequot War in 1637, when the colonists made speaking the language a capital offense. Within a generation or so, it became largely extinct. Pequot from both the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mashantucket Pequot now speak English as their first language.

In the 21st century, the Mashantucket Pequot are undertaking aggressive efforts to revive the language. They are conducting careful analysis of historical documents containing Pequot words and comparing them to extant closely related languages. So far, they have reclaimed more than 1,000 words, though that is a small fraction of what would be necessary for a functional language. The Mashantucket Pequots have begun offering language classes with the help of the Mashpee Wampanoag. The Wampanoag recently initiated the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project. The southern New England Indian communities participating in the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project are Mashpee Wampanoag, Aquinnah Wampanoag, Herring Pond Wampanoag, and Mashantucket Pequot.

==Notable Pequot==
* William Apess (1798–1839) was an ordained Methodist minister, writer, and temperance activist of Pequot and European descent; he was a political and religious leader in Massachusetts.
* Willy DeVille (1950–2009), rock and roll guitarist, songwriter and singer, was Pequot through his mother and maternal grandmother&#x27;s lineage. He explored his Pequot roots in his post-2000 works.

<text>The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation is a federally recognized American Indian tribe in the state of Connecticut. They are descended from the Pequot people, an Algonquian-language tribe that dominated the southern New England coastal areas, and they own and operate Foxwoods Resort Casino within their reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut. Foxwoods Resort Casino is one of the largest casinos in the world in terms of square footage, casino floor size, and number of slot machines, and it was one of the most economically successful in the United States until 2007, but it became deeply in debt by 2012 due to its expansion and changing conditions.

The tribe was federally recognized in 1983 through the Mashantucket Pequot Land Claims Settlement Act. The federal land claims suit was brought by the tribe against the State of Connecticut and the Federal government, charging that the tribe had been illegally deprived of its land through state actions that were not ratified by the Senate. As part of the settlement of this suit, Congress gave federal recognition to the tribe, in addition to approving financial compensation so that the tribe could repurchase lost land. Tribal membership is based on proven lineal descent of 11 Pequot families whose ancestors were listed in the 1900 US Census.

The Mashantucket Pequot tribe is one of two federally recognized tribes in Connecticut, the other being the Mohegan Indian Tribe.

==Geography==
The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation is located in Mashantucket, Connecticut, in southeastern Connecticut&#x27;s New London County near the Thames River. It is held in trust for the tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The tribe also owns land in the adjacent towns of Ledyard, Preston and North Stonington, as well as in New London.

==Demographics and membership==

Today, the Mashantucket Pequot population consists of more than 1100 enrolled members. As a federally recognized tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots have the authority to determine their membership criteria. The tribe requires its members to be of proven lineal descent from 11 Mashantucket Pequot ancestors listed in the U.S. censuses of 1900 and 1910. In 1996, the tribal membership voted to close enrollment, with the exception of children born to currently enrolled tribal members.

The 2000 census showed a resident population of 325 persons living on reservation land, 227 of whom identified themselves as American Indian, while others identify themselves as having more than one ethnicity, including non-Pequot spouses. Since that time, the tribe expanded reservation housing, and members continue to relocate to the reservation as housing becomes available.

==Government==

As of 2020, the Mashantucket Pequot Elders Council officers are:

*Chair—Marjorie Colebut-Jackson
*Vice-chair— Shirley &quot;Laughing Woman&quot; Patrick
*Secretary/Treasurer-Anthony Sebastian

The seven members of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council are:
*Chair—Rodney A. Butler
*Vice-chair—Latoya Cluff
*Secretary—Matthew Pearson 
*Treasurer— Merrill Reels
*Councilor—Daniel Menihan 
*Councilor—Crystal Whipple
*Councilor—Michele Scott

The current administration&#x27;s seven-member council has stated that the tribe&#x27;s priorities are protecting tribal sovereignty, focusing on the educational, emotional, and physical well-being of members, and working to leverage the tribe&#x27;s financial and economic strengths through partnership initiatives, both locally and abroad. Mashantucket Pequot&#x27;s local investments include the Lake of Isles golf course and the Spa at Norwich Inn, both of which have proven to be positive additions to local municipal tax bases.

Council members are elected by popular vote of the tribal membership to three-year, staggered terms. There are roughly 600 eligible voting members of the tribe, which numbered 1086 in 2018. Tribal Members must be at least 18 years old and in good standing with the tribe to be eligible to vote.

==Chairman==
*Richard Arthur Hayward (1975–1998)
*Kenneth M. Reels (1998–2003)
*Michael Thomas (2003–2009)
*Rodney Butler (2010–present)

==Economy==
The Mashantucket Pequots have owned and operated one of the largest resort casinos in the world since 1992. The University of Connecticut analyzed the Foxwoods casino&#x27;s effects on the Connecticut economy, and their report stated that it had a positive economic impact on the neighboring towns of Ledyard, Preston, and North Stonington, as well as the state of Connecticut, which has received more than $4 billion in slot revenue.

==History==
The Mashantucket Pequots are descendants of the historic Pequot tribe, an Algonquian-speaking people who dominated the coastal area from the Niantic River of Connecticut east to the Pawcatuck River which forms a border with Rhode Island, and south to Long Island Sound. A second descendant group is the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is not recognized by the Federal government.

During the colonial years, colonists recorded inter-tribal warfare, shifts in boundaries, and changes in power among the tribes. Scholars believe that the Pequots migrated from the upper Hudson River Valley into central and eastern Connecticut around 1500. William Hubbard wrote &quot;Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New-England&quot; in 1667 to explore the ferocity with which the Pequot tribe had attacked the colonists. He described them as invaders from &quot;the interior of the continent&quot; who &quot;by force seized upon one of the places near the sea, and became a Terror to all their Neighbors.&quot; Contemporary scholars suggest that archaeological, linguistic, and documentary evidence show that the Pequots were indigenous for centuries in the Connecticut Valley before the arrival of settlers.

By the time that Plymouth Colony and the Massachusetts Bay colony were being established, the Pequots had established military dominance among Indian tribes in central and eastern Connecticut. They numbered some 16,000 in the most densely inhabited portion of southern New England. The smallpox epidemic of 1616–19 killed roughly 90-percent of the Indians on the eastern coast of New England, but it failed to reach the Pequot, Niantic and Narragansett tribes, and this assisted the Pequots in their rise to dominance. But the Massachusetts smallpox epidemic in 1633 devastated the region&#x27;s Indian population, and historians estimate that the Pequots suffered the loss of 80-percent of their entire population. By the outbreak of the Pequot War in 1637, their numbers may have been reduced to about 3,000 in total.

===Pequot War===
In 1637, Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay colonies overwhelmed the Pequots during the Pequot War. This followed the Indians&#x27; attack on Wethersfield, Connecticut that left several settlers dead. The military force of the two colonies was led by John Mason and John Underhill, and they launched an assault on the Pequot stronghold at Mystic, Connecticut, killing a significant portion of the Pequot population.

The colonists enslaved some of the surviving Pequots, sending some to the West Indies as labor on sugar cane plantations, putting others to indentured servitude as household servants in New England. Most of the survivors, however, were transferred to the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes. A few Pequots returned to the reservation years later, and they intermarried with the colonists. Many of the Pequot descendants, while multi-racial, retained a sense of culture and continuity.
===Present day===
The Mashantucket Pequot reservation was created by the Connecticut Colony in 1666, but only 13 people lived on the reservation by the time of the 1910 United States census. Elizabeth George (1894–1973) was one of the last Pequot living on the reservation and, when she died in 1973, the federal government started planning to reclaim the land which they presumed would be vacated upon the deaths of the last remaining Pequot residents.

Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Hayward, a grandson of Elizabeth George, led the Tribe&#x27;s efforts in filing a federal land claims suit against the state of Connecticut which challenged the state&#x27;s sale of of reservation lands—an event which had occurred more than 100 years earlier in 1855. The State of Connecticut agreed with the Tribe, and the US Department of Justice entered the suit, as it dealt with Federal issues and the legality of the state action.

On October 18, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement Act which included Federal recognition of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. They were the eighth American Indian tribe to gain Federal recognition through an act of Congress rather than through the administrative process of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Department of Interior. The Mashantucket Pequots have since added to their land holdings by purchase and placed the additional lands into trust with the BIA on behalf of the tribe. As of the 2000 census, their total land area was .

In 1994 it purchased, and later developed further, what is now known as The Spa at Norwich Inn in Norwich, Connecticut.

==Controversies==
The Bureau of Indian Affairs had established criteria by which tribes seeking recognition had to document cultural and community continuity, a political organization, and related factors. Among the criteria are having to prove continuous existence as a recognized community since 1900, with internal government and tribal rules for membership.

In 1993, Donald Trump said that the owners of Foxwoods casino &quot;did not look like real Indians.&quot; He became a key investor with the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were seeking federal recognition.

In his book &quot;Without Reservation: The Making of America&#x27;s Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World&#x27;s Largest Casino&quot; (2001), Jeff Benedict argues that the Mashantuckets are not descended from the historical Pequot tribe, but rather from the Narragansett tribe. Spokesmen for the Pequots denounced the book and asserted that Benedict&#x27;s genealogical research was inherently flawed, as it failed to reflect the correct descendant lineages for the Mashantucket Pequot people identified on the 1900 and 1910 U.S. Censuses. Laurence Hauptman argued with Benedict&#x27;s assertions on the genealogy of current members, and anthropologist Katherine A. Spilde also criticized it.

==Tribal membership rules==
The Mashantucket Pequot tribe receives numerous requests from individuals applying for admission as members. They base tribal membership on an individual proving descent, by recognized genealogical documentation, from one or more members of eleven families included on the 1900 U.S. census of the tribe.

Each federally recognized tribe has the authority to set its own membership/citizenship rules. Their descent rules are similar to the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s reliance on proven direct descent from those Cherokee listed in the early 20th-century Dawes Rolls. CBS News reported in May 2000 that the tribal membership had voted to drop the requirement that tribal applicants have a minimum percentage of Mashantucket Pequot blood. However, the tribe has since begun to require genetic testing of newborn children whose parents are tribal members, to establish maternity and paternity.

==Foxwoods Resort Casino==

In 1986, Skip Hayward and financial backers built a high-stakes bingo hall on reservation land, and later they added other facilities. In 1992, the Mashantucket Pequots opened Foxwoods casino, which is now one of the largest casinos in the world. Adjacent to Foxwoods is the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center which interprets Pequot history and culture. The museum hosts local and international indigenous artists and musicians, as well as mounting changing exhibits of artifacts throughout the year.

<text>The Mallophaga are a possibly paraphyletic section of lice, known as chewing lice, biting lice, or bird lice, containing more than 3000 species. These lice are external parasites that feed mainly on birds, although some species also feed on mammals. They infest both domestic and wild mammals and birds, and cause considerable irritation to their hosts. They have paurometabolis or incomplete metamorphosis.

==Characteristics==
About 3000 species of Mallophaga are in the world. They are easily identifiable by their heads, which are wider than their prothoraces. Species that feed on birds usually have two claws at the tip of each tarsus, while those that feed on mammals usually have only one claw.

Mallophaga have mandibulate mouthparts which are located on the ventral side of their heads. They use these mouthparts to feed on feathers, hair, and epidermal skin scales. Some species also use these mouthparts to feed on blood, which they obtain by piercing the pulp of young feathers or by gnawing through the skin.

==Lifecycle==
Mallophaga develop by gradual metamorphosis. Females typically lay 150–300 eggs over an interval of 2–3 weeks. The eggs, commonly known as nits, are oblong and around 1 mm long. The eggs are glued to the hairs or feathers of the host with a secretion from the female accessory glands. The eggs typically hatch several days or up to three weeks from the time they are laid. The nymphs that hatch from the eggs resemble the adults except for their smaller size and lighter color. These nymphs go through three nymphal instars during a 2–3-week period. After these three instars, they are considered adults. Most adult species are light tan to brown in color and are usually 1–4 mm in length, although some livestock species can grow to be 5–7 mm, and some wild bird species can even get to 10 mm.

Mallophaga are often adapted to live on a specific part of their host and typically spend their entire lives on a single host. They can only survive for about three days after their host has died, and they typically use phoresis, which is hitching a ride from a fly, as an attempt to reach a new host. Mallophaga may also use the phoresis to spread to a new host even if the present one is still alive.

<doc id="58294" wikidata="Q219205" url="?curid=58294" title="Hmong people">
<text>The Hmong people (RPA: , CHV: &quot;Hmôngz&quot;, Nyiakeng Puachue: , Pahawh Hmong: , , ) are an indigenous group in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In China, the Hmong people are classified as a sub-group of the Miao people. The modern Hmong reside mainly in Southwestern China and Mainland Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. There are also diaspora communities in the United States, Australia, and South America.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Hmong&quot; is the English pronunciation of the Hmong&#x27;s native name. It is a singular and plural noun (e.g., Japanese, French, etc.). Very little is known about the native Hmong name as it is not mentioned in Chinese historical records, since the Han identified the Hmong as Miao. The meaning of it is debatable and no one is sure of its origin, although it can be traced back to several provinces in China. However, Hmong Americans and Hmong Laotians often associate it with &quot;Free&quot; and/or &quot;Hmoov&quot; (Fate); it serves as a reminder to them of their history of fighting oppression.

Before the 1970s, the term &quot;Miao or Meo&quot; (i.e. barbarians, wild, seedlings, and even &quot;Sons of the Soil&quot;) was used in reference to the Hmong. In the 1970s, Dr. Yang Dao, a Hmong American scholar, who at the time was the head of the Human Resource Department of the Ministry of Planning in the Royal Lao Government of Laos, advocated for the term &quot;Hmong&quot; with the support of clan leaders and General Vang Pao. Yang Dao had insisted that the terms &quot;Meo&quot; and &quot;Miao&quot; were both unacceptable as his people had always called themselves by the name &quot;Hmong,&quot; which he defined as &quot;free men&quot;. Surrounding countries began to use the term &quot;Hmong&quot; after the U.S. Department of State used it during Immigration screening in Thailand&#x27;s Ban Vinai Refugee Camp. In 1994, Pobzeb Vang registered the term &quot;Hmong&quot; with the United Nations, making it the proper term to identify the Hmong people internationally.

Soon after, there was a political push from Hmong American politicians and activists to replace the term Miao with the term Hmong in China with little to no success. To date, China is the only country that does not recognize the term Hmong. Rather, they are still categorized under the umbrella term Miáo () along with three other indigenous groups of people. Historically, the term Miao carried strong pejorative connotations in both China and Southeast Asia. In modern times, however, it has lost such negative connotations in China and has since been officially recognized as an ethnicity, which includes the Hmong. The Hmong in China are often happy or proud to be known as Miao while most Hmong outside China find it offensive.

Little is known about the origin of the Miao term and the people it referenced historically, since the Han used it loosely to identify non-Han in Southern China until the Tang Dynasty when evidence of its association with the Hmong became more apparent. Its origin can be dated before the Qin dynasty (221 BCE). Thereafter it was perceived as barbaric, and resurfaced more often in Chinese historical records during the Miao&#x27;s rebellions against the Ming and Qing dynasties between the 1300s and early 1900s that are still chanted by guides in most Hmong funerals today when guiding the spirits of the deceased individuals to their origins so they can reincarnate. The term Miao was more of a stereotype such as uncivilized, uncooperative, uncultivated, harmful, and inhumane than a name of an ethnic group and was used in daily conversations as an expression for ugliness and primitivity.

In Southeast Asia, Hmong people are referred to by other names, including: Vietnamese , or ; Lao () or (); Thai () or (); and Burmese (). With a slight change in accent, the word &quot;Meo&quot; in Lao and Thai can be pronounced to mean
&quot;cat&quot;. The term Maew and Meo derived from the term Miao.

==Origins==

===Genetic origins===

A DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes. The Hmong–Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand; they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation.
According to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that they have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000 years. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong–Mien–speaking populations supports the existence of southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time, although it has been shown that Hmong-speaking populations had comparatively more contact with northern East Asians than had the Mien. Overall, Hmong–Mien cluster with Tai-Kadai and Sino-Tibetan speakers compared to other Chinese populations. However, there is evidence that Hmong-Mien groups show stronger affinities with Austroasiatic groups, with Tai-Kadai ancestry peaking in groups that live in southeastern China.

=== Homeland ===
The most likely homeland of the Hmong–Mien languages is in southern China between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers. In particular, southwestern China was suggested to the original homeland of Hmong-Mien peoples.

Migration of people speaking these languages from southern China to Southeast Asia took place ca. 1600–1700 CE. Ancient DNA evidence suggests that the ancestors of the speakers of the Hmong–Mien languages were a population genetically distinct from that of the Tai–Kadai and Austronesian language populations at a location on the Yangtze River. Recent Y-DNA phylogeny evidence supports the theory that people who speak the Hmong–Mien languages are descended from a population that is distantly related to those who now speak the Mon-Khmer languages. Another study shows that the core Hmong-Mien population in southern China derived most of their ancestry from Neolithic Mekong (32.3%–35.3%) than Late Neolithic Fujian (23.7%–26.4%).

The time of Proto-Hmong–Mien was estimated to be about 2500 BP (500 BCE) by Sagart, Blench, and Sanchez-Mazas using traditional methods employing many lines of evidence, and about 4243 BP by the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP), an experimental algorithm for automatic generation of phonologically based phylogenies.

==History==
===China===

Hmong traditions and legends indicate that they originated near the Yellow River region of northern China, but this is not substantiated by any scientific evidence. According to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that they have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000 years. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong–Mien–speaking populations supports the southern origins of maternal lineages even farther back in time, although it has been shown that Hmong-speaking populations had comparatively more contact with northern East Asians than the Mien. A rare haplogroup, O3d, was found at the Daxi culture in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, indicating that the Daxi people might be the ancestors of modern Hmong–Mien populations, which show only small traces of O3d today.

In 2011, Hmong DNA was sampled and found to contain 7.84% D-M15 and 6%N(Tat) DNA. The research found a common ancestry between Hmong–Mien peoples and Mon-Khmer groups dating to the Last Glacial Maximum, approximately 15,000 to 18,000 years ago.

In 2021, researchers found that a 500 year old &#x27;GaoHuaHua&#x27; population in Guangxi contributed to the ancestries of modern Hmong-Mien groups in Guangxi. The &#x27;GaoHuaHua&#x27; population was modeled as having 66% Dushan-related ancestry and 34% Bushan-related ancestry. They also received Northeast Asian-related Shandong ancestry, which emerged 9,500–7,700 years ago.

The author of &quot;Guoyu&quot;, written in the 4th to 5th century, considered Chi You&#x27;s Jiu Li tribe to be related to the ancient ancestors of the Hmong, the San-Miao people. Chi You is the Hmong ancestral God of War. Today, a statue of Chi You has been erected in the town named Zhuolu.

Conflict between the Hmong of southern China and newly arrived Han settlers increased during the 18th century under repressive economic and cultural reforms imposed by the Qing dynasty. This led to armed conflict and large-scale migrations well into the late 19th century, the period during which many Hmong people emigrated to Southeast Asia. However, the migration process had begun as early as the late 17th century, before the time of major social unrest, when small groups went in search of better agricultural opportunities.

The Hmong people were subjected to persecution and genocide by the Qing dynasty government. Arthur A. Hansen wrote: &quot;In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, while the Hmong lived in south-western China, their Manchu overlords had labeled them &#x27;Miao&#x27; and targeted them for genocide.&quot;

Since 1949, the Miao people () has been an official term for one of the 56 official minority groups recognized by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Miao live mainly in southern China, in the provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong, and Hubei. According to the 2000 census, the number of &#x27;Miao&#x27; in China was estimated to be about 9.6 million. The Miao nationality includes Hmong people as well as other culturally and linguistically related ethnic groups who do not call themselves Hmong. These include the Hmu, Kho (Qho) Xiong, and A-Hmao. The settling region of the Hmong in China is further western than that of the other groups, mainly in Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guangxi.

===Vietnam===
The Hmong or Miao began to migrate to Tonkin (Northern Vietnam) in 19th century, where they struggled to establish their community on the high mountains. They recognized the Tai-speaking overlords of valleys, who were vassals of the Vietnamese court in Hue. The Hue court of Tu Duc at the time was facing crisis after crisis, unable to retake control of Tonkin and the border regions. The Taiping rebellion and other Chinese rebels spilled over into Vietnam and had caused anarchy; the Hmong communities thrived on either sides of the Red River, harmonizing with other ethnic groups, and were largely ignored by all factions.

During the colonization of &#x27;Tonkin&#x27; (North Vietnam) between 1883 and 1954, a number of Hmong decided to join the Vietnamese Nationalists and Communists, while many Christianized Hmong sided with the French. After the Viet Minh victory, numerous pro-French Hmong had to fall back to Laos and South Vietnam.

===Laos===
After decades of distant relations with the Lao kingdoms, closer relations between the French military and some Hmong on the Xieng Khouang plateau arose after World War II. There, a rivalry between members of the Lo and Ly clans developed into open enmity, also affecting those connected with them by kinship. Clan leaders took opposite sides; as a consequence, several thousand Hmong participated in the fighting against the Pathet Lao Communists, while almost as many were enrolled in the communist Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army. In Laos, numerous Hmong genuinely tried to avoid getting involved in the conflict in spite of the extremely difficult material conditions under which they lived during wartime.

====The U.S. and the Laotian Civil War====
In the early 1960s, partially as a result of the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division began to recruit, train and lead the indigenous Hmong people in Laos to fight against North Vietnamese Army divisions that were invading Laos during the Vietnam War. This &quot;Secret Army&quot; was organized into various mobile regiments and divisions, including Special Guerrilla Units, all of whom were led by General Vang Pao. An estimated sixty-percent (60%) of Hmong men in Laos joined up.

While there were Hmong soldiers who fought with the communist Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese, others were recognized for serving in combat against the NVA and the Pathet Lao, helping block Hanoi&#x27;s Ho Chi Minh trail inside Laos and rescuing downed American pilots. Though their role was generally kept secret in the early stages of the conflict, they made great sacrifices to help the U.S.

Thousands of economic and political refugees have resettled in Western countries in two separate waves. The first wave resettled in the late 1970s, mostly in the United States after the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao takeovers of the pro-U.S. governments in South Vietnam and Laos respectively. The Lao Veterans of America, and Lao Veterans of America Institute, helped to assist in the resettlement of many Laotian and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in the United States, especially former Hmong veterans and their family members who served in the &quot;U.S. Secret Army&quot; in Laos during the Vietnam War.

====Hmong Lao resistance====


For many years, the Neo Hom political movement played a key role in resistance to the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army in Laos following the U.S. withdrawal in 1975; Vang Pao played a significant role in this movement. Additionally, a spiritual leader, Zong Zoua Her, as well as other Hmong leaders, including Pa Kao Her or Pa Khao Her, rallied some of their followers in a factionalized guerrilla resistance movement called ChaoFa (RPA: Cob Fab, Pahawh Hmong: ). These events led to the yellow rain controversy when the United States accused the Soviet Union of supplying and using chemical weapons in this conflict.

Small groups of Hmong people, many second or third generation descendants of former CIA soldiers, remain internally displaced in remote parts of Laos, in fear of government reprisals. Faced with continuing military operations against them by the government and a scarcity of food, some groups have begun coming out of hiding, while others have sought asylum in Thailand and other countries. Hmong in Laos, in particular, developed a stronger and deeper anti-Vietnamese sentiment than their Vietnamese Hmong cousins, due to historic persecution perpetrated by the Vietnamese against them.

====Controversy over repatriation====

In June 1991, after talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to the repatriation of over 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including tens of thousands of Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily. Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, coercive measures and forced repatriation was used to send thousands of Hmong back to the places they had fled. Of the Hmong who did return to Laos, some quickly escaped back to Thailand, describing discrimination and brutal treatment at the hands of Lao authorities.

In the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, The Center for Public Policy Analysis, a non-governmental public policy research organization, and its executive director, Philip Smith, played a key role in raising awareness in the U.S. Congress and policy-making circles in Washington, D.C. about the plight of the Hmong and Laotian refugees in Thailand and Laos. The CPPA, backed by a bipartisan coalition of members of the U.S. Congress and human rights organizations, conducted numerous research missions to the Hmong and Laotian refugee camps along the Mekong River in Thailand, as well as the Buddhist temple of Wat Tham Krabok.

Amnesty International, the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., the United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. (led by Dr. Pobzeb Vang Vang Pobzeb, and later Vaughn Vang) and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights organizations joined the opposition to forced repatriation.

Although some accusations of forced repatriation were denied, thousands of Hmong people refused to return to Laos. In 1996, as the deadline for the closure of Thai refugee camps approached, under mounting political pressure, the U.S. agreed to resettle Hmong refugees who passed a new screening process. Around 5,000 Hmong people who were not resettled at the time of the camp closures sought asylum at Wat Tham Krabok, a Buddhist monastery in central Thailand where more than 10,000 Hmong refugees were already living. The Thai government attempted to repatriate these refugees, but the Wat Tham Krabok Hmong refused to leave and the Lao government refused to accept them, claiming they were involved in the illegal drug trade and were of non-Lao origin.

In 2003, following threats of forcible removal by the Thai government, the U.S., in a significant victory for the Hmong, agreed to accept 15,000 of the refugees. Several thousand Hmong people, fearing forced repatriation to Laos if they were not accepted for resettlement in the U.S., fled the camp to live elsewhere within Thailand where a sizable Hmong population has been present since the 19th century. In 2004 and 2005, thousands of Hmong fled from the jungles of Laos to a temporary refugee camp in the Thai province of Phetchabun.

The European Union, UNHCHR, and international groups have since spoken out about the forced repatriation.

====Alleged plot to overthrow the government of Laos====
On 4 June 2007, as part of an investigation labeled Operation Tarnished Eagle, U.S. federal courts ordered warrants issued for the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of federal Neutrality Acts and for multiple weapons charges. The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, in order to buy and smuggle into Thailand in June 2007, where they were intended to be used by Hmong resistance forces in Laos. Out of the 9 arrested, one was an American, Harrison Jack, a 1968 West Point graduate and retired Army infantry officer who allegedly attempted to recruit Special Operations veterans to act as mercenaries.

To obtain the weapons, Jack allegedly met unknowingly with undercover U.S. federal agents posing as weapons dealers, prompting the warrants, part of a long-running investigation into the activities of the U.S.-based Hmong leadership and its supporters.

On 15 June, the defendants were indicted by a grand jury; a warrant was also issued for the arrest of an 11th man allegedly involved in the plot. Simultaneous raids of the defendants&#x27; homes and work locations, involving over 200 federal, state and local law enforcement officials, were conducted in approximately 15 U.S. cities in Central and Southern California.

Multiple protest rallies in support of the suspects, designed to raise awareness of the treatment of Hmong peoples in the jungles of Laos, took place in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Alaska. Several of Vang Pao&#x27;s high-level supporters in the U.S. criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants, arguing that Vang was a historically important American ally and a valued leader of U.S. and foreign-based Hmong. Calls to Californian Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and President George W. Bush to pardon the defendants went unanswered pending a conclusion to the large, ongoing federal investigation.

On 18 September 2009, the U.S. federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing that the federal government was permitted to consider &quot;the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted&quot;. On 10 January 2011, after Vang Pao&#x27;s death, the federal government dropped all charges against the remaining defendants saying, &quot;Based on the totality of the circumstances in the case, the government believes, as a discretionary matter, that continued prosecution of defendants is no longer warranted.&quot;

===Thailand===

The presence of Hmong settlements in Thailand is documented from the end of the 19th century on. Initially, the Siamese paid little attention to them. But in the early 1950s, the state suddenly took a number of initiatives aimed at establishing links. Decolonization and nationalism were gaining momentum in the peninsula and wars of independence were raging. Armed opposition to the state in northern Thailand, triggered by outside influence, started in 1967 while again many Hmong refused to take sides in the conflict. Communist guerrilla warfare stopped by 1982 as a result of an international concurrence of events that rendered it pointless. Priority has since been given by the Thai state to sedentarizing the mountain population, introducing commercially viable agricultural techniques and national education, with the aim of integrating these non-Tai animists within the national identity.

===In the United States===

Many Hmong refugees resettled in the United States after the Vietnam War. Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum at that time under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had emigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao&#x27;s secret army. It was not until the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families were scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington State and Oregon. Smaller, but still sizeable communities also formed in Massachusetts (Lowell), Michigan (Detroit), Montana (Missoula) and Alaska (Anchorage).

==Culture==
Hmong people have their own terms for their cultural divisions. &quot;Hmong Der&quot; (Hmoob Dawb), and &quot;Hmong Leng&quot; (Hmoob Leeg) are the terms for two of the largest groups in the United States and Southeast Asia. These subgroups are also known as the White Hmong, and Blue or Green Hmong, respectively. These names originate from the color and designs of women&#x27;s dresses in each respective group, with the White Hmong distinguished by the white dresses women wear on special occasions, and the Blue/Green Hmong by the blue batiked dresses. The name and pronunciation &quot;Hmong&quot; is exclusively used by the White Hmong to refer to themselves, and many dictionaries use only the White Hmong dialect.

In the Romanized Popular Alphabet, developed in the 1950s in Laos, these terms are written &quot;Hmoob Dawb&quot; (White Hmong) and &quot;Hmoob Leeg&quot; (Green Hmong). The final consonants indicate with which of the eight lexical tones the word is pronounced.

White Hmong and Green Hmong speak mutually intelligible dialects of the Hmong language, with some differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. One of the most characteristic differences is the use of the voiceless /m̥/ in White Hmong, indicated by a preceding &quot;H&quot; in Romanized Popular Alphabet. Voiceless nasals are not found in the Green Hmong dialect. Hmong groups are often named after the dominant colors or patterns of their traditional clothing, style of head-dress, or the provinces from which they come.

===Vietnam and Laos===
The Hmong groups in Vietnam and Laos, from the 18th century to the present day, are known as Black Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Dub&quot;), Striped Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Txaij&quot;), White Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Dawb&quot;), Hmong Leng (&quot;Hmoob Leeg&quot;) and Green Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Ntsuab&quot;). In other places in Asia, groups are also known as Black Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Dub&quot; or &quot;Hmong Dou&quot;), Striped Hmong (&quot;Hmoob Txaij&quot; or &quot;Hmoob Quas Npab&quot;), Hmong Shi, Hmong Pe, Hmong Pua, and Hmong Xau, Hmong Xanh (Green Hmong), Hmong Do (Red Hmong), Na Mieo and various other subgroups. These include the Flower Hmong or the Variegated Hmong (&quot;Hmong Lenh&quot; or &quot;Hmong Hoa&quot;), so named because of their bright, colorful embroidery work (called &quot;pa ndau&quot; or &quot;paj ntaub&quot;, literally &quot;flower cloth&quot;).


===Hmong/Mong controversy===

When Western authors first came in contact with Hmong people in the 18th century, they referred to them by writing ethnonyms which were previously assigned to them by the Chinese (i.e., Miao, or variants). This practice continued into the 20th century. Even ethnographers studying the Hmong people in Southeast Asia often referred to them as Meo, a corruption of Miao applied by Thai and Lao people to the Hmong. Although &quot;Meo&quot; was an official term, it was often used as an insult against the Hmong people, and it is considered to be derogatory.

The issue came to a head during the passage of California State Assembly Bill (AB) 78, in the 2003–2004 season. Introduced by Doua Vu and Assembly Member Sarah Reyes, District 31 (Fresno), the bill encouraged changes in secondary education curriculum to include information about the Secret War and the role of Hmong people in the war. Furthermore, the bill called for the use of oral histories and first-hand accounts by Hmong people who had participated in the war and were caught up in its aftermath. Originally, the language of the bill mentioned only &quot;Hmong&quot; people, intending to include the entire community. Several Mong Leng activists, led by Dr. Paoze Thao (Professor of Linguistics and Education at California State University, Monterey Bay), drew attention to the problems associated with omitting &quot;Mong&quot; from the language of the bill. They noted that despite nearly equal numbers of Hmong Der and Mong Leng in the United States, resources are disproportionately allocated to the Hmong Der community. This not only includes scholarly research, but also the translation of materials, including the curriculum proposed by the bill. Despite these arguments, &quot;Mong&quot; was not added to the bill. In the version of the bill that was passed by the assembly, &quot;Hmong&quot; was replaced by &quot;Southeast Asians,&quot; a broader and more inclusive term.

Dr. Paoze Thao and some others strongly feel that &quot;Hmong&quot; can only be used in reference to Hmong Der people because it does not include &quot;Mong&quot; Leng people. He feels that the use of &quot;Hmong&quot; in reference to both groups perpetuates the marginalization of the Mong Leng language and culture. Thus, he advocates the use of &quot;Hmong&quot; and &quot;Mong&quot; in reference to the entire ethnic group. Other scholars, including anthropologist Dr. Gary Yia Lee (a Hmong Der person), suggests that for the past 30 years, &quot;Hmong&quot; has been used in reference to the entire community and as a result, the inclusion of Mong Leng people is understandable. Some argue that such distinctions create unnecessary divisions within the global community, arguing that the use of these distinctions will only confuse non-Hmong and Mong people who are both trying to learn more about Hmong and Mong history and culture.

As a compromise alternative, multiple iterations of &quot;Hmong&quot; have been proposed. A Hmong theologian, Rev. Dr. Paul Joseph T. Khamdy Yang has proposed the use of the term &quot;HMong&quot; in reference to the &quot;Hmong&quot; and the &quot;Mong&quot; communities by capitalizing the H and the M. The ethnologist Jacques Lemoine has also begun to use the term (H)mong in reference to the entirety of the Hmong and Mong communities.

===Hmong and Miao===
Some non-Chinese Hmong advocate for the term &#x27;Hmong&#x27; to be used not only to designate their dialect group They generally claim that the word &quot;Miao&quot; or &quot;Meo&quot; is a derogatory term, with connotations of barbarism, that probably should not be used at all. The term was later adopted by Tai-speaking groups in Southeast Asia where it took on especially insulting associations for Hmong people despite its official status.

In modern China, the term &quot;Miao&quot; does not carry these negative associations, and people of the various sub-groups that constitute this officially recognized nationality freely identify themselves as Miao or Chinese, typically reserving more specific ethnonyms for intra-ethnic communication. During the struggle for political recognition after 1949, it was members of these ethnic minorities who campaigned for identification under the umbrella term &quot;Miao&quot;taking advantage of its familiarity and associations of historical political oppression.

Contemporary transnational interactions between Hmong in the West and Miao groups in China, following the 1975 Hmong emigration, led to the development of a global Hmong identity that includes linguistically and culturally related minorities in China with no previous ethnic affiliation. Scholarly and commercial exchanges, increasingly made over the internet, have also resulted in an exchange of terminology, including some Hmong people accepting the designation &quot;Miao&quot; after visiting China and some nationalist non-Hmong Miao peoples identifying as Hmong. Such realignments of identity, while largely the concern of economically elite community leaders reflects a trend towards the interchangeability of the terms &quot;Hmong&quot; and &quot;Miao&quot;.

==Diaspora==
Linguistic data shows that the Hmong of the peninsula stem from the Miao of southern China as one among a set of ethnic groups belonging to the Hmong–Mien language family. Linguistically and culturally speaking, the Hmong and the other sub-groups of the Miao have little in common.

Vietnam, where their presence is attested from the late 18th century onwards and characterized with both assimilation, cooperation and hostility, is likely to be the first Southeastern Eurasian country into which the Hmong migrated. At the 2019 national census, there were 1,393,547 Hmong living in Vietnam, the vast majority of them in the north of the country. The traditional trade in coffin wood with China and cultivation of the opium poppy – not prohibited in Vietnam until 1993 – long guaranteed a regular cash income. Today, cash cropping is the main economic activity. As in China and Laos, Hmong participate to a certain degree in local and regional administration. In the late 1990s, several thousands of Hmong started moving to the Central Highlands and some crossed the border into Cambodia, constituting the first attested presence of Hmong settlers in that country.

In 2015, the Hmong in Laos numbered 595,028. Hmong settlement there is nearly as ancient as in Vietnam.

After the 1975 Communist victory, thousands of Hmong from Laos had to seek refuge abroad (see Laos below). Approximately 30 percent of the Hmong have left, although the only concrete figure we have is that of 116,000 Hmong from Laos and Vietnam together seeking refuge in Thailand up to 1990.

In 2002 the Hmong in Thailand numbered 151,080.

Myanmar most likely includes a modest number of Hmong (perhaps around 2,500) but no reliable census has been conducted there recently.

As result of refugee movements in the wake of the Indochina Wars (1946–1975), in particular, in Laos, the largest Hmong community to settle outside Asia went to the United States where approximately 100,000 individuals had already arrived by 1990. By the same date, 10,000 Hmong had migrated to France, including 1,400 in French Guiana; Canada admitted 900 individuals, while another 360 went to Australia, 260 to China, and 250 to Argentina. Over the following years and until the definitive closure of the last refugee camps in Thailand in 1998, additional numbers of Hmong have left Asia, but the definitive figures are still to be produced.
Approximately 5% of the Hmong population currently lives outside of Asia, with the United States home to the largest Hmong diaspora community. The 2008 census counted 171,316 people solely of Hmong ancestry, and 221,948 persons of at least partial Hmong ancestry. Other countries with significant populations include:
* France: 15,000
* Australia: 2,000
* French Guiana: 1,500
* Canada: 835
* Argentina: 600

The Hmong population within the United States is centered in the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota) and California.

===Vietnam===

Hmong people in Vietnam have been perceived differently by various modern political organizations and in different historical periods. Since the Hmong are an ethnic minority in Vietnam, their loyalty toward the Vietnamese state has been frequently questioned by the state. However, many Hmong in Vietnam are fiercely loyal, regardless of the current ideologies of the government; the Hmong in Laos and Cambodia are the most supportive of active resistance. These tend to be Hmong Christians that have been targeted by all three Vietnamese governments. The Hmong in Vietnam also receive cultural and political incentives from the government, which led to the Vietnamese Hmong further diverging from the Laotian Hmong, since the latter are strongly anti-Vietnamese due to the Secret War and Communism.

===Laos===

There are 595,028 Hmong people in Laos. They mainly live in northern regions.

===Thailand===
The Hmong presence in Thailand dates back to the turn of the 20th century when families migrated from China through Laos and Burma, according to most authors. A relatively small population, they still formed dozens of villages and hamlets throughout the northern provinces. The Hmong were registered by the state as the Meo hill tribe. Then, more Hmong migrated from Laos to Thailand following the victory of the Pathet Lao in 1975. While some ended up in refugee camps, others settled in mountainous areas among more ancient Hill Tribes.

===Americas===

Many Hmong refugees resettled in the United States after the Vietnam War. Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had emigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao&#x27;s secret army. It was not until the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, 260,073 Hmong people reside in the United States, the majority of whom live in California (91,224), then Minnesota (66,181), and Wisconsin (49,240), an increase from 186,310 in 2000. 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity. The vast majority of part-Hmong are under 10 years old.

In terms of cities and towns, the largest Hmong-American community is in St. Paul (29,662), followed by Fresno (24,328), Sacramento (16,676), Milwaukee (10,245), and Minneapolis (7,512).

There are smaller Hmong communities scattered across the United States, including those in Minnesota (Rochester, Mankato, Duluth); Michigan (Detroit and Warren); Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Washington; North Carolina (Charlotte, Morganton); South Carolina (Spartanburg); Georgia (Auburn, Duluth, Monroe, Atlanta, and Winder); Florida (Tampa Bay); California (Merced); Wisconsin (Madison, Eau Claire, Appleton, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Manitowoc, and Wausau); Aurora, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Missoula, Montana; Des Moines, Iowa; Springfield, Missouri; Arkansas, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island.

Sunisa &quot;Suni&quot; Lee of Saint Paul, Minnesota is a notable Hmong-American; she is a three time Olympic medalist in artistic gymnastics. In the 2020 Summer Olympics, Lee won silver in the women&#x27;s artistic team all-around, followed by gold in the women&#x27;s artistic individual all-around and bronze in the women&#x27;s uneven bars. With these results, Sunisa made history as both the first Hmong-American to compete in the Olympics in any sport and the first Hmong-American to win an Olympic medal.

Canada&#x27;s small Hmong population is mostly concentrated within the province of Ontario. Kitchener, Ontario has 515 residents of Hmong descent, and has a Hmong church.

There is also a small community of several thousand Hmong who migrated to French Guiana in the late 1970s and early 1980s, that can be mainly found in the Hmong villages of Javouhey (1200 individuals) and Cacao (950 individuals).

The Hmong immigrant population of Detroit is a central focus of the 2008 film Gran Torino, though that city does not have a significant Hmong population.

==Religious persecution==
Hmong Catholics, Protestants, and animists have been subjected to military attacks, police arrest, imprisonment, forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture in Laos and Vietnam on anti-religious grounds.

A significant example was the deportation of Zoua Yang and her 27 children from Thailand on 19 December 2005, after the group was arrested attending a church in Ban Kho Noi, Phetchabun Province, Thailand. Ms. Yang and her children were detained upon their return to Laos, after which the whereabouts of much of the family is unknown.

In 2011, Vietnam People&#x27;s Army troops were used to crush a peaceful demonstration by Hmong Catholic, Protestant and Evangelical Christians who gathered in Dien Bien Province and the Dien Bien Phu area of northwestern Vietnam, according to Philip Smith of the Center for Public Policy Analysis, independent journalists and others. In 2013, Vam Ngaij Vaj, a Christian pastor of Hmong ancestry, was beaten to death by Vietnamese police and security forces. In Hanoi, Vietnamese government officials refused to allow medical treatment for a Hmong Christian leader, Duong Van Minh, who was suffering from a serious kidney illness, in February 2014.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has documented official and ongoing religious persecution, religious-freedom violations against the Laotian and Hmong people in both Laos and Vietnam by the governments. In April 2011, the Center for Public Policy Analysis also researched and documented cases of Hmong Christians being attacked and summarily executed, including four Lao Hmong Christians.

<text>The California gold rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter&#x27;s Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy; the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood in the Compromise of 1850. The gold rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population&#x27;s decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide.

The effects of the gold rush were substantial. Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, called &quot;forty-niners&quot; (referring to 1849, the peak year for gold rush immigration). Outside of California, the first to arrive were from Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America in late 1848. Of the approximately 300,000 people who came to California during the gold rush, about half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the California Road; forty-niners often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the gold rush attracted thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and China. Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers. San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852. Roads, churches, schools and other towns were built throughout California. In 1849, a state constitution was written. The new constitution was adopted by referendum vote; the future state&#x27;s interim first governor and legislature were chosen. In September 1850, California became a state.

At the beginning of the gold rush, there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of &quot;staking claims&quot; was developed. Prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. Although mining caused environmental harm, more sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service. By 1869, railroads were built from California to the eastern United States. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today&#x27;s US dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few, though many who participated in the California gold rush earned little more than they had started with.

==History==

===Earlier discoveries===
Gold was discovered in California as early as March 9, 1842, at Rancho San Francisco, in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles. Californian native Francisco Lopez was searching for stray horses and stopped on the bank of a small creek (in today&#x27;s Placerita Canyon), about east of present-day Newhall, and about northwest of Los Angeles. While the horses grazed, Lopez dug up some wild onions and found a small gold nugget in the roots among the bulbs. He looked further and found more gold. Lopez took the gold to authorities who confirmed its worth. Lopez and others began to search for other streambeds with gold deposits in the area. They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In November, some of the gold was sent to the U.S. Mint, although otherwise attracted little notice. In 1843, Lopez found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846. Minor finds of gold in California were also made by Mission Indians prior to 1848. The friars instructed them to keep its location secret to avoid a gold rush.

===Marshall&#x27;s discovery===
In January 1847, nine months into the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed, leading to the resolution of the military conflict in Alta California (Upper California). On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill he was building for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter—known as Sutter&#x27;s Mill, near Coloma on the American River. Marshall brought what he found to Sutter, and the two privately tested the metal. After the tests showed that it was gold, Sutter expressed dismay, wanting to keep the news quiet because he feared what would happen to his plans for an agricultural empire if there were a gold rush in the region. The Mexican–American War ended on May 30 with the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which formally transferred California to the United States.

Having sworn all concerned at the mill to secrecy, in February 1848, Sutter sent Charles Bennett to Monterey to meet with Colonel Mason, the chief U.S. official in California, to secure the mineral rights of the land where the mill stood. Bennett was not to tell anyone of the discovery of gold, but when he stopped at Benicia, he heard talk about the discovery of coal near Mount Diablo, and he blurted out the discovery of gold. He continued to San Francisco, where again, he could not keep the secret. At Monterey, Mason declined to make any judgement of title to lands and mineral rights, and Bennett for the third time revealed the gold discovery.

By March 1848, rumors of the discovery were confirmed by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. Brannan hurriedly set up a store to sell gold prospecting supplies, and he walked through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting &quot;Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!&quot;

On August 19, 1848, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, US President James K. Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress. As a result, individuals seeking to benefit from the gold rush—later called the &quot;forty-niners&quot;—began moving to the Gold Country of California or &quot;Mother Lode&quot; from other countries and from other parts of the United States. As Sutter had feared, his business plans were ruined after his workers left in search of gold, and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle.

San Francisco had been a tiny settlement before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco increased quickly from about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships. There were no churches or religious services in the rapidly growing city, which prompted missionaries like William Taylor to meet the need, where he held services in the street, using a barrel head as his pulpit. Crowds would gather to listen to his sermons, and before long he received enough generous donations from successful gold miners and built San Francisco&#x27;s first church.

===Transportation and supplies===
In what has been referred to as the &quot;first world-class gold rush,&quot; there was no easy way to get to California; forty-niners faced hardship and often death on the way. At first, most , as they were also known, traveled by sea. From the East Coast, a sailing voyage around the tip of South America would take four to five months, and cover approximately . An alternative was to sail to the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama, take canoes and mules for a week through the jungle, and then on the Pacific side, wait for a ship sailing for San Francisco. There was also a route across Mexico starting at Veracruz. The companies providing such transportation created vast wealth among their owners and included the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, the federally subsidized Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Accessory Transit Company. Many gold-seekers took the overland route across the continental United States, particularly along the California Trail. Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards, from shipwreck to typhoid fever and cholera. In the early years of the rush, much of the population growth in the San Francisco area was due to steamship travel from New York City through overland portages in Nicaragua and Panama and then back up by steamship to San Francisco.

While traveling, many steamships from the eastern seaboard required the passengers to bring kits, which were typically full of personal belongings such as clothes, guidebooks, tools, etc. In addition to personal belongings, Argonauts were required to bring barrels full of beef, biscuits, butter, pork, rice, and salt. While on the steamships, travelers could talk to each other, smoke, fish, and engage in other activities depending on the ship they traveled. Still, the dominant activity held throughout the steamships was gambling, which was ironic because segregation between wealth gaps was prominent throughout the ships. Everything was segregated between the rich vs. the poor. There were different levels of travel one could pay for to get to California. The cheaper steamships tended to have longer routes. In contrast, the more expensive would get passengers to California quicker. There were clear social and economic distinctions between those who traveled together, being that those who spent more money would receive accommodations that others were not allowed. They would do this with the clear intent to distinguish their higher class power over those that could not afford those accommodations.

Supply ships arrived in San Francisco with goods to supply the needs of the growing population. When hundreds of ships were abandoned after their crews deserted to go into the goldfields, many ships were converted to warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. As the city expanded and new places were needed on which to build, many ships were destroyed and used as landfill.

===Other developments===
Within a few years, there was an important but lesser-known surge of prospectors into far Northern California, specifically into present-day Siskiyou, Shasta and Trinity Counties. Discovery of gold nuggets at the site of present-day Yreka in 1851 brought thousands of gold-seekers up the Siskiyou Trail and throughout California&#x27;s northern counties.

Settlements of the gold rush era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into existence and then faded. The Gold Rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, a legacy of Chinese miners who came. While there are not many Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.

By 1850, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Faced with gold increasingly difficult to retrieve, Americans began to drive out foreigners to get at the most accessible gold that remained. The new California State Legislature passed a foreign miners tax of twenty dollars per month ($ per month as of 2025), and American prospectors began organized attacks on foreign miners, particularly Latin Americans and Chinese.

In addition, the huge numbers of newcomers were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, &quot;Life Amongst the Modocs.&quot;

==Forty-niners==
The first people to rush to the goldfields, beginning in the spring of 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Californians and some &quot;Californios&quot; (Spanish-speaking Californians; at the time, commonly referred to in English as simply &#x27;Californians&#x27;). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.

Word of the gold rush spread slowly at first. The earliest gold-seekers were people who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and from as far away as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.

Only a small number (probably fewer than 500) traveled overland from the United States that year. Some of these &quot;forty-eighters&quot;, as the earliest gold-seekers were sometimes called, were able to collect large amounts of easily accessible gold—in some cases, thousands of dollars worth each day. Even ordinary prospectors averaged daily gold finds worth 10 to 15 times the daily wage of a laborer on the East Coast. A person could work for six months in the goldfields and find the equivalent of six years&#x27; wages back home. Some hoped to get rich quick and return home, and others wished to start businesses in California.

By the beginning of 1849, word of the gold rush had spread around the world, and an overwhelming number of gold-seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent. The largest group of forty-niners in 1849 were Americans, arriving by the tens of thousands overland across the continent and along various sailing routes (the name &quot;forty-niner&quot; was derived from the year 1849). Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania, poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports, and then traveling in a wagon train along the California Trail. Many others came by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the steamships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Australians and New Zealanders picked up the news from ships carrying Hawaiian newspapers, and thousands, infected with &quot;gold fever&quot;, boarded ships for California.

Forty-niners came from Latin America, particularly from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile. Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China, began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to &quot;Gum San&quot; (&quot;Gold Mountain&quot;), the name given to California in Chinese. The first immigrants from Europe, reeling from the effects of the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France, with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.

It is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849—about half by land and half by sea. Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries. By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world. The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians, French, and Latin Americans, together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques and people from the Ottoman Empire.

People from small villages in the hills near Genoa, Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.

A number of immigrants were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.

There were also women in the gold rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship to the San Francisco Bay in 1849, only 700 were women (including those who were poor, wealthy, entrepreneurs, prostitutes, single, and married). They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing to be left behind to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.

Because of many thousands of people flooding into California at Sacramento and San Francisco and surrounding areas, the Methodist church deemed it necessary to send missionaries there to preach the gospel, as churches in that part of the state were not to be found. The first missionary to arrive was William Taylor who arrived in San Francisco in September 1849. For many months he preached in the streets to hundreds of people without salary, and ultimately after saving often generous donations from successful miners, he built and established the first Methodist church in California, and California&#x27;s first professional hospital.

==Legal rights==
When the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican–American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal &quot;territory&quot; and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region. Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves.

While the treaty ending the Mexican–American War obliged the United States to honor Mexican land grants, almost all the goldfields were outside those grants. Instead, the goldfields were primarily on &quot;public land&quot;, meaning land formally owned by the United States government. However, there were no legal rules yet in place, and no practical enforcement mechanisms.

The benefit to the forty-niners was that the gold was simply &quot;free for the taking&quot; at first. In the goldfields at the beginning, there was no private property, no licensing fees, and no taxes. The miners informally adapted Mexican mining law that had existed in California. For example, the rules attempted to balance the rights of early arrivers at a site with later arrivers; a &quot;claim&quot; could be &quot;staked&quot; by a prospector, but that claim was valid only as long as it was being actively worked.

Miners worked at a claim only long enough to determine its potential. If a claim was deemed as low-value—as most were—miners would abandon the site in search of a better one. In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would &quot;claim-jump&quot; the land. &quot;Claim-jumping&quot; meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site. Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators. This often led to heightened ethnic tensions. In some areas the influx of many prospectors could lead to a reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure.

==Development of gold-recovery techniques==
Approximately four hundred million years ago, California lay at the bottom of a large sea; underwater volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.

Because the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, early forty-niners were able to retrieve loose gold flakes and nuggets with their hands, or simply &quot;pan&quot; for gold in rivers and streams. Panning cannot take place on a large scale, and industrious miners and groups of miners graduated to placer mining, using &quot;cradles&quot; and &quot;rockers&quot; or &quot;long-toms&quot; to process larger volumes of gravel. Miners would also engage in &quot;coyoteing&quot;, a method that involved digging a shaft deep into placer deposits along a stream. Tunnels were then dug in all directions to reach the richest veins of pay dirt.

In the most complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates are that as much as 12 million ounces (370 t) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush.

In the next stage, by 1853, hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the goldfields. In a modern style of hydraulic mining first developed in California, and later used around the world, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. The loosened gravel and gold would then pass over sluices, with the gold settling to the bottom where it was collected. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that of gold (worth approximately US$15 billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by hydraulic mining.

A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers. Court rulings (1882 Gold Run and 1884 &quot;Sawyer Act&quot;) and 1893 federal legislation limited hydraulic mining in California. many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.

After the gold rush had concluded, gold recovery operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed down into the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California&#x27;s Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and it is estimated that more than were recovered by dredging.

Both during the gold rush and in the decades that followed, gold-seekers also engaged in &quot;hard-rock&quot; mining, extracting the gold directly from the rock that contained it (typically quartz), usually by digging and blasting to follow and remove veins of the gold-bearing quartz. Once the gold-bearing rocks were brought to the surface, the rocks were crushed and the gold separated, either using separation in water, using its density difference from quartz sand, or by washing the sand over copper plates coated with mercury (with which gold forms an amalgam). Loss of mercury in the amalgamation process was a source of environmental contamination. Eventually, hard-rock mining became the single largest source of gold produced in the Gold Country. The total production of gold in California from then until now is estimated at .

==Profits==
Recent scholarship confirms that merchants made far more money than miners during the gold rush. The wealthiest man in California during the early years of the rush was Samuel Brannan, a tireless self-promoter, shopkeeper and newspaper publisher. Brannan opened the first supply stores in Sacramento, Coloma, and other spots in the goldfields. Just as the rush began, he purchased all the prospecting supplies available in San Francisco and resold them at a substantial profit.

Some gold-seekers made a significant amount of money. On average, half the gold-seekers made a modest profit, after taking all expenses into account; economic historians have suggested that white miners were more successful than black, Indian, or Chinese miners. However, taxes such as the California foreign miners tax passed in 1851, targeted mainly Latino miners and kept them from making as much money as whites, who did not have any taxes imposed on them. In California most late arrivals made little or wound up losing money. Similarly, many unlucky merchants set up in settlements that disappeared, or which succumbed to one of the calamitous fires that swept the towns that sprang up. By contrast, a businessman who went on to great success was Levi Strauss, who first began selling denim overalls in San Francisco in 1853.

Other businessmen reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, and laundry were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay well for a service done by a woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.

By 1855, the economic climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to large groups of workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made in a wide variety of conventional businesses.

===Path of the gold===
Once extracted, the gold itself took many paths. First, much of the gold was used locally to purchase food, supplies and lodging for the miners. It also went towards entertainment, which consisted of anything from a traveling theater to alcohol, gambling, and prostitutes. These transactions often took place using the recently recovered gold, carefully weighed out. These merchants and vendors, in turn, used the gold to purchase supplies from ship captains or packers bringing goods to California.

The gold then left California aboard ships or mules to go to the makers of the goods from around the world. A second path was the Argonauts themselves who, having personally acquired a sufficient amount, sent the gold home, or returned home taking with them their hard-earned &quot;diggings&quot;. For example, one estimate is that some US$80 million worth of California gold (equivalent to US$ billion today) was sent to France by French prospectors and merchants.

A majority of the gold went back to New York City brokerage houses.

As the gold rush progressed, local banks and gold dealers issued &quot;banknotes&quot; or &quot;drafts&quot;—locally accepted paper currency—in exchange for gold, and private mints created private gold coins. With the building of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, gold bullion was turned into official United States gold coins for circulation. The gold was also later sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the booming California economy.

==Effects==
The arrival of hundreds of thousands of new people in California within a few years, compared to a population of some 15,000 Europeans and &quot;Californios&quot; beforehand, had many dramatic effects.

A 2017 study attributes the record-long economic expansion of the United States in the recession-free period of 1841–1856 primarily to &quot;a boom in transportation-goods investment following the discovery of gold in California.&quot;

===Government and commerce===
The gold rush propelled California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to a center of the global imagination and the destination of hundreds of thousands of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic mindedness. For example, in the midst of the gold rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C., to negotiate the admission of California as a state.

Large-scale agriculture (California&#x27;s second &quot;Gold Rush&quot;) began during this time. Roads, schools, churches, and civic organizations quickly came into existence. The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans. Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States, leading to statehood for California on September 9, 1850, in the Compromise of 1850 as the state of the United States.

Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. &quot;Central America&quot;, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.

===Native Americans===

The human and environmental costs of the Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers&#x27; camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.

In some areas, systematic attacks against tribespeople in or near mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers. Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that there were times when miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked, killing more than 150 Wintu people. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.

Historian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873 and estimated that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the &quot;intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise&quot;). According to demographer Russell Thornton, between 1849 and 1890, the Indigenous population of California fell below 20,000 – primarily because of the killings. According to the government of California, some 4,500 Native Americans suffered violent deaths between 1849 and 1870. Furthermore, California stood in opposition of ratifying the eighteen treaties signed between tribal leaders and federal agents in 1851. The state government, in support of miner activities, funded and supported death squads, appropriating over 1 million dollars towards the funding and operation of the paramilitary organizations. Peter Burnett, California&#x27;s first governor declared that California was a battleground between the races and that there were only two options towards California Indians, extermination or removal. &quot;That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.&quot; For Burnett, like many of his contemporaries, the genocide was part of God&#x27;s plan, and it was necessary for Burnett&#x27;s constituency to move forward in California. The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, passed on April 22, 1850, by the California Legislature, allowed settlers to capture and use Native people as bonded workers, prohibited Native peoples&#x27; testimony against settlers, and allowed the adoption of Native children by settlers, often for labor purposes.

After the initial boom had ended, explicitly anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought to drive out foreigners—in addition to Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico, and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.

===World-wide economic stimulation===
The gold rush stimulated economies around the world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British manufactured goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs around the world. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. Preceding the gold rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.

Within a few years after the end of the gold rush, in 1863, the groundbreaking ceremony for the western leg of the First transcontinental railroad was held in Sacramento. The line&#x27;s completion, some six years later, financed in part with Gold Rush money, united California with the central and eastern United States. Travel that had taken weeks or even months could now be accomplished in days.

===Gender practices===
As the California gold rush brought a disproportionate population of men and set an environment of experimental lawlessness separate from the bounds of standard society, conventional American gender roles came into question. In the large absence of women, these migrant young men were made to reorganize their social and sexual practices, leading to cross-gender practices that most often took place as cross-dressing. Dance events were a notable social space for cross-dressing, where a piece of cloth (such as a handkerchief or sackcloth patch) would denote a &#x27;woman.&#x27; Beyond social events, these subverted gender expectations continued into domestic duties as well. Though cross-dressing occurred most frequently with men as women, the reverse also applied.

These miners and merchants of various genders and gendered appearances, encouraged by the social fluidity and population limitations of the Wild West, shaped the beginnings of San Francisco&#x27;s prominent queer history.

===Longer-term===
California&#x27;s name became indelibly connected with the gold rush, and fast success in a new world became known as the &quot;California Dream&quot;. California was perceived as a place of new beginnings, where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:


Overnight California gained the international reputation as the &quot;golden state&quot;. Generations of immigrants have been attracted by the California Dream. California farmers, oil drillers, movie makers, airplane builders, computer and microchip makers, and &quot;dot-com&quot; entrepreneurs have each had their boom times in the decades after the Gold Rush.

In addition, the standard route shield of state highways in California is in the shape of a miner&#x27;s spade to honor the California gold rush. Today, the aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills, connecting many Gold Rush-era towns such as Placerville, Auburn, Grass Valley, Nevada City, Coloma, Jackson, and Sonora. This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many gold rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.

==Cultural references==
The literary history of the gold rush is reflected in the works of Mark Twain (&quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot;), Bret Harte (&quot;A Millionaire of Rough-and-Ready&quot;), Joaquin Miller (&quot;Life Amongst the Modocs&quot;), and many others.

The San Francisco 49ers, a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area and competing in the National Football League, are named after miners.

<doc id="58298" wikidata="Q1441453" url="?curid=58298" title="Swedish colonies in the Americas">
<text>Sweden established colonies in the Americas in the mid-17th century, including the colony of New Sweden (1638–1655) on the Delaware River in what is now Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, as well as two possessions in the Caribbean during the 18th and 19th centuries.

==North America==
The colony of New Sweden was founded in 1638 by the first expedition of Swedish South Company, a consortium of Swedish, Dutch and German business interests formed in 1637. The colony was located along the Delaware River with settlements in modern Delaware (e.g., Wilmington), Pennsylvania (e.g., Philadelphia) and New Jersey (e.g., New Stockholm and Swedesboro) along locations where Swedish and Dutch traders had been visiting for decades.

At the time (until 1809) Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden, and some of the settlers of Sweden&#x27;s colonies came from present-day Finland or were Finnish-speaking. The Swedes and Finns brought their log house design to America, where it became the typical log cabin of pioneers. The Swedish colonists established a trading relationship with the Susquehannock, and supported them in their successful war against Maryland colonists.

While a Baltic naval power, the international power of the Swedish Empire was rooted in land-based military power, and when another general war engulfed northern Europe, the Royal Swedish Navy was incapable of protecting the colony. Subsequently, the young colony was eventually annexed by the Dutch, who perceived the presence of Swedish colonists in North America as a threat to their interests in the New Netherland colony.

== Caribbean ==
The Swedish colony of Saint Barthélemy (1784–1878) was operated as a &quot;porto franco&quot; (free port). The capital city of Gustavia retains its Swedish name. Guadeloupe (1813–1814) came into Swedish possession as a consequence of the Napoleonic Wars. It gave rise to the Guadeloupe Fund.
In addition to these the Swedes briefly attempted to settle Tobago in 1733, but were driven away by native tribes, and Tobago was eventually claimed by the British.

==Esequibo==
During the 18th century, the Swedes attempted to colonize the Essequibo region between the lower Orinoco and Barima rivers in Guyana&#x27;s present-day Barima-Waini region. The Swedes, settled in the area in July 1732, were expelled in 1737 by forces led by Major Sergeant Carlos Francisco Francois Sucre y Pardo (grandfather of Venezuelan independence leader Antonio José de Sucre).

==Other settlements==
Swedish emigrants continued to go to the Americas to settle within other countries or colonies. The mid-19th and early 20th centuries saw a large Swedish emigration to the United States. In 1841, a group composed of former Upsala University students and a couple of relatives established the first Swedish colony west of the Allegheny Mountains on the east shore of Pine Lake 30 miles west of Milwaukee and named their settlement, New Upsala. Approximately 1.3 million Swedes subsequently settled in the U.S., and there are currently about four million Swedish-Americans, as of 2008.

Dom Pedro II, the second Emperor of Brazil, encouraged immigration, resulting in a sizeable number of Swedes entering Brazil, settling mainly in the cities of Joinville and Ijuí. In the late 19th century, Misiones Province in Argentina was a major centre for Swedish immigration, and laid the foundations of a population of Swedish-Argentines.

<doc id="58299" wikidata="Q2916790" url="?curid=58299" title="Opera Australia">
<text>Opera Australia is the principal opera company in Australia. Based in Sydney, New South Wales, its performance season at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Opera Australia Orchestra runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent at the Arts Centre Melbourne, where it is accompanied by Orchestra Victoria. In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, Victoria, attended by more than 294,000 people.

It is funded by government grants, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales. The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75 per cent. The company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with Dame Joan Sutherland, for Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s production of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; in the early 1990s and more recently, for, apart from performances inside the opera house, large scale outdoor performances on Sydney Harbour.

Many thousands of Australians also experience the company&#x27;s work through television, radio, video, compact disc, DVD, and the annual free performance of opera in the Domain in Sydney. The company also performs in an annual outdoor event at Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Chair, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, where since 2012 operas such as &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; have played.

== History ==

===Australian Opera Company, 1956–57===
In 1956, the Australian Opera Company was formed in Sydney under the auspices of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. It commemorated the Mozart bicentenary by presenting four Mozart operas in all capital cities, travelling more than 10,000 kilometres, and giving 169 performances.

===Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company, 1957–70===
By 1957, it changed its name to the Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company.

In 1959 the company&#x27;s laid-off singers gave the first of many regional tours (presented by state Arts Councils) with Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; using reduced scenery and conducted from the piano by Georg Tintner (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland). Subsequent Arts Council tours included &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (1960; Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales), &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1961; New South Wales, Queensland) and &quot;La traviata&quot; (1962; New South Wales, Queensland), all conducted by Tintner. However, by 1963 a permanent nucleus of singers and staff was retained throughout the year and the company had made appearances at regional festivals, including the Adelaide Festival. It was also able to establish the first Elizabethan Trust Orchestra for the company by 1967 with additional government aid. During this time, Stefan Haag played an important role in the development of the company.

A major milestone for the company was a television recording of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; filmed in 1968 at the Adelaide Festival. This starred Tito Gobbi as Scarpia alongside two Australian singers, soprano Marie Collier in the title role, and tenor Donald Smith as Cavaradossi, with the Argentinian born, Italian conductor Carlo Felice Cillario conducting. This was the commencement of a long and fruitful association between the Australian Opera and Cillario until his retirement in 2003. Some of his first rehearsals in the country involved conducting the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra and the Australian Opera Chorus, both newly formed and on permanent contracts.

While not yet appearing with this company, Joan Sutherland, then an internationally known Australian soprano, and her husband, the conductor Richard Bonynge, helped the cause of opera in general in Australia during the 1960s. Sutherland&#x27;s name was also linked to the progress of the Sydney Opera House, begun in 1957 and still undergoing a lengthy and controversial construction. By the time &quot;La Stupenda&quot; appeared there in 1974, one year after the opening of the theatre, the company was a leading repertory company with a large chorus and a roster of experienced Australian principals supplemented by guest singers and conductors.

===The Australian Opera, 1970–96===
In 1970, the company became known as The Australian Opera. The 1970s saw considerable changes both in administration and location. In 1972, Edward Downes, formerly associated with London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, became musical director, and his first new production was the Australian premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, followed closely by Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; as the opening night performance of the Sydney Opera House, a short time before the building&#x27;s official opening.

The Sydney Opera House, as well as quickly becoming a distinctive cultural landmark in that city, gave the company a permanent performance home and thus helped to expand its repertoire and develop local audiences. Audiences were boosted by Joan Sutherland&#x27;s performances with The Australian Opera in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. In the 1974 season, three Australian works were performed: &quot;The Affair&quot; by Felix Werder, &quot;Lenz&quot; by Larry Sitsky, and &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; by Peter Sculthorpe. (&quot;Rites of Passage&quot; was to have been the inaugural opera presentation at the Sydney Opera House, but was not ready in time.)

By 1976, Richard Bonynge had become musical director and he led the company on its first overseas tour to New Zealand with Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, the latter conducted by Georg Tintner. This was followed in 1978 by the first Australian Opera country tour with orchestra to north-eastern New South Wales (&quot;Don Pasquale&quot; with the Queensland Theatre Orchestra, conducted by Tintner). The principal tenor for this tour was Robin Donald. From 1977 to 1990, the resident director was Elke Neidhardt.

In 1977, the New South Wales Friends of the Australian Opera and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust established the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship to further the musical education of professional opera singers.

During the 1980s, after many years of recording performances by the Australian Opera for television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and The Australian Opera presented their first live simulcast, Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, and it was seen by more than two million people. Over the following years a series of simulcasts reached millions of Australian homes.

Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland appeared at the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House in 1983, with the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge (the sister orchestra in Melbourne was known as the Elizabethan Melbourne Orchestra. Now they are known respectively as the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra, Sydney and Orchestra Victoria, Melbourne). Another successful concert with Sutherland and Marilyn Horne was held in the Concert Hall.

Several innovative features characterised this period of the 1980s. The first, Esso Opera in the Park in the Sydney Domain, quickly became an annual event, and it is now called &quot;Opera in the Domain&quot;. Typically, it attracts almost 100,000 people each year. A similar annual outdoor event, which attracts more than 25,000 people, is held in Melbourne. The second was the establishment of The Esso Young Artists&#x27; Development Program for the Australian Opera while the third was the Australian Compositions Program launched with a new production of Brian Howard&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;.

Another innovative program, The National Opera Workshop, was established to enable selected Australian composers to present works in workshop form with artists from the Australian Opera. Lastly, OperaAction, the Youth Education Program, established a program of events, including three youth performances of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and, in 1986, &quot;Winds of the Solstice&quot;, an original youth opera created by 70 students working on libretto, music, choreography and orchestration and presented at the Sydney Opera House.

The company re-organised its administration gradually throughout the decade, appointing Moffatt Oxenbould as artistic director in 1984, and announcing that Bonynge would become Musical Director Emeritus and principal guest conductor from 1987, after his decade long contract as musical director expired.

In 1988, in association with the Australian Bicentennial Authority, the company toured Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and the National Opera Workshop in Melbourne with &quot;The Ra Project&quot;, a music-theatre work composed with the direct participation from the earliest stages by the singers who performed it and marking director Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s first association with the Australian Opera.

Sutherland gave her farewell performances for the Australian Opera in 1990 in a production of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. Two years later, the company named its major rehearsal studio after Dame Joan.

Also in 1990, Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; premiered in Sydney, establishing Cheryl Barker and David Hobson as important principals in the company. Such was its impact that the production went on to play at the Broadway Theatre in New York in 2002 for 228 performances.

The early 1990s were to see two important changes in the way that the company worked: firstly, in 1991, with the formation of the Artistic Associates of The Australian Opera, a body of people was created which comprised some of the most important figures in the Australian musical and performing arts world. Secondly, the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra was integrated with the Australian Opera to produce a permanent opera and ballet orchestra for the company.

In its first performances outside Australasia in 1994, the company performed Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Edinburgh International Festival. In addition, the Baz Luhrmann production of &quot;La bohème&quot; was screened over more than 300 North American television stations, followed by worldwide video release and a later Broadway version.

==Opera Australia, since 1996==
Opera Australia (OA) was formed by the merger of the Australian Opera and the Victoria State Opera (VSO) companies in 1996, following the financial collapse of the Melbourne-based VSO. Adrian Collette was appointed general manager of the new company, and developed a three-year plan to restructure the company involving twice yearly seasons in both Sydney and Melbourne, integrating the OA and VSO staff and planning a viable financial structure so as to manage the inherited debt.

The first few years of the present century saw the retirement of Moffatt Oxenbould, Opera Australia&#x27;s artistic director for 15 years, and the appointment of Simone Young as musical director. Immediately on taking up her position in 2001, Simone Young appointed the Australian director Stuart Maunder to the position of artistic director. Young proceeded to develop the company&#x27;s core repertoire, including more German operas in the repertoire and diversifying the types of productions mounted and the standards of international and local artists employed. By late 2002 however, the OA board, faced with mounting deficits, announced that Young&#x27;s future visions for the company were &quot;unsustainable&quot; and decided not to renew her contract after the end of 2003.

At the end of 2003, Richard Hickox was named music director-designate of Opera Australia, and took up the post full-time from January 2005. During his tenure, Hickox diversified the repertoire with the addition of more 20th-century works such as &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, &quot;Rusalka&quot; and &quot;Arabella&quot;, recording live performances of many of these works for Chandos Records. The company&#x27;s 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2006 with a gala concert in which tributes were paid to Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, the principal artists, the chorus, production staff and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra (the AOBO) for their &quot;artistry and talent&quot; and the &quot;ensemble nature&quot; of the company. In mid-2008, Hickox and Opera Australia were criticised by a singer for what she perceived as a decline in artistic standards since the start of Hickox&#x27;s tenure. The board expressed complete confidence in Hickox. On returning to the UK in November 2008 following the Sydney winter season, Hickox died suddenly from a heart attack after conducting a rehearsal in Swansea. On 30 June 2009, Lyndon Terracini was announced as the new artistic director.
===&quot;Change for survival&quot;===
In 2011, Terracini gave a controversial speech as part of the annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address, in which he announced that Opera Australia had to change in order to survive. &quot;Opera companies and orchestras of significance world wide are closing at an alarming rate ... We can blithely ignore the fact ... or we can change ... brave programming is having the courage to programme what critics will criticise you for, but will make a genuine connection to a real audience.&quot;

Terracini pursued a program designed to bring opera to wider audiences. In 2012 through the sponsorship of Haruhisa Handa and Destination NSW, Opera Australia staged the first Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, a three-week season of a fully produced and staged opera, designed to be an opera &quot;event&quot;. The production of &quot;La traviata&quot; was directed by Francesca Zambello and attracted an audience of 40,000 people. In 2013, Opera Australia staged an open-air production of &quot;Carmen&quot; on Sydney Harbour, directed by Gale Edwards. It reached similar audience numbers. The harbour has since received annual stagings, followed by &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (2014), &quot;Aida&quot; (2015), and &quot;Turandot&quot; (2016), a new production of &quot;Carmen&quot; in 2017, &quot;La bohème&quot; (2018), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2019), &quot;La Traviata&quot; (1920, 2021), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2022), &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (2023), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2024)

In 2012, Opera Australia replaced the regular Gilbert and Sullivan productions that had formed part of the company&#x27;s repertoire for some years with a series of Broadway musicals. A Lincoln Center Theatre production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; played at the Sydney Opera House and Melbourne&#x27;s Princess Theatre in 2012, kicking off a national tour which continued in 2013.

An extensive philanthropic drive enabled the company to program its first full-length &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;, which was performed in Melbourne over four weeks at the end of 2013. After tickets to the event sold out in just one day, ABC Classic FM and Opera Australia announced the radio station would live broadcast the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; to audiences across the country.

In April 2013, Opera Australia announced a 44 per cent growth in total revenue based on an increase in box office sales of more than 55 per cent. For the second year in a row, the company reported an operating profit following two successive deficits.

In January 2013, the board of Opera Australia announced they would extend Lyndon Terracini&#x27;s contract as artistic director for five more years. Later that year, Terracini announced that singers on 12-month contracts will be &quot;rested&quot; without pay for a period of six to twelve weeks in 2014.

Terracini resigned in October 2022 and in December Opera Australia announced Welsh-born Jo Davies as his replacement. She was the first woman to be appointed artistic director of the company, but left in August 2024, following &quot;differences of opinion&quot; with the CEO.

===Educational outreach===
Oz Opera was established after the merger of the AO with the VSO in 1996 with Lindy Hume as its director. Its aim is to present opera to audiences throughout metropolitan and regional Australia. It presents performances in primary schools across New South Wales and Victoria, adapting large-scale scores to suit young audiences.

Oz Opera, now called Opera Australia Touring and Outreach (Opera Australia&#x27;s education, access and development arm), presented the &quot;La bohème&quot; production in Victoria, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, attended by 13,350 people, while OzOpera&#x27;s Schools Company performed to over 63,500 primary age children in more than 360 performances in urban and regional New South Wales and Victoria. Since then the touring and outreach arm of the company has performed to a great many more people around Australia and toured other states, including South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania.

===Modern Australian opera===
Opera Australia is committed to the long-term development and performance of modern Australian operas. Since 1974, OA has fully staged 12 new Australian operas and workshopped over 20 new works in various stages of development. The main new works staged by the company have been &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; by Anne Boyd (1985); &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; by Brian Howard (1985); &quot;Voss&quot; by Richard Meale (1986); &quot;Whitsunday&quot; by Howard (1988); &quot;Mer de glace&quot; by Richard Meale (1992); &quot;The Golem&quot; by Larry Sitsky (1993); &quot;The Eighth Wonder&quot; by Alan John (1995); &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; by Richard Mills (1999); &quot;Batavia&quot; by Richard Mills (2001); &quot;Love in the Age of Therapy&quot; by Paul Grabowsky (OzOpera 2002); &quot;Lindy&quot; by Moya Henderson (2003); &quot;Madeline Lee&quot; by John Haddock (2004); &quot;Bliss&quot; (2010) by Brett Dean; and &quot;The Rabbits&quot; by Kate Miller Heidke (2015). In 2015, OA produced the television opera &quot;The Divorce&quot; by Elena Kats-Chernin and Joanna Murray-Smith based on an original idea by Terracini for ABC Television.

===Digital strategy===
In 2011, Opera Australia launched a digital strategy in order to bring high-definition recordings of its operas to cinemas (in collaboration with CinemaLive), as well as launching DVD, Blu-ray and CD releases on its own label and broadcasting these recordings on ABC Television.

<doc id="58300" wikidata="Q588061" url="?curid=58300" title="List of counties in Michigan">
<text>There are 83 counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. The boundaries of these counties have not changed substantially since 1897. However, throughout the 19th century, the state legislature frequently adjusted county boundaries. County creation was intended to fulfill the goal of establishing government over unorganized territory, but a more important goal was encouraging settlement by surveying the land and dividing it into saleable sections.

The creation of counties generally occurred in two stages. First the boundaries of a county were declared and given a name. The county appeared on maps, even though this may have been the entire extent of a county&#x27;s tangible existence for several years. During this period, the as-yet–unorganized county was attached to another already organized county for administrative purposes. The legislature frequently changed the administrative attachment of these unorganized counties. Residents of such an attached county could petition the legislature for organization, which was the granting of full legal recognition to the county.

There are many cities and villages that span county boundaries in Michigan, including its capital, Lansing. For a few years during the early 1970s, split cities briefly had authority to petition to change the county boundaries to accord with the city boundaries. The only city to take advantage of this brief opportunity was New Baltimore (previously split between Macomb County and St. Clair County; now completely in Macomb). This transfer of territory from St. Clair to Macomb was the only county boundary change in Michigan since the early 20th century.

The state constitution of 1850 permitted an incorporated city with a population of at least 20,000 to be organized into a separate county of its own. The Constitution of 1908 retained this provision, but raised the population threshold to 100,000. No city was ever organized into an independent county in this fashion and when a new Constitution took effect in 1963, the provision was removed.

Michigan&#x27;s boundary with Illinois is formed by Lake Michigan, and three counties have water boundaries with Illinois: Berrien County, Van Buren County, and Allegan County. Michigan also has a boundary with Minnesota, which is formed by Lake Superior. The water boundary in this instance is formed by two counties: Ontonagon County and Keweenaw County. The land boundary with Wisconsin continues into Lake Superior, involving both Gogebic County (which shares a land border) and Ontonagon County (water boundary only).

==Etymologies==

Nine counties have names invented by the ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft, usually adapted from parts of Native American words, but sometimes having parts from Greek, Arabic and Latin roots.
Schoolcraft&#x27;s made-up words have disputed sources. While he was a devotee of Native American words and culture, some of his words may have originated with tribes from other areas of the country, such as New York or the Northeast, where many settlers to Michigan came from. Real Native words were eradicated, and he substituted made-up words, sometimes with a kernel of Indian language or sound in them.

A second group of four counties were renamed for Irish locales (counties Antrim, Clare, Roscommon and Wexford), apparently because it was close to the heart for certain Michigan legislators or their constituents.

Ten counties, the so-called &quot;cabinet counties&quot;, were named for persons who served in Andrew Jackson&#x27;s presidential administration, which was tied to Michigan&#x27;s anticipated ascendancy to statehood. Eight were named in 1829. Livingston County was named in 1833. Cass County was also named in 1829, but Governor Lewis Cass did not become a member of Jackson&#x27;s Cabinet until 1831.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, the number 001 is shared by Alcona County, Michigan, Adams County, Wisconsin, and Adair County, Iowa. To uniquely identify Alcona County, Michigan, one must use the state code of 26 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Alcona County, Michigan is 26001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.
==List of counties==





























==Defunct counties and county precursors==
This listing includes only counties or county precursors created by the Territory of Michigan or the State of Michigan. It excludes counties that existed in the Territory of Michigan or the modern boundaries of the State of Michigan but were created by any other entity (another state, a territorial government, the federal government, etc.) before the creation of the Territory of Michigan.
# Brown County, formed on December 3, 1818, from unorganized territory when Michigan Territory was expanded to include area west of Lake Michigan upon formation of the state of Illinois. Transferred to Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and continues as Brown County, Wisconsin.
# Crawford County, formed on December 3, 1818, from unorganized territory when Michigan Territory was expanded to include area west of Lake Michigan upon formation of the state of Illinois. Transferred to Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and continues as Crawford County, Wisconsin.
# Des Moines County, formed on October 1, 1834, from unorganized territory. Transferred to Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and continues as Des Moines County, Iowa.
# Detroit District, formed on July 3, 1805, as a county precursor by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass to carry out the Territory&#x27;s judicial and administrative functions. Superseded by counties on October 2, 1818, as proclaimed by William Woodbridge, Secretary of Michigan Territory.
# Dubuque County, formed on October 1, 1834, from unorganized territory. Transferred to Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and continues as Dubuque County, Iowa.
# Erie District, formed on July 3, 1805, as a county precursor by Territorial Governor William Hull to carry out the Territory&#x27;s judicial and administrative functions. Included parts of modern-day Indiana and the Toledo Strip. Although the Erie District was officially superseded by counties by proclamation of Michigan Territorial Secretary William Woodbridge on October 2, 1818, the area of the district had actually been lost to the State of Indiana when it was created on December 11, 1816.
# Huron District formed on July 3, 1805, as a county precursor by Territorial Governor William Hull to carry out the Territory&#x27;s judicial and administrative functions. Superseded by counties on October 2, 1818, as proclaimed by William Woodbridge, Secretary of Michigan Territory.
# Iowa County, formed on January 1, 1830, from part of Crawford County. Transferred to Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and continues as Iowa County, Wisconsin.
# Isle Royale County, formed on March 4, 1875, from part of Keweenaw County. County became officially unorganized on March 13, 1885, and was attached to Houghton County, for judicial and administrative purposes. Michigan Legislature officially dissolved Isle Royale County and returned it to Keweenaw County on April 9, 1897.
#Keskkauko County, formed on April 1, 1840, from part of Mackinac County. Renamed Charlevoix County, on March 8, 1843. Annexed to Emmet County, on January 29, 1853, and eliminated as a county. Reformed as Charlevoix County from Emmet, Antrim, and Otsego, Counties on April 2, 1869, albeit with boundaries that differed somewhat from the 1840–1853 iteration of Keskkauko–Charlevoix County.
# Manitou County, formed on February 12, 1855, from parts of Emmet County and Leelanau County. On March 16, 1861, Manitou County was attached to Mackinac County for meetings of the District Court, but all other County functions were unchanged. Four years later, on March 10, 1865, the District Court attachment was changed to Leelanau County instead of Mackinac. Another four years later, on March 24, 1869, the District Court attachment to Leelanau County was terminated. The entire Manitou County government was dissolved on April 4, 1895, and the county was abolished. It was absorbed by Charlevoix County, and Leelanau County.

<doc id="58301" wikidata="Q1334227" url="?curid=58301" title="List of counties in Mississippi">
<text>The U.S. state of Mississippi has 82 counties. The first two counties, Adams County and Pickering County (renamed Jefferson County later), were established in 1799 in the Mississippi Territory. 14 counties, all in the southwest, were created before the Mississippi Territory became a state in 1817. The last county created was Humphreys County in 1918. The Mississippi Constitution governs the creation of new counties, which requires an election of qualified electors to approve of the creation of a new county. Elections are limited to once every four years. Any new county must be at least , with no existing county reduced below that size.

The county governing body, known as the Board of Supervisors, is located under the judicial branch of state government as established in the 1817 Mississippi Constitution. The 1868 Constitution mandated five-member Board of Supervisors, an evolution of the five-member board of police created in the 1832 Constitution. Supervisors are elected without term limits. County government includes other elected and appointed officials who serve concurrent four-year terms. Major elected officials include the chancery clerk, who manages records and administrative tasks for the supervisors and chancery court; the circuit clerk, who handles election administration duties; and the sheriff, who functions as the chief of county law enforcement. Other elected officials include the constables, justice court judges, and the tax assessor or collector (23 counties have separate officials). Major appointed county officials include the board attorney, the county administrator, the county engineer, and the road manager. Counties have either one of two county seats, depending on the number of court districts.

Through evolving constitutions, counties are granted police powers, administrative duties for transportation infrastructure, and election scheduling for vacacines in county offices. The Board of Supervisors are mandated to additional duties as defined by the legislature. While placed under the judicial branch, the Mississippi Supreme Court recognize counties perform mixed duties that are executive, legislative, and judicial in nature. Prior to 1988, each supervisor independently managed roads and bridges in their assigned area, and would allocate money at their discretion, subject to restrictions in state law. County revenues were divided equally among all five supervisors. However, this came under scrutiny after Operation Pretense (19841987), an FBI sting operation targeting corruption that led to the indictment of fifty-five county supervisors. The Mississippi Legislature passed the County Government Reorganization Act of 1988 in response, which transferred responsibilities to a system of centralized road administration.

According to 2023 U.S. Census Data, the average population of Mississippi&#x27;s 82 counties is 35,850, with Hinds County as the most populous (214,870) and Issaquena County the least (1,256). Six counties have populations over 100,000 while 16 have populations under 10,000. Yazoo County is the largest by total area at , and Alcorn County is the smallest at . The average land area is . 19 counties have names with Native American etymologies.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is used by the United States Federal government to uniquely identify counties. In the table below, each code links to the U.S. Census &quot;quick facts&quot; page for that county. Mississippi&#x27;s FIPS state code is 28.

<text>Sucking lice (Anoplura, formerly known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional superfamilies of lice. As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing lice, which are now divided among three suborders, the sucking lice are monophyletic.

The Anoplura are all blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals. They only occur on about 20% of all placentalian mammal species, and are unknown from several orders of mammals (Monotremata, Edentata, Pholidota, Chiroptera, Cetacea, Sirenia, and Proboscidea). They can cause localized skin irritations and are vectors of several blood-borne diseases. Children appear particularly susceptible to attracting lice, possibly due to their fine hair.

At least three species or subspecies of Anoplura are parasites of humans; the human condition of being infested with sucking lice is called pediculosis. &quot;Pediculus humanus&quot; is divided into two subspecies, &quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;, or the human body louse, sometimes nicknamed &quot;the seam squirrel&quot; for its habit of laying of eggs in the seams of clothing, and &quot;Pediculus humanus capitis&quot;, or the human head louse. &quot;Pthirus pubis&quot; (the human pubic louse) is the cause of the condition known as crabs.

==Families==
These 15 families are generally recognized in the Anoplura:
* Echinophthiriidae – (seal lice)
* Enderleinellidae 
* Haematopinidae – (ungulate lice)
* Hamophthiriidae 
* Hoplopleuridae – (armoured lice)
* Hybophthiridae 
* Linognathidae – (pale lice)
* Microthoraciidae 
* Neolinognathidae 
* Pecaroecidae 
* Pedicinidae – (Old World monkey lice)
* Pediculidae – (body lice)
* Polyplacidae – (spiny rat lice)
* Pthiridae – (pubic lice)
* Ratemiidae

<doc id="58303" wikidata="Q852579" url="?curid=58303" title="List of counties in Missouri">
<text>There are 114 counties and one independent city in the U.S. State of Missouri. Following the Louisiana Purchase and the admittance of Louisiana into the United States in 1812, five counties were formed out of the Missouri Territory at the first general assembly: Cape Girardeau, New Madrid, Saint Charles, Saint Louis, and Ste. Genevieve. Most subsequent counties were apportioned from these five original counties. Six more counties were added through the 1836 Platte Purchase, the acquired lands of which formed the northwest tip of the state and consisted of Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Holt, Nodaway, and Platte counties.

In Missouri, the county level of government comes between those of the city and the state. Its primary responsibilities include maintaining roads, providing security, prosecuting criminals, and collecting taxes. Elected officials at this level include a sheriff, prosecuting attorney, and assessor.

Most of the counties in Missouri are named after politicians. One such county, Cass, was originally named Van Buren County after President Martin Van Buren, and was changed to its present name in support of Van Buren&#x27;s Democratic opponent Lewis Cass during the presidential election of 1848. Other counties are named after war heroes, natural resources, explorers, and former U.S. territories.

The city of St. Louis is an independent city, and is not within the limits of a county. Its residents voted to secede from St. Louis County in 1876. Throughout the United States, St. Louis is one of three independent cities outside the state of Virginia (the other two are Baltimore, Maryland, and Carson City, Nevada).

Population figures are based on the 2023 Census estimate. According to that census estimate, the population of Missouri is 6,196,156, an increase of 0.7% from 2020. The average population of Missouri&#x27;s counties is 53,880; St. Louis County is the most populous (987,059), and Worth County is the least (1,907). The average land area is . The largest county is Texas County (1,179 sq mi, 3,054 km2) and the smallest is St. Louis city (61.9 sq mi, 160 km2). 

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties, and is provided for each entry. These codes link to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s &quot;quick facts&quot; for each county. To distinguish from counties in other states, one must use Missouri&#x27;s FIPS code, 29. For example, Adair County&#x27;s unique nationwide identifier is 29001.

<text>There are 16 counties and one independent city in the U.S. state of Nevada. On November 25, 1861, the first Nevada Territorial Legislature established nine counties. Nevada was admitted to the Union on October 31, 1864, with 11 counties. In 1969, Ormsby County and Carson City were consolidated into a single municipal government known as Carson City.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Churchill County, Nevada is 001, Alameda County, California and Baker County, Oregon are also 001. To uniquely identify Churchill County, Nevada, one must use the state code of 32 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Churchill County, Nevada is 32001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.

<text>There are ten counties in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. Five of the counties were created in 1769, when New Hampshire was still an English colony and not a state, during the first subdivision of the state into counties. The last counties created were Belknap County and Carroll County, in 1840.

The majority of New Hampshire&#x27;s counties were named for prominent British or American people or geographic locations and features. Only one county&#x27;s name originates in a Native American language: Coös County, named for an Algonquian word meaning &quot;small pines&quot;.

The counties tend to be smaller in land area towards the southern end of the state, where New Hampshire population is concentrated, and larger in land area in the less populous north.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Belknap County, New Hampshire is 001, Addison County, Vermont and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Belknap County, New Hampshire, one must use the state code of 33 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Belknap County, New Hampshire is 33001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.

<text>There are 33 counties in the U.S. state of New Mexico.

The New Mexico Territory was organized in September 1850. The first nine counties in the territory to be created, in 1852, were Bernalillo, Doña Ana, Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Santa Fe, Socorro, Taos, and Valencia Counties. Mora County was created in 1860. Following the Gadsden Purchase of 1853–1854, the northeasternmost part of the New Mexico Territory was ceded to the new Colorado Territory in February 1861, before the western half was reorganized as the Arizona Territory in February 1863, establishing New Mexico&#x27;s present-day boundaries.

Grant County was created in 1868, followed by Colfax and Lincoln Counties in 1869. In 1876, Santa Ana County was absorbed by Bernalillo County. A further 14 counties were then created between 1884 and 1909, bringing the total number to 26.

New Mexico was admitted to the Union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. De Baca and Lea Counties were created in 1917, followed by Hidalgo County in 1920 and Catron and Harding Counties in 1921. Los Alamos County was created in 1949 and finally Cibola County in 1981, bringing the total number of counties to 33.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. New Mexico&#x27;s code is 35, which when combined with any county code would be written as 35XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county. 

==List==

For comparison, the population estimate for the state of New Mexico as of July 2011 was 2,082,224, and the area was mi2 (315,194 km2).

==Former counties==
* Arizona County, New Mexico Territory, is mentioned in the 1860 United States census.
* Mesilla County, appears on 1860s-era territorial map encompassing area in present-day Dona Aña, Grant, Hidalgo, Luna, Sierra west of the Rio Grande
* Santa Ana County (1844–1876) absorbed by Bernalillo County; portions are in present-day McKinley County
* Santa Fe County, Texas (1848–1850), never organized, included the portion of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande except for southeastern New Mexico east of the Pecos River and south of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River as well as the Trans-Pecos and most of the Panhandle regions of Texas, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and portions of Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming. Before Texas ceded its western lands to the federal government after the Compromise of 1850, the following counties were briefly created from Santa Fe County earlier that year in south-central New Mexico between the Rio Grande and the Pecos:
** El Paso County, Texas
** Worth County, Texas

<doc id="58312" wikidata="Q1412139" url="?curid=58312" title="List of counties in West Virginia">
<text>The U.S. state of West Virginia has 55 counties. Fifty of them existed at the time of the Wheeling Convention in 1861, during the American Civil War, when those counties seceded from the Commonwealth of Virginia to form the new state of West Virginia. West Virginia was admitted as a separate state of the United States on June 20, 1863. Five additional counties (Grant, Mineral, Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo) were formed from the original counties in the decades following admission.

After the Civil War, Berkeley County and Jefferson County, the two easternmost counties of West Virginia, refused to recognize their inclusion in the state, and the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation attempting to reclaim them. In March 1866, the United States Congress passed a joint mandate assenting to their inclusion in the new state, and the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed this outcome in the case of &quot;Virginia v. West Virginia&quot; (1871).

The West Virginia Constitution was ratified in 1872, replacing the state constitution created in 1863 when West Virginia became a state. Article 9, Section 8, of the West Virginia Constitution permits the creation of additional counties if a majority of citizens in the proposed new county vote for its creation and the new county has a minimum area of and a population of at least 6,000. Creation of a new county is prohibited if it would bring another county below these thresholds. Three counties (Greenbrier, Kanawha, and Randolph) have sufficient population (based on the 2020 United States Census) and land area to allow a new county to be split off. The remaining counties cannot be split, as either their land area would decrease to under 400 square miles, or their population would decrease to below 6,000.

The role of counties in local government had been minimized under the 1863 constitution, which vested most local government authority in a system of townships based on the New England model. The authors of the 1872 constitution chose to return to the system used in Virginia, in which each county was governed by a county court with combined authority for executive, legislative, and judicial functions of the county government. In 1880, West Virginia amended its constitution and replaced the county court system with an arrangement that divides county government powers between seven county offices, each of which is independently elected: the county commission, county clerk, circuit clerk, county sheriff, county assessor, county prosecuting attorney, and county surveyor of lands. Counties have only those powers that are expressly granted to them by the state Constitution or by state statute. These powers include, but are not limited to, maintaining the infrastructure of the state, funding libraries, maintaining jails and hospitals, and waste disposal. Reforming public education became a county function in 1933. In May 1933, a county unit plan was adopted. Under this plan, the state&#x27;s 398 school districts were consolidated into the current 55 county school systems. This enabled public schools to be funded more economically and saved West Virginia millions of dollars.

Randolph County is the largest by area at , and Hancock County is the smallest at . Kanawha County contributed land to the founding of 12 West Virginia counties and has the largest population (174,805 in 2023). Wirt County has the smallest population (5,000 in 2023). The oldest county is Hampshire, established in 1754, and the newest is Mingo, established in 1895. Spruce Knob, located in Pendleton County, is the state&#x27;s highest point at . Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes, which are used by the United States government to identify counties uniquely, are five-digit numbers. For West Virginia, they start with 54 and end with the three-digit county code (for example, Barbour County has FIPS code 54001). Each county&#x27;s code is provided in the table below, linked to census data for that county.

<text>There are 72 counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The land that eventually became Wisconsin was transferred from British to American control with the 1783 signing of the Treaty of Paris. It was an unorganized part of the Northwest Territory until 1802 when all of the land from St. Louis north to the Canadian border was organized as St. Clair County. When Illinois was admitted to the union in 1818, Wisconsin became part of the Territory of Michigan and divided into two counties: Brown County in the northeast along Lake Michigan and Crawford County in the southwest along the Mississippi River. Iowa County was formed in 1829 from the Crawford County land south of the Wisconsin River. Brown County&#x27;s southern portion was used to form Milwaukee County in 1834. The state of Wisconsin was created from Wisconsin Territory on May 29, 1848, with 28 counties.

The most populous county in the state is Milwaukee County at 916,205 people at the 2023 Census estimate. The county with the least population is Menominee County with 4,226 residents; the Menominee Indian Reservation is co-extensive with the county. Pepin County is the smallest in area, with ; Marathon is the largest, having .

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Wisconsin&#x27;s code is 55, which when combined with any county code would be written as 55XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

== Governance ==
Each county has a county seat, often a populous or centrally located community, where the county&#x27;s governmental offices are located. Some of the services provided by the county include: law enforcement, circuit courts, social services, vital records and deed registration, road maintenance, and snow removal. County officials include sheriffs, district attorneys, clerks, treasurers, coroners, surveyors, registers of deeds, and clerks of circuit court; these officers are elected for four-year terms. In most counties, elected coroners have been replaced by appointed medical examiners. State law permits counties to appoint a registered land surveyor in place of electing a surveyor.

Counties in Wisconsin are governed by county boards, headed by a chairperson. Counties with a population of 500,000 or more must also have a county executive. Smaller counties may have either a county executive or a county administrator. As of 2011, 13 counties had elected county executives: Brown, Chippewa, Dane, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Milwaukee, Outagamie, Portage, Racine, Sawyer, Waukesha, and Winnebago. 23 had an appointed county administrator, 34 had an appointed administrative coordinator, and 2 had neither an executive nor an administrator. Waukesha County had both an executive and an administrator.

==List of counties==

























==Renamed counties==
Five counties in Wisconsin have been renamed, but otherwise kept their same borders.

* Bad Axe County existed from 1851 to 1862. It was named after the Bad Axe River and the Battle of Bad Axe. It was renamed to Vernon County in 1862.
* Dallas County existed for 10 years, from 1859 to 1869. It was named after George M. Dallas, the 11th vice president of the United States. It was named to Barron County in 1869.
* Gates County existed from 1901 to 1905. It was named after Milwaukee land speculator James L. Gates. It was renamed to Rusk County in 1905. 
* La Pointe County existed from 1845 to 1866. In 1848, when Wisconsin achieved statehood, La Pointe County was split between Wisconsin and Minnesota. It was renamed to Bayfield County in 1866.
* New County existed briefly between 1879 and 1880. It was formed from part of Oconto County. It was renamed to Langlade County in 1880. 

== Proposed counties ==
Two proposed counties were ultimately not established.

* In 1850, Tuskola County was proposed as a new subdivision of Washington County. The proposed borders lie within the modern Washington and Ozaukee counties.

* In 1997, Century County was proposed, for creation after the year 2000, as a merger of Wood, Clark, and Marathon counties that would be centered around the city of Marshfield. The name was selected to represent &quot;a new county for a new century&quot;. Problems associated with Frac Sand mining rekindled the idea in 2012.

<text>There are 23 counties in the U.S. state of Wyoming. There were originally five counties in the Wyoming Territory: Laramie and Carter, established in 1867; Carbon and Albany established in 1868; and Uinta, an annexed portion of Utah and Idaho, extending from Montana (including Yellowstone Park) to the Wyoming–Utah boundary. On July 10, 1890, Wyoming was admitted to the Union with thirteen counties in it. Ten more counties were created after statehood.

Two counties were renamed after their creation. Carter County was renamed Sweetwater County on December 1, 1869. Pease County, formed in 1875, was renamed Johnson County in 1879.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Wyoming&#x27;s code is 56, which when combined with any county code would be written as 56XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

<doc id="58316" wikidata="Q15708621" url="?curid=58316" title="Haematomyzus">
<text>The genus Haematomyzus includes three species of lice that differ so markedly from all other lice that the genus is placed in its own family Haematomyzidae, itself monotypic within the superfamily Rhynchophthirina. These unusual lice are ectoparasites of elephants and warthogs. Their mouthparts are elongated to form a drill-like structure that allows them to penetrate the thick skin of their host.

==Taxonomy==
The three species, &quot;Haematomyzus elephantis&quot; (elephant louse), &quot;Haematomyzus hopkinsi&quot; (warthog louse) and &quot;Haematomyzus porci&quot; (red river hog louse) belong to a single family, the Haematomyzidae, itself the only family within Rhynchophthirina. A molecular phylogenetic study using subunit rRNA sequences suggests a placement of the Rhychophthirina as a sister group of the Anoplura.
== Host records ==
&quot;H. elephantis&quot; is known from both the African and Asian Elephant in captivity but the species found in the wild are thought to have coevolved with their hosts and further study is required.

== Notes ==
The first spelling of &quot;Rhyncophthirina&quot; by Ferris was a lapse, and in subsequent use of the term he spelled it &quot;Rhynchophthirina&quot; adding the second &quot;h&quot;. Ordinal names are not covered by the International Code of Nomenclature and thus the name and spelling comes down to a matter of personal preference. The majority of phthirapterists spell the suborder as &quot;Rhynchophthirina&quot; as did Hopkins and Clay, 1952, and Price &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003.

<doc id="58317" wikidata="Q3155167" url="?curid=58317" title="Ischnocera">
<text>The Ischnocera is a large superfamily of lice. They are mostly parasitic on birds, but including a large family (the Trichodectidae) parasitic on mammals. The genus &quot;Trichophilopterus&quot; is also found on mammals (lemurs), but probably belongs to the &quot;avian Ischnocera&quot; and represents a host switch from birds to mammals. It is a chewing louse, which feeds on the feathers and skin debris of birds. Many of the avian Ischnocera have evolved an elongated body shape. This allows them to conceal themselves between the feather shafts and avoid being dislodged during preening or flight.

The taxonomy of the group is in need of revision, as several phylogenetic studies have found the group to be paraphyletic, specifically in regards to the two major families Philopteridae and Trichodectidae. In order to resolve this, in 2020 de Moya &quot;et al.&quot; proposed retaining the majority of the species (including Philopteridae) within Ischnocera, and then moving Trichodectidae to its own grouping called Trichodectera.

Ischnocera currently consists of the following families:
* Philopteroidea
** Goniodidae
** Heptapsogasteridae
** Lipeuridae
** Philopteridae 
** Trichophilopteridae
* Trichodectoidea
** Bovicolidae
** Dasyonygidae
** Trichodectidae

<doc id="58318" wikidata="Q1936744" url="?curid=58318" title="Amblycera">
<text>The Amblycera are a large clade of chewing lice,
 parasitic on both birds and mammals. The Amblycera are considered the most primitive clade of lice.

== Description ==
These insects are very much like the familiar advanced sucking lice, except they do not stay on their host permanently. They roam freely over the surface of their host and, unlike other lice, do not form permanent attachments. They feed by chewing soft areas of skin, causing an area of localized bleeding from which they drink.

Species of this group have antennae but they cannot readily be seen because they lie in grooves in the side of the head. Usually the antennae of Amblycera composes 4-5 segments. The maxillary palps may, however, be present and these may be visible in mounted specimens but may be confused with the antennae. Palps of amblycerans ranges in segments from two to five. The mandibles of Amblycera bite horizontally. The head is often broader and rounder anteriorly than of Anoplura but this morphologic difference is not reliable. The tarsi of species that parasitise birds have two claws, while of those that parasitise mammals have one only.

==Families==
The Amblycera are divided into the following families:
* Ancistronidae
* Boopidae 
* Colpocephalidae 
* Gliricolidae
* Gyropidae 
* Laemobothriidae 
* Menoponidae 
* Pseudomenoponidae 
* Ricinidae 
* Somaphantidae 
* Trimenoponidae
* Trinotonidae 

==Significant species==
Notable Amblycera that parasitise birds:
* &quot;Holomenopon leucoxanthum&quot; – cause of &quot;wet feathers&quot; of ducks
* &quot;Menopon gallinae&quot; – the &quot;shaft louse&quot; of poultry, pale yellow in color
* &quot;Menopon phaeostomum&quot; – usually occurs on peafowl
* &quot;Menecanthus stramineus&quot; – the yellow &quot;body louse&quot; of poultry
* &quot;Trinoton anserinum&quot; – may be found on ducks and swans

Notable species that parasitise mammals:
* &quot;Gliricola porcelli&quot; – on guinea-pigs
* &quot;Gyropus ovalis&quot; – on guinea-pigs
* &quot;Heterodoxus longitarsus&quot; – on Macropodidae (wallabies and kangaroos)
* &quot;Heterodoxus macropus&quot; – on Macropodidae
* &quot;Heterodoxus spiniger&quot; – common on dogs in warm countries (between latitudes 40° north and 40° south)
* &quot;Trimenopon hispidium&quot; – on guinea-pigs

<text>A serial number is a unique identifier used to &quot;uniquely&quot; identify an item, and is usually assigned incrementally or sequentially.

Despite being called serial &quot;numbers&quot;, they do not need to be strictly numerical and may contain letters and other typographical symbols, or may consist entirely of a character string.
==Applications of serial numbering==
Serial numbers identify otherwise identical individual units, thereby serving various practical uses. Serial numbers are a deterrent against theft and counterfeit products, as they can be recorded, and stolen or otherwise irregular goods can be identified. Banknotes and other transferable documents of value bear serial numbers to assist in preventing counterfeiting and tracing stolen ones. 

They are valuable in quality control, as once a defect is found in the production of a particular batch of product, the serial number will identify which units are affected. Some items with serial numbers are automobiles, firearms, electronics, and appliances.

==Smartphones and other smart devices==
 In smartphones, serial numbers are extended to the integrated components in addition to the electronic device as a whole, also known as serialization. This gives unique individual parts such as the screen, battery, chip and camera a separate serial number. This is queried by the software for proper release for use. This practice by manufacturers limits the &quot;serial number&quot; electronic devices.

===Serial numbers for intangible goods===
Serial numbers may be used to identify individual physical or intangible objects; for example, computer software or the right to play an online multiplayer game. The purpose and application is different. A software serial number, otherwise called a product key, is usually not embedded in the software but is assigned to a specific user with a right to use the software. The software will function only if a potential user enters a valid product code. The vast majority of possible codes are rejected by the software. If an unauthorized user is found to be using the software, the legitimate user can be identified from the code. It is usually not impossible, however, for an unauthorized user to create a valid but unallocated code either by trying many possible codes, or reverse engineering the software; use of unallocated codes can be monitored if the software makes an Internet connection.

==Other uses of the term==
The term &quot;serial number&quot; is sometimes used for codes which do not identify a single instance of something. For example, the International Standard Serial Number or ISSN used on magazines, journals and other periodicals, an equivalent to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) applied to books, is assigned to each &quot;periodical&quot;. It takes its name from the library science use of the word &quot;serial&quot; to mean a periodical.

Certificates and certificate authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic, again not identifying a single instance of the content being protected.

===Military and government use===
The term &quot;serial number&quot; is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression &quot;service number&quot;. In air forces, the serial number is used to uniquely identify individual aircraft and is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft fuselage, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft&#x27;s fin/rudder(s). Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a &quot;tail number&quot;.
In the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the individual serial takes the form of two letters followed by three digits, e.g., &quot;BT308&quot;—the prototype Avro Lancaster, or &quot;XS903&quot;—an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook. During the Second World War RAF aircraft that were secret or carrying secret equipment had &quot;/G&quot; (for &quot;Guard&quot;) appended to the serial, denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., &quot;LZ548/G&quot;—the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or &quot;ML926/G&quot;—a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this scheme the RAF, and predecessor Royal Flying Corps (RFC), utilized a serial consisting of a letter followed by four figures, e.g., &quot;D8096&quot;—a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or &quot;K5054&quot;—the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The serial number follows the aircraft throughout its period of service.

In 2009, the U.S. FDA published draft guidance for the pharmaceutical industry to use serial numbers on prescription drug packages. This measure is intended to enhance the traceability of drugs and to help prevent counterfeiting.

==Serial number arithmetic==
Serial numbers are often used in network protocols. However, most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers, but not other recently allocated serial numbers. To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, &quot;Serial Number Arithmetic&quot;, defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers.

Lollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated sit for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols.

<text>In fluid dynamics, potential flow or irrotational flow refers to a description of a fluid flow with no vorticity in it. Such a description typically arises in the limit of vanishing viscosity, i.e., for an inviscid fluid and with no vorticity present in the flow.

Potential flow describes the velocity field as the gradient of a scalar function: the velocity potential. As a result, a potential flow is characterized by an irrotational velocity field, which is a valid approximation for several applications. The irrotationality of a potential flow is due to the curl of the gradient of a scalar always being equal to zero.

In the case of an incompressible flow the velocity potential satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation, and potential theory is applicable. However, potential flows also have been used to describe compressible flows and Hele-Shaw flows. The potential flow approach occurs in the modeling of both stationary as well as nonstationary flows. 

Applications of potential flow include: the outer flow field for aerofoils, water waves, electroosmotic flow, and groundwater flow. For flows (or parts thereof) with strong vorticity effects, the potential flow approximation is not applicable. In flow regions where vorticity is known to be important, such as wakes and boundary layers, potential flow theory is not able to provide reasonable predictions of the flow. Fortunately, there are often large regions of a flow where the assumption of irrotationality is valid which is why potential flow is used for various applications. For instance in: flow around aircraft, groundwater flow, acoustics, water waves, and electroosmotic flow.

==Description and characteristics==
In potential or irrotational flow, the vorticity vector field is zero, i.e., 

formula_1

where formula_2 is the velocity field and formula_3 is the vorticity field. Like any vector field having zero curl, the velocity field can be expressed as the gradient of certain scalar, say formula_4 which is called the velocity potential, since the curl of the gradient is always zero. We therefore have

formula_5

The velocity potential is not uniquely defined since one can add to it an arbitrary function of time, say formula_6, without affecting the relevant physical quantity which is formula_7. The non-uniqueness is usually removed by suitably selecting appropriate initial or boundary conditions satisfied by formula_8 and as such the procedure may vary from one problem to another.

In potential flow, the circulation formula_9 around any simply-connected contour formula_10 is zero. This can be shown using the Stokes theorem, 

formula_11

where formula_12 is the line element on the contour and formula_13 is the area element of any surface bounded by the contour. In multiply-connected space (say, around a contour enclosing solid body in two dimensions or around a contour enclosing a torus in three-dimensions) or in the presence of concentrated vortices, (say, in the so-called irrotational vortices or point vortices, or in smoke rings), the circulation formula_9 need not be zero. In the former case, Stokes theorem cannot be applied and in the later case, formula_15 is non-zero within the region bounded by the contour. Around a contour encircling an infinitely long solid cylinder with which the contour loops formula_16 times, we have 

formula_17

where formula_18 is a cyclic constant. This example belongs to a doubly-connected space. In an formula_19-tuply connected space, there are formula_20 such cyclic constants, namely, formula_21

==Incompressible flow==
In case of an incompressible flow — for instance of a liquid, or a gas at low Mach numbers; but not for sound waves — the velocity has zero --&gt;
If , the streamlines are given by

formula_22

This is more easily interpreted in terms of real and imaginary components:
formula_23

Thus the streamlines are circles that are tangent to the x-axis at the origin. The circles in the upper half-plane thus flow clockwise, those in the lower half-plane flow anticlockwise. Note that the velocity components are proportional to ; and their values at the origin is infinite. This flow pattern is usually referred to as a doublet, or dipole, and can be interpreted as the combination of a source-sink pair of infinite strength kept an infinitesimally small distance apart. The velocity field is given by

formula_24

or in polar coordinates:

formula_25

==== Power laws with : quadrupole ====
If , the streamlines are given by

formula_26

This is the flow field associated with a quadrupole.

===Line source and sink===
A line source or sink of strength formula_27 (formula_28 for source and formula_29 for sink) is given by the potential

formula_30

where formula_27 in fact is the volume flux per unit length across a surface enclosing the source or sink. The velocity field in polar coordinates are

formula_32

i.e., a purely radial flow.

===Line vortex===
A line vortex of strength formula_9 is given by

formula_34

where formula_9 is the circulation around any simple closed contour enclosing the vortex. The velocity field in polar coordinates are

formula_36

i.e., a purely azimuthal flow.

==Analysis for three-dimensional incompressible flows==
For three-dimensional flows, complex potential cannot be obtained.

===Point source and sink===
The velocity potential of a point source or sink of strength formula_27 (formula_28 for source and formula_29 for sink) in spherical polar coordinates is given by

formula_40

where formula_27 in fact is the volume flux across a closed surface enclosing the source or sink. The velocity field in spherical polar coordinates are

formula_42

<text>A psychic is a person who claims to use powers rooted in parapsychology, such as extrasensory perception (ESP), to identify information hidden from the normal senses, particularly involving telepathy or clairvoyance; or who performs acts that are apparently inexplicable by natural laws, such as psychokinesis or teleportation. Although many people believe in psychic abilities, the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers, and describes the practice as pseudoscience.

Psychics encompass people in a variety of roles. Some are theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use various techniques, e.g. prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading, to produce the appearance of such abilities for entertainment purposes. A large industry and network exist whereby people advertised as psychics provide advice and counsel to clients. Some famous psychics include Edgar Cayce, Ingo Swann, Peter Hurkos, Janet Lee, Miss Cleo, John Edward, Sylvia Browne, and Tyler Henry. Psychic powers are asserted by psychic detectives and in practices such as psychic archaeology and even psychic surgery.

Critics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion. In 1988 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences gave a report on the subject and concluded there is &quot;no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena&quot;. A study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition. Attempts to repeat the results, which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it, &quot;failed to produce significant effects&quot; and thus &quot;do not support the existence of psychic ability&quot; of this kind.

Psychics are sometimes featured in science fiction and fantasy fiction. Examples of fiction featuring characters with psychic powers include the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, which features &quot;Force-sensitive&quot; beings who can see into the future and move objects telekinetically, along with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and some of the works of Stephen King, amongst many others.

==History==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;psychic&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;psychikos&quot; (&quot;of the mind&quot; or &quot;mental&quot;), and refers in part to the human mind or psyche (ex. &quot;psychic turmoil&quot;). The Greek word also means &quot;soul&quot;. In Greek mythology, the maiden Psyche was the deification of the human soul. The word derivation of the Latin &quot;psȳchē&quot; is from the Greek &quot;psȳchḗ&quot;, literally &quot;breath&quot;, derivative of &quot;psȳ́chein&quot;, to breathe or to blow (hence, to live).

French astronomer and spiritualist Camille Flammarion is credited as having first used the word psychic, while it was later introduced to the English language by Edward William Cox in the 1870s.

===Early seers and prophets===
Elaborate systems of divination and fortune-telling date back to ancient times. Perhaps the most widely known system of early civilization fortune-telling was astrology, where practitioners believed the relative positions of celestial bodies could lend insight into people&#x27;s lives and even predict their future circumstances. Some fortune-tellers were said to be able to make predictions without the use of these elaborate systems (or in conjunction with them), through some sort of direct apprehension or vision of the future. These people were known as seers or prophets, and in later times as clairvoyants (French word meaning &quot;clear sight&quot; or &quot;clear seeing&quot;) and psychics.

Seers formed a functionary role in early civilization, often serving as advisors, priests, and judges. A number of examples are included in biblical accounts. The book of 1 Samuel (Chapter 9) illustrates one such functionary task when Samuel is asked to find the donkeys of the future king Saul. The role of prophet appeared perennially in ancient cultures. In Egypt, the priests of the sun deity Ra at Memphis acted as seers. In ancient Assyria seers were referred to as &quot;nabu&quot;, meaning &quot;to call&quot; or &quot;announce&quot;.

The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC. It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice. The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia&#x27;s state of inspiration.

One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503–1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book &quot;Les Prophéties&quot;, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies, as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.

Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus&#x27; quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.

Englishwoman Mother Shipton demonstrated psychic abilities from her youth and foresaw historical events in the 16th century. In addition to the belief that some historical figures were endowed with a predisposition to psychic experiences, some psychic abilities were thought to be available to everyone on occasion. For example, the belief in prophetic dreams was common and persistent in many ancient cultures.

===Nineteenth-century progression===

In the mid-nineteenth century, Modern Spiritualism became prominent in the United States and the United Kingdom. The movement&#x27;s distinguishing feature was the belief that the spirits of the dead could be contacted by mediums to lend insight to the living. The movement was fueled in part by anecdotes of psychic powers. One such person believed to have extraordinary abilities was Daniel Dunglas Home, who gained fame during the Victorian period for his reported ability to levitate to various heights and speak to the dead.

As the Spiritualist movement grew, other comparable groups arose, including the Theosophical Society, which was co-founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky (1831–1891). Theosophy coupled spiritualist elements with Eastern mysticism and was influential in the early 20th century, later influencing the New Age movement during the 1970s. Blavatsky herself claimed numerous psychic powers.

===Late twentieth century===
By the late twentieth century, psychics were commonly associated with New Age culture. Psychic readings and advertising for psychics were common from the 1960s on, as readings were offered for a fee and given in settings such as over the phone, in a home, or at psychic fairs.

==Popular culture==

===Belief in psychic abilities===
In a 1990 survey of members of the National Academy of Sciences, only 2% of the respondents thought that extrasensory perception had been scientifically demonstrated, with another 2% thinking that the phenomena happened sometimes. Asked about research in the field, 22% thought that it should be discouraged, 63% that it should be allowed but not encouraged, and 10% that it should be encouraged; neuroscientists were the most hostile to parapsychology of all the specialties.

A survey of the beliefs of the general United States population about paranormal topics was conducted by The Gallup Organization in 2005. The survey found that 41 percent of those polled believed in extrasensory perception and 26 percent believed in clairvoyance. 31 percent of those surveyed indicated that they believe in telepathy or psychic communication.

A poll of 439 college students conducted in 2006 by researchers Bryan Farha of Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward of University of Central Oklahoma, suggested that college seniors and graduate students were more likely to believe in psychic phenomena than college freshmen. Twenty-three percent of college freshmen expressed a belief in paranormal ideas. The percentage was greater among college seniors (31%) and graduate students (34%). The poll showed lower belief in psychic phenomena among science students than social science and education students.

Some people also believe that anyone can have psychic abilities which can be activated or enhanced through the study and practice of various disciplines and techniques such as meditation and divination, with a number of books and websites being dedicated to instruction in these methods. Another popular belief is that psychic ability is hereditary, with a psychic parent passing their abilities on to their children.

===Science fiction===

Psychic abilities are common in science fiction, often under the term &quot;psionics&quot;. They may be depicted as innate and heritable, as in Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;Slan&quot;, Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s Talents universe series or setting, and the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Another recurring trope is the conveyance of psychic power through psychoactive drugs, as in the &quot;Dune&quot; novels and indirectly in the &quot;Scanners&quot; films, as well as the ghosts in the &quot;StarCraft&quot; franchise. Somewhat differently, in Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot; and Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, psychic abilities may be achieved by any human who learns the proper mental discipline, known as &quot;kything&quot; in the former work. Popular movies include &quot;The Initiation of Sarah&quot;. Psychic characters are also common in superhero comics, for instance Jean Grey, Professor X and Emma Frost as well as many others from the Marvel Comics&#x27; X-Men. More characters include the characters Raven Baxter and Booker Baxter from the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Raven&#x27;s Home&quot;. The Disney Channel Original Series &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot; features recurring characters Cara and Sara, who are twin psychics claimed to be the descendants of the Oracle of Delphi, their visions also contrast their personalities (Cara is a Goth that sees only positive visions, while Sara is always in a good mood despite only seeing negative visions).

==Criticism and research==
 Parapsychological research has attempted to use random number generators to test for psychokinesis, mild sensory deprivation in the Ganzfeld experiment to test for extrasensory perception, and research trials conducted under contract by the U.S. government to investigate remote viewing. Critics such as Ed J. Gracely say that this evidence is not sufficient for acceptance, partly because the intrinsic probability of psychic phenomena is very small.

Critics such as Ray Hyman and the National Science Foundation suggest that parapsychology has methodological flaws that can explain the experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience. This has largely been due to a lack of replication of results by independent experimenters.

The evidence presented for psychic phenomena is not sufficiently verified for scientific acceptance, and there exist many non-paranormal alternative explanations for claimed instances of psychic events. Parapsychologists, who generally believe that there is some evidence for psychic ability, disagree with critics who believe that no psychic ability exists and that many of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena such as mediumism, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading, hot reading, or even self-delusion. Cold reading techniques would include psychics using flattery, intentionally making descriptions, statements or predictions about a person vague and ambiguous, and surreptitiously moving on to another prediction when the psychic deems the audience to be non-responsive. Magicians such as James Randi, Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, but they present physical and psychological explanations as opposed to paranormal ones.

In January 2008 the results of a study using neuroimaging were published. To provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions, the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had participants who are biologically or emotionally related, such as twins. The experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition occurred, but despite this, no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic stimuli and non-psychic stimuli, while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on patterns of brain activation. The researchers concluded that &quot;These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena.&quot; James Alcock had cautioned the researchers against the wording of said statement.

A detailed study of Sylvia Browne predictions about missing persons and murder cases found that despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, &quot;Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case&quot;. Concerning the television psychics, James Underdown states that testing psychics in a studio setting is difficult as there are too many areas to control: the psychic could be getting help from anyone on the set. The editor controls everything; they can make a psychic look superior or ridiculous depending on direction from the producer. In an Independent Investigations Group &quot;exposé&quot; of John Edward and James Van Praagh they discovered that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were &quot;substantially different in the accuracy. They&#x27;re getting rid of the wrong guesses... Once you pull back the curtain and see how it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s not impressive at all.&quot;

Richard Saunders, Chief Investigator for the Australian Skeptics, and producer and presenter of &quot;The Skeptic Zone&quot; podcast sought to answer the question “Can self-proclaimed psychics predict unlikely future events with any greater accuracy than chance?” To answer that question he launched &quot;The Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project&quot;. Over the course of 12 years, Saunders and then Saunders and his international team of skeptics - Michelle Bijkersma, Kelly Burke, Susan Gerbic, Adrienne Hill, Louis Hillman, Wendy Hughes, Paula Lauterbach, Dr. Angie Mattke, Rob Palmer, and Leonard Tramiel - searched through Australian published media for individuals making psychic or otherwise paranormal predictions.

The goal of the Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project was to collect and then vet the accuracy of every published psychic prediction in Australia since the year 2000. The team analyzed over 3800 predictions made by 207 psychics over the years 2000 to 2020. While a few of the psychic predictions were about events outside of Australia, the predictions primarily focused on celebrities, scandals, natural disasters, weather patterns, sports, and real estate trends.

The results of the analysis of the predictions found that psychics were correct 11% of the time, wrong 35% of the time, and that some predictions were too vague to characterize (19%) or the predicted outcome was so obvious it was to be expected (15%). Two percent of the predictions were unable to be categorized.

The main conclusions of the Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project were: &lt;br&gt;“Psychics are appallingly bad at predicting future events.” &lt;br&gt; “Most predictions were too vague, expected, or simply wrong.” &lt;br&gt; “Most of what happens is not predicted, and most of what is predicted does not happen.”

The Project confirmed that even when considering the margin of error, it is difficult to come to any other conclusion except that people who claim to see into the future cannot do so with a rate of success better than that of educated guesswork, chance, or luck.

==Psychic fraud==
In an article reported by Pat Foran in CTV News-Toronto, an Ontario woman, known as Marie Jean, depressed after having to sell her home, began seeing a psychic who went by the name of Maha Dev. Marie Jean reported that Dev claimed she was surrounded by &quot;evil spirits&quot; and that &quot;(her) life could be in danger and (her) sons could lose their lives.&quot; The initial payment requested was $10,000 to remove the spirits, but in subsequent visits Dev indicated that the spirits were &quot;too strong&quot; and more money was needed. In total, the woman paid $46,000 before deciding she had been &quot;duped.&quot; After Marie Jean reported the incident to CTV News, CTV News contacted the psychic. While Dev did not admit to knowing the woman, the money was refunded in full the next day.

Falling for a psychic scam can result in a loss of one&#x27;s entire life savings. In an example given in an article by Rob Palmer a woman gave a psychic $41,642 over a period of 10 weeks. The woman had contacted Palmer for help, who put her in contact with Bob Nygaard, a private investigator who specializes in psychic fraud cases. Palmer had previously written articles about Nygaard and the work he was doing.

It is apparently difficult to get cases of psychic fraud prosecuted as a crime. Palmer states &quot;when someone reports to law enforcement that they are a victim of this type of fraud, they are often turned away and told it is a civil matter.&quot; Palmer goes on to discuss Thomas John and other famous &quot;psychics&quot; who were proven to be frauds. Investigator Ben Radford states that &quot;scammers use various psychological principles to ensnare their prey&quot;. Their state of mind, belief in psychic abilities, unhappiness with something happening in their lives and looking for answers. The psychic will instruct the client not to tell their friends or family as they know they may be warned away from the psychic.

With curse removal, the psychic may say that the magic will not work or get worse if they do tell anyone about their involvement with the psychic. The con games from psychics, according to Radford, can &quot;play out over the course of weeks, months, or even years.&quot; The psychic is playing the long game and looking to extract as much money as possible. Radford claims that when a victim realizes they have been scammed, often they are too embarrassed to come forward.

Skeptical activist Susan Gerbic has summarized a number of techniques, which she says are used by psychics to create their effects.

<doc id="58324" wikidata="Q1812303" url="?curid=58324" title="Mao (card game)">
<text>Mao (or Mau) is a card game of the shedding family. The aim is to get rid of all of the cards in hand without breaking certain unspoken rules which tend to vary by venue. The game is from a subset of the Stops family and is similar in structure to the card game Uno or Crazy Eights.

The game forbids its players from explaining the rules, and new players are often informed that &quot;the only rule you may be told is this one&quot;. The ultimate goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand. Specifics are discovered through trial and error. A player who breaks a rule is penalized by being given an additional card from the deck. The person giving the penalty must state what the incorrect action was, without explaining the rule that was broken.

There are many variants of Mao in existence. While beginners sometimes assume that the dealer (sometimes called the &quot;Chairman&quot;, the &quot;Mao&quot; or the &quot;Grand Master&quot;) and other experienced players are simply making up possibly inconsistent rules (as in the games Mornington Crescent or Fizbin), the rules of Mao are consistent within each game and can be followed correctly.

== History ==
Mao is most likely descended from the German game Mau Mau. It may have influenced the game Eleusis, which was published in Martin Gardner&#x27;s column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in June 1959. Both of these games share similar principles of inductive reasoning.

Other inductive games in which not all players know the rules include Penultima and Zendo; however, the secret rules in those games are made up at the start of play and disclosed at the end of each round, and the scope and subject matter of Eleusis, Penultima or Zendo rules may be more explicit and closely circumscribed.

Mao&#x27;s name and rules are a reference to Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s rule over China. The rules not being explained are an allusion to the laws in China at the time being in constant flux, leading to many people being arrested for laws they did not know were in place.

== Rules ==
Part of the traditional experience of Mao is a new player being forced to learn some or all of the rules of the game through observation and trial and error. Thus new players are not presented with a list of rules, as part of the game is to discover the rules through gameplay.

The exact set of rules divulged to new players varies between groups of players: some groups will say &quot;the only rule I can tell you is this one&quot;, others will reveal the goal of eliminating cards, and some might outline the basic rules and, in most cases, no rules are revealed at all. However much information is revealed, the players will explain that they are not allowed to reveal any more, and that the new player must deduce the full rules during play.

Mao rules can vary widely between different groups with no individual set of rules being canonical.

=== Rules of play ===
Each player is dealt an initial hand of the same number of cards; the exact number of cards dealt varies, but is generally either three or seven. The size of the deck also varies; it is good to have approximately one 52-card deck for every two or three players, but missing or extra cards are not important to gameplay. Two or more combined decks is common; matching card backs is not important. Once the cards are dealt, the remaining cards are placed face down in a stack in the middle of the table, and the top card from the stack is turned over and placed next to it. The dealer may then say &quot;this game of Mao has officially begun&quot;, &quot;the game of Mao begins now&quot;, &quot;Mao is a game of rules&quot; or a variant thereof. Play commences with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise. Many variants penalize players for touching or looking at their cards before the game begins, or before the dealer looks at their own cards.

A player may play any card from their hand matching the value or the suit of the top card currently face-up on the table. The card played must be placed on top of this card, and the next player will have to play a card that matches the new one. If the player has no cards they can play, they must instead draw a new card from the top of the stack and, in some variants, say something such as &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;penalty card&quot; or knock on the table to indicate inability to play a card.

Rules vary widely between variants. Some common rules include:
*A face value reverses order of play when played (commonly eight, sometimes two).
*Aces cause the next player to skip their turn.
*Jacks are wild, allowing any player to call out a new suit when a jack is played.
*Spade cards must be named when played (e.g., playing an ace of spades requires the player to say &quot;ace of spades&quot;).
*A seven forces the next player to draw a penalty card and requires the person who played it to announce &quot;have a nice day&quot;. If the next player also plays a seven, they announce &quot;have a very nice day&quot; and the player after that draws two penalty cards. The number of &quot;very&quot;s and penalty cards can increase as long as sevens can be played.

=== Variant rules ===
As might be expected in a game where the rules are unknown to many of the players, a wide variety of rulesets have developed.

The rules are typically changed between games, either at the beginning or with each successive game. Many times, this is simply that the winner of the last game is allowed to construct their own rule. This new rule is made known to the dealer or not, depending on the game, though in many varieties it is required for the dealer to know the rule in order to confirm its use and to enforce it. Often the winner of the last game is also made the new dealer.

In another variant, players abandon all normal rules and have each player make up a rule of their own at the very beginning of the game. This variant is known as &quot;Dutch Mao&quot;, or &quot;The People&#x27;s Democratic Dictatorship&quot;, and probably several other names. It has no restrictions on what cards to play (other than those made by the players) and can get very confusing when rules conflict.

=== Speaking ===
Many of the rules of Mao involve speech. Mostly this means that the right thing must be said at the right time. Saying the wrong thing, or speaking at the wrong time, will usually incur a penalty.

;No talking
:In most variants of Mao, no unnecessary speech is allowed, and one may only speak when required to do so by the rules. For example, if one plays a 6 of spades (with the declaring spades rule active), one is required to say &quot;six of spades&quot; and will be penalized for not doing so. But if one says, &quot;six of spades, I didn&#x27;t forget this time&quot; one will be penalized for the additional unnecessary speech. A different but common way to say this is &quot;excessive verbosity&quot;.
;Point of order
:Any player (or, in some variations, only the dealer) may at any time announce &quot;point of order&quot;, which is a signal for all players to put down their cards while discussion takes place.
;Thank you
:It may be required to thank the dealer for each penalty card. Usually a player is given a reasonable amount of time to say &quot;thank you&quot; before being penalized. Failure to say &quot;thank you&quot; after a penalty card will usually result in another penalty card. One &quot;thank you&quot; will usually cover for all occurrences where it was required.
;Last card
:Some variants require the player to announce when they have only one card left in their hand. This can be with the statement of &quot;last card&quot;, &quot;zin&quot;, &quot;one card left&quot; or &quot;Mao&quot; itself (similar to Uno). If a player fails to announce their last card, they receive a penalty card. In some versions, they continue to receive penalty cards until they announce their last card. At this point, because it is not their last card anymore, they are given three additional penalty cards in quick succession for &quot;lying, cheating, theft&quot;.
;End game
:Upon playing their last card, a player must call out &quot;Mao&quot;, &quot;game over&quot; or some other similar phrase to win. Should a player forget to say &quot;Mao&quot;, or call it incorrectly, they are penalized. Stacking penalties at this point can cause much grief to a player who has gleefully placed their last card down and proclaimed &quot;Mao&quot;, only to discover that they have broken some rule.
;Swearing
:Many variants prohibit swearing, whereas other variants consider swearing to be an exception to the prohibition on excessive verbosity. 
;&quot;Hail to the chairman&quot;
:In some variants, playing a king requires the player to say &quot;hail to the chairman&quot; (alluding to Chairman Mao) or &quot;all hail the chief&quot;, and playing a queen requires the player to say &quot;hail to the chairwoman&quot;, &quot;hail the chairman&#x27;s wife&quot;, &quot;all hail the chair lady&quot;, or &quot;all hail her Mighty Majesty the Queen of Spades&quot;. Then the other players are sometimes required to say &quot;all hail&quot;.
;&quot;Have a nice day&quot;
:Some versions of the game will require a player to tell the next player &quot;have a nice day&quot; upon playing a seven. For instance, if the next person was John, the player would say &quot;have a nice day John&quot;. Not doing so would result in a penalty card.
;Special card names
:In some variants, specific cards are given a name that is to be said instead of the real name of the card. For example, upon playing the nine of diamonds or a joker, a player might say &quot;that&#x27;s the badger!&quot; Failure to say this would result in a penalty card.

=== Points of order ===
Any player (or, in some variations, only the dealer) may at any time announce &quot;point of order&quot; (could also be &quot;court of law&quot;, &quot;point of information&quot;, &quot;point of interest&quot;, &quot;pevis&quot;, or &quot;coffee break&quot;), which is a signal for all players to put down their cards, while discussion takes place. A common abbreviation is &quot;P of O&quot;. This time period basically is an intermission to game play and often comes with its own set of rules. Some versions penalize for abbreviating &quot;point of order&quot; to &quot;P of O&quot;, which often confuses new players into thinking only the dealer or chairman is permitted to call a point of order. Most versions penalize players for touching their cards (including failing to put them down in a timely manner) during a point of order.

The objective of a point of order is to clarify uncertain aspects of gameplay: particularly to allow disputes over penalties to be resolved. A point of order may also be used to accommodate out-of-game necessities such as eating, shuffling the discard pile to form a new draw pile, etc. Some variants may impose restrictions or penalties on a player&#x27;s activities during a point of order:

*Players have to talk in the third person.
*Players are not allowed to say the phrase &quot;point of order&quot; during a point of order (this can usually be circumvented by saying abbreviations such as: &quot;point of O&quot;, &quot;P of order&quot;, &quot;P of O&quot;, &quot;point order&quot;, &quot;POO&quot;, &quot;P-Vo&quot;, &quot;Piffo&quot;, etc. and often has to be to actually call a penalty that would otherwise have the phrase &quot;point of order&quot; in it).

The point of order ends when any player (or, depending on local rules, only the dealer, or only the player that called point of order) announces &quot;end point of order&quot;, &quot;point taken&quot;, &quot;point of disorder&quot;, or &quot;pick your cards up&quot;, at which point the cards are picked back up and play resumes.

=== Penalties ===
The normal penalty for any offence in Mao is one card per offence, though as previously stated, offences are consecutively applied, making some offences harsher than others.

There is usually a time limit of approximately 5 to 10 seconds for each turn. If exceeded, the player gets a penalty card for delay of game or late play and either loses their turn or gets another penalty every five seconds thereafter to either comply with any violated rules, or play a card. Ruthless players who are familiar with the rules sometimes exploit this rule to confuse new players who are unfamiliar with game mechanics that change the order of play: for example, players might look expectantly at a particular player other than the one whose turn it is as if waiting for them to play, then penalizing that player for playing out of turn if they actually played, then immediately penalizing the player whose turn it actually is for delay of game.

For each penalty, unless the rules have been changed appropriately, the penalty card is given with the declaration of the rule violated.

In most cases, when a penalty is called, one card is given to the offender. If the call was incorrect, the caller of a penalty can be given the card back with a reason of &quot;bad call&quot; or &quot;frivolous card-giving&quot;.

=== Adding rules ===
In many variants an additional rule is silently and secretly added to the game with each round. It is customary for a player (often the winner of the previous round, sometimes the next person to deal) to add one new rule to the game. In a game with only one round, players who have gotten rid of all their cards may make a rule for those still in the game. Sometimes a new rule is explained to one other player (sometimes the dealer, sometimes a runner-up winner of the round), both to ensure consistency of the rule and consistency of its enforcement. Any new rules are allowed, but it must not be biased towards a player. 

There may also be additional rules that are already in effect at the beginning of the game, just to get things moving, and these rules may be known to all players, or perhaps only to the dealer. After many rounds, many new rules will accumulate. Naturally, only the person who created the rule will initially know what it is. The rules will vary from group to group, and from game to game, but most rules fall under one of the following four categories.

*When an event occurs, a player must perform an action (such as speaking a phrase or knocking on the table)
*When an event occurs, something about the game changes
*An action must always, or must never, be performed by players (such as holding cards in the left hand, or straightening the pile)
*Something fundamental about the gameplay changes (e.g. all kings are treated as if they were jacks for all game purposes)

The triggering events in the example above can be anything. They might include playing a specific card (the ace of spades) or a specific type of card (any red three), but triggering conditions can become as complicated as their creator wishes, such as when someone plays the fourth card of the same suit or playing an odd-numbered card on top of an even-numbered card.

To create a rule, one could pick a triggering condition, and then an action and/or game effect. The spirit of the rule is generally something in good fun; while rules that unfairly sway the game in favor of one player or to the detriment of one specific player are quite easy to concoct (&quot;Every time James plays a ten, he gets a penalty of ten cards&quot;), they are also generally frowned upon as unsportsmanlike. Rarely do rules have a penalty of more than one card, but certain rules have a large penalty attached to them, usually the result of a cumulative rule.

<text>Vigilantism () is the act of preventing, investigating, and punishing perceived offenses and crimes without legal authority.

A vigilante is a person who practices or partakes in vigilantism, or undertakes public safety and retributive justice without commission.

==Definition==
The term is borrowed from Italian , which means &#x27;sentinel&#x27; or &#x27;watcher&#x27;, from Latin . According to political scientist Regina Bateson, vigilantism is &quot;the extralegal prevention, investigation, or punishment of offenses.&quot; The definition has three components:

# Extralegal: Vigilantism is done outside of the law (not necessarily in violation of the law)
# Prevention, investigation, or punishment: Vigilantism requires specific actions, not just attitudes or beliefs
# Offense: Vigilantism is a response to a perceived crime or violation of an authoritative norm

Other scholars have defined &quot;collective vigilantism&quot; as &quot;group violence to punish perceived offenses to a community.&quot;

Les Johnston argues that vigilantism has six necessary components: 
* it is planned or premeditated 
* it is carried out by private volunteers
* it is a social movement
* it involves or threatens the use of force
* it occurs when established societal norms are perceived to be threatened
* its primary goal is to enforce safety and security, especially to its participants, by combating crime

==History==
Vigilantism and the vigilante ethos existed long before the word &quot;vigilante&quot; was introduced into the English language. There are conceptual parallels between the medieval aristocratic custom of private war or vendetta and the modern vigilante philosophy.

Elements of the concept of vigilantism can be found in the biblical account in Genesis 34 of the abduction and rape (or, by some interpretations, seduction) of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, in the Canaanite city of Shechem by the eponymous son of the ruler, and the violent reaction of her brothers Simeon and Levi, who slew all of the males of the city in revenge, rescued their sister and plundered Shechem. When Jacob protested that their actions might bring trouble upon him and his family, the brothers replied &quot;Should he [i.e., Shechem] treat our sister as a harlot?&quot;

In the Western literary and cultural tradition, characteristics of vigilantism have often been vested in folkloric heroes and outlaws (e.g., Robin Hood).

During medieval times, punishment of felons was sometimes exercised by such secret societies as the courts of the Vehm (cf. the medieval Sardinian &quot;Gamurra&quot; later become &quot;Barracelli&quot;, the Sicilian Vendicatori and the Beati Paoli), a type of early vigilante organization, which became extremely powerful in Westphalian Germany during the 15th century.

===Vigilantism in Mexico===

In some regions of Mexico, mainly in the state of Michoacan, people affected by criminal groups like Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, created vigilante groups called Grupos de autodefensa comunitaria in 2013. Their most notorious leader Hipólito Mora, was assassinated in 2023.

===Other notable acts of vigilantism===
* In the early 20th century, the White Finns founded the Suojeluskunta (Protection Corps) as a paramilitary vigilante organization in Finland. It formed the nucleus of the White Army in the Finnish Civil War.
* A number of vigilante organizations were founded in the US around the time of World War I including the American Protective League, National Security League, Knights of Liberty, and Boy Spies of America, with the goal of targeting those suspected to be pro-German or insufficiently loyal. Violent events by such groups included the Tulsa Outrage, the lynching of Olli Kinkkonen, and a number of other tarring and feathering events such as those in Wisconsin.
*In the 1920s, the Big Sword Society of China protected life and property in a state of anarchy.
* After World War II, many alleged Nazi collaborators were beaten up or killed for their activities by vigilantes.
*In 1954, the Thai Border Patrol Police formed the Volunteer Defense Corps (also called the Village Scouts; ) to provide law and order and emergency or natural disaster response. In 1974 it was expanded by the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) to urban areas to fight left-wing political activism. The Village Scouts were subsequently involved in the Thammasat University massacre of 1976. Their 21st century Internet censorship vigilance groups are called or &#x27;Cyber Scouts&#x27;.
*Recognized since the 1980s, Sombra Negra (&quot;Black Shadow&quot;) of El Salvador is a group of mostly retired police officers and military personnel whose sole duty is to cleanse the country of impure social elements by killing criminals and gang members. Along with several other organizations, Sombra Negra are a remnant of the death squads from the civil war of the 1970s and 1980s.
*On the 5th of May, 1981 Marianne Bachmeier pulled out a handgun from the right side of her trench coat and shot her seven year old daughter&#x27;s sexual abuser and murderer dead during his trial in the courtroom of Lübeck District Court.
*On March 16, 1984, Gary Plauché shot and killed Jeff Doucet, who was on trial for the kidnapping and rape of Plauché&#x27;s son. The case received wide publicity because some people questioned whether Plauché should have been charged with murder.
*In the Philippines in the mid-eighties, the Alsa Masa and the Kuratong Baleleng were formed to fight Communist insurgents.
*During the 1990s, the group City without Drugs publicly beat and murdered drug dealers and forced addicts to quit doing drugs in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia.
*On the 28th of November, 1994, Jeffrey Dahmer, a famous Milwaukee serial killer and cannibal was beaten to death by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.
*Formed in 1996, the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs of Cape Town, South Africa fights drugs and gangs in their region. They have been linked to terrorism since they bombed some American targets in Cape Town.
*Formed in 1998, the Bakassi Boys of Nigeria were viewed as instrumental in decreasing the region&#x27;s high crime.
*Los Pepes was a group formed in Colombia during the 1990s that committed acts of vigilantism against drug lord Pablo Escobar and his associates within the Medellín Cartel.
*After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Jonathan Idema, a self-proclaimed vigilante, entered Afghanistan and captured many people he claimed to be terrorists. Idema claimed he was collaborating with, and supported by, the United States Government. He sold news-media outlets tapes that he claimed showed an Al Qaeda training camp in action. His operations ended abruptly when he was arrested with his partners in 2004 and sentenced to 10 years in a notorious Afghan prison, before being pardoned in 2007.
*Formed in 2002, the Revolutionary Front is a Swedish anti-fascist organization. Members have been known to orchestrate attacks against known/suspected fascist individuals. The attacks usually involve damaging property, or even attacking the person themselves.
* On August 13, 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar, India. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body.
*Salwa Judum, the anti-Naxalite group formed in 2005 in India are suspected to be helping the security forces in their fight against Naxals.
*In Hampshire, England, during 2006, a vigilante slashed the tires of more than twenty cars, leaving a note made from cut-out newsprint stating &quot;Warning: you have been seen while using your mobile phone&quot;. Driving whilst using a mobile is a criminal offense in the UK, but critics feel the law is little observed or enforced.
* The Gulabi Gang, formed in 2006 in Uttar Pradesh, is a female vigilante group dedicated to protecting women of all castes from domestic abuse, sexual violence, and oppression.
*Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an Irish republican socialist paramilitary group, maintains a presence in parts of Northern Ireland and has carried out punishment beatings on local alleged petty criminals. In 2006, the INLA claimed to have put at least two drugs gangs out of business in Northern Ireland. After their raid on a criminal organization based in the north-west, they released a statement saying that &quot;the Irish National Liberation Army will not allow the working-class people of this city to be used as cannon fodder by these criminals whose only concern is profit by whatever means available to them.&quot; On 15 February 2009, the INLA claimed responsibility for the shooting death of Derry drug-dealer Jim McConnell. On 19 August 2009, the INLA shot and wounded a man in Derry. The INLA claimed that the man was involved in drug dealing although the injured man and his family denied the allegation. In a newspaper article on 28 August, however, the victim retracted his previous statement and admitted that he had been involved in small scale drug-dealing but has since ceased these activities.
*Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) are an Irish Republican vigilante organization active predominantly in and around Derry. Although often attributed as being a front for &quot;Dissident Republican&quot; groups by the media, the organization claim to have no allegiance to any particular Republican party or paramilitary. Formed in late 2008, RAAD originally offered an &quot;amnesty&quot; to all drug dealers, asking them to make themselves known to the group before giving an assurance that they had stopped dealing. In an interview with the &quot;Derry Journal&quot; in August 2009, the group&#x27;s leadership explained: &quot;We would monitor the actions of those who have come forward and, given an adequate period of time, interest in those drug dealers would cease and they could start to lead normal lives&quot;. Since then, RAAD have claimed responsibility for no less than 17 shootings as well as countless pipe bomb attacks (see Republican Action Against Drugs#Timeline).
*Other Irish republican paramilitary organizations have served and continue to serve as vigilantes. Óglaigh na hÉireann for example in 2011 claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a taxi depot on Oldpark Road, Belfast, which led to the owners fleeing the country. It claimed that the owners were using the depot as a cover for drug dealing. In 2010 The Real Irish Republican Army shot a man in the legs in Derry. The man was a convicted sex offender. The Continuity Irish Republican Army in 2011 were blamed for the punishment beating of a heroin dealer in Clondalkin, Dublin. The man had previously been ordered to leave the country.
*On April 15, 2011, a group of women in Cherán armed with rocks and fireworks attacked a bus carrying illegal loggers armed with machine guns in Michoacán associated with the Mexican drug cartel La Familia Michoacana. They assumed control over the town, expelled the police force and blocked roads leading to oak timber on a nearby mountain. Vigilante activity spread to the nearby community of Opopeo. They established Community self-defence groups. The government of Mexico has recognized Cherán as a self-governing indigenous community, but criminals continue to murder residents in the forest.
* On June 13, 2014, Darius, a 16-year-old Romani residing in France and who has been several times interrogated by the police on the account of suspected burglaries and larcenies, was kidnapped, beaten up, and then left in a supermarket trolley by an unknown party after rumors circulated of him being implicated in a housebreaking, which happened several hours before in the city of Pierrefite-sur-Seine.
* Since the May 9, 2016 Philippine elections and the start of Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s term as the President of the Philippines, numerous suspects (particularly drug users and pushers) were killed by various unknown hitmen labelled as a summary execution during his war on drugs. Duterte has been accused of being linked to the Davao Death Squad, a vigilante group active since the mid-1990s in Davao City, where Duterte had previously served as mayor.

<text>Miao is a sub-division in the Changlang district in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It is located about 25 km from the Assam border. It is one of the 60 constituencies of Arunachal.

==Geography and climate==
Miao is located at .

Miao is located in a region where it gets one of the heaviest rainfall in north-east India. The noa-dihing is the most important river flowing through Miao. The mountain range is called Patkai Bum and is the eastern extension of the Himalayas.

The tall forests make the region a good haven for smugglers. The Miao region covers the towns of Diyun and Chowkham. Diyun is the stronghold of the Chakmas and Chowkham to the Khamptis. Chowkham has generated wealth from the plywood business to a degree that once it was the richest village in Asia. Though it is low in literacy, most of the people here boast of spunky cars. It is a small town, but it is well connected by road and has a transport station with a bus available daily.

==Tourism==
Miao is also a popular tourist location. The Namdapha tiger project is situated here. There is a mini zoo, a museum and various other sites to be visited. Deban is the main tourist spot, 25 km from Miao. The people here are mainly engaged in government jobs, but the people of nearby villages survive on agriculture. Jhum cultivation is very famous here, now people have started tea plantations too. It is a developing town, with about four primary schools and one secondary school.

==Demographics==
Miao has a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The main tribes in this region are the Tangsa, Singpho, and Lisu. A major chunk of Chakma people and Tibetan refugees have a settlement area. It is a custom for the Tibetans to burn effigies of Chinese leaderships during the anniversary of the exile of their leader to India.

To the north of Chowkham is the region inhabited by the Mishmi people. Their region is famous for opium cultivation because its dry mountainous landscape is very suitable for growing opium.

===Languages===

According to the Census 2011, Bengali is Spoken by 1,073 people, Hindi by 915 people, Nepali by 849, Tangsa by 518 people, Assamese by 500, Adi by 260 people, Wancho by 256 people and Nishi by 230.

==Politics==
Miao has many government offices. There is an Additional Deputy Commissioner office, Divisional Manager, Public Works Department, and Rural Works Department.

As of October 2016, the Minister of the Miao constituency is Kamlung Mossang.

==Education==
Until recent years, there were only government-run schools until the twelfth standard. Now there are many private schools. Among the top private schools are Light Of The World, Jawlai Public School, and Little Tots School. So educational institutions are growing rapidly.

==Media==
Miao also can boast of a weekly news publication called &quot;The Miao Times&quot; by Pisi Zauing Singpho. That provides local news and has a good circulation in the area.

==Religion==
Miao is well known for the majority residing community the Singphos. The Singpho community dominantly follows Buddhism. The Buddhist monastery in the Miao town is where people gather to worship Lord Buddha and get blessings from the Lord and the monks. The monastery in Miao is yet another milestone of the Buddha teachings. With time there have been many Christians in this town. Miao Town Baptist Church is perhaps one of the first established churches. They preach messages in Hindi and sometimes in English, so visitors might find this church a good place to go. There are also Revival Church, Church of Christ, and the Catholic Church.

There are Hindu temples right in the middle of the Miao Bazaar. And there is a Rangfrah temple, an indigenous religion of tangsa people, near the Namdapha Field Director&#x27;s office.

<text>Klyuchevskaya Sopka (; also known as Klyuchevskoi, ) is a stratovolcano, the highest mountain of Siberia and the highest active volcano of Eurasia. Its steep, symmetrical cone towers about from the Bering Sea. The volcano is part of the natural Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site. Klyuchevskaya Sopka is ranked 15th in the world by topographic isolation.

Klyuchevskaya appeared 7,000 years ago. Its first recorded eruption occurred in 1697, and it has been almost continuously active ever since, as have many of its neighboring volcanoes. It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. No other ascents were recorded until 1931, when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent. As similar dangers still exist today, few ascents are made.

==Eruptions==

Klyuchevskaya Sopka has erupted 110 times during the Holocene Epoch.

===2007 eruption===
Beginning in early January 2007, Klyuchevskaya Sopka began another eruption cycle. Students from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and scientists of the Alaska Volcano Observatory traveled to Kamchatka in the spring to monitor the eruption. On 28 June 2007, the volcano began to experience the largest explosions so far recorded in this eruption cycle. An ash plume from the eruption reached a height of before drifting eastward, disrupting air traffic between the United States and Asia and causing ashfalls on Alaska&#x27;s Unimak Island.

===2010 eruption===
As early as 27 February 2010, gas plumes had erupted from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, reaching elevations of . During the first week of March 2010, both explosive ash eruptions and effusive lava eruptions occurred until March 9th; the ash cloud was reported to have reached an elevation of . As well, significant thermal anomalies have been reported, and gas-steam plumes extended roughly to the north-east from the volcano beginning on March 3rd.

===2012 eruptions===
On 15 October 2012, the volcano had a weak eruption that stopped the following day. A weak thermal eruption occurred on 29 November 2012, then stopped again, as all of its neighboring volcanoes Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Shiveluch, and Tolbachik erupted more actively and continuously, taking a major magma supply load off of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.

===2013 eruptions===
On 25 January 2013, the volcano had a weak Strombolian eruption that stopped the following day. During January 2013, all volcanoes in the eastern part of Kamchatka—Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Klyuchevskaya Sopka, Shiveluch, and Tolbachik—erupted, with the exception of Kamen.
On 15 August 2013, the volcano had another weak Strombolian eruption with some slight lava flow that put on an excellent fireworks display before stopping on 21 August 2013, when Gorely Volcano woke up and started erupting again in relief of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.

On 12 October, Klyuchevskaya Sopka had another three days of on-and-off eruptions with anomalies and a short ash plume, possibly indicating Strombolian and weak Vulcanian activity. An explosion from a new cinder cone low on Kliuchevskoi&#x27;s southwest flank occurred on 12 October. An ash plume rose to altitudes of , and drifted eastward. The eruptions weakened and paused by 16 October 2013.

On 19 November, a strong explosion occurred, and observers reported that ash plumes rose to altitudes of and drifted southeast. The Aviation Color Code was raised to Red. Later that day, the altitudes of the ash plumes were lower and the eruptions weakened and stopped again.

On 7 December, activity at Kliuchevskoi significantly increased, having continued during 29 November – 7 December, prompting KVERT to raise the Alert Level to Red. Ash plumes rose to altitudes of above sea level and drifted more than northeast and over east. According to a news article, a warning to aircraft was issued for the area around the volcanoes. Video showed gas-and-steam activity, and satellite images detected a daily weak thermal anomaly. On 9 December, the Alert Level was lowered to Green when the eruptions abruptly stopped.

===2015 eruptions===
On 2 January 2015, after a one-year period of inactivity, the volcano had a Strombolian eruption which stopped on 16 January 2015. Minor eruptions resumed on 10 March 2015 and stopped on 24 March 2015. On 27 August 2015, the volcano had another Strombolian eruption which ended 16 hours later.

===2019 eruptions===
Kluchevskaya Sopka saw renewed eruption activity beginning in 2019. On 25 October 2019, the volcano had another weak Strombolian eruption which ended some 30 hours later.

===2020 eruption===
A volcanic eruption occurred on 9 December 2020.

===2022 eruption===
A volcanic eruption started on 20 November 2022.

===2023 eruptions===
A volcanic eruption started on 22 June 2023. The June eruption follows nearby eruptions on 11 April 2023 in other volcanoes in the area. A significant eruptive event occurred as part of ongoing activity on 1 November 2023, sending ash as high as above sea level and causing flight delays as far away as Vancouver, BC, on 4–5 November 2023. 

==2022 climbing accidents==
In September 2022, nine people died while climbing Kluchevskaya Sopka. They were part of a 12-strong group of Russian nationals, which included two guides. Five climbers were killed after a fall at about 4,000 meters. Another four, including a guide, died on the mountainside afterwards. A rescue helicopter managed to land at 1,663 meters at the fourth attempt, bringing rescuers who faced a two-day climb to reach a volcanologists&#x27; hut at 3,300 meters where the three survivors were sheltering.

<text>Joseph Billings (17581806) was an English navigator, hydrographer and explorer who spent the most of his career in Russian service. From 1790 to 1794 he commanded a marine expedition that searched for a Northeast Passage and explored the coasts of Alaska and Siberia. Between 1797 and 1798 he conducted a hydrographic survey of the Black Sea.

==Life==

===Early life===
Sources provide conflicting details regarding the early life of Joseph Billings. British records show he was born in 1758 at Turnham Green, Middlesex. Parish church registers confirm his birth on 6 September 1758, the son of Thomas and Mary Billing. However, according to Russian sources, Billings told associates he was born in Yarmouth, the son of a fisherman of the same name. He worked on coal ships from an early age and later was apprenticed to a watchmaker. His Russian service record, signed by him, indicates he was born in 1761. 

===Royal Navy Service===
In 1776, Billings enlisted in the Royal Navy as an able seaman and joined the third and final voyage of James Cook. Billings became an astronomer&#x27;s assistant, initially aboard , and then transferring to in September 1779. The expedition explored the North Pacific, visiting Nootka Sound, Alaska, the Bering Sea, and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east coast of Russia. When they returned to England in October 1780, Billings was promoted to warrant officer.

Following his return, Billings served aboard the &quot;Conquestador&quot; and the &quot;Crocodile&quot;. In July 1782 he became master&#x27;s mate on the &quot;Resistance&quot;, serving Captain James King, who had also served on Cook&#x27;s last voyage. Billings frequently accompanied King on visits to Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society. He was imprisoned in 1782 for a debt and the &quot;Resistance&quot; sailed to the West Indies without him. With Banks’ help, he was released from prison on 14 January 1783.

In 1783 he applied through the Russian ambassador Ivan Matveevich Simolin to enter the Russian navy.

===The Billings Expedition===

In 1785, the Russian government of Catherine the Great commissioned a new expedition in search for the Northeast Passage, led by Joseph Billings, the Russian officer Gavril Sarychev as his deputy and Carl Heinrich Merck as the expedition&#x27;s naturalist. Martin Sauer served as secretary and translator. Captains , Gavril Sarychev, and Christian Bering had leading roles. The expedition operated until 1794.

Though considered a failure by some scholars because the expenditures outweighed the results, it nevertheless had a substantial record of achievement. Accurate maps were made of the Chukchi Peninsula in Eastern Siberia, the west coast of Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands. Members of the expedition landed on Kodiak Island and made an examination of the islands and mainlands of Prince William Sound. Additionally, the expedition compiled a census of the native population of the Aleutian Islands and reported to the crown stories of abuse by the Russian fur traders (&quot;promyshlenniki&quot;).

===Later years===
After the expedition, Joseph Billings remained with the Imperial Russian Navy. He was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet at his request. From 1797 to 1798, he conducted a hydrographical survey of the Black Sea. He subsequently published an atlas of this work. In November 1799, he retired and settled in Moscow.

Billings died in Moscow on 18 June 1806, possibly at the age of 48 years.

==Legacy==
Cape Billings in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug was named after him.

Billings Glacier on Passage Peak in Alaska was named after him in 1908.

<doc id="58334" wikidata="Q493872" url="?curid=58334" title="Let It Ride (card game)">
<text>Let It Ride is a casino table game based on poker, where the player wagers on a five-card poker hand formed by their own three cards and two community cards. It is a product of Bally Technologies, under its Shuffle Master brand.

==History==
The game was invented by Shuffle Master founder John Breeding, with the goal of fueling demand for the company&#x27;s shuffling machine.

Initially popular in many casinos, the popularity of the game has waned since then because of its relatively high house edge. Like blackjack and video poker, player decisions in Let It Ride affect the house edge. With the standard pay table and optimal strategy, the house edge is 3.51%, several times that of blackjack and craps.

== Basic rules ==
Let It Ride is a variation of five-card stud, based on three player cards and two community cards. The two community cards are initially dealt face down. The most distinguishing feature of Let It Ride is that the player is given two opportunities to withdraw exactly one-third of their initial wager. One chance occurs after the player looks at their hand but before the first community card is revealed, and the second occurs after the first community card is revealed, but before the second is revealed. The player may reduce their wager on either of these occasions, or on both, or neither. If the player decides not to withdraw part of their wager, they are said to &quot;let it ride.&quot; In order to ensure that the player&#x27;s initial wager is divisible by three, each player must distribute their wager over three betting spots which must all contain the same chip value. On some table layouts these spots are given the symbols &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;$&quot;, with &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; indicating the thirds of the wager which the player can withdraw before the first and second community cards respectively are turned up, and &quot;$&quot; representing the third of the wager which there is never a chance to withdraw.

After players have placed their bets, the dealer starts from their left, and deals each player one card, followed by the first face-down community card, followed by a further card to each player, followed by the second community card, followed by a final card to each player. Players are not permitted to show their cards or to see the cards of other players at any point before the end of the deal.

In the event of a winning hand after the second community card is revealed, what remains of the player&#x27;s wager is paid out according to a payout table such as the one given below. There are small variations in payoffs between casinos, but the lowest paying hand in Let It Ride is typically a pair of 10s; a pair of nines or less is a losing hand, which results in the player forfeiting their remaining wager to the house.

===Payouts===
==Three Card Bonus==
The Three Card Bonus is an optional side bet offered at some tables. The bet is placed on the player&#x27;s three cards only. Winnings from a fixed payout table are awarded based on the three-card hand, following the hand rankings of three-card brag. This is comparable to the &quot;Pair Plus&quot; side bet in the casino game of Three Card Poker.

<text>Cape Dezhnyov or Cape Dezhnev (; ; Inupiaq: &quot;Nuuġaq&quot;), formerly known as East Cape or Cape Vostochny, is a cape that forms the easternmost mainland point of Asia. It is located on the Chukchi Peninsula in the very sparsely populated Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. This cape is located between the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Strait, across from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska; the Bering Strait is delimited by the two capes. The Diomede Islands and Fairway Rock are located in the midst of the strait.

==Geography==
In 1898, the cape was officially renamed as Cape Dezhnev, replacing Captain James Cook&#x27;s name, the &quot;East Cape&quot;. It was named in honor of Semyon Dezhnev, the first recorded European to round its tip (in 1648). There is a large monument to Dezhnev on the seacoast.

The cape is the eastern tip of a high, rocky headland, about from Uelen in the north to Cape Pe&#x27;ek in the south, connected to the mainland by a neck of lower-lying land peppered with swamps and shallow lakes. That low-lying land is so low in elevation that the cape appears as an island from a distance far to the south of it. The US Hydrographic Office publication &quot;Asiatic Pilot&quot; from 1909 gives the height of the headland as , and the US Office of Coast Survey chart of 2000 shows the highest peak at . The headland and the neck of low-lying land together form a peninsula. A well-established trail crossed the neck of land behind the headland in pre-historic and historic times, traversed by sleds in the winter and used as a portage in the summer to avoid traversing the strait. This route was important enough that, according to an analysis by linguist Michael Krauss, the Central Siberian Yupik language continued up the coast, un-interrupted by the Naukansky dialect spoken in the village of Naukan on the headland.

The Great Circle distance from Cape Dezhnev to the shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait in Yemen is about , which is the longest land distance of Asia.

==History==

The Cape Dezhnev peninsula, (or East Cape, as it was then generally called) was a center for trade between American (and other) whalers and the fur traders and the native Yupik and Chukchi people of the coast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the early years, ships would call at Uelen to trade for furs produced along the arctic coast. Subsequently, there were established trading stations at Uelen and Deshnevo (Chukchi name Keniskun; Yupik Kaniskak). When a source of that period speaks of stopping or trading at East Cape, either of these locations may be meant, or occasionally the Yupik village Naukan on the southeast shore of the cape, which had less trade because it lacked a good anchorage. Sources from that period sometimes speak of a village Emma-Town. Although this name may be derived from the nearby Yupik village Enmitahin (Chukchi for &quot;end of the cliff&quot;) the name appears to refer to Keniskun (where the traders were) or perhaps to both villages together. Of the four historical villages on the cape itself, only Uelen is still inhabited. Naukan was evacuated in 1958 with most of the occupants relocated to Nunyamo near Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka, and Keniskun was merged with Uelen a little earlier.
In Josef Bauer&#x27;s &quot;As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me&quot; (1955), Cape Deshnev is given as the site of a Gulag lead-mine camp from which a German POW Clemens Forell (actual name: Cornelius Rost) escaped in 1949. Later research cast serious doubt on the book&#x27;s accuracy. For example, at the time of the escape described, no Cape Dezhnev Gulag camp lead mine existed.

<text>Fan Chuo (; previously romanized as &quot;Fan Ch&#x27;e&quot; and &quot;Fan Zhuo&quot;) (??? – late 9th century) was a secretary working under the Jiedu () (similar to the Byzantine thema) with headquarters located at Hanoi.

Since the thema was a front of the Tang dynasty against Nanzhao, he was able to get his hands on the updated diplomatic and military documents of the two countries. He also lived in Hanoi during his first tenure; therefore he knew some firsthand information of the city, such as trades, deployments, population, etc. As the Nanzhao army sacked the city for the first time, he just escaped from being captured by jumping into the Red River and swimming to the opposite bank. Then he worked under another Jie-du located at Guangzhou where he compiled the first draft of &quot;Manshu&quot; (; roughly means &quot;the book on the southern tribes&quot;). He also worked a second tenure in Hanoi where he finished the book in 862 CE. He died in Guangzhou after retirement. His book &quot;Manshu&quot; is an invaluable source of the Tang-Nanzhao relation and for anthropological research of Hmong and Vietnam during the later years of the Tang dynasty. For instance, his eyewitness account on the siege of Hanoi was monumental.

Vietnamese, English, and French translations are also available.

<doc id="58341" wikidata="Q203607" url="?curid=58341" title="Guilder">
<text>Guilder is the English translation of the Dutch and German gulden, originally shortened from Middle High German &quot;guldin pfenninc&quot; (&quot;gold penny&quot;). This was the term that became current in the southern and western parts of the Holy Roman Empire for the Fiorino d&#x27;oro (introduced in 1252 in the Republic of Florence). Hence, the name has often been interchangeable with &quot;florin&quot; (currency sign ƒ or fl.).

The guilder is also the name of several currencies used in Europe and the former colonies of the Dutch Empire.

==Gold guilder==
The guilder or gulden was the name of several gold coins used during the Holy Roman Empire. It first referred to the Italian gold florin, introduced in the 13th century. It then referred to the Rhenish gulden (&quot;florenus Rheni&quot;) issued by several states of the Holy Roman Empire from the 14th century. The Rhenish gulden was issued by Trier, Cologne and Mainz in the 14th and 15th centuries. Basel minted its own &quot;Apfelgulden&quot; between 1429 and 1509. Bern and Solothurn followed in the 1480s, Fribourg in 1509 and Zürich in 1510, and other towns in the 17th century.

The &quot;Reichsmünzordnung&quot; or imperial minting ordinance of the Holy Roman Empire first defined standards for the Rhenish gulden (&quot;Rheinischer Gulden&quot;) in 1524. It also defined a silver &quot;Guldengroschen&quot; of equal value to the &quot;gulden&quot;.

The standards of the Rhenish gulden has changed over the centuries, as follows:
* In 1354, it was minted th a Cologne Mark of gold, 23 karats fine; hence fine gold, or identical to the Florentine florin.
* By 1419, it was minted th to a Mark, 19 karats fine; hence fine gold.
* By the 1559 &quot;Reichsmünzordnung&quot;, it was minted nd to a Mark, 18 karats; hence fine gold.

==Currency guilder==
With increasingly standardized currencies in the early modern period, &quot;gulden&quot; or &quot;guilder&quot; became a term for various early modern and modern currencies, detached from actual gold coins. The Dutch guilder first emerged as the currency of the Burgundian Netherlands after the monetary reforms of 1435, under Philip the Good. It remained the national currency of the Netherlands until it was replaced by the euro, on 1 January 2002.

The Reichsmünzordnung of 1524 defined fixed standards for the gold Rhenish gulden and the Guldengroschen of equal value. By 1551, however, both coins were valued at 72 kreuzer, and a new guilder currency unit of 60 kreuzer was defined. The latter gulden was then defined over the succeeding centuries as a currency unit worth a fraction of the silver Reichsthaler.

In 1753, Austria-Hungary and Bavaria agreed to the Conventions monetary standard which resulted into two differently valued gulden: the Austro-Hungarian florin of the Austrian Empire from 1754 to 1892, and the South German gulden of the Southern German states from 1754, until German unification in 1871. Currencies identical to the South German gulden include the Bavarian gulden, Baden gulden &amp; the Württemberg gulden.

A Danzig gulden was in use from 1923 to 1939.

==Currencies derived from the Dutch guilder==
* The Netherlands Indies gulden was introduced in 1602, at the start of the United East Indies Company.
* The British Guianan guilder was in use in British Guiana from 1796 to 1839.
* The Netherlands Antillean guilder was in use in the Netherlands Antilles until its dissolution, in 2010. Afterwards, it remained the currency of the new countries Curaçao and Sint Maarten and (until 1 January 2011) the Caribbean Netherlands.
* The Surinamese guilder
* The Netherlands New Guinean gulden
* The Caribbean guilder is a proposed currency for Curaçao and Sint Maarten.

<doc id="58349" wikidata="Q207682" url="?curid=58349" title="Sergei Kirov">
<text>Sergei Mironovich Kirov (born Kostrikov; 27 March 1886 – 1 December 1934) was a Russian and Soviet politician and Bolshevik revolutionary. Kirov was an early revolutionary in the Russian Empire and a member of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Kirov became an Old Bolshevik and personal friend to Joseph Stalin, rising through the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ranks to become head of the party in Leningrad and a member of the Politburo.

On 1 December 1934, Kirov was shot and killed by Leonid Nikolaev at his offices in the Smolny Institute. Nikolaev and several alleged accomplices were convicted in a show trial and executed less than 30 days later. Kirov&#x27;s assassination was used by Stalin as a reason for starting the Moscow trials and the Great Purge. 

== Early life ==

Sergei Mironovich Kostrikov was born on in Urzhum in Vyatka Governorate, Russian Empire, as one of seven children born to Miron Ivanovich Kostrikov and Yekaterina Kuzminichna Kostrikova (&quot;née&quot; Kazantseva). Their first four children had died young, while Anna (born 1883), Sergei (1886), and Yelizaveta (1889) survived. 

Miron, an alcoholic, abandoned the family around 1890, and Yekaterina died of tuberculosis in 1893. Sergei and his sisters were raised for a brief time by their paternal grandmother, Melania Avdeyevna Kostrikova, but she could not afford to take care of them all on her small pension of 3 rubles per month. Through her connections, Melania succeeded in having Sergey placed in an orphanage at the age of seven, but he saw his sisters and grandmother regularly.

In 1901, a group of wealthy benefactors provided a scholarship for Kirov to attend an industrial school at Kazan. After gaining his degree in engineering, Kirov moved to Tomsk, a city in Siberia, where he became a Marxist and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1904.

== Revolutionary ==
Kirov was a participant in the 1905 Russian Revolution and was arrested, joining with the Bolsheviks soon after being released from prison. In 1906, he was arrested once again, but this time jailed for over three years, charged with printing illegal literature. Soon after his release, Kirov again took part in revolutionary activity, once again being arrested for printing illegal literature. After a year in custody, Kirov moved to the Caucasus, where he stayed until the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II after the February Revolution in March 1917. By this time, Kirov had shortened his last name from Kostrikov to Kirov, a practice common among Russian revolutionaries of the time. Kirov began using the pen name Kir, first publishing under the pseudonym Kirov on 26 April 1912. One account states that he chose the name Kir, the Russian version of Cyrus (from the Greek Kūros), after a Christian martyr in third-century Egypt from an Orthodox calendar of saints&#x27; days, and Russifying it by adding an &quot;-ov&quot; suffix. A second story is that Kirov based it on the name of the Persian king Cyrus the Great.

Kirov became commander of the Bolshevik military administration in Astrakhan and fought for the Red Army in the Russian Civil War until 1920. Simon Sebag Montefiore writes: &quot;During the Civil War, he was one of the swashbuckling commissars in the North Caucasus beside Ordzhonikidze and Mikoyan. In Astrakhan he enforced Bolshevik power in March 1919 with liberal bloodletting; more than 4,000 were killed. When a bourgeois was caught hiding his own furniture, Kirov ordered him shot.&quot;

== Career ==

In 1921, Kirov became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, the Bolshevik party organization in the Azerbaijan SSR. Kirov was a loyal supporter of Joseph Stalin, the successor of Vladimir Lenin, and in 1926 was rewarded with command of the Leningrad party organization. Kirov was a close personal friend of Stalin, and a strong supporter of industrialisation and forced collectivisation. At the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930, Kirov stated: &quot;The General Party line is to conduct the course of our country industrialization. Based on the industrialisation, we conduct transformation of our agriculture. Namely, we centralise and collectivise.&quot; 

In 1934, at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Kirov delivered the speech called &quot;The Speech of Comrade Stalin Is the Program of Our Party&quot;, which refers to Stalin&#x27;s speech delivered at the Congress earlier. Kirov praised Stalin for everything he had done since the death of Lenin. Moreover, Kirov personally named and ridiculed Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky—former party allies of Stalin. Bukharin and Rykov were later tried in the show trial called The Trial of the Twenty-One accused of Kirov&#x27;s death, while Tomsky committed suicide expecting his arrest by the NKVD.

== Reputation ==
After his assassination, Kirov acquired a reputation for having repeatedly stood up to Stalin in private and for becoming so popular that he was a threat to Stalin&#x27;s supremacy, as he displayed some independence from Stalin. In an alleged example from 1932, Stalin wanted to have Martemyan Ryutin executed for writing an attack on his leadership but Kirov and Sergo Ordzhonikidze talked him out of it. Alexander Orlov, who defected to the West, listed a series of incidents in which Kirov allegedly clashed with Stalin, based on rumours he must have heard from fellow NKVD officers. Kirov&#x27;s reputed rivalry is a major theme of the historical novel &quot;Children of the Arbat&quot;, by Anatoli Rybakov, who wrote:

At the end of the Communist Party&#x27;s Seventeenth Congress in February 1934, there is reputed to have been a scandal, when Kirov topped the poll in elections to the Central Committee, and Stalin&#x27;s acolyte, Lazar Kaganovich ordered a number of ballots be destroyed so that Stalin and Kirov could share top billing. Amy Knight, a historian of the Soviet Union, suggests that whereas Kirov &quot;might have toed the line as others did, on the other hand, he might have acted as a rallying point for those who wanted to oppose his [Stalin&#x27;s] dictatorship.&quot; Furthermore, Knight suggests that Kirov would not have been a willing accomplice when the full force of Stalin&#x27;s terror was unleashed in Leningrad. 

Knight&#x27;s contention is supported by the fact that whereas most of the elite tried to anticipate what Stalin desired and to act accordingly, Kirov did not always do what Stalin wanted. In 1934, Stalin wanted Kirov to come to Moscow permanently. Whereas all the other members of the Politburo would have complied, Stalin accepted that, as Kirov had no desire to leave Leningrad, he would not come to Moscow until 1938. When Stalin wanted Filipp Medved moved from the Leningrad NKVD to Minsk, Kirov refused to agree; in a rare move for Stalin, he had to accept defeat.

==Assassination==
On the afternoon of Saturday, 1 December 1934, Kirov&#x27;s assassin, Leonid Nikolayev, arrived at the Smolny Institute offices and made his way to the third floor unopposed, waiting in a hallway until Kirov and his bodyguard Borisov stepped into the corridor. Borisov appeared to have stayed some 20 to 40 paces behind Kirov, with some sources alleging Borisov parted company with Kirov in order to prepare his lunch. Kirov turned a corner and passed Nikolayev, who then drew his revolver and shot Kirov in the back of the neck.

Nikolayev was well known to the NKVD, which had arrested him for various petty offences in recent years. Various accounts of his life agree that he was an expelled party member and a failed junior functionary, with a murderous grudge and an indifference to his own survival. Nikolayev was unemployed, with a wife and child, and in financial difficulties. According to Orlov, Nikolayev had allegedly told a friend he wanted to kill the head of the party control commission that had expelled him. Nikolayev&#x27;s friend reported this to the NKVD. Ivan Zaporozhets then allegedly enlisted Nikolayev&#x27;s friend to contact him, giving him money and a loaded 7.62 mm Nagant M1895 revolver. 

Nikolayev&#x27;s first attempt at killing Kirov failed. On 15 October 1934, Nikolayev packed his Nagant revolver in a briefcase and entered the Smolny Institute where Kirov now worked. Although Nikolayev was initially passed by the main security desk at Smolny, he was arrested after an alert guard asked to examine his briefcase, which was found to contain the revolver. A few hours later, Nikolayev&#x27;s briefcase and loaded revolver were returned to him, and he was told to leave the building. 

With Stalin&#x27;s approval, the NKVD had previously withdrawn all but four police bodyguards assigned to Kirov. These four guards accompanied Kirov each day to his offices at the Smolny Institute and then left. On 1 December 1934, the usual guard post at the entrance to Kirov&#x27;s offices was supposedly left unmanned, even though the building housed the chief offices of the Leningrad party apparatus and was the seat of the local government. According to some reports, only a single friend, Commissar Borisov, an unarmed bodyguard of Kirov&#x27;s, remained. Given the circumstances of Kirov&#x27;s death, Alexander Barmine stated that &quot;the negligence of the NKVD in protecting such a high party official was without precedent in the Soviet Union.&quot;

===Aftermath===

Kirov was cremated and his ashes interred in the Kremlin Wall necropolis in a state funeral, with Stalin and other prominent members of the CPSU personally carrying his coffin. After Kirov&#x27;s death, Stalin called for swift punishment of the traitors and those found negligent in Kirov&#x27;s death. Nikolayev was tried alone and secretly by Vasili Ulrikh, Chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was sentenced to death by shooting on 29 December 1934, and the sentence was carried out that very night. The Soviet government, led by Stalin, stated that their investigation proved that the assassin was acting on behalf of a secret Zinovievist group. The hapless Commissar Borisov died the day after Kirov&#x27;s assassination, allegedly falling from a moving truck while riding with a group of NKVD agents. According to Orlov, Borisov&#x27;s wife was committed to an insane asylum, while Nikolayev&#x27;s mysterious friend and alleged provocateur, who had supplied him with the revolver and money, was later shot on Stalin&#x27;s personal orders.

Several NKVD officers from the Leningrad branch were convicted of negligence for not adequately protecting Kirov and sentenced to prison terms of up to ten years. According to Barmine, none of the NKVD officers were executed in the aftermath, and none actually served time in prison. Instead, they were transferred to executive posts in Stalin&#x27;s Gulag labour camps for a period of time—in effect, a demotion. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the same NKVD officers were later shot in 1937. Lajos Magyar, a Hungarian communist and refugee from the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, was falsely accused of complicity in Kirov&#x27;s assassination. Magyar was convicted as a &quot;Zinovievite-Terrorist&quot; and sent to a Gulag, where he died in 1940.

A Communist Party communiqué initially reported that Nikolayev had confessed his guilt as an assassin in the pay of a &quot;fascist power,&quot; having received money from an unidentified &quot;foreign consul&quot; in Leningrad. The same author claims 104 defendants who were already in prison at the time of Kirov&#x27;s assassination, and who had no demonstrable connection to Nikolayev, were found guilty of complicity in the &quot;fascist plot&quot; against Kirov, and summarily executed; however, a few days later, during a subsequent Communist Party meeting of the Moscow District, the party secretary announced in a speech that Nikolayev had been personally interrogated by Stalin the day after the assassination, something unheard-of for a party leader such as Stalin to have done. He said: &quot;Comrade Stalin personally directed the investigation of Kirov&#x27;s assassination. He questioned Nikolayev at length. The leaders of the Opposition placed the gun in Nikolayev&#x27;s hand!&quot;

Other speakers duly rose to purge the Communist Party of any opposition: &quot;The Central Committee must be pitiless—the Party must be purged... the record of every member must be scrutinized...&quot; No one at the meeting mentioned the initial theory that fascist agents had been responsible for the assassination. Barmine asserts Stalin even used the Kirov assassination to eliminate the remainder of the Opposition leadership, accusing Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Abram Prigozhin, and others who had stood with Kirov in opposing Stalin (or who had simply failed to acquiesce to Stalin&#x27;s views), of being &quot;morally responsible&quot; for Kirov&#x27;s murder, and therefore guilty of complicity. Barmine also claimed that Stalin arranged the murder with the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, who armed Nikolayev and sent him to assassinate Kirov.

=== Investigations by Soviet authorities ===
In his Secret Speech in 1956, Khrushchev said that the murder of Kirov was organized by NKVD agents who were tasked with protecting Kirov and were eventually shot in 1937. Khrushchev entrusted Pyotr Pospelov, Secretary of the Central Committee, to form a commission to investigate the repression of the 1930s; this was the same Pospelov who had drafted the famous Secret Speech for Khrushchev at the 20th Congress. Khrushchev stated:

There are reasons for the suspicion that the killer of Kirov, Nikolayev, was assisted by someone from among the people whose duty it was protect the person of Kirov. A month and a half before the killing, Nikolayev was arrested on the grounds of suspicious behavior, but he was released and not even searched. It is an unusually suspicious circumstance that when the Chekist [Borisov] assigned to protect Kirov was being brought for an interrogation, on 2 December 1934, he was killed in a car &quot;accident&quot; in which no other occupants of the car were harmed. After the murder of Kirov, top functionaries of the Leningrad NKVD were relieved of their duties and were given very light sentences, but in 1937 they were shot. We can assume that they were shot in order to cover the traces of the organizers of Kirov&#x27;s killing.

Pospelov&#x27;s committee came to the conclusion that Kirov’s murder was facilitated by NKVD officers who were responsible for his security, and that NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda was declared a hero, instead of holding him responsible. Pospelov spoke to Dr. Kirchakov and former nurse Trunina, former members of the party, who had been mentioned in a letter by another member of the commission, Olga Shatunovskaya, as having knowledge of the Kirov murder. Kirchakov confirmed that he did talk to Shatunovskaya and Trunina about some of the unexplained aspects of the Kirov murder case and agreed to provide the commission with a written deposition. He stressed that his statement was based on the testimony of one Comrade Yan Olsky, a former NKVD officer who was demoted after Kirov&#x27;s murder and transferred to the People&#x27;s Supply System.

In his deposition, Kirchakov wrote that he had discussed Kirov&#x27;s murder and the role of Fyodor Medved with Olsky. Olsky was of the firm opinion that Medved, Kirov&#x27;s friend and NKVD security chief of the Leningrad branch, was innocent of the murder. Olsky also told Kirchakov that Medved had been barred from the NKVD Kirov assassination investigation. Instead, the investigation was carried out by a senior NKVD chief, Yakov Agranov, and later by another NKVD bureau officer whose name he did not remember. The other NKVD official may have been Yefim Georgievich Yevdokimov (1891–1939), a Stalin crony, mass-killing specialist, and architect of the Shakhty purge trials, who continued to lead a secret police team within the NKVD even after technically retiring from the OGPU in 1931. During one of the committee sessions, Olsky said he was present when Stalin asked Leonid Nikolayev why Comrade Kirov had been killed. To this Nikolayev replied that he carried out the instruction of the &quot;Chekists&quot; (meaning the NKVD) and pointed towards the group of &quot;Chekists&quot; (NKVD officers) standing in the room; Medved was not among them. 

Khrushchev&#x27;s report, &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, was later read at closed-door Party meetings. Afterwards, new material was received by the Pospelov Committee, including the assertion by Kirov&#x27;s chauffeur, Kuzin, that Commissar Borisov, Kirov&#x27;s friend and bodyguard, who was responsible for Kirov&#x27;s round-the-clock security at the Smolny Institute, was intentionally killed, and that his death in a road accident was not an accident at all. 

The last attempt in the Soviet Union to review the Kirov murder case was made by the Politburo Commission headed by Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev in 1989. After two years of investigations, the working team of the Commission concluded that no materials were found to support Stalin&#x27;s or NKVD&#x27;s participation in Kirov&#x27;s murder. However, Yakovlev himself dissented noticing that a number of circumstances indicated the murder was organized by the NKVD. According to Amy Knight, the Politburo Commission tried to whitewash Stalin.

=== Significance and responsibility===
Kirov&#x27;s assassination became a major event in the history of the Soviet Union because it was used by Stalin to justify Moscow trials and his campaign of terror known as the Great Purge. At the time of Kirov&#x27;s murder, Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, was out of the country; his daughter Tanya implied that Litvinov realised this event might be an excuse for Stalin to unleash a reign of terror. This view was confirmed by Anastas Mikoyan&#x27;s son, who stated that the murder of Kirov had certain similarities to the burning of the Reichstag in Nazi Germany in 1933. The fire at the Reichstag was often said to have been organized by the Nazis as a pretext for the mass persecution of the Communists and Social Democrats in Germany. The physical removal of Kirov meant the elimination of a future potential rival for Stalin; the principal objective, as with the fire at the Reichstag, was to manufacture an excuse for repression and control. Based on circumstantial evidence, a number of historians concluded that the assassination was ordered by Stalin.

According to Orlov, Stalin ordered Yagoda to arrange the assassination of Kirov. Orlov said that Yagoda ordered Medved&#x27;s deputy, Vania Zaporozhets, to undertake the job. Zaporozhets returned to Leningrad in search of an assassin; in reviewing the files he found the name of Leonid Nikolayev. According to another Soviet defector, Grigori Tokaev, a real oppositionist underground group assassinated Kirov. Author and Menshevik scholar Boris Nikolaevsky argued: &quot;One thing is certain: the only man who profited by the Kirov assassination was Stalin.&quot; 

The idea of Stalin&#x27;s complicity in Kirov&#x27;s assassination has been backed by Robert Conquest and Amy Knight but challenged by revisionist historians who argued that this theory relies primarily on circumstantial evidence and Khrushchev-era investigations. Robert W. Thurston argued that Kirov was in agreement with Stalin on all major issues and that on the Seventeenth Party Congress, at least 86,5% of voting delegates were in favour of Stalin&#x27;s membership of the Central Committee; hence, Stalin had little to fear from Kirov. Moreover, nothing in Nikolaev&#x27;s personal diary indicates that he did not carry out the assassination on his own. 

Alla Kirilina and Oleg Khlevniuk went as far as to claim that &quot;the conventional narratives are almost entirely myth&quot; because they did not find any orders of assassination in the former Soviet archives. Edvard Radzinsky argued in his biography of Stalin that written documents about Stalin ordering the assassination of Kirov were never found simply because they never existed and could not exist. Radzinsky believes that Stalin was behind the assassination, but given the prominent status of Kirov as a Politburo member, it would have been ordered verbally by Stalin to NKVD director Genrikh Yagoda.

== Legacy ==

Many cities, streets, and factories were named or renamed after Kirov in Russia, including the cities of Kirov (formerly Vyatka) and Kirov Oblast, Kirovsk (Murmansk Oblast), Kirov (Kaluga Oblast), Kirovohrad (formerly Zinovyevsk, now Kropyvnytskyi) and Kirovohrad Oblast (Ukrainian SSR; now Ukraine), Kirovabad (Azerbaijani SSR; now Ganja, Azerbaijan), Kirovakan (Armenian SSR; now Vanadzor, Armenia), the Kirovskaya station of the Moscow Metro (now Chistye Prudy station), the Kirov Ballet (now the Mariinsky Ballet), the massive Kirov Plant in Saint Petersburg, Kirov Square in Yekaterinburg, the Kirov Islands in the Kara Sea, and various small settlements. 
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the locations and buildings named after Kirov have been renamed, especially outside of Russia. In order to comply with Ukrainian decommunization laws, Kirovohrad was renamed Kropyvnytskyi by the Ukrainian Parliament on 14 July 2016. In 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine approved the change of the oblast&#x27;s name to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast, or Kropyvnychchyna. 

The S. M. Kirov Forestry Academy in Leningrad was named after him but renamed the Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University. For many years, a huge granite and bronze statue of Kirov dominated the city of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, erected on a hill in 1939. The statue was dismantled in January 1992, shortly after Azerbaijan gained its independence.

The Kirov Prize, a speedskating match in the city of Kirov, was named for him. The Kirov Prize is the oldest annual organised race in speedskating, apart from the World Speed Skating Championships and the European Speed Skating Championships. The English communist poet John Cornford wrote an eponymous poem in his honour. The Soviet Navy cruiser &quot;Kirov&quot; was named after him, and by extension the &quot;Kirov&quot;-class cruiser. The &quot;Kirov&quot; name was again used for the battlecruiser &quot;Kirov&quot; and the &quot;Kirov&quot;-class battlecruiser. The &quot;Khai-3&quot; tailless airplane was also named after him.
==Personal life==
Kirov was married to Maria Lvovna Markus (1885–1945) since 1911, although they never formally registered their relationship. Yevgenia Kostrikova (1921–1975), who claimed to be Kirov&#x27;s daughter, was a famous tank company commander and World War II veteran.

<text>Eyeball () is a 1975 giallo slasher film written and directed by Umberto Lenzi. It was an international co-production between Italy and Spain.

==Plot==

Alma Burton, whose marriage to Mark, the owner of a marketing company in the U.S. state of Vermont, is on the verge of divorce, is supposed to go to a mental institution in New York for treatment. However, at the airport she changes her plans at short notice and travels via Barcelona to Miami, Florida.

While in the Spanish city, a tour group of American tourists, which includes the secretary Paulette Stone, the lesbian photographer Lisa Sanders and her African-American model friend Naiba, as well as several wealthy entrepreneurs, are exploring Barcelona&#x27;s sights by bus. However, the traveling party is soon shaken by a gruesome incident: the mysterious murder of a local woman. The victim, a young girl, is brutally killed by a murderer wearing a red raincoat who also gouges out her left eye. Soon after, the attractive American Peggy becomes the unknown serial killer&#x27;s next victim, causing consternation among the travelers.

The aging inspector Tudela, who is in his last week of work before retirement, takes over the investigation together with his young successor. The police are initially in the dark, but soon suspect that the perpetrator is in the group&#x27;s environment, so that each of the travelers is formally classified as a potential murderer.

Mark Burton also soon joins the group, which includes his secret mistress, Paulette Stone. However, the series of murders does not stop, and Mark briefly fears that his unstable wife could be the murderer, as he once found her lying on the ground next to him with a bloody knife and one eye in her hand. He kept this incident quiet at the time and even covered up the traces so as not to endanger his marriage. He secretly thinks his wife Alma, who he currently suspects is somewhere in Barcelona, is a suspect. He initially kept this fact secret from the authorities.

Shortly after, Lisa Sanders is murdered, but before her death she manages to take an incriminating photo of the serial killer: Paulette, while Naiba interrupts the attack so that Paulette, contrary to previous crimes, does not mutilate her victim. Nevertheless, the series of murders does not stop and the number of tourists continues to decline until the serial perpetrator is caught red-handed at the end of the film. In the presence of Naiba and Mark, the inspector fatally injures Paulette, armed with a knife. It is revealed that her left eye is missing due to an accident when she was a child, hence her mutilation of the murder victims.

In the last scene of the film, the young inspector congratulates his experienced predecessor, who managed to solve the delicate series of murders within a week. Mark also makes a conciliatory phone call to his wife Alma, whom he gives another chance to save his marriage.

<doc id="58352" wikidata="Q2032716" url="?curid=58352" title="Sport in the Netherlands">
<text>Approximately 5 million of the 17 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two thirds of the population older than 15 years participates in sports weekly.

Football is the most popular sport in the Netherlands, with field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports. Speed skating, cycling, tennis and golf are the four most widely played individual sports. A number of native Dutch sports are also practiced, such as fierljeppen (polsstokverspringen), beugelen, kaatsen, klootschieten, kolven and korfball.

Organization of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 356 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 147 medals at the Winter Olympic Games.

An influential figure in Dutch sport was Pim Mulier. In 1879, he founded the first rugby and football club in the Netherlands, and he was involved in forming the first tennis club in 1884. He also established the predecessor of the Royal Dutch Football Association five years later, and introduced field hockey in 1896, as well as bandy. His hometown Haarlem and the English Bury Fen Bandy Club played the first international match.

==Team sports==

===Football===
The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) is the largest sports federation in the country with 1,076,759 players (in 2005). According to the KNVB&#x27;s website, it has over 1.2 million members as of 2016. The organization came into being on 19 December 1899, and was one of the founding members of FIFA (the world Football Association) in 1904.

Dutch football teams won three Olympic bronze medals in 1908, 1912 and 1920. Other successes came in the 1970s, when the national team played in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cup finals, losing to the tournament&#x27;s host on both occasions. In the same period, Dutch league sides Ajax and Feyenoord won European Cups from 1970 to 1973. In 1988, the national team won the only international title so far at the European Championships. PSV won the European Cup that year too. Ajax won the European Cup again in 1995.

Despite their wealth of individual talent, the Dutch national men team have only been able to claim one trophy in their entire history. This came at the UEFA Euro 1988 in which they defeated the Soviet Union to claim the coveted Henri Delaunay Trophy. In 2017 the Dutch national woman team equalized this result when they beat Denmark, claiming their European title on home ground.

Many Dutch football players have gained international fame, such as Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Kluivert, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Clarence Seedorf, Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Frenkie de Jong. Rinus Michels was named Coach of the Century by FIFA in 1999. Additional football notoriety came with the Dutch team&#x27;s participation in the 2010 World Cup finals, in which they lost to Spain, giving Spain its first World Cup title. In June 2019 the Netherlands reached their 6th major final, where they lost to Portugal in the UEFA Nations League final. A month later the national woman team reached their first World Cup Final against USA.

Football stadiums Johan Cruyff Arena and De Kuip have UEFA&#x27;s 5-star rating, enabling them to host finals of the UEFA Champions League and the European Championship.

===Baseball===
The Royal Dutch Baseball Federation was established on 12 March 1912. They merged with the softball federation to form the Royal Dutch Baseball and Softball Federation in 1971 In 2008 there were over 24,000 players active at one of the 184 clubs in the country.

The Netherlands boasts the most successful national baseball team in Europe, winning the European Baseball Championship 20 times and frequently representing the continent in international competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and Baseball World Cup. There is a domestic professional baseball league whose best team, Neptunus of Rotterdam, regularly contends for the European club championship, including five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004.

Baseball is especially popular on the island of Curaçao. In 2005, the Pabao Little League Champions of Willemstad advanced all the way to the championship game in the Little League World Series. Former New York Yankees outfielder Andruw Jones, now of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in Japan&#x27;s Pacific League, is arguably the most successful and popular baseball player to emerge from Curaçao, and in 2006 was a member of the Netherlands national team that participated in the inaugural World Baseball Classic. Jair Jurrjens, pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, became the first pitcher from Curaçao to pitch in the major leagues. John Houseman became the first Dutch-born player in the Major Leagues when he made his debut for the Chicago Colts in 1894. Bert Blyleven was an All-Star, a two-time World Series champion and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011.

In 2009, the Netherlands twice upset the Dominican Republic in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. The Dominican Republic&#x27;s entire roster played in Major League Baseball (MLB), while the Netherlands only had one player on an MLB roster. The Dominican teams&#x27; combined salary total in the MLB was about $84 million, while the Netherlands totals for $400,000. The Dominican Republic were highly favoured but in its first game against the Dominican, the Dutch won 3–2. The Dominican Republic won its next game against Panama to set up a rematch against the Netherlands. The Dutch stunned the Dominicans again and won 2–1 in extra innings. At the 2013 World Baseball Classic the Netherlands performed even better. With a mix of experienced veterans and talented youngsters they progressed through the preliminary rounds to the semi-final, where the team lost to the Dominican Republic. The team again reached the semifinals at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but again fell one game shy of the championship, losing this time to Puerto Rico.

===Field hockey===

The Royal Dutch Hockey Federation was formed on 8 October 1898 and is, with 185,923 members (in 2005), the fifth largest sports federation. &quot;Men&#x27;s Hoofdklasse Hockey&quot; and &quot;Women&#x27;s Hoofdklasse Hockey&quot; are the country&#x27;s primary hockey competitions, which are contested by 12 clubs in both the male and female league.

As of 2024, the Netherlands women&#x27;s national field hockey team is the most successful team in World Cup and Olympic history, having won the title nine and five times respectively. The Dutch male hockey team has won both the World Cup and Olympic gold on three occasions. Several Dutch hockey league clubs have won the European Cup. At the Paris 2024 Olympics both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams won the gold medal.

===Korfball===

Korfball is a mixed gender or only female ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. It is played by two teams of eight players with four females and four males in each team or with eight female players in each team. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a high pole. Mixed gender korfball is more generally played in the north of the Netherlands, while all female korfball is generally played in the south of the Netherlands.
The sport was invented by Dutch schoolteacher Nico Broekhuysen in 1902. In the Netherlands, there are around 580 clubs and over 100,000 people playing korfball. The sport is also very popular in Belgium and Taiwan, and is played in 54 other countries.
The Dutch korfball union is called Koninklijk Nederlands Korfbalverbond (KNKV).

===Basketball===
Basketball is also a popular sport in the Netherlands. The national team had its most successful time during the 1980s. At the 1983 European Basketball Championship the team finished in the final four and qualified to the 1986 FIBA World Championship where the Dutch left behind strong competition such as Team Australia and Team Germany. During that time, the Dutch had its strong players in Jelle Esveldt and a young Rik Smits. Smits later became an NBA All-Star and emerged as the Dutch basketball-icon for years to come.

Since 2000, basketball in the Netherlands went through some revival and has been home to several National Basketball Association (NBA) players, including Francisco Elson and Dan Gadzuric.

===Handball===
While the men&#x27;s national handball team has only qualified for the World Championship once and also once for the European Championship and never for the Olympic Games, the women&#x27;s team have been more successful, with a gold medal at the 2019 World Women&#x27;s Handball Championship as the best result.

===Volleyball===
Volleyball is the third most participated team sport in the country. Founded on 6 September 1947, the Dutch Volleyball Federation is with 128,693 players (in 2005) the ninth largest sports association. The A-League is the highest division in which eight men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams compete for the national championships.

The national men&#x27;s team is the most successful exponent, winning the silver medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and the gold medal four years later in Atlanta. The biggest success of the women&#x27;s national team was winning the European Championship in 1995 and the World Grand Prix in 2007

The Netherlands featured national teams in beach volleyball that competed at the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s section at the 2018–2020 CEV Beach Volleyball Continental Cup.

===Cricket===

The Royal Dutch Cricket Federation was formed in 1883. In 2021 the federation had 5000 members, which indicates that cricket is a minority sport in the Netherland yet still growing. The premier division is called the &quot;Topklasse&quot;, in which ten teams compete for the national championships.

The Netherlands national cricket team qualified for the cricket World Cup on five occasions; 1996, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2023. The country has been considered one of the stronger associate in the world and in Europe alongside Scotland. Netherlands is ranked within the top 15 teams in the world and has co-hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1999.

Most recently at the 2009 World Twenty20 in England, the Dutch team made a name for themselves by their victory over hosts, England, in the opening match of the tournament. Though they failed to qualify for the Super Eight stage afterward, their win against England, considered one of the biggest wins in Dutch cricket history. Recently the Dutch have managed to beat two time world champions West Indies in the ICC Men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup Qualifiers Zimbabwe 2023 considered ones of the biggest upsets in Cricket history due to it eventually leading to the West Indies not being able to qualify for the World Cup in India 2023.

In ICC Men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup 2023 Dutch team led by captain Scott Edwards has surprised the cricket world by beating South Africa and Bangladesh by big margins.

===Bandy===
In terms of licensed athletes, bandy is the second biggest winter sport in the world.

Bandy was introduced to the Netherlands in the 1890s and enjoyed some following for a couple of decades before ice hockey took over as the most popular winter team sport in the 1920s. However, bandy lived on in the Netherlands, and in the 1970s, it got a more organised form again. Bandy Bond Nederland became the first non-founding member of Federation of International Bandy in 1973. The national team plays in Division B of the World Championships.

===Lacrosse===
For the first time, the Netherlands will feature a national team at the 2022 Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships.

==Individual sports==

===Ice skating===

The Royal Dutch Skating Federation was formed on 17 September 1882. With 161,673 members they are the seventh largest sports federation (in 2005).

====Speed skating====
The first official known speed skating competition ever for women was held in Leeuwarden from 1 to 2 February 1805 and was won by Trijntje Pieters Westra.

After a successful period around 1900, with Jaap Eden and Coen de Koning as World Champions, Dutch speed skating successes became numerous in the 1960s. Champions Kees Verkerk and Ard Schenk were immensely popular, causing a real speed skating hype in the country. Successes continue up to today, with the likes of Yvonne van Gennip (3 Olympic gold medals in 1988), Rintje Ritsma (4-time World
Allround Champion), Jochem Uytdehaage (2 Olympic gold medals in 2002), Marianne Timmer (3 Olympic gold medals in 1998 and 2006), Ireen Wüst (5 Olympic golds in 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 6 World Allround Speed Skating Championships) and Sven Kramer (4 Olympic gold medals in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 9 World Allround Championships). The Dutch speed skaters&#x27; performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Thialf Stadium in Heerenveen was the second indoor 400m speed skating oval in the world, the first to host an international championship and remains a world-class facility today.
Dutch speed skaters have won 77 world single distance championships (since 1996).

====Figure skating====
Sjoukje Dijkstra is the most successful Dutch figure skater, winning the World Championships three times, the European Championships five times and two Olympic medals. Her Olympic gold in 1964 in Innsbruck was the first time an athlete from the Netherlands won gold at an Olympic Winter Games. Dianne de Leeuw won the silver medal in figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics.

===Cycling===


The Royal Dutch Cycling Union was instituted on 26 January 1928. Two Dutch road racing cyclists have won the Tour de France: Jan Janssen and Joop Zoetemelk. In 2017, Tom Dumoulin won the Giro d&#x27;Italia, becoming the first Dutchman to win the race and the first Dutch Grand Tour winner since Zoetemelk&#x27;s Tour win in 1980. Eight Dutchmen have been World Champion on the road (Theo Middelkamp (1947), Jan Janssen (1964), Harm Ottenbros (1969), Hennie Kuiper (1975), Gerrie Knetemann (1978), Jan Raas (1979), Joop Zoetemelk (1985) and Mathieu van der Poel (2023)), but only one Dutchman has won the time trial World Championship Tom Dumoulin (2017). Eight women have been road race World Champions (Keetie van Oosten-Hage (1968, 1976), Tineke Fopma (1975), Petra de Bruijn (1979), Leontien van Moorsel (1991, 1993), Marianne Vos (2006, 2012, 2013), Chantal Blaak (2017), Anna van der Breggen (2018, 2020) and Annemiek van Vleuten (2019, 2022)) and four have been World Champions in the time trial (Leontien van Moorsel (1998, 1999), Ellen van Dijk (2013, 2021, 2022), Annemiek van Vleuten (2017, 2018) and Anna van der Breggen (2020)). At the Olympic Games the Netherlands has won 23 gold medals in cycling (ten in road cycling, 11 in track cycling and one each in mountain biking and BMX). Only three countries have won more gold cycling medals at the Olympics. Erik Dekker won the 2001 Cycling World Cup. Mathieu van der Poel is a three-time world champion in cyclo-cross and Dutch women have won more medals than any other country at the cyclo-cross World championships.
