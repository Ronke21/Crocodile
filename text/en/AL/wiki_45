<text>Lev Ivanovich Yashin (; 22 October 1929 – 20 March 1990) was a Soviet professional footballer considered by many to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the sport. He was known for his athleticism, positioning, imposing presence in goal, and acrobatic reflex saves. He was also deputy chairman of the Football Federation of the Soviet Union.

Yashin earned status for revolutionising the goalkeeping position by imposing his authority on the entire defence. A vocal presence in goal, he shouted orders at his defenders, came off his line to intercept crosses and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers, done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action. His performances made an indelible impression on a global audience at the 1958 World Cup, the first to be broadcast internationally. He dressed head to toe in apparent black (in truth very dark blue), thus earning his nicknames &quot;the Black Spider&quot; or &quot;the Black Panther&quot;, which enhanced his popularity. 
Yashin appeared in three World Cups from 1958 to 1966 and was an unused squad member in 1970. In 2002 was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 1994, he was chosen for the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, and in 1998 was chosen as a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. According to FIFA, Yashin saved over 150 penalty kicks in professional football — more than any other goalkeeper. He also kept over 270 clean sheets in his career, winning a gold medal at the 1956 Olympic football tournament, and the 1960 European Championships.

In 1963, Yashin received the Ballon d&#x27;Or, the only goalkeeper ever to receive the award. He was additionally named posthumously to the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team in 2020, a greatest all-time XI, and was voted the best goalkeeper of the 20th century by the IFFHS. He was also named to the IFFHS All-time Men&#x27;s Dream Team in 2021. He was named by &quot;France Football&quot; as the greatest goalkeeper of all time in 2020. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Russia by the Russian Football Union as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. In 2019, &quot;France Football&quot; established the Yashin Trophy for the best performing goalkeeper, and is awarded alongside the Ballon D&#x27;Or.

==Early life==
Yashin was born in Moscow, in a Russian family of industrial workers. When he was 12, World War II forced him to work in a factory to support the Soviet war effort. However his health at the age of 18 (after he suffered a nervous breakdown) meant he was unable to work. Thus, he was sent to work in a military factory in Moscow. After being spotted playing for the factory team he was invited to join the Dynamo Moscow youth team.

==Club career==

Yashin’s debut for Dynamo Moscow came in 1950 in a friendly match. It was not the debut he would have hoped for, as he conceded a soft goal scored straight from a clearance by the opposing keeper. That year he played in only two league games, and did not appear in a senior match again until 1953. But he remained determined, and stayed at Dynamo in the reserves waiting for another opportunity. Yashin also played goalie for the Dynamo ice hockey team during those early years of trying to break into the senior squad. He managed to win a USSR ice hockey cup in 1953 and was third in the USSR ice hockey championship as goalkeeper.

He spent his entire professional football career with Dynamo Moscow, from 1950 to 1970, winning the USSR football championship five times and the Soviet Cup three times. Yashin&#x27;s club teammate, rival and mentor was Alexei &quot;Tiger&quot; Khomich, the keeper of the Soviet national team, who had become famous for his role in Dynamo Moscow’s British tour. He also internally rivalled goalkeeper Valter Sanaya, who left the club in 1953.

==International career==

In 1954, Yashin was called up to the Soviet national team, and would go on to gather 78 caps. With the national team he won the 1956 Summer Olympics as well as the first European championship, the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup. He also played in three World Cups, in 1958, 1962 and 1966. Yashin is credited with four clean sheets out of the 12 games he played in the World Cup finals.

The 1958 World Cup, played in Sweden, put Yashin on the map for his performances, with the Soviet Union advancing to the quarter-finals. In a group stage match against the eventual Cup winners Brazil, the Soviet team lost 2–0. Facing a Brazil team that featured Garrincha and a 17 year old Pelé in attack, Yashin&#x27;s performance prevented the score from becoming a rout.

Yashin was nominated for Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1960 and 1961 and placed fifth and fourth, respectively. In 1962, despite suffering two concussions during the tournament, he once again led the team to a quarter-final finish, before losing to host country Chile. That tournament showed that Yashin was all too human, having made some uncharacteristic mistakes. In the game against Colombia, which the Soviet Union was leading 4–1, Yashin let in a few soft goals, including a goal scored by Marcos Coll directly from a corner kick. It was the first and the only goal scored directly from a corner in FIFA World Cup history. The Soviet Union&#x27;s game against Colombia finished in a 4–4 draw, which led the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; to predict the end of Yashin&#x27;s career. He did, however, make an outstanding save against Chile in the quarter-final. Despite this, the Soviet Union suffered a 2–1 defeat and were eliminated from the World Cup.

Despite the disappointment of the 1962 World Cup, Yashin would bounce back to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or in December 1963. One of his best performances that year was the 1963 England v Rest of the World football match, where he made a number of spectacular saves. From that point onward he was known to the world as the &quot;Black Spider&quot; because he wore a distinctive all-black outfit and because it seemed as though he had eight arms to save almost everything. But to his fans, he was always the fearless &quot;Black Panther&quot;. He often played wearing a cloth cap of burnt-brick colour. Yashin led the Soviet team to its best showing at the FIFA World Cup, a fourth-place finish in the 1966 World Cup held in England.

Always ready to give advice to his comrades, Yashin even made a fourth trip to the World Cup finals in 1970, held in Mexico, as the third-choice back-up and an assistant coach. The Soviet team again reached the quarter-finals. In 1971, in Moscow, he played his last match for Dynamo Moscow. Lev Yashin&#x27;s FIFA testimonial match was held at the Lenin Stadium in Moscow with 100,000 fans attending and a host of football stars, including Pelé, Eusébio and Franz Beckenbauer.

==Personal life and health==
After retiring from playing, Yashin spent almost 20 years in various administrative positions at Dynamo Moscow. A bronze statue of Lev Yashin was erected at the Dynamo Stadium in Moscow.

In 1986, following a thrombophlebitis contracted while he was in Budapest, Yashin underwent the amputation of one of his legs. He died in 1990 of stomach cancer, despite a surgical intervention in an attempt to save his life. He was given a state funeral as a Soviet Honoured Master of Sport.

Yashin was survived by wife Valentina Timofeyevna and daughters Irina and Elena; when Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Valentina was still living in the Moscow apartment that the Soviet state had given her husband in 1964. Yashin has a granddaughter and one surviving grandson; another grandson died in 2002 at age 14 from injuries suffered in a bicycle accident. The surviving grandson, Vasili Frolov, played as a goalkeeper in Dynamo&#x27;s youth section and was on the books of the senior side, but never played a game with the senior side, retiring from play at age 23. He now runs a goalkeeper training school in Moscow near Spartak Moscow&#x27;s current stadium.

==Style of play and accolades==

Considered by many in the sport to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game, Yashin was an imposing presence in goal due to his tall stature, and was highly regarded for his athleticism, agility, positional sense, bravery, and exceptional reflexes, which enabled him to produce acrobatic and spectacular saves. Yashin remains the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d&#x27;Or, in 1963. He also stopped 151 penalty kicks during his career, more than any other goalkeeper in history, and kept over 270 clean sheets. For his outstanding service to the people and to his country, Yashin was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1967, the highest award of the USSR.

A vocal and authoritative figure between the posts, Yashin is known for revolutionising the goalkeeping position: he shouted orders at his defenders, came off his line to intercept crosses, and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers, done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action. Yashin would always organise the defensive game of his team, often so fiercely that even his wife accused him of yelling too much on the pitch. He rarely captained his teams, as the later accepted custom of appointing a goalkeeper captain was virtually unheard-of in that era, but his leadership on the field was always evident. Yashin was one of the goalkeepers who began the practice of punching balls out in difficult situations instead of trying to catch them. Other novel practices he developed were the quick throw of the ball to begin a counterattack, coming out of the penalty area to anticipate danger, and the command and organisation of the defenders – practices now quite common among goalkeepers. When asked what his secret was, he would reply that the trick was &quot;to have a smoke to calm your nerves, then toss back a strong drink to tone your muscles.&quot;

In 1994, FIFA established the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper at the World Cup finals. FIFA polls named Yashin as the sole goalkeeper in World Team of the 20th Century. &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine named him in their 100 Greatest Players of the 20th century. Many commentators consider Yashin the best goalkeeper in the history of football, which has resulted in him being chosen to be the goalkeeper in most of the world-all-time teams (including the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team and the FIFA Dream Team). In 2020 Yashin was named in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI.

<text>The skull crucible process was developed at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow to manufacture cubic zirconia. It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia&#x27;s melting-point being too high for even platinum crucibles.

In essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own &quot;crucible&quot; from its cooler outer layers. The term &quot;skull&quot; refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume. Zirconium oxide powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool. Heating is accomplished by radio frequency induction using a coil wrapped around the apparatus. The outside of the device is water-cooled in order to keep the radio frequency coil from melting and also to cool the outside of the zirconium oxide and thus maintain the shape of the zirconium powder.
Since zirconium oxide in its solid state does not conduct electricity, a piece of zirconium metal is placed inside the gob of zirconium oxide. As the zirconium melts it oxidizes and blends with the now molten zirconium oxide, a conductor, and is heated by radio frequency induction.

When the zirconium oxide is melted on the inside (but not completely, since the outside needs to remain solid) the amplitude of the RF induction coil is gradually reduced and crystals form as the material cools. Normally this would form a monoclinic crystal system of zirconium oxide.

In order to maintain a cubic crystal system a stabilizer is added, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide or yttrium oxide as well as any material to color the crystal. After the mixture cools the outer shell is broken off and the interior of the gob is then used to manufacture gemstones.

<text>Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, art, and science of determining the terrestrial two-dimensional or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, locations, such as the designated positions of structural components for construction or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.

A professional in land surveying is called a land surveyor.
Surveyors work with elements of geodesy, geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming languages, and the law. They use equipment, such as total stations, robotic total stations, theodolites, GNSS receivers, retroreflectors, 3D scanners, lidar sensors, radios, inclinometer, handheld tablets, optical and digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, GIS, and surveying software.

Surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. It is used in the planning and execution of most forms of construction. It is also used in transportation, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.

==Definition==
The International Federation of Surveyors defines the function of surveying as follows:

A surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;
* to determine, measure and represent land, three-dimensional objects, point-fields and trajectories;
* to assemble and interpret land and geographically related information,
* to use that information for the planning and efficient administration of the land, the sea and any structures thereon; and,
* to conduct research into the above practices and to develop them.
==History==
===Ancient history===

Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In ancient Egypt, a rope stretcher would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the Nile River. The almost perfect squareness and north–south orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built , affirm the Egyptians&#x27; command of surveying. The &quot;groma&quot; instrument may have originated in Mesopotamia (early 1st millennium BC). The prehistoric monument at Stonehenge () was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.

The mathematician Liu Hui described ways of measuring distant objects in his work &quot;Haidao Suanjing&quot; or &quot;The Sea Island Mathematical Manual&quot;, published in 263 AD.

The Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD). Roman surveyors were known as &quot;Gromatici&quot;.

In medieval Europe, beating the bounds maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.

In England, William the Conqueror commissioned the Domesday Book in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area&#x27;s content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.

===Modern era===
Abel Foullon described a plane table in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.

Gunter&#x27;s chain was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician Edmund Gunter. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.

Leonard Digges described a theodolite that measured horizontal angles in his book &quot;A geometric practice named Pantometria&quot; (1571). Joshua Habermel (Erasmus Habermehl) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.

In the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. Jesse Ramsden introduced the first precision theodolite in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his great theodolite using an accurate dividing engine of his own design. Ramsden&#x27;s theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument&#x27;s accuracy. William Gascoigne invented an instrument that used a telescope with an installed crosshair as a target device, in 1640. James Watt developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the parallactic angle from which the distance to a point could be deduced.

Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of triangulation. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Breda, approximately . He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the Earth. He also showed how to resect, or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, Jacques Cassini and his son César undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the meridian arc, leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time triangulation methods were well established for local map-making.

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General William Roy&#x27;s Ordnance Survey of Great Britain began the Principal Triangulation of Britain. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The Great Trigonometric Survey of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped Mount Everest and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out canals, roads and rail.

In the US, the Land Ordinance of 1785 created the Public Land Survey System. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.

Napoleon Bonaparte founded continental Europe&#x27;s first cadastre in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.

Robert Torrens introduced the Torrens system in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.
Surveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the century, surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but they still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. Trevor Lloyd Wadley developed the Tellurometer during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.
During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced electronic distance measurement (EDM) equipment. EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance. These instruments eliminated the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.

Advances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as total stations. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders and on-board calculation programs.

The first satellite positioning system was the US Navy TRANSIT system. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system&#x27;s main purpose was to provide position information to Polaris missile submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.

The US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission, thus improving accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Later improvements to both satellites and receivers allowed for Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys provide high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.

===21st century===
The theodolite, total station and RTK GPS survey remain the primary methods in use.

Remote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and lidar-based topographical surveys. UAV technology along with photogrammetric image processing is also appearing.

==Equipment==
=== Hardware ===
The main surveying instruments in use around the world are the theodolite, measuring tape, total station, 3D scanners, GPS/GNSS, level and rod. Most instruments screw onto a tripod when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.

The theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate &quot;circles&quot;, &quot;protractors&quot; or &quot;alidades&quot; to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.

The gyrotheodolite is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.

The total station is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.

Modern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to satellite positioning systems, such as Global Positioning System. Real Time Kinematic GPS systems have significantly increased the speed of surveying, and they are now horizontally accurate to within 1 cm ± 1 ppm in real-time, while vertically it is currently about half of that to within 2 cm ± 2 ppm.

GPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate baseline that can be over 20 km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.

Surveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys make them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place beacons on the ground (about apart). This method reaches precisions between 5–40 cm (depending on flight height).

Surveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; PPE; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.

===Software===
Land surveyors, construction professionals, geomatics engineers and civil engineers using total station, GPS, 3D scanners, and other collector data use land surveying software to increase efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.

Typically, much if not all of the drafting and some of the designing for plans and plats of the surveyed property is done by the surveyor, and nearly everyone working in the area of drafting today (2021) utilizes CAD software and hardware both on PC, and more and more in newer generation data collectors in the field as well. Other computer platforms and tools commonly used today by surveyors are offered online by the U.S. Federal Government and other governments&#x27; survey agencies, such as the National Geodetic Survey and the CORS network, to get automated corrections and conversions for collected GPS data, and the data coordinate systems themselves.

==Techniques==
Surveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.
GPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.

===Distance measurement===

Before EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) laser devices, distances were measured using a variety of means. In pre-colonial America Natives would use the &quot;bow shot&quot; as a distance reference (&quot;as far as an arrow can slung out of a bow&quot;, or &quot;flights of a Cherokee long bow&quot;). Europeans used chains with links of a known length such as a Gunter&#x27;s chain, or measuring tapes made of steel or invar. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to &quot;break&quot; (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. Perambulators, or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. Tacheometry is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.

===Angle measurement===
Historically, horizontal angles were measured by using a compass to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with reticles atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see theodolite). Levels and calibrated circles allowed the measurement of vertical angles. Verniers allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century transit.

The plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 Francis Ronalds invented a reflecting instrument for recording angles graphically by modifying the octant.

By observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180° difference. This is called a &quot;close&quot;. If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the &quot;angular misclose&quot;. The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.

===Leveling===

The simplest method for measuring height is with an altimeter using air pressure to find the height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the Global Positioning System (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually, GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. &quot;Turning&quot; is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To &quot;turn&quot; the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun, which is why this method is referred to as &quot;differential levelling&quot;. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

===Determining position===
The primary way of determining one&#x27;s position on the Earth&#x27;s surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the Sun, Moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument&#x27;s position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on Earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the Earth.

===Reference networks===

Few survey positions are derived from the first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previously measured points. This forms a reference or &quot;control&quot; network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.

Survey points are usually marked on the earth&#x27;s surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to large beacons that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments in this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.

&quot;Triangulation&quot; is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for topographic maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the baseline. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements were repeated for increased accuracy. See also Triangulation in three dimensions.

&quot;Offsetting&quot; is an alternate method of determining the position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.

&quot;Traversing&quot; is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyors start from an old reference mark or known position and place a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.

====Datum and coordinate systems====
Many surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the Earth, but instead, measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey&#x27;s objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the Earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the Earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a &#x27;datum&#x27; (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the Earth&#x27;s curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.

For larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the Earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the Earth.

===Errors and accuracy===

A basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error. There are three classes of survey errors:
*&quot;Gross errors or blunders:&quot; Errors made by the surveyor during the survey. Upsetting the instrument, misaiming a target, or writing down a wrong measurement are all gross errors. A large gross error may reduce the accuracy to an unacceptable level. Therefore, surveyors use redundant measurements and independent checks to detect these errors early in the survey.
*&quot;Systematic:&quot; Errors that follow a consistent pattern. Examples include effects of temperature on a chain or EDM measurement, or a poorly adjusted spirit-level causing a tilted instrument or target pole. Systematic errors that have known effects can be compensated or corrected.
*&quot;Random:&quot; Random errors are small unavoidable fluctuations. They are caused by imperfections in measuring equipment, eyesight, and conditions. They can be minimized by redundancy of measurement and avoiding unstable conditions. Random errors tend to cancel each other out, but checks must be made to ensure they are not propagating from one measurement to the next.

Surveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used, and errors can be detected by comparing the results of two or more measurements, thus utilizing redundancy.

Once the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in his or her work, it is adjusted. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the Bowditch method, also known as the compass rule, and the principle of least squares method.

The surveyor must be able to distinguish between accuracy and precision. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25 ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8 inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.

==Types==
Local organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:
* &quot;As-built survey&quot;: a survey that documents the location of recently constructed elements of a construction project. As-built surveys are done for record, completion evaluation and payment purposes. An as-built survey is also known as a &#x27;works as executed survey&#x27;. As built surveys are often presented in red or redline and laid over existing plans for comparison with design information.
* &quot;Cadastral or boundary surveying&quot;: a survey that establishes or re-establishes boundaries of a parcel using a legal description. It involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the boundaries of a parcel. These take the form of iron rods, pipes, or concrete monuments in the ground, or nails set in concrete or asphalt. The &quot;ALTA/ACSM&quot; Land Title Survey is a standard proposed by the American Land Title Association and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. It incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey.
* &quot;Control surveying&quot;: Control surveys establish reference points to use as starting positions for future surveys. Most other forms of surveying will contain elements of control surveying.
* &quot;Construction surveying&quot; and &quot;engineering surveying&quot;: topographic, layout, and as-built surveys associated with engineering design. They often need geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice.
* &quot;Deformation survey:&quot; a survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. First the positions of points on an object are found. A period of time is allowed to pass and the positions are then re-measured and calculated. Then a comparison between the two sets of positions is made.
* &quot;Dimensional control survey:&quot; This is a type of survey conducted in or on a non-level surface. Common in the oil and gas industry to replace old or damaged pipes on a like-for-like basis, the advantage of dimensional control survey is that the instrument used to conduct the survey does not need to be level. This is useful in the off-shore industry, as not all platforms are fixed and are thus subject to movement.
* &quot;Foundation survey&quot;: a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foundation was constructed in the location, and at the elevation, authorized in the &quot;plot plan&quot;, &quot;site plan&quot;, or &quot;subdivision plan&quot;.
* &quot;Hydrographic survey&quot;: a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the shoreline and bed of a body of water. Used for navigation, engineering, or resource management purposes.
* &quot;Leveling&quot;: either finds the elevation of a given point or establish a point at a given elevation.
* &quot;LOMA survey&quot;: Survey to change base flood line, removing property from a Special Flood Hazard Area.
* &quot;Measured survey&quot; : a building survey to produce plans of the building. such a survey may be conducted before renovation works, for commercial purpose, or at end of the construction process.
* &quot;Mining surveying&quot;: Mining surveying includes directing the digging of mine shafts and galleries and the calculation of volume of rock. It uses specialised techniques due to the restraints to survey geometry such as vertical shafts and narrow passages.
* &quot;Mortgage survey:&quot; A &quot;mortgage survey&quot; or &quot;physical survey&quot; is a simple survey that delineates land boundaries and building locations. It checks for &quot;encroachment&quot;, building setback restrictions and shows nearby flood zones. In many places a mortgage survey is a precondition for a mortgage loan.
* &quot;Photographic control survey&quot;: A survey that creates reference marks visible from the air to allow aerial photographs to be rectified.
* &quot;Stakeout, layout or setout&quot;: an element of many other surveys where the calculated or proposed position of an object is marked on the ground. This can be temporary or permanent. This is an important component of engineering and cadastral surveying.
* &quot;Structural survey&quot;: a detailed inspection to report upon the physical condition and structural stability of a building or structure. It highlights any work needed to maintain it in good repair.
* &quot;Subdivision&quot;: A boundary survey that splits a property into two or more smaller properties.
* &quot;Topographic survey&quot;: a survey of the positions and elevations of points and objects on a land surface, presented as a topographic map with contour lines.
* &quot;Existing conditions&quot;: Similar to a topographic survey but instead focuses more on the specific location of key features and structures as they exist at that time within the surveyed area rather than primarily focusing on the elevation, often used alongside architectural drawings and blueprints to locate or place building structures.
* &quot;Underwater survey&quot;: a survey of an underwater site, object, or area.

===Plane vs. geodetic surveying===
Based on the considerations and true shape of the Earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.

&quot;Plane surveying&quot; assumes the Earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the Earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the Earth&#x27;s shape are too small to matter.

In &quot;geodetic surveying&quot; the curvature of the Earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic. In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.

=== On the basis of the instrument used ===

* Chain Surveying
* Compass Surveying
* Plane table Surveying
* Levelling
* Theodolite Surveying
* Traverse Surveying
* Tacheometric Surveying
* Aerial Surveying

== Profession ==

The basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.

Surveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, pipelines, retaining walls, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for &quot;geographical information systems&quot; (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.

Surveyors must have a thorough knowledge of algebra, basic calculus, geometry, and trigonometry. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, real property, and contracts.

Most jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:
# &quot;Survey assistants&quot; or &quot;chainmen&quot; are usually unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old reference marks, and mark points on the ground. The term &#x27;chainman&#x27; derives from past use of measuring chains. An assistant would move the far end of the chain under the surveyor&#x27;s direction.
# &quot;Survey technicians&quot; often operate survey instruments, run surveys in the field, do survey calculations, or draft plans. A technician usually has no legal authority and cannot certify his work. Not all technicians are qualified, but qualifications at the certificate or diploma level are available.
# &quot;Licensed, registered, or chartered surveyors&quot; usually hold a degree or higher qualification. They are often required to pass further exams to join a professional association or to gain certifying status. Surveyors are responsible for planning and management of surveys. They have to ensure that their surveys, or surveys performed under their supervision, meet the legal standards. Many principals of surveying firms hold this status.

Related professions include cartographers, hydrographers, geodesists, photogrammetrists, and topographers, as well as civil engineers and geomatics engineers.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a post nominal, which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.

A licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.

In many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on survey monuments when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.

===Surveying institutions===
Most countries&#x27; governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of geodetic networks. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.

Most jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the International Federation of Surveyors (Abbreviated FIG, for ). They represent the survey industry worldwide.

===Building surveying===
Most English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. A building surveyor can provide technical building advice on existing buildings, new buildings, design, compliance with regulations such as planning and building control. A building surveyor normally acts on behalf of his or her client ensuring that their vested interests remain protected. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is a world-recognised governing body for those working within the built environment.

===Cadastral surveying===

One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.

&quot;Cadastral land surveyors&quot; are licensed by governments.
The cadastral survey branch of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States. They consult with Forest Service, National Park Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, and others. The BLM used to be known as the United States General Land Office (GLO).

In states organized per the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.

Cadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.

===Quantity surveying===
Quantity surveying is a profession that deals with the &quot;costs and contracts&quot; of construction projects. A quantity surveyor is an expert in estimating the &quot;costs of materials, labor, and time&quot; needed for a project, as well as managing the &quot;financial and legal aspects&quot; of the project. A quantity surveyor can work for either the client or the contractor, and can be involved in different stages of the project, from planning to completion. Quantity surveyors are also known as &quot;Chartered Surveyors&quot; in the UK.

== Notable surveyors ==


Some U.S. Presidents were land surveyors. George Washington and Abraham Lincoln surveyed colonial or frontier territories early in their career, prior to serving in office.

Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler is considered the &quot;father&quot; of geodetic surveying in the U.S.

<text>&quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; is a British patriotic song, with music by Edward Elgar, written in 1901 and with lyrics by A. C. Benson added in 1902.

==Composition==

The music to which the words of the refrain &#x27;Land of Hope and Glory, &amp;c&#x27; below are set is the &#x27;trio&#x27; theme from Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1&quot;. The words were fitted to the melody on the suggestion of King Edward VII who told Elgar he thought the melody would make a great song. When Elgar was requested to write a work for the King&#x27;s coronation, he worked the suggestion into his &quot;Coronation Ode&quot;, for which he used words provided by the poet and essayist A. C. Benson. The first and last sections of the &quot;Ode&quot; use the march&#x27;s melody.

The first five notes of the refrain are similar to the first two bars of &quot;God Save the King&quot; in an early version published in 1745.

Owing to the King&#x27;s illness, the coronation was postponed. Elgar created a separate song, which was first performed by Madame Clara Butt in June 1902. In fact, only the first of the seven stanzas of the Ode&#x27;s final section was re-used, as the first four lines of the second stanza below. This stanza is the part which is popularly sung today.

 Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,
 How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee?
 Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set;
 God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet,
 God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet!

==Usage==

===BBC Proms===
The Proms began in 1895; in 1901 Elgar&#x27;s newly composed &#x27;Pomp and Circumstance&#x27; March No. 1 was introduced as an orchestral piece (a year before the words were written), conducted by Henry Wood who later recollected &quot;little did I think then that the lovely broad melody of the trio would one day develop into our second national anthem&quot;. It was played as &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; in the last concert of the 1905 proms, and at the first and last concerts of the 1909 Proms, which also featured Wood&#x27;s Fantasia on British Sea Songs. The two pieces were played one after another at the closing concerts in 1916, 1917 and 1918. From 1927, the BBC began supporting the Proms, with radio broadcasts bringing the music to an increasingly wide audience.

&quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; featured in the final concerts for 1928, 1929, 1936 and 1939. By then, audience participation in the second half of the programme had become a ritual, and from 1947 a boisterous &#x27;tradition&#x27; was created by the conductor Malcolm Sargent, making &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; part of a standard programme for the event. The Last Night of the Proms was broadcast annually on television from 1953 onwards, and Promenaders began dressing up outrageously and waving flags and banners during the climax of the evening. In some years, &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; and the other favourites were left out of the programme but reinstated after press and public outrage. In an exception, for the 2001 Last Night concert following the September 11 attacks, the conductor Leonard Slatkin substituted a more serious programme, featuring Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;, but despite the success of this occasion, the now traditional pieces returned the following year.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the BBC announced a decision not to feature &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; as well as &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; in the Last Night of the Proms running order. This break from tradition prompted outrage from some members of the public, the media and some politicians, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson who accused the BBC of &quot;cringing embarrassment about our history&quot;. Further reporting hypothesised that the decision was made in light of renewed prominence for the Black Lives Matter movement, after the murder of George Floyd earlier in the summer, supporters of which accused the songs of glorifying colonialism and slavery. The BBC later reversed the decision, claiming the original move was due to the coronavirus social-distancing measures, and that they would now be sung. Ultimately, both songs were featured albeit with a reduced-capacity choir and orchestra.

=== Sporting events ===

====Rugby====
At international rugby league matches, England often sang &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; as their national anthem. Although their anthem changed to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; after of the Great Britain side in 2007, it is still tradition for the team to use &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; as their walk-out theme.

==== Football ====
Supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club (the team Elgar supported) sing a version of the song with the lyrics changed to &#x27;We will follow the Wanderers over land, sea, and water.&#x27; Their local rivals West Bromwich Albion sing &#x27;We will follow the Albion over land, sea, and water.&#x27; Supporters of Huddersfield Town sing &#x27;We&#x27;re all following Huddersfield, over land and sea&#x27;. Derby County and Chelsea football club supporters sing &#x27;We all follow Derby/Chelsea, over land and sea (and Leicester)&#x27;, although supporters of Arsenal sang this first; similarly Blackburn Rovers fans sing &#x27;We all follow the Rovers, over the land and sea (and Preston!)&#x27;. In Wales Aberystwyth Town supporters sing a version of the song, &#x27;We all follow the Aber, over land and sea and Bangor! we all follow the Aber, on to victory&#x27;. Leeds United supporters sing a version of the song that goes as follows: &#x27;Land of hope and glory, Yorkshire shall be free, We all follow United, onto victory&#x27;. In London, Spurs fans have been heard to sing &#x27;We hate Nottingham Forest. We hate Arsenal, too. We hate Manchester United, but Tottenham we love you.&#x27;

==== Commonwealth Games ====
&quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; was the England team&#x27;s victory anthem at the Commonwealth Games until 2010, when the public rejected it in a poll in favour of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

=== Proposed anthem for England ===

England currently has no agreed national anthem. However, there have been calls for this to be changed, with a 2006 survey conducted by the BBC suggesting that 55% of the English public would rather have &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; than &quot;God Save the King&quot; as their national anthem.

=== Films and television ===
&quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; was sung by Jeanette MacDonald in the 1941 MGM film, &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot;.

Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; uses Elgar&#x27;s version to herald the arrival of the Minister of the Interior in Alex&#x27;s story.

The song inspired the title of John Boorman&#x27;s 1987 film of the same name, depicting World War II through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy.

In 1997, the Labour Party broadcast a 5 minute long television broadcast criticizing the Conservative Party and John Major&#x27;s handling as Prime Minister. The song was ironically used in the entirety of the broadcast. 

The song is also used in the 2012 Japanese film &quot;Little Maestra&quot;. It is set in a small fishing village in Shikamachi, Ishikawa Prefecture, who depend on the local amateur orchestra as their favourite source of entertainment. When the conductor dies unexpectedly, the townspeople recruit the man&#x27;s granddaughter, a high school student with a talent for conducting. The song is heard three times throughout the movie.

In the British television comedy &quot;The Goodies&quot;, a recurring joke involves Tim Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s character playing a recording of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; every time he makes a patriotic, motivational speech.

In &quot;&quot;, Merlin activates the implanted chips&#x27; failsafe, killing the guards and conspirators as heads explode around the world, to the tune of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;.

It was used for the British postcard for the Eurovision Song Contest 1982 right before the British entry.

===Graduation ceremonies (United States, Canada and The Philippines)===

In the United States, Canada and the Philippines, the instrumental version of this song is traditionally associated with high school and college (university) graduation ceremonies. It is played as a processional or recessional often omitting all but the movement of the song over which the chorus is traditionally sung. During ceremonies for larger schools this piece (or the truncated version, if it is being used) is played repeatedly. It may be played for as long as the graduates are marching or walking, which can be longer than some symphonies.

<doc id="60899" wikidata="Q5598599" url="?curid=60899" title="Greasy spoon">
<text>A greasy spoon is a small, cheap restaurant typically specializing in short order fare.

A greasy spoon is often located alongside a main road to serve passing motorists, particularly a truck stop catering particularly to truck (lorry) drivers; this is known as a transport cafe in Britain . 

==Term==
The term &quot;greasy spoon&quot;—used to describe small and inexpensive diners and coffee shops—became popular in the United States as early as the 1920s.

Nicknaming cheap restaurants after an unwashed spoon dates back at least to 1848: 

The earliest appearance in print of the specific term &quot;greasy spoon&quot; was in 1906, in a story in Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine, referring to an eatery in Paris frequented for a time by Robert Louis Stevenson:
==Menu==
Many typical American and Canadian greasy spoon diners focus on griddled, grilled, or fried food, such as hamburgers, french fries, chili, eggs and omelettes, 
bacon, sausages, pancakes, waffles, 
fried chicken, Spam, and fish and chips.

Sandwiches are also popular, as are beef stew, baked beans, and hearty soups. Regional fare is often served. Since the 1970s, many Greek immigrants have entered the business. Coffee, iced tea, and soft drinks are the typical beverages, as alcohol is usually not offered due to the prohibitive cost of a liquor license. Pie, savouries and ice cream are popular snacks and desserts.

A typical American greasy spoon or diner may offer a full meal for a special price, sometimes called a blue-plate special. A British or Irish cafe will typically offer a &quot;full cooked breakfast&quot; all day.

==Popular culture==
Although there are now far fewer establishments due to the dominance of corporate fast food restaurant chains, a certain nostalgia exists surrounding a greasy spoon. Evocative characteristics include &quot;counter service”, jukeboxes, and hearty comfort cuisine. The greasy spoon as a setting is a common trope in movies and TV shows.

Restaurateur and television personality Guy Fieri, on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives&quot;, pays homage to such eateries across the United States.

Comic strips and humorous magazines have often lampooned the greasy spoon diner. &quot;The Better Half&quot; had Bert&#x27;s Beanery, and Dagwood Bumstead continues to eat at Lou&#x27;s Diner in &quot;Blondie&quot;. The kitchen and mess hall in &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; provide the military equivalent of a greasy spoon. Cooks featured in these tropes tend to be unkempt in some way – hirsute, unshaven, tattooed, wearing a stain-covered apron, or smoking a cigarette while working.

<text>The term carp (: carp) is a generic common name for numerous species of freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large clade of ray-finned fish mostly native to Eurasia. While carp are prized quarries and are valued (even commercially cultivated) as both food and ornamental fish in many parts of the Old World, they are considered trash fish and invasive pests in many parts of Africa, Australia and most of the United States.

==Biology==
The cypriniformes (family Cyprinidae) are traditionally grouped with the Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes to create the superorder Ostariophysi, since these groups share some common features. These features include being found predominantly in fresh water and possessing Weberian ossicles, an anatomical structure derived from the first five anterior-most vertebrae, and their corresponding ribs and neural crests.
The third anterior-most pair of ribs is in contact with the extension of the labyrinth and the posterior with the swim bladder. The function is poorly understood, but this structure is presumed to take part in the transmission of vibrations from the swim bladder to the labyrinth and in the perception of sound, which would explain why the Ostariophysi have such a great capacity for hearing.

Most cypriniformes have scales and teeth on the inferior pharyngeal bones which may be modified in relation to the diet. &quot;Tribolodon&quot; is the only cyprinid genus which tolerates salt water. Several species move into brackish water but return to fresh water to spawn. All of the other cypriniformes live in continental waters and have a wide geographical range. Some consider all cyprinid fishes carp, and the family Cyprinidae itself is often known as the carp family.

In colloquial use, carp usually refers only to several larger cyprinid species such as &quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; (common carp), &quot;Carassius carassius&quot; (crucian carp), &quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot; (grass carp), &quot;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&quot; (silver carp), and &quot;Hypophthalmichthys nobilis&quot; (bighead carp). Common carp are native to both Eastern Europe and Western Asia, so they are sometimes called a &quot;Eurasian&quot; carp.

Carp have long been an important food fish to humans. Several species such as the various goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;) breeds and the domesticated common carp variety known as koi (&quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot; var. &quot;koi&quot;) have been popular ornamental fishes. As a result, carp have been introduced to various locations, though with mixed results. Several species of carp are considered invasive species in the United States, and, worldwide, large sums of money are spent on carp control.

At least some species of carp are able to survive for months with practically no oxygen (for example under ice or in stagnant, scummy water) by metabolizing glycogen to form lactic acid which is then converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol diffuses into the surrounding water through the gills.

==Species==

==Recreational fishing==

In 1653 Izaak Walton wrote in &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, &quot;The Carp is the queen of rivers; a stately, a good, and a very subtle fish; that was not at first bred, nor hath been long in England, but is now naturalised.&quot;

Carp are variable in terms of angling value.
* In Europe, even when not fished for food, they are eagerly sought by anglers, being considered highly prized coarse fish that are difficult to hook. The UK has a thriving carp angling market, with the British record carp standing at 68lb 1oz. It is the fastest growing angling market in the UK, and has spawned a number of specialised carp angling publications such as &quot;Carpology&quot;, &quot;Advanced carp fishing&quot;, &quot;Carpworld&quot; and &quot;Total Carp&quot;, and informative carp angling web sites, such as &quot;Carpfishing UK&quot; and &quot;Carp Squad&quot;.
* In the United States, carp are also classified as a rough fish, as well as a damaging naturalized exotic species, but with sporting qualities. Carp have long suffered from a poor reputation in the United States as undesirable for angling or for the table, especially since they are typically an invasive species out-competing more desirable local game fish. Nonetheless, many states&#x27; departments of natural resources are beginning to view the carp as an angling fish instead of a maligned pest. Groups such as Wild Carp Companies, American Carp Society, and the Carp Anglers Group promote the sport and work with fisheries departments to organize events to introduce and expose others to the unique opportunity the carp offers freshwater anglers.&lt;br&gt; The common carp is one of the most abundant species of carp found in most rivers, creeks, lakes, and ponds throughout the Midwest region of the United States. Common carp are a particularly strong fish that fight hard on the end of anglers&#x27; lines, making them an appealing target for recreational fisherman. Since its introduction to the waters of the United States in the 1880s these fish have been viewed as a game fish, despite the fact that they are a destructive, and invasive species.

==Aquaculture==

Various species of carp have been domesticated and reared as food fish across Europe and Asia for thousands of years. These various species appear to have been domesticated independently, as the various domesticated carp species are native to different parts of Eurasia. Aquaculture has been pursued in China for at least 2,400 years. A tract by Fan Li in the fifth century BC details many of the ways carp were raised in ponds. The common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) is originally from Central Europe. Several carp species (collectively known as Asian carp) were domesticated in East Asia. Carp that are originally from South Asia, for example catla (&quot;Gibelion catla&quot;), rohu (&quot;Labeo rohita&quot;) and mrigal (&quot;Cirrhinus cirrhosus&quot;), are known as Indian carp. Their hardiness and adaptability have allowed domesticated species to be propagated all around the world.

Although the carp was an important aquatic food item, as more fish species have become readily available for the table, the importance of carp culture in Western Europe has diminished. Demand has declined, partly due to the appearance of more desirable table fish such as trout and salmon through intensive farming, and environmental constraints. However, fish production in ponds is still a major form of aquaculture in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, where most of the production comes from low or intermediate-intensity ponds. In Asia, the farming of carp continues to surpass the total amount of farmed fish volume of intensively sea-farmed species, such as salmon and tuna.

==Breeding==
Selective breeding programs for the common carp include improvement in growth, shape, and resistance to disease. Experiments carried out in the USSR used crossings of broodstocks to increase genetic diversity, and then selected the species for traits such as growth rate, exterior traits and viability, and/or adaptation to environmental conditions such as variations in temperature. Selected carp for fast growth and tolerance to cold, the Ropsha carp. The results showed a 30 to 77.4% improvement of cold tolerance, but did not provide any data for growth rate. An increase in growth rate was observed in the second generation in Vietnam, Moav and Wohlfarth (1976) showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared to selecting for faster growth. Schaperclaus (1962) showed resistance to the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality (11.5%) compared to unselected (57%).

The major carp species used traditionally in Chinese aquaculture are the black, grass, silver and bighead carp. In the 1950s, the Pearl River Fishery Research Institute in China made a technological breakthrough in the induced breeding of these carps, which has resulted in a rapid expansion of freshwater aquaculture in China. In the late 1990s, scientists at the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences developed a new variant of the common carp called the Jian carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; var. &quot;Jian&quot;). This fish grows rapidly and has a high feed conversion rate. Over 50% of the total aquaculture production of carp in China has now converted to Jian carp.

==As ornamental fish==

Carp, along with many of their cyprinid relatives, are popular ornamental aquarium and pond fish.

Ornamental goldfish were originally domesticated from their wild form, a dark greyish-brown carp native to Asia, but may have been influenced by &quot;Carassius carassius&quot; and &quot;Carassius gibelio&quot;. They were first bred for color in China over a thousand years ago. Due to selective breeding, goldfish have been developed into many distinct breeds, and are found in various colors, color patterns, forms and sizes far different from those of the original carp. Goldfish were kept as ornamental fish in China for thousands of years before being introduced to Japan in 1603, and to Europe in 1611.

Nishikigoi, better known simply as koi, are a domesticated varieties of common carp and Amur carp (&quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;) that have been selectively bred for color. The common carp was introduced from China to Japan, where selective breeding in the 1820s in the Niigata region resulted in koi. In Japanese culture, koi are treated with affection, and seen as good luck. They are popular in other parts of the world as outdoor pond fish.
==As food==

* Bighead carp is enjoyed in many parts of the world, but it has not become a popular foodfish in North America. Acceptance there has been hindered in part by the name &quot;carp&quot;, and its association with the common carp which is not a generally favored foodfish in North America. The flesh of the bighead carp is white and firm, different from that of the common carp, which is darker and richer. Bighead carp flesh shares one similarity with common carp flesh – both have intramuscular bones within the filet. However, bighead carp captured from the wild in the United States tend to be much larger than common carp, so the intramuscular bones are also larger and thus less problematic.
* Common carp, breaded and fried, is part of traditional Christmas Eve dinner in Slovakia, Poland, eastern part of Croatia and in the Czech Republic. In pond based water agriculture it is treated as most prominent food fish. Some recipes are specifically for carp such as the &quot;sweet-and-sour carp&quot; () and &quot;thick miso soup with carp&quot; ().
* Crucian carp is considered the best-tasting pan fish in Poland. It is known as , and is served traditionally with sour cream (). In Russia, this particular species is called , meaning &quot;golden crucian&quot;, and is one of the fish used in a borscht recipe called () or ).
* Mud carp, due to the low cost of production, is mainly consumed by the poor, locally; it is mostly sold alive, but can be dried and salted. An important food fish in Guangdong Province, it is also cultured in this area and Taiwan. Mud carp is sometimes canned or processed as fish cakes, fish balls, or dumplings, as used in Cantonese and Shunde cuisines. It can be combined with or Chinese fermented black beans in a dish called fried dace with salted black beans. It can be served cooked with vegetables such as Chinese cabbage.
* Fisherman&#x27;s soup
* Kuai
* Taramosalata
* Masgouf, a popular Iraqi dish consisting of seasoned, grilled carp.
* Gefilte fish, an Ashkenazi Jewish dish made from a poached mixture of ground deboned fish, primarily carp, whitefish, and pike.

==Common carp in culture==
=== In Chinese literature ===

A long tradition of common carp exists in Chinese culture and literature. A popular lyric circulating as early as 2,000 years ago in the late Han period includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp (), in which, when the wife opened the fish to cook, she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines: &quot;Eat well to keep fit, missing you and forget me not&quot;.

===Jumping carp the Chinese folk tale===
At the Yellow River at Henan () is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate. It is said that if certain carp called &quot;yulong&quot; can climb the cataract, they will transform into dragons. Every year in the third month of spring, they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls. It used to be said that only 71 could make the climb in any year. When the first succeeded, then the rains would begin to fall. This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god-emperor Yu, who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River. It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying, &quot;a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate.&quot;

Henan is not the only place where this happens. Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province.

The fish&#x27;s jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as &quot;&quot;Liyu&quot; (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate (),&quot; an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one&#x27;s social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the imperial examination. It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance. This symbolic image, as well as the image of the carp itself, has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings, especially those of popular styles. The fish is usually colored in gold or pink, shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone. 

=== In Japanese culture ===
The modern Japanese Koi fish are a brightly colored species of the Amur carp that have been bred by rice farmers in Japan since the early 19th century. This subspecies of carp plays a significant role in Japanese art, often being depicted as symbols of luck, strength, and tenacity. For this reason, Koi fish are also presented as gifts in Japanese culture as symbols of love, gratitude, and peace. Their bright colors and unique patterns present a high degree of eloquence to the Japanese people, thus creating a level of respect and appreciation for the Koi.

With Koi fish being at the forefront of a lot of Japanese art, it is common to find modern depictions of Koi in paintings, home art, murals, and even tattoos.

To many people, Koi fish strongly represent Samurai warriors, as they are able to be seen swimming upwards against a rivers current, symbolizing a Samurai&#x27;s bravery. One typical saying is the phrase &quot;koi no taki-nobori&quot;, translating to &quot;Carp climbing the waterfalls&quot;, a phrase that is used to describe a persons strength and perseverance.

<text>The Pomp and Circumstance Marches are a series of five marches for orchestra composed by Edward Elgar, together with a sixth march created from sketches. The marches were dedicated to his friends including composer Granville Bantock and organists George Robertson Sinclair, Ivor Atkins and Percy Hull.

==Origin of the name==
Elgar took the phrase &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; from Act 3, Scene 3 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, th&#x27;ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, &quot;pomp, and circumstance&quot; of glorious war!&lt;/poem&gt;

But also, on the score of the first march, Elgar set as a motto for the whole set of marches a verse from Lord de Tabley&#x27;s poem &quot;The March of Glory&quot;, which (as quoted by Elgar&#x27;s biographer Basil Maine) begins with:

&lt;poem&gt;Like a proud music that draws men on to die
Madly upon the spears in martial ecstasy,
A measure that sets heaven in all their veins
   And iron in their hands.
I hear the Nation march
Beneath her ensign as an eagle&#x27;s wing;
O&#x27;er shield and sheeted targe
The banners of my faith most gaily swing;
Moving to victory with solemn noise,
With worship and with conquest, and the voice of myriads.&lt;/poem&gt;

Shakespeare&#x27;s words proclaim the &quot;shows of things&quot; (Maine&#x27;s quotation marks): the naïve assumption that the splendid show of military pageantry—&quot;Pomp&quot;—has no connection with the drabness and terror—&quot;Circumstance&quot;—of actual warfare. The first four marches were all written before the events of World War I shattered that belief, and the styles in which wars were written about spurned the false romance of the battle-song.

==Marches==
The &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; marches are
*March No. 1 in D (1901)
*March No. 2 in A minor (1901)
*March No. 3 in C minor (1904)
*March No. 4 in G (1907)
*March No. 5 in C (1930)
*March No. 6 in G minor (written as sketches, elaborated by Anthony Payne in 2005–06)

The first five were all published by Boosey &amp; Co. as Elgar&#x27;s Opus 39, and each of the marches is dedicated to a particular musical friend of Elgar&#x27;s.

Each march takes about five minutes to play.

===March No. 1 in D===
====Dedication====
March No. 1, was composed in 1901 and dedicated &quot;to my friend Alfred E. Rodewald and the members of the Liverpool Orchestral Society&quot;.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: two piccolos (2nd &quot;ad lib.&quot;), two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns in F, two trumpets in F, two cornets in A, three trombones, tuba, three timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, triangle, side drum, jingles, glockenspiel (ad. lib.) and tambourine (ad lib.)), two harps, organ, and strings.

====History====
The best-known of the six marches, &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D&quot; had its premiere, along with March No. 2, in Liverpool on 19 October 1901, with Alfred Rodewald conducting the Liverpool Orchestral Society. Elgar and his wife attended, and it was a &quot;frantic&quot; success. Both marches were played two days later at a London Promenade Concert (which the Elgars unintentionally missed) in the Queen&#x27;s Hall London, conducted by Henry Wood, with March No. 1 played second. Wood remembered that the audience &quot;...rose and yelled... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.&quot;

The &quot;Trio&quot; contains the tune known as &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. In 1902 the tune was re-used, in modified form, for the &quot;Land of hope and glory&quot; section of his &quot;Coronation Ode&quot; for King Edward VII. The words were further modified to fit the original tune. The result has since become a fixture at the Last Night of the Proms, and an English sporting anthem and general patriotic song.

March No. 1 was the first piece in the recessional music for the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II, followed in both cases by March No. 4.


In Canada, the Philippines, and the United States, the &quot;Trio&quot; section &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; of March No. 1 is often known simply as &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; or as &quot;The Graduation March&quot; and is played as the at virtually all high school and most college graduation ceremonies. It was first played at such a ceremony on 28 June 1905, at Yale University, where the Professor of Music Samuel Sanford had invited his friend Elgar to attend commencement and receive an honorary doctorate of music. Elgar accepted, and Sanford made certain he was the star of the proceedings, engaging the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the College Choir, the Glee Club, the music faculty members, and New York musicians to perform two parts from Elgar&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Light of Life&quot; and, as the graduates and officials marched out, &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; March No. 1. Elgar repaid the compliment by dedicating his &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot; to Sanford later that year.

====Description====
March No. 1 opens with an introduction marked &quot;Allegro, con molto fuoco.&quot; The introduction leads to a new theme: strong pairs of beats alternating with short notes, and a bass which persistently clashes with the tune. The bass tuba and full brass is held back until the section is repeated by the full orchestra. A little rhythmic pattern is played by the strings, then repeated high and low in the orchestra before the section is concluded by a chromatic upward scale from the woodwind. The whole of this lively march section is repeated. The bridging section between this and the well-known &quot;Trio&quot; has rhythmic chords from the brass punctuating high held notes from the wind and strings, before a fanfare from trumpets and trombones leads into the theme with which the march started. There are a few single notes that quieten, ending with a single quiet tap from side drum and cymbal accompanied by all the bassoons. The famous, lyrical &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; &quot;trio&quot; follows (in the subdominant key of G), played softly (by the first violins, four horns and two clarinets) and repeated by the full orchestra including two harps. What follows is a repetition of what has been heard before, including a fuller statement of the &quot;Trio&quot; (this time in the &#x27;home&#x27; key of D) in which the orchestra is joined by organ as well as the two harps. The march ends, not with the big tune, but with a short section containing a brief reminder of the brisk opening march.

===March No. 2 in A minor===
====Dedication====
March No. 2 was composed in 1901 and dedicated &quot;To my friend Granville Bantock&quot;.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in F, 2 cornets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (2 side drums, triangle, glockenspiel &amp; jingles, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.

====History====
It was first performed, as was March No. 1, by the Liverpool Orchestral Society conducted by Alfred Rodewald, in Liverpool on 19 October 1901. Both marches were played two days later at a London Promenade Concert.

====Description====
The second is the shortest and most simply constructed of the marches. The composer Charles Villiers Stanford is said to have preferred this march to the first, and thought this the finest of all the marches. After a loud call to attention from the brass, a simple &quot;staccato&quot; theme, tense and repetitive, is played quietly by the strings, being gradually joined by other instruments before building up to an abrupt climax. This section is repeated. The second theme, confidently played by horns and clarinets, with contrasting triple and duple rhythms, is one which was sketched by Elgar a few years before: this is developed and ends with flourishes from the strings and brass joined by the glockenspiel. The opening &quot;staccato&quot; theme returns, concluded by a quiet swirling bass passage, which leads into the &quot;Trio&quot; section (in the tonic major key of A) which consists of a delightfully simple tune in thirds played by the woodwind (flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons), answered conclusively by the strings and brass. This &quot;Trio&quot; section is repeated, and the march concluded with a brilliant little coda, which includes a drum roll on the snare drum, a shattering chord in A Minor, briefly played by horns, and followed by a final cadence.

===March No. 3 in C minor===
====Dedication====
March No. 3 was completed in November 1904 and published in 1905. It was dedicated &quot;To my friend Ivor Atkins&quot;. It was first performed on 8 March 1905, in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, conducted by the composer.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in B, 2 cornets in B, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (tenor drum, side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.

====Description====
March No. 3 differs from the others in its opening mood, which is deliberately solemn. It begins with a dark subdued quick march led by low clarinets, three bassoons and the horns (with drum-beats inserted between the notes of the tune), before a vigorous theme (with brass alone at the first beats), erupts from the full orchestra. The dark theme re-appears, is then restarted boldly, then ended abruptly. The central section commences with a perky tune played by a solo clarinet with simple string accompaniment, which is followed by another of Elgar&#x27;s noble tunes played by the strings of the orchestra. All the themes re-appear and there is the final section which ends abruptly.

===March No. 4 in G===
March No. 4 is as upbeat and ceremonial as No. 1, containing another big tune in the central &quot;Trio&quot; section.

====Dedication====
March No. 4 was completed on 7 June 1907, and dedicated &quot;To my friend Dr. G. Robertson Sinclair, Hereford&quot;. It was first performed on 24 August 1907, in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, conducted by the composer.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: piccolo (with 3rd flute), 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), 2 harps, and strings.

====History====
The &quot;Trio&quot; was used by Elgar in a song called &quot;The King&#x27;s Way&quot; which he wrote, to his wife&#x27;s words, in celebration of the opening of an important new London street called Kingsway in 1909.

In World War II, No. 4 also acquired words: a patriotic poem by A. P. Herbert with the refrain beginning &quot;All men must be free&quot; was used as &quot;Song of Liberty&quot;.

In the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; No. 4 served as the recessional. As Diana&#x27;s veil was lifted and the couple bowed and curtsied to Queen Elizabeth II, the opening notes sounded and continued as they walked down the aisle of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral out to the portico and the waiting crowds.

March No. 4 was the first piece in the recessional music for the coronation of Charles III.
====Description====
The march has an opening section consisting mainly of two-bar rhythmic phrases which are repeated in various forms, and a lyrical &quot;Trio&quot; constructed like the famous &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; trio of March No. 1.

The first eight bars of the march is played by the full orchestra with the melody played by the violas and upper woodwind. Both harps play from the beginning, while the cellos, double basses and timpani contribute a simple bass figure. The bass clarinet, contrabassoon, trombones and tuba are held &quot;in reserve&quot; for the repeat, when the first violins join the violas with the tune. There are subdued fanfares from the brass interrupted by little flourishes from the strings before the opening march is repeated. There is pause, then a little section which starts forcefully but quietens, leading into the &quot;Trio&quot;. The &quot;Trio&quot; follows the pattern of March No. 1, with the melody (in the subdominant key of C) played by clarinet, horn and violins. The violins start the &quot;Trio&quot; tune on the lowest note they can play, an open G-string, which gives a recognisable &quot;twang&quot; to this one note, and they are directed to play the passage &quot;sul G&quot; on the same string, for the sake of the tone-colour, and the accompaniment is from the harps, low strings and bassoons. The grand tune is repeated, as we expect, by the full orchestra; the opening march section returns; the grand tune is repeated once more, in the &quot;home&quot; key of G major; and the last word is had by a re-statement of the opening rhythmic patterns. The march prepares the audience for its end as surely as a train pulling into a station, with the violins, violas, and cellos ending on their resonant open G.

===March No. 5 in C===
====Dedication====
March No. 5 was composed in 1930, much later than the others, and dedicated &quot;To my friend Dr. Percy C. Hull, Hereford&quot;. Its first public performance was on 20 September 1930 in a Queen&#x27;s Hall concert conducted by Sir Henry Wood, though it had been recorded two days earlier in the Kingsway Hall, London, conducted by Elgar himself in spite of his poor health.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.

====Description====
Without introduction, its opening episode is extended with enormous confidence and proceeds directly into the &quot;Trio&quot; section. The &quot;Trio&quot; starts quietly in a similar way to the introduction of his First Symphony: just a moving bass line and a tune, also in the same key (A). The tune is re-stated strongly, as we expect, then developed. The re-statement of the opening employs the same instruments of the orchestra, but is this time started as soft as possible for just four bars before a quick &quot;crescendo&quot; restores its spirit to as it was in the beginning. There is more development before a big return of the &quot;Trio&quot; theme, in the home key of C, and a triumphant ending which might bring to mind the conclusion of Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;.

===March No. 6 in G minor===
====History====
Elgar left sketches for a sixth &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; march, to be the final work in the set.

====Version orchestrated by Percy M. Young====
In 1956, Boosey &amp; Co. published a &quot;Military March No. 6&quot; in the key of B major, arranged and orchestrated by Percy M. Young. According to the introduction Young indicates that certain manuscripts were made available to him from the estate of the Grafton family (of Elgar&#x27;s niece May Grafton), including a short score dated March 1924 and separate violin and cello parts. Elgar indicated details of orchestration and expression. From these sources Young orchestrated 117 bars for full orchestra including harp (but not organ). However it appears to be substantially &quot;The Empire March&quot; composed for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, including the Trio section &quot;A Song of Union&quot;.

====Version completed by Anthony Payne====
In 2005, Elgar&#x27;s sketches were sent by the lawyer for the Elgar Will Trust in a bundle to the English composer Anthony Payne. Also included was an article titled &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot; by the Elgar authority Christopher Kent from the August 1997 &quot;Musical Times&quot; explaining the sketches. One idea in the sketches was marked by the composer &quot;jolly good&quot;. Kent believed that Elgar&#x27;s compositional thoughts and time were by then engaged with the Third Symphony and &quot;The Spanish Lady&quot;, and that the main theme for the march was &quot;unpromising&quot;. Payne felt there was not enough in the sketches to complete the march, but three pages of score in Elgar&#x27;s handwriting were discovered at the Royal School of Church Music Colles Library marked &quot;P&amp;C 6&quot;. In 2006, the score and sketches were turned into a performing version. Payne observed in the programme notes that &quot;Nowhere else in the Pomp and Circumstance marches does Elgar combine compound and duple metres in this way&quot;. Payne concluded the piece with a brief allusion to the first Pomp and Circumstance March. The world premiere of Payne&#x27;s version was on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms at Royal Albert Hall. The first recording was by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Richard Hickox.

====Instrumentation====
The instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (4), percussion (side drum, cymbals, bass drum, jingles, glockenspiel), and strings.

==Arrangements==
For piano solo: The first four marches were arranged by Adolf Schmid and March No. 5 by Victor Hely-Hutchinson.

For piano duo: Marches Nos. 1 &amp; 2 were arranged by Adolf Schmid.

For organ: March No. 1 was arranged by Edwin H. Lemare and March No. 4 was arranged by G. R. Sinclair. Marches 1–5 have been arranged in simplified and abbreviated form by William McVicker; concert transcriptions of Marches 2, 3, and 5, matching the Lemare and Sinclair arrangements, have been made by Michael Brough for use at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, but have not yet been published.

For military band: The first four marches were arranged by M. Retford and March No. 5 by Thomas Conway Brown.

For brass band: March No. 1 was arranged (transposed to B) by J. Ord Hume.

An arrangement featuring melodies from Marches 1 through 4 was used in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; to accompany a retelling of the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark featuring Donald and Daisy Duck. This version was performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and features a choral accompaniment from the Chicago Symphony Chorus with soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. James Levine, who conducts for this recording, introduces the segment, all the while Mickey, having just completed the previous segment from the original film, searches for Donald to remind him that the segment is starting up.

==Recordings==
* The first recording with Elgar conducting (Marches 1 and 4 only) was weeks before the outbreak of World War I, in July 1914. This acoustic recording was made for the Gramophone Company and appeared under the His Master&#x27;s Voice label on disc D179.

==Adapted versions==
* An adapted version of this piece was used as one of the ending themes in the anime version of the Japanese manga series &quot;Atashin&#x27;chi&quot;.

<text>Linux has several filesystem drivers for the File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem format. These are commonly known by the names used in the codice_1 command to invoke particular drivers in the kernel: &#x27;,&#x27;, and &quot;&quot;.

== History and support ==
Most of the major Linux distributions, including RedHat, SuSE, and Debian, do not employ &quot;&quot; to permit installation of Linux on a FAT disc volume. A few distributions do, however. These include distributions such as Phat Linux, which installs in codice_2 on DOS by unpacking a ZIP file and is booted by running a COMMAND.COM script named codice_3, and ZipSlack.

The UMSDOS project was started in 1992 by Jacques Gelinas and made available to the net in January 1994 as a patch. It was included in the standard distribution starting with kernel 1.1.36. UMSDOS was removed from the Linux 2.6.11 kernel for lack of maintenance. UVFAT, an extension of UMSDOS to use the Windows data structures for long filenames instead of its own, was discontinued before release. They should work in 2.4.x kernels.

Earlier Linux distributions which used UMSDOS are MuLinux, Monkey Linux and Winlinux 2000.

== Feature comparison ==

All of the Linux filesystem drivers support all three FAT types, namely FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. Where they differ is in the provision of support for long filenames, beyond the 8.3 filename structure of the original FAT filesystem format, and in the provision of Unix file semantics that do not exist as standard in the FAT filesystem format such as file permissions. The filesystem drivers are mutually exclusive. Only one can be used to mount any given disk volume at any given time. Thus the choice among them is determined by what long filenames and Unix semantics they support and what use one wants to make of the disk volume.
The &#x27; filesystem driver provides no extra Unix file semantics and no long filename support. If a FAT disk filesystem is mounted using this driver, only 8.3 filenames will be visible, no long filenames will be accessible, nor will any long filename data structures of any kind on the disk volume be maintained. The &#x27; filesystem driver provides long filename support using the same disk data structures that Microsoft Windows uses for VFAT long filename support on FAT format volumes, but it does not support any extra Unix file semantics. The &quot;&quot; filesystem driver provides long filename support, and extra Unix file semantics. However, it does so using on-disk data structures that are not recognized by any filesystem drivers for any operating systems other than Linux.
The key advantage to &quot;&quot; out of the three is that it provides full Unix file semantics. Therefore, it can be used in situations where it is desirable to install Linux on and run it from a FAT disk volume, which require such semantics to be available. However, Linux installed on and running from such a disk volume is slower than Linux installed on and running from a disk volume formatted with, for example, the ext2 filesystem format. Further, unless a utility program is regularly run every time that one switches from running Windows to running Linux, certain changes made to files and directories on the disk by Windows will cause error messages about inaccessible files in Linux.
&#x27;, although lacking full Unix file semantics and lacking the ability to have Linux installed on and running from a FAT disk volume, does not have the aforementioned disadvantages of &#x27; when it comes to simply sharing data on a FAT disk volume between Linux and other operating systems such as Windows. Its data structures are the same as those used by Windows for VFAT long filenames, and it does not require running a synchronization utility in order to prevent Windows and Linux data structures from becoming disjointed. For this reason, it is the most appropriate of Linux&#x27;s FAT filesystem drivers to use in the majority of situations.

== Commonalities ==
As mentioned previously, all of the Linux filesystem drivers support all of the three File Allocation Table sizes, 12-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. Other common features that they all support are various Linux mounting options (specified with the codice_4 option to the codice_1 command):
;codice_6 and codice_7:These two options tell the filesystem driver to set the (default, in the case of &#x27;) owner user ID and group ID to be a single, specified, value for all files in the volume. Both IDs are specified as numeric values (as to be found in the codice_8 file). So, for example, to specify to the &#x27; filesystem driver that all files and directories are to have owner ID 745 and group ID 15, the codice_9 command would be invoked as Linux filesystem drivers do not at present incorporate support for file/directory passwords on FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 volumes and multi-user world/group/owner access permissions for read/write/delete/execute rights on FAT12/FAT16 volumes as implemented in various operating systems of the Digital Research family, including DR-DOS, PalmDOS, Novell DOS, OpenDOS, FlexOS, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32.
;codice_10:This option sets the umask to apply globally to all files in the volume. For example, to specify to the &quot;&quot; filesystem driver that no &quot;group&quot; or &quot;other&quot; access is to be allowed, the codice_9 command would be invoked as 
;codice_12:This option specifies &quot;file content conversion&quot; semantics. It is possible for the filesystem drivers to convert the newline conventions in files, between LF termination and CRLF termination, on the fly as files are read and written. By default this conversion is entirely disabled. The filesystem drivers can perform conversion for some files, attempting to auto-detect what files to convert based upon the extension portion of the filename, or globally for all files. These three conversion levels are specified as codice_13 (for &quot;binary&quot;), codice_14 (for &quot;auto-detect&quot;), and codice_15 (for &quot;text&quot;), respectively. The latter two options carry an inherent risk of corrupting non-text file data. No conversion at all is the default.

=== Data structure ===
The &quot;&quot; FAT filesystem driver stores all of the extra information relating to Unix file semantics in what, to another FAT filesystem driver, appears to be just a normal file in each directory and subdirectory, named codice_16.

In the absence of this file in any given directory, and thus by default, the &#x27; filesystem driver provides the same semantics as the &#x27; filesystem driver does for the directory: only 8.3 filenames and no extra Unix file semantics. To enable the &quot;&quot; driver&#x27;s extra abilities, it is necessary to create that file in the directory and synchronize its internal data with the normal FAT data for any existing entries already in the directory. This is done with a tool called codice_17.

This is the utility program that is run, across every directory on the disc volume, every time that one switches from running Windows to running Linux, in order for the &quot;&quot; filesystem driver to incorporate any changes made to files and directories by Windows into its private data structures in its codice_16 file. By default, the codice_17 tool creates codice_16 files in directories if they do not already exist, resulting in such a file in every directory in the disc volume. When switching between Windows and Linux this behaviour is not often considered desirable. Therefore, the normal mode of operation when invoking codice_17 after switching from Windows to Linux (which is usually done by running the tool at Linux boot time from a startup script) is to employ the codice_22 option to the command, which prevents the creation of any new codice_16 files in directories that do not already possess them.

=== Installing Linux on FAT ===
As mentioned, &quot;&quot; permits installing Linux on, and then bootstrapping and running it from, a FAT format disc volume. The advantage of this is that it permits the use of Linux on a computer where DOS is already installed, without requiring that the hard disc be repartitioned. Linux is not bootstrapped directly from a Volume Boot Record in such a scenario. Instead DOS is first bootstrapped, and loadlin or is used to then bootstrap Linux from DOS.

The convention for such an installation is for the Linux root directory to be a subdirectory of the root directory of the DOS boot volume, e.g. codice_24 . The various Linux top-level directories are thus, to DOS, directories such as codice_25 (for codice_26), codice_27 (for codice_28), codice_29 (for codice_30), and so forth. The &#x27; filesystem driver automatically prepends the codice_31 to all pathnames. The location of the Linux root directory is supplied to the &#x27; filesystem driver in the first place via an option to the codice_32 command. So, for example, codice_32 would be invoked with a command line such as codice_34 .

The installation of Linux into such a directory in the first place simply involves unpacking files from an archive into that directory and its subdirectories. Such an installation also generally requires the use of a swap file rather than a swap partition for Linux, however this is related to the desire not to repartition the hard disc and unrelated to the &quot;&quot; filesystem driver per se.

== Accessing FAT formatted volumes without kernel support ==

Although the filesystem drivers in the kernel make it possible to access files and directories on FAT formatted volumes in the normal manner, it is also possible to do so without kernel driver support, using the utility programs that form the mtools utility suite. Like the &quot;&quot; FAT filesystem driver, provides long filename support using the same disc data structures that Microsoft Windows uses.

Alternately, one of the FUSE filesystem drivers may be used—FatFuse, FuseFat or .

== POSIX overlay filesystem ==
A modern equivalent of UMSDOS is POSIX Overlay Filesystem (). It works in FUSE.

<doc id="60903" wikidata="Q4934" url="?curid=60903" title="Larry Page">
<text>Lawrence Edward Page (born March 26, 1973) is an American businessman, computer engineer and computer scientist best known for co-founding Google with Sergey Brin.

Page was chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 when he stepped down in favor of Eric Schmidt, and then again from April 2011 until July 2015 when he became CEO of its newly formed parent organization Alphabet Inc. He held that post until December 4, 2019, when he and Brin stepped down from all executive positions and day-to-day roles within the company. He remains an Alphabet board member, employee, and controlling shareholder.

Page has an estimated net worth of $175 billion as of December 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $162.2 billion according to Forbes, making him the sixth-richest person in the world. He has also invested in flying car startups Kitty Hawk and Opener.

Page is the co-creator and namesake of PageRank, a search ranking algorithm for Google for which he received the Marconi Prize in 2004 along with co-writer Brin.

== Early life ==
Lawrence Edward Page was born on March 26, 1973, in Lansing, Michigan. His mother is Jewish; his maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel, though Page&#x27;s household while growing up was secular. His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan. BBC reporter Will Smale described him as a &quot;pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence&quot;. Page&#x27;s paternal grandparents came from a Protestant background. Page&#x27;s father was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and his mother Gloria was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at the same institution. Larry&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eight years old, but he maintained a good relationship both with his mother Gloria and his father&#x27;s long-term partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal.

When Larry Page was six years old, in 1979, his father brought home an Exidy Sorcerer computer, which Larry soon mastered and began using for schoolwork.

During an interview, Page recalled his childhood home &quot;was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazines all over the place&quot;, an environment in which he immersed himself. Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: &quot;I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines&quot;. According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page&#x27;s home atmosphere and his attentive parents &quot;fostered creativity and invention&quot;. Page also played instruments and studied music composition while growing up. His parents sent him to music summer camp—Interlochen Arts Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, and Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. &quot;In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me&quot;. In an interview Page said that &quot;In music, you&#x27;re very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing&quot; and that &quot;If you think about it from a music point of view, if you&#x27;re a percussionist, you hit something, it&#x27;s got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second&quot;.

Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to &quot;play with the stuff lying around&quot;—first-generation personal computers—that had been left by his mother and father. He became the &quot;first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor&quot;. His older brother Carl Victor Page Jr. also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking &quot;everything in his house apart to see how it worked&quot;. He said that &quot;from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually.&quot;

== Education ==
Page attended Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from ages 2 to 7 (1975 to 1979). He attended East Lansing High School, graduating in 1991. In summer school, he attended Interlochen Center for the Arts at Interlochen, Michigan, playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summers.

Page received a Bachelor of Science with a major in computer engineering with honors from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University in 1998.

While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge and built the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu honor society, and was a member of the 1993 &quot;Maize &amp; Blue&quot; University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid-transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.

== PhD studies and research ==
After enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received. He also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research. Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page&#x27;s research project, nicknamed &quot;BackRub.&quot; Together, the pair authored a research paper titled &quot;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&quot;, which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.

John Battelle, co-founder of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that:

&quot;[the] entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it &quot;the Web would become a more valuable place.&quot;&quot;

Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:

&quot;At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea&#x27;s complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. &quot;I talked to lots of research groups&quot; around the school, Brin recalls, &quot;and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry.&quot;&quot;

=== Search engine development ===
To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub&#x27;s web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.

Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page&#x27;s dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford&#x27;s broadband campus network. After filling Page&#x27;s room with equipment, they then converted Brin&#x27;s dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford&#x27;s computing infrastructure to experience problems.

Page and Brin used the former&#x27;s basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.

By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:
BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: &quot;We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.&quot; Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: &quot;Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is real.&quot;

Page and Brin&#x27;s vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:
&quot;In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance [...] Google has done a similar job.&quot;

The comparison was also noted by the authors of &quot;The Google Story&quot;: &quot;Not since Gutenberg [...] has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.&quot; Also, not long after the two &quot;cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web&quot; such as digitizing books and expanding health information.

== Google ==
=== 1998–2000 ===
==== Founding ====
Mark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story:&quot;Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park. [Soon after], Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 cheque to &quot;Google, Inc.&quot; The only problem was, &quot;Google, Inc.&quot; did not yet exist—the company hadn&#x27;t yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.&quot;In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc. with the initial domain name of &quot;Googol&quot;, derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Using the garage in their friend Susan Wojcicki&#x27;s Menlo Park home for $1,700 a month, Page and Brin were able to successfully build the Google search engine. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google&#x27;s co-founder, was Google&#x27;s president. Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:&quot;The pair&#x27;s mission was &#x27;to organize the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google&#x27;s competitors at the time.&quot;

By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that &quot;there are more than 1 billion web pages online today&quot;, with Google &quot;providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.&quot;

==== Early management style ====
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google&#x27;s project managers in 2001. Page&#x27;s plan involved all of Google&#x27;s engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him—Page explained that he did not like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge. Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:
* Do not delegate: Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
* Do not get in the way if you&#x27;re not adding value. Let the people doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
* Do not be a bureaucrat.
* Ideas are more important than age. Just because someone is junior does not mean they do not deserve respect and cooperation.
* The worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying, &quot;No. Period.&quot; If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.

Even though Page&#x27;s new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction. Page also believed that the faster Google&#x27;s search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times. He also pushed for keeping Google&#x27;s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the page load faster.

=== 2001–2011 ===
==== Changes in management and expansion ====
Before Silicon Valley&#x27;s two most prominent investors, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a &quot;world-class management team.&quot; Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including Steve Jobs and Intel&#x27;s Andrew Grove. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the president of products role.

Under Schmidt&#x27;s leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.

Page led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt&#x27;s knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world&#x27;s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.

==== Assumption of CEO position at Google ====
Following a January 2011 announcement, Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman. By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees. Reporter Max Nisen described the decade prior to Page&#x27;s second appointment as Google&#x27;s CEO as Page&#x27;s &quot;lost decade&quot; saying that while he exerted significant influence at Google via product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.

Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, jokingly tweeting on Twitter: &quot;Adult-supervision no longer needed.&quot;

=== 2011–2013 ===
As Google&#x27;s new CEO, Page&#x27;s two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Then Page also formed what the media called the &quot;L-Team&quot;, a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked near his office for a portion of the working week. Additionally, he reorganized the company&#x27;s senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google&#x27;s most important product divisions, including YouTube, AdWords, and Google Search.

Following a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new &quot;zero tolerance for fighting&quot; policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually concluded that ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page&#x27;s collaborative rejuvenation process, Google&#x27;s products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.

==== Changes and consolidation process ====
At least 70 of Google&#x27;s products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified. Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page&#x27;s redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, &quot;Project Kennedy&quot;, based on Page&#x27;s use of the term &quot;moonshots&quot; to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 &quot;Wired&quot; interview. An initiative named &quot;Kanna&quot; previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google&#x27;s range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company&#x27;s history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when &quot;Kennedy&quot; started, explained in 2013 that &quot;Google passionately cares about design.&quot; Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a &quot;cohesive vision&quot; of Google might look like.

The eventual results of &quot;Kennedy&quot; which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon &quot;refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.&quot; The final products were aligned with Page&#x27;s aim for a consistent suite of products that can &quot;move fast&quot;, and &quot;Kennedy&quot; was called a &quot;design revolution&quot; by Duarte. Page&#x27;s &quot;UXA&quot; (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the &quot;Kennedy&quot; project, tasked with &quot;designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Google&#x27;s application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users.&quot; Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that &quot;Kennedy&quot; became an &quot;institution.&quot;

==== Acquisition strategy and new products ====
When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question &quot;Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?&quot;. This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.

With Facebook&#x27;s influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page&#x27;s second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google&#x27;s own social network, Google+, in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra, Google&#x27;s then senior vice president of social.

In August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility. The purchase was primarily motivated by Google&#x27;s need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc. Page wrote on Google&#x27;s official blog on August 15, 2011, that &quot;companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to &#x27;protect competition and innovation in the open source software community&#x27; [...] Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google&#x27;s patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies&quot;. In 2014, Page sold Motorola Mobility for $2.9 billion to Personal Computer maker, Lenovo which represented a loss in value of $9.5 billion over two years.

Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, ChromeOS.

=== 2013–2015 ===
In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with &quot;Wired&quot;, in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page&#x27;s &quot;10X&quot; mentality—Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb. Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to Levy that 10X is &quot;just core to who he [Page] is&quot;, while Page&#x27;s &quot;focus is on where the next 10X will come from.&quot; In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of &quot;crazy&quot; ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: &quot;If you&#x27;re not doing some things that are crazy, then you&#x27;re doing the wrong things.&quot; Page also stated he was &quot;very happy&quot; with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced:&quot;I do think the Internet&#x27;s under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they&#x27;re a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people&#x27;s freedoms. But they&#x27;ve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users&#x27; freedoms at their peril.&quot;At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said &quot;We&#x27;re at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we&#x27;re still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity [...] Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That&#x27;s boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don&#x27;t exist&quot; and that he was &quot;sad the Web isn&#x27;t advancing as fast as it should be&quot;, citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause. In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to Microsoft&#x27;s practice as &quot;milking off&quot;. During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt&#x27;s hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.

In September 2013, Page launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&amp;D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple&#x27;s board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the new division&#x27;s CEO. Page&#x27;s official statement read: &quot;Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives.&quot;

Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page&#x27;s chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google&#x27;s CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.
Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a &quot;bad rap&quot;, which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing &quot;50 or 20 years ago&quot;. He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceX:&quot;He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That&#x27;s a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who&#x27;ve become pretty wealthy. You&#x27;re working because you want to change the world and make it better [...] I&#x27;d like for us to help out more than we are.&quot;Page also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercialization:&quot;Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things []... invention and innovation focus, plus [...] a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.&quot;Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google&#x27;s core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including Google X initiatives; access and energy, including Google Fiber; smart-home automation through Nest Labs; and biotechnology innovations under Calico. Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial &quot;chief product officer&quot;. Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google&#x27;s core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page.

In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his &quot;deep knowledge&quot; of Google&#x27;s products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. About his then role as the company&#x27;s CEO, Page said: &quot;I think my job as CEO—I feel like it&#x27;s always to be pushing people ahead.&quot;

On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google&#x27;s official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc. In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:&quot;Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. [...] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren&#x27;t very related.&quot;As well as explaining the origin of the company&#x27;s name:&quot;We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity&#x27;s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!&quot;Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google &quot;cleaner and more accountable.&quot; He also wrote that there was a desire to improve &quot;the transparency and oversight of what we&#x27;re doing&quot; and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.

Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; termed the reorganization into Alphabet a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a &quot;futurist&quot;, highly detached from day-to-day business dealings, and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are &quot;akin to a royal visit&quot;.

=== 2019 ===
On December 3, 2019, Larry Page announced that he would step down from the position of Alphabet CEO and be replaced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai also continued as Google CEO. Page and Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin announced the change in a joint blog post, &quot;With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it&#x27;s the natural time to simplify our management structure. We’ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there&#x27;s a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President.&quot;

== Other interests ==
Page is an investor in Tesla Motors co-founded by friend and fellow billionaire Elon Musk. He has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of Google.org, Google&#x27;s philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars and other alternative energy investments. He also was a strategic backer in the Opener and Kitty Hawk startups, developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel. The company has ceased all activities. It was merged into the Wisk Aero joint venture with Boeing in September 2022.

Page is interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in ), provide for people&#x27;s needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.

Page helped to set up Singularity University, a transhumanist think-tank.

== Personal life ==

In the early 2000s, Page briefly dated Marissa Mayer, American business leader and former CEO of Yahoo!, who was a Google employee at that time.

On February 18, 2005, Page bought a Spanish Colonial Revival architecture house in Palo Alto, California, designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos&#x27;s family&#x27;s castle in Spain. The Pedro de Lemos House was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de Lemos. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2007, Page married Lucinda Southworth on Necker Island, the Caribbean island owned by Richard Branson. Southworth is a research scientist and the sister of American actress and model Carrie Southworth. Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011 respectively.
In 2009, Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were &quot;deconstructed&quot; and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to &quot;minimize the impact on the environment.&quot; Page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC (volatile organic compound) materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. The house&#x27;s exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. The house also observes other green home design features such as organic architecture building materials and low volatile organic compound paint.

In 2011, Page bought the $45-million superyacht &quot;Senses&quot;. Later on, Page announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999, and that the doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. The Google+ post also revealed that Page had made a large donation to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in Boston. An anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20 million. In October 2013, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Page&#x27;s paralysis were caused by an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.

In November 2014, Page&#x27;s family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15 million to aid the effort against the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Page wrote on his Google+ page that &quot;My wife and I just donated $15 million [...] Our hearts go out to everyone affected.&quot;

In August 2021 it was revealed that Page holds a New Zealand resident&#x27;s visa and had traveled to the country on a medivac flight from Fiji for his son&#x27;s treatment in New Zealand. The flight took place on January 12, 2021. Page had been living in Fiji with his family during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2023, the US Virgin Islands tried several times to serve Page a subpoena in the lawsuit over JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s links to Jeffrey Epstein.

Page has purchased multiple private islands across the Caribbean and South Pacific, including the Hans Lollik Island in 2014, Eustatia Island, Cayo Norte in 2018, and Tavarua in 2020.

<text>Sergey Mikhailovich Brin (; born August 21, 1973) is an American computer scientist and businessman who co-founded Google with Larry Page. He was the president of Google&#x27;s parent company, Alphabet Inc., until stepping down from the role on December 3, 2019. He and Page remain at Alphabet as co-founders, controlling shareholders and board members. As of December 2024, Brin is the 7th-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $164 billion, according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot;.

Brin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, following in his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science. After graduation, in September 1993, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and he discontinued his PhD studies to start Google in Susan Wojcicki&#x27;s garage in Menlo Park.

==Early life and education==
Sergey Mikhailovich Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow in the Soviet Union, to Russian Jewish parents, Mikhail and Eugenia Brin, both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU). His father is a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother is a researcher at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center.

The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey&#x27;s paternal grandmother. In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result, his father was &quot;promptly fired&quot;. For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.

The Brin family lived in Vienna and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the University of Maryland with help from Anatole Katok. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.

Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Maryland. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19. In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica.

Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation, receiving an M.S. in computer science in 1995. , he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.

==Search engine development==
During an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met Larry Page. The two men seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together they &quot;became intellectual soul-mates and close friends.&quot; Brin&#x27;s focus was on developing data mining systems while Page&#x27;s was on extending &quot;the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers&quot;. Together, they authored a paper titled &quot;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&quot;.

To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub&#x27;s web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to those existing at the time. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, they began utilizing Page&#x27;s dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford&#x27;s broadband campus network.

After filling Page&#x27;s room with equipment, they then converted Brin&#x27;s dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford&#x27;s computing infrastructure to experience problems.

Page and Brin used Page&#x27;s basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available on the Stanford Web site.

By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:
::Some Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996)
::Total indexable HTML urls: 75.2306 Million
::Total content downloaded: 207.022 gigabytes

::BackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.
:::- Larry Page 
BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: &quot;We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.&quot; Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: &quot;Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real.&quot;

Some compared Page and Brin&#x27;s vision to the impact of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:

The comparison was also noted by the authors of &quot;The Google Story&quot;: &quot;Not since Gutenberg... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.&quot; Also, not long after the two &quot;cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web,&quot; such as digitizing books and expanding health information.

==Other interests==

In June 2008, Brin invested $4.5 million in Space Adventures, a Virginia-based space tourism company.

Brin and Page jointly own a customized Boeing 767–200 and a Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, and pay $1.3 million a year to house them and two Gulfstream V jets owned by Google executives at Moffett Federal Airfield. The aircraft has scientific equipment installed by NASA to allow experimental data to be collected in flight.

Brin is a backer of LTA Research &amp; Exploration LLC, an airship maker company. In October 2023, LTA&#x27;s 124-meter long flagship, Pathfinder 1, became the largest airship since the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; to receive clearance for flight testing, permitted over the boundaries of Moffett Field and neighboring Palo Alto Airport’s airspaces, at a height of up to 460 meters.

==Personal life==
Brin was raised Jewish, but is not religious.

In May 2007, Brin married biotech analyst and entrepreneur Anne Wojcicki in the Bahamas. They had a son in late 2008 and a daughter in late 2011. In August 2013, it was announced that Brin and his wife were living separately after Brin had an extramarital affair with a Google Glass colleague. In June 2015, Brin and Wojcicki finalized their divorce.

On November 7, 2018, he married Nicole Shanahan, a legal tech founder. They have a daughter, born in late 2018. Brin and Shanahan separated on December 15, 2021, and Brin filed for divorce on January 4, 2022. In summer 2023, the divorce was finalized. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a reason for the breakup was a &quot;brief affair&quot; in 2021 between Shanahan and Elon Musk. 

Brin&#x27;s mother, Eugenia, has been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2008, he decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where his mother has received treatment. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Brin has donated over $1 billion to fund research on the disease.

Brin and Wojcicki, although separated, jointly ran The Brin Wojcicki Foundation until 2014. Since then, Brin has used the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and a donor-advised fund for his philanthropic giving. They donated extensively to The Michael J. Fox Foundation and in 2009 gave $1 million to support the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.

Brin is a donor to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, having donated $5,000 to Barack Obama&#x27;s reelection campaign and $30,800 to the DNC. Brin attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump, sitting alongside Donald Trump supporters and other tech moguls.

<doc id="60906" wikidata="Q49750" url="?curid=60906" title="Socialist Unity Party of Germany">
<text>The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (, ; SED, ) was the founding and ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from the country&#x27;s foundation in 1949 until its dissolution after the Peaceful Revolution in 1989. It was a Marxist–Leninist communist party, established in 1946 as a merger of the East German branches of the Communist Party of Germany and Social Democratic Party of Germany.

The GDR was effectively a one-party state. Other institutional popular front parties were permitted to exist in alliance with the SED; these parties included the Christian Democratic Union, the Liberal Democratic Party, the Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party, and the National Democratic Party. These parties were largely subservient to the SED, and had to accept the SED&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their existence. Long one of the most rigidly Stalinist parties in the Soviet bloc, the SED rejected the liberalisation policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, such as &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; in the 1980s, which would lead to the GDR&#x27;s isolation from the restructuring USSR and the party&#x27;s downfall in the autumn of 1989.

The SED was officially organized on the basis of democratic centralism. Theoretically, the highest body of the SED was the Party Congress, convened every fifth year. When the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body, but since the body normally met only once a year most duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. Members of the latter were the top leadership of both the party and the state, with the party&#x27;s general secretary effectively having the authority of a dictator. From 1960, many of them concurrently served on the State Council of East Germany, replacing the President of the German Democratic Republic.

Ideologically, the party, from its foundation, adhered to Marxism–Leninism, and pursued state socialism, under which all industries in East Germany were nationalized, and a command economy was implemented. The SED made the teaching of Marxism–Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools. Walter Ulbricht was the party&#x27;s dominant figure and effective leader of East Germany from 1950 to 1971. In 1953, an uprising against the Party was met with violent suppression by the Ministry of State Security and the Soviet Army. In 1971, Ulbricht was succeeded by Erich Honecker who presided over a stable period in the development of the GDR until he was forced to step down during the 1989 revolution. The party&#x27;s last leader, Egon Krenz, was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the SED&#x27;s hold on political governance of the GDR and was imprisoned after German reunification.

The SED&#x27;s long-suppressed reform wing took over the party in the autumn of 1989. In hopes of changing its image, it reorganized as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), abandoning Marxism–Leninism and declaring itself a democratic socialist party. It received 16.4% of the vote in the 1990 parliamentary elections. In 2007, the PDS merged with Labour and Social Justice (WASG) into The Left (&quot;Die Linke&quot;), the sixth largest party in the German Parliament following the 2021 federal election.

==Early history==

The SED was founded on 21 April 1946 by a merger of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) which was based in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin. Official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties. However, there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed. By all accounts, the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD&#x27;s eastern branch to merge with the KPD. The newly merged party, with the help of the Soviet authorities, swept to victory in the 1946 elections for local and regional assemblies held in the Soviet zone. However, these elections were held under less-than-secret conditions, thus setting the tone for the next four decades. Conversely, in the Berlin City Council elections held that same year, the merger fared more poorly. In that contest, the SED received less than half the votes of the SPD. The bulk of the Berlin SPD remained aloof from the merger, even though Berlin was deep inside the Soviet zone.

The Soviet Military Administration in Germany (Russian initials: SVAG) directly governed the eastern areas of Germany following World War II, and their intelligence operations carefully monitored all political activities. An early intelligence report from SVAG Propaganda Administration director Lieutenant Colonel Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov indicates that the former KPD and SPD members created different factions within the SED and remained mutually quite antagonistic for some time after the formation of the new party. The report also noted considerable difficulty in convincing the masses that the SED was an authentic German political party and not merely a tool of the Soviet occupation force.

According to Tiulpanov, many former members of the KPD expressed the sentiment that they had &quot;forfeited [their] revolutionary positions, that [the KPD] alone would have succeeded much better had there been no SED, and that the Social Democrats are not to be trusted&quot; (Tiulpanov, 1946). Tiulpanov also indicated that there was a marked &quot;political passivity&quot; among former SPD members, who felt they were being treated unfairly and as second-class party members by the new SED administration. As a result, the early SED party apparatus frequently became effectively immobilised as former KPD members began discussing any proposal, however small, at great length with former SPD members, so as to achieve consensus and avoid offending them. Soviet intelligence claimed to have a list of names of an SPD group within the SED that was covertly forging links with the SPD in the West and even with the Western Allied occupation authorities.

A problem for the Soviets that they identified with the early SED was its potential to develop into a nationalist party. At large party meetings, members applauded speakers who talked of nationalism much more than when they spoke of solving social problems and gender equality. Some even proposed the idea of establishing an independent German socialist state free of both Soviet and Western influence, and of soon regaining the formerly German land that the Yalta Conference, and ultimately the Potsdam Conference, had allocated to Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia. The SED began to integrate former members of the Nazi Party at its founding. However, the strategy was controversial within the party. The SED therefore set up the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD) in 1948 as satellite party that could serve as a pool for former Nazis and Wehrmacht officers. Nonetheless, the SED continued to absorb former Nazi Party members. By 1954, 27 percent of all members of the SED and 32.2 percent of all public service employees were former members of the Nazi Party.

Soviet negotiators reported that SED politicians frequently went beyond the boundaries of the political statements which had been approved by the Soviet monitors, and there was some initial difficulty making regional SED officials realize that they should think carefully before opposing the political positions decided upon by the Central Committee in Berlin.

==A monopoly of power==
Although it was nominally a merger of equals, from the beginning the SED was dominated by Communists. By the late 1940s, the SED began to purge most recalcitrant Social Democrats from its ranks. By the time of East Germany&#x27;s formal establishment in 1949, the SED was a full-fledged Communist party—essentially the KPD under a new name. It began to develop along lines similar to other Communist parties in the Soviet bloc.

Although other parties nominally continued to exist, the Soviet occupation authorities forced them to join in the National Front of Democratic Germany, a nominal coalition of parties that was for all intents and purposes controlled by the SED. By ensuring that Communists predominated on the list of candidates put forward by the National Front, the SED effectively predetermined the composition of legislative bodies in the Soviet zone, and from 1949 in East Germany.

Over the years, the SED gained a reputation as one of the most hardline parties in the Soviet bloc. When Mikhail Gorbachev initiated reforms in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the SED held to an orthodox line.

==Organisation==
===Basic organisation===
The party organisation was based on, and co-located with, the institutions of the German Democratic Republic. Its influence stood behind and shaped every facet of public life. The party required every member to live by the mantra &quot;Where there is a comrade, the party is there too&quot; (&quot;Wo ein Genosse ist, da ist die Partei&quot;). This meant that the party organisation was at work in publicly owned industrial and quasi-commercial enterprises, machine and tractor stations, publicly owned farms and in the larger agricultural cooperatives, expressly mandated to monitor and regulate the operational management of each institution.

The smallest organisational unit in the party was the Party Group. Group members elected one of their number Party Group Organiser (PGO), to take responsibility for Party Work. There were also a Treasurer, an Agitator, and according to the size of the group other associated members included in the Party Group leadership. Where there were several Party Groups operating in a single place they would be combined in a Departmental Party Organisation (APO / &quot;Abteilungsparteiorganisation&quot;) which in turn would have its own leadership and an APO Party Secretariat.

===Party conference===
The was formally the party&#x27;s leading institution.

Increasingly, party conferences were planned with military-level precision. Their choreography was carefully undertaken to ensure that they were understood as high-profile society events. They were very much more than mere political functions. Delegates were selected from the regional and sectional party organisations according to criteria determined by the Party Central Committee. Care was taken over the proportions of women, of youth representatives, of members from approved Mass organisations and of &quot;exemplary&quot; workers.

===Party Secretaries===
Party secretaries existed at different levels within the party. They usually held their offices on an unsalaried basis, often combining their party secretarial duties with a salaried function. Where a basic administrative unit grew beyond certain size tension tended to arise between the party secretary and fellow committee members, and at this point a full-time salaried party secretary would be appointed. Party secretaries in very large industrial combines and other economically important institutions would combine their party secretarial roles with membership of a more powerful body, applying a structural element maintained right up to the level of the Party Central Committee. The task of the Party Secretaries was the organisation of political work. They prepared the party meetings and organised political training in partnership with the party leaderships. They ensured implementation of and compliance with party decisions and undertook general reporting and leadership duties. They were also required to provide a monthly report on &quot;Morale and Opinions&quot; (&quot;Stimmungen und Meinungen&quot;) concerning the people covered by their party secretarial duties.

Where work on occasion attracted criticism, there were many ways on which changes could be passed on. This fact lay behind the burgeoning bureaucratization of the party apparatus and the presence of Stalinist tendencies. Party secretaries underwent a special monthly political process that included instructive guidance and verification by representatives from higher level party committees. Along with their party responsibilities, party secretaries were members of the state administration, and they secured the leadership role that the SED claimed for itself in businesses and offices. Managerial decisions were discussed and ultimately decided in party committees. This meant that a manager, provided he was a party member, was committed to implementing those decisions.

===Sectional directorates===
The basic organisional unit in an organisation or department was placed under the control of the party&#x27;s sectional leadership team (&quot;SED-Kreisleitung&quot;). There were in total 262 of these sectional leadership teams, including one each for the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Trade Union Federation (FDGB), the Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Trade Ministry, the State Railway organisation, the military branches of the Interior Ministry, the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), the National People&#x27;s Army, each of which had its own integrated political-administrative structure.

===Regional directorates===
The party&#x27;s regional structure started with the country&#x27;s fifteen regions. Regional level government structure changed dramatically with the abolition of regional assemblies in 1952, but each administrative structure always had a party secretary, applying a structure also replicated in administrative structures at local levels.

The regional party leadership team (&quot;SED Bezirksleitung&quot;/ BL) was an elected body analogous to the Central Committee, membership of which was unpaid. It worked alongside the administrative body of paid officials who were occasionally also members of the party leadership team.

At a regional level the SED leadership team was headed by a Secretariat. The Secretariats always had a First Secretary (also responsible for Security Affairs) and a Second Secretary (also responsible for Cadre Affairs), and secretaries responsible for &quot;Agitation and propaganda&quot;, Economy, Science, Culture and Agriculture. There were also regional teams to shadow the regional teams of national institutions such as the FDJ, the FDGB and the Planning Commission. The First Secretaries of the regional FDJ and chairmen of the regional FDGB and Planning Commission were always Secretariat members too.

First Secretaries of regional party organisations held significant power in their respective regions, with some First Secretaries such as Hans-Joachim Böhme or Hans Albrecht being described as despotic, sometimes dictatorial. First Secretaries were always full members of the Central Committee and sometimes even candidate or full members (always the First Secretary in East Berlin) of the Politburo. First Secretaries of Bezirke that had a significant border with West Germany usually also served on the National Defence Council.

===Central Committee===

When the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the party&#x27;s leading element. Power was centred on the Committee Secretariat, which was chaired by a General Secretary, named First Secretary from 1953 to 1976. This function was combined with chairmanship of the Politburo. The General Secretary until 1971 was Walter Ulbricht: he was deposed by Erich Honecker, who in turn was deposed by Egon Krenz. Unlike in the Soviet Union, the SED only had &quot;Second Secretaries&quot; on the local and regional levels, but not in the Central Committee. That being said, some Politburo members and secretaries held an unofficial number two spot, most notably Karl Schirdewan and then Honecker during the tenure of Walter Ulbricht and Paul Verner, then Egon Krenz during the tenure of Honecker.

In the political hierarchy of the GDR, members of the Central Committee ranked above government ministers.

In July 1950, at the third Party Conference, the SED&#x27;s Central Committee was elected on the Soviet model, which at this time employed a single list electoral system: most members of the serving party executive were replaced. It was striking that more than 62% of the new Central Committee members had been members of the Communist Party (KPD) before the party merger of 1946. Four years on, there was little sign of the KPD/SPD parity that had been invoked when the SED was created.

By 1989, membership of the Central Committee had increased to 165: there were also 57 people listed as candidates for membership. All the high ranking party functionaries were represented in it along with other senior government officials (provided they were already party members). Beyond the professional functionaries and politicians the Committee also included the chiefs of the country&#x27;s leading institutions and industrial combines, the president of the country&#x27;s Writers&#x27; Association, top military officers and party veterans.

The Party Central Committee, reflecting the country&#x27;s overall power structure, was overwhelmingly male: the proportion of women never rose above 15%.

====Central Party Control Commission====

The Central Party Control Commission (ZPKK) was the supreme disciplinary body of the SED operating under and elected by the SED Central Committee. Its role was enforcing conformity and eliminating perceived opposition within the party ranks, closely working with the Stasi and Volkspolizei. It had corresponding bodies at all levels of the party in the form of Bezirk (BPKK) and district Party Control Commissions (KPKK). Notable ZPKK victims include Robert Havemann and Rudolf Herrnstadt.

There also existed a Central Auditing Commission (ZRK) to inspect the party finances analogous to the CPSU Central Auditing Commission, though due to its limited jurisdiction, its practical significance was minor compared to the ZPKK.

====Politburo of the Central Committee====
The most important day-to-day work of the Central Committee was undertaken by the Politburo, a small circle of senior party officers, comprising between 15 and 25 full members, along with approximately 10 candidate (non-voting) members. The politburo members included approximately ten Central Committee Secretaries. The General Secretary of the Central Committee also held the Chairmanship of the Politburo (along with all his other functions). The country&#x27;s government, formally headed by the Council of Ministers, served largely to implement the Politburo&#x27;s decisions. This meant that while the Council of Ministers was nominally the highest executive authority in the GDR, in reality it was under the permanent control of the Party Committees, a structure that ensured the &quot;leading role&quot; of the SED. This status was spelled out expressly after the constitutional changes introduced in 1968, which defined East Germany as a &quot;socialist state&quot; led by &quot;the working class and its Marxist–Leninist party.&quot; The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the president of the National legislature &quot;(&quot;Volkskammer&quot;)&quot; were also members of the Politburo.

The meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED usually took place every Tuesday in the conference room on the 2nd floor of the Central Committee building on Werderscher Markt, starting at 10 a.m. The meetings usually lasted only 2 hours and included up to 10 to 20 items on the agenda. According to former Politburo members Egon Krenz and Günter Schabowski, most Politburo members had little to say, much less dissent.

====Secretariat of the Central Committee====

The Central Committee Secretariat met each Wednesday to implement decisions finalised by the Politburo the previous day and to prepare the agenda for the Central Committee&#x27;s next weekly meeting. The Secretariat comprised the Central Committee Party Secretaries. The Secretariat played a decisive role in selecting the Nomenklatura of the Central Committee. Nomenklatura members were the holders of the top 300 or so positions in the party and the state: changes to the Nomenklatura membership list required the approval of the Central Committee Secretariat.
The Secretariat was the connecting element between the Politburo and the Central Committee Departments. These departments, whose heads were always full members of the Central Committee, formulated policy for the party and thus the country, with most departments mirroring ministries of the GDR (for example, there was a Ministry of Light Industry and a Ministry of District-led and foodstuffs industry). Department could de facto issue binding orders to the respective ministries, though de jure this was only possible for the secretaries. A notable exception was the Ministry of People&#x27;s Education, which was not under supervision of the People&#x27;s Education Department, but directly under the General Secretary, as Minister Margot Honecker was the General Secretary&#x27;s wife. Secretaries were usually assigned to multiple departments, for example, throughout the GDR&#x27;s existence, there was one Economy Secretary.

The party newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; was organised as a department, its Editor-in-chief having department head rank. Similarly, the Party Academy and the Institute for Marxism–Leninism were organised as departments, their directors having department head rank.

==Party Congresses==
===The 1st Congress===

The 1st Party Congress &quot;(Vereinigungsparteitag)&quot;, which convened on 21 April 1946, was the unification congress. This congress elected two co-chairmen to lead the party: Wilhelm Pieck, former leader of the eastern KPD, and Otto Grotewohl, former leader of the eastern SPD. The union was initially intended to apply to the whole of occupied Germany. The union was rejected consistently in the three western occupation zones, where both parties remained independent. The union of the two parties was thus effective only in the Soviet zone. The SED was modeled after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

===The 2nd Congress===
The 2nd Party Congress convened from 20 to 24 July 1947. It adopted a fresh party statute and transformed the party executive committee into a central committee &quot;(Zentralkomitee&quot; or &quot;ZK&quot;).

===The 3rd Congress===
The 3rd Party Congress convened in July 1950 and emphasized industrial progress. The industrial sector, employing 40% of the working population, was subjected to further nationalization, which resulted in the formation of &quot;people&#x27;s enterprises&quot; (German: &quot;Volkseigener Betrieb&quot;, VEB). These enterprises incorporated 75% of the industrial sector. At the same time, the party completed its transformation into a more orthodox Soviet-style party with the election of Walter Ulbricht as the party&#x27;s general secretary.

===The 4th Congress===

===The 5th Congress===

===The 6th Congress===
The 6th Party Congress convened from 15 to 21 January 1963. The congress approved a new party program and a new party membership statute. Walter Ulbricht was re-elected as the party&#x27;s First Secretary. A new economic policy was introduced, more strongly centralized – the &quot;New Economic System&quot;.

===The 7th Congress===
First Secretary Walter Ulbricht announced the &quot;ten requirements of the socialist moral and ethics&quot;. During his report at the 7th Party Congress in 1967, Erich Honecker had called for a return to an orthodox Socialist economic system, away from the recently instituted New Economic System. But the about-face in economic policy that year cannot be attributed to Honecker&#x27;s advancement alone. During the previous two winters, the GDR had been plagued with power shortages and traffic breakdowns.

===The 8th Congress===
From 1971 onwards, congresses were held every five years. The last was the 11th Party Congress in April 1986. In theory, the party congresses set policy and elected the leadership, provided a forum for discussing the leadership&#x27;s policies, and undertook activities that served to legitimize the party as a mass movement. They were formally empowered to pass both the party program and the statutes, to establish the general party line, to elect the members of the Central Committee and the members of the Central Auditing Commission, and to approve the Central Committee&#x27;s report. Between congresses the Central Committee could convene a party conference to resolve policy and personnel issues.

In the spring of 1971, the 8th Congress rolled back some of the programs associated with the Ulbricht era and emphasized short-term social and economic problems. The SED used the occasion to announce its willingness to cooperate with West Germany and the Soviet Union in helping to solve a variety of international problems, particularly the future political status of Berlin. Another major development initiated at the congress was a strengthening of the Council of Ministers at the expense of the Council of State; this shift subsequently played an important role in administering the &quot;Main Task&quot; program. The SED further proclaimed that greater emphasis would be devoted to the development of a &quot;socialist national culture&quot; in which the role of artists and writers would be increasingly important. Honecker was more specific about the SED&#x27;s position toward the intelligentsia at the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee, where he stated: &quot;As long as one proceeds from the firm position of socialism, there can in my opinion be no taboos in the field of art and literature. This applies to questions of content as well as of style, in short to those questions which constitute what one calls artistic mastery.&quot;

===The 9th Congress===
The 9th Party Congress in May 1976 can be viewed as a midpoint in the development of SED policy and programs. Most of the social and economic goals announced at the 7th Congress had been reached; however, the absence of a definitive statement on further efforts to improve the working and living conditions of the population proved to be a source of concern. The SED sought to redress these issues by announcing, along with the Council of Ministers and the leadership of the FDGB, a specific program to raise living standards. The 9th Congress initiated a hard line in the cultural sphere, which contrasted with the policy of openness and tolerance enunciated at the previous congress. Six months after the 9th Congress, for example, the GDR government withdrew permission for the singer Wolf Biermann to live in East Germany. The congress also highlighted the fact that East Germany had achieved international recognition in the intervening years. East Germany&#x27;s growing involvement in both the East European economic system and the global economy reflected its new international status. This international status and the country&#x27;s improved diplomatic and political standing were the major areas stressed by this congress. The 9th Party Congress also served as a forum for examining the future challenges facing the party in domestic and foreign policy. On the foreign policy front, the major events were various speeches delivered by representatives of West European Marxist–Leninist parties, particularly the Italian, Spanish, and French, all of which expressed in varying ways ideological differences with the Soviet Union. At the same time, although allowing different views to be heard, the SED rejected many of these criticisms in light of its effort to maintain the special relationship with the Soviet Union emphasized by Honecker. Another major point of emphasis at the congress was the issue of inter-German détente. On the East German side, the benefits were mixed. The GDR regime considered economic benefits as a major advantage, but the party viewed with misgivings the rapid increase in travel by West Germans to and through the GDR. Additional problems growing out of the expanding relationship with West Germany included conflict between Bonn and East Berlin on the rights and privileges of West German news correspondents in East Germany; the social unrest generated by the &quot;two-currency&quot; system, in which East German citizens who possessed West German D-marks were given the privilege of purchasing scarce luxury goods at special currency stores (Intershops); and the ongoing arguments over the issue of separate citizenship for the two German states, which the SED proclaimed but which the West German government refused to recognize as late as 1987.

During the 9th Congress, the SED also responded to some of the public excitement and unrest that had emerged in the aftermath of the signing of the Helsinki Accords, the human rights documents issued at the meetings in 1975 of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Before the congress was convened, the SED had conducted a &quot;People&#x27;s Discussion&quot; in order openly to air public concerns related to East Germany&#x27;s responsibility in honoring the final document of the Helsinki conference.

===The 10th Congress===
The 10th Congress, which took place in April 1981, celebrated the status quo; the meeting unanimously re-elected Honecker to the office of general secretary, and there were no electoral surprises, as all incumbents except the ailing 76-year-old Albert Norden were returned to the &quot;Politbüro&quot; and the Secretariat. The congress highlighted the importance of policies that had been introduced or stressed at the two previous congresses and that had dominated East German life during the 1970s. As in the past, Honecker stressed the importance of the ties to the Soviet Union. In his closing remarks, he stated: &quot;Our party, the SED, is linked forever with the party of Lenin, [the CPSU].&quot; A delegation led by chief party ideologue Mikhail Suslov, a member of the CPSU &quot;Politburo&quot;, represented the CPSU at the SED congress. Honecker reiterated earlier positions on the relationship between the two German states, stressing that they were two sovereign states that had developed along different lines since World War II, and that their differences had to be respected by both sides as they continued efforts toward peaceful coexistence despite membership in antagonistic alliances. In his speeches, Honecker, along with other SED officials, devoted greater attention to Third World countries than he had done in the past. Honecker mentioned the continually increasing numbers of young people from African, Asian, and Latin American countries who received their higher education in East Germany, and he referred to many thousands of people in those countries who had been trained as apprentices, skilled workers, and instructors by teams from East Germany.

The bulk of the Central Committee report delivered at the opening session of the congress by the general secretary discussed the economic and social progress made during the five years since the 9th Congress. Honecker detailed the increased agricultural and industrial production of the period and the resultant social progress as, in his words, the country continued &quot;on the path to socialism and communism.&quot; Honecker called for even greater productivity in the next five years, and he sought to spur individual initiative and productivity by recommending a labor policy that would reward the most meritorious and productive members of society.

===The 11th Congress===

The 11th Congress, held 17–21 April 1986, unequivocally endorsed the SED and Honecker, whom it confirmed for another term as party head. The SED celebrated its achievements as the &quot;most successful party on German soil&quot;, praised East Germany as a &quot;politically stable and economically efficient socialist state&quot;, and declared its intention to maintain its present policy course. East Germany&#x27;s successes, presented as a personal triumph for Honecker, marked a crowning point in his political career. Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s presence at the congress endorsed Honecker&#x27;s policy course, which was also strengthened by some reshuffling of the party leadership. Overall, the 11th Congress exhibited confidence in East Germany&#x27;s role as the strongest economy and the most stable country in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev praised the East German experience as proof that central planning could be effective and workable in the 1980s.

Official statements on the subject of foreign policy were mixed, particularly with respect to East Germany&#x27;s relations with West Germany and the rest of Western Europe. Honecker&#x27;s defense of his policy of &quot;constructive dialogue&quot; appeared in tune with Gorbachev&#x27;s own calls for disarmament and détente in Europe. However, the SED leadership made it unequivocally clear that its foreign policy, including relations with West Germany, would remain closely coordinated with Moscow&#x27;s. Although Honecker&#x27;s criticism of West Germany was low key, Gorbachev&#x27;s was sharp, attacking Bonn&#x27;s participation in the United States Strategic Defense Initiative and the alleged &quot;revanchism&quot; in West Germany. However, after a final round of talks with Gorbachev, Honecker signed a hard-line communiqué that openly attacked the policies of the West German government. Overall, Gorbachev&#x27;s statements suggested that the foreign policy emphasis would be on a common foreign policy adhered to by all members of the Warsaw Pact under Soviet direction. Until the 11th Party Congress, East German leaders had maintained that small and medium states had a significant role to play in international affairs. As a result of Soviet pressure, such statements disappeared from East German commentary on foreign policy.

==Final days: collapse of the SED==

On the day of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, 7 October 1989, the old Social Democratic Party was illegally refounded. The rest of October saw widespread protests across the country, including in East Berlin and Leipzig. At a special &quot;Politbüro&quot; meeting on 18 October, Honecker was voted out as general secretary and replaced by Egon Krenz, the party&#x27;s number-two leader. Krenz tried to portray himself as a reformer, but few believed him. He was almost as detested as Honecker himself, and most of the populace remembered that only four months earlier, he had gone to China to thank the regime there for the suppression in Tiananmen Square. Krenz made some attempts to adjust state policy. However, he could not (or would not) satisfy the growing demands of the people for increased freedom.

One of the regime&#x27;s efforts to stem the tide ended up being its death knell. On 9 November the SED &quot;Politbüro&quot; drafted new travel regulations allowing anyone who wanted to visit West Germany to do so by crossing East Germany&#x27;s borders with official permission. However, no one told the party&#x27;s unofficial spokesman, East Berlin party boss Günter Schabowski, that the regulations were to take effect the next afternoon. When a reporter asked him when the regulations were to be in place, Schabowski assumed they were already in effect and replied, &quot;As far as I know—effective immediately, without delay.&quot; This was widely interpreted as a decision to open the Berlin Wall. Thousands of East Berliners crowded at the Wall, demanding to be let through. Unprepared and unwilling to use force, the guards were quickly overwhelmed and let them through the gates to West Berlin.

The fall of the Wall destroyed the SED politically. On 1 December 1989, the GDR parliament &quot;(Volkskammer)&quot; rescinded the clause in the GDR Constitution which defined the country as a socialist state under the leadership of the SED, thus formally ending Communist rule in East Germany. On 3 December 1989, the entire Central Committee and &quot;Politbüro&quot;—including Krenz—resigned.

== Rebirth as the PDS ==

Some younger members of the SED had been receptive to Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms, but had more or less been silenced until the events of 1989. Soon after the SED abandoned power, Gregor Gysi, a reformist, was elected to the new post of party chairman. In his first speech, Gysi admitted that the SED was responsible for the country&#x27;s economic problems—thus repudiating everything the party had done since 1949. He also declared that the party needed to adopt a new form of socialism. As December wore on, most of the party&#x27;s hardliners—including Honecker, Krenz and others—were pushed out as the party made a desperate attempt to change its image. By the time of a special 16 December congress, the SED was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party. To distance itself from its repressive past, the party added &quot;Party of Democratic Socialism&quot; (PDS) to its name. On 4 February 1990, what remained of the party was renamed solely as the PDS. On 18 March 1990, the PDS was roundly defeated in the first—and as it turned out, only—free election in the GDR; the Alliance for Germany coalition, led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), won on a platform of speedy reunification with the West.

The SED had sequestered money overseas in secret accounts, including some which turned up in Liechtenstein in 2008. This was returned to the German government, as the PDS had rejected claims to overseas SED assets in 1990. The vast majority of domestic SED assets were transferred to the GDR government before unification. Legal issues over back taxes possibly owed by the PDS on former SED assets were eventually settled in 1995, when an agreement between the PDS and the Independent Commission on Property of Political Parties and Mass Organizations of the GDR was confirmed by the Berlin Administrative Court.

The PDS survived the reunification of Germany. It was represented in the Bundestag without interruption until 2007, and eventually began growing again. It has remained influential in former eastern Germany, especially at the state and local levels. It has been important in addressing East-German issues and addressing social problems. In 2007 the PDS merged with the western-based Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative (WASG) to create the new party The Left (&quot;Die Linke&quot;), which has resulted in a higher acceptance in western states, the party now also being represented in the parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Hesse and Hamburg.

==Attempts to influence West German politics==
The SED had two West German affiliates, which it controlled via the Central Committee&#x27;s Department for International Politics and Economics (mostly named &quot;West Department&quot; until May 1984): the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and, after its 1957 ban, the German Communist Party (DKP) as well as the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin (SEW). The SED funded its West German affiliates to the tune of millions every year through the Central Committee&#x27;s Trafficking Department, the SEW received about 15 million DM yearly, the DKP 70 million DM.

The SED initially had a branch in West Berlin, but after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, that branch became a separate party. The party changed its name to Socialist Initiative (&quot;Sozialistische Initiative&quot;) in April 1990, then dissolved in June 1991, part of its members subsequently joining the Party of Democratic Socialism.

==General Secretaries of the Central Committee of the SED==
== Electoral history ==
=== GDR Volkskammer elections ===
There were effective constitutional structures in place to ensure that the ruling SED was able to control the Volkskammer because of the extent to which it controlled other parties and mass organisations which also received predetermined fixed quotas of Volkskammer seats.

<text>Gene Rayburn (born Eugene Peter Jeljenic; December 22, 1917 – November 29, 1999) was an American radio and television personality. He is best known as the host of various editions of the American television game show &quot;Match Game&quot; for over two decades.

==Early life==
Rayburn was born in Christopher, Illinois, the younger of two children of Croatian immigrants Mary A. Hikec (August 14, 1897 – April 29, 1985) and Peter Pero Jeljenić (January 17, 1887 – December 26, 1918). In an episode of &quot;Match Game ‘74&quot;, Rayburn spoke Serbo-Croatian with a contestant, mentioning that his parents were born in what was then Yugoslavia. His father died when Rayburn was an infant. Mary moved her family to Chicago, where she met Milan Rubessa. After she married Rubessa on November 10, 1919, Rayburn took the name Eugene Rubessa (). He had an elder brother, Alfred, who was killed when Rayburn was a child and a younger half-brother, Milan Rubessa Jr.

Rayburn graduated from Lindblom Technical High School and attended Knox College. At Lindblom, he was senior class president and acted in the plays &quot;Robert of Sicily&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch&quot;.

An aspiring actor and opera singer, Rayburn moved to New York City but was unable to find stage work. He found a job as a page and tour guide at NBC studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza instead. After three years in that position, Rayburn began announcing at various radio stations, eventually landing back in New York at WNEW. He enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served in World War II. Gene chose the stage name &quot;Rayburn&quot; by randomly sticking his finger in the phone book.

==Career==
===Radio career===

Before appearing in television, Rayburn was an actor and radio performer. He had a morning drive time radio show in New York City, first with Jack Lescoulie (&quot;Anything Goes&quot;) and later with Dee Finch (&quot;Rayburn &amp; Finch&quot;) on WNEW. Rayburn&#x27;s pairings with Lescoulie and Finch helped to popularize the now-familiar morning drive radio format. At WNEW, he lobbied for playing of certain songs, resulting in chart popularity (e.g. &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; (recorded by Teresa Brewer)) and co-authored the lyrics of the song &quot;Hop-Scotch Polka&quot; with Carl Sigman (both 1949). When Rayburn left WNEW, Dee Finch continued the format with Gene Klavan.

=== Stage career ===
Rayburn took the lead role in the Broadway musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; when Dick Van Dyke left the production to star in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. At one point in his stage career, Rayburn&#x27;s stand-in was future &quot;Match Game&quot; panelist Charles Nelson Reilly.

===Television career===
Breaking into television as the original announcer on Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot;, Rayburn began a long association with game show producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman in 1953. He first appeared on Robert Q. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;; Rayburn frequently sat in for regular panelist Carl Reiner. In 1955, he took over as host of the summer replacement game show &quot;Make the Connection&quot; from original host Jim McKay (and appearing with his WNEW morning show successor Gene Klavan). From there he hosted shows such as &quot;Choose Up Sides&quot;, &quot;Dough Re Mi&quot;, &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot;, and the daytime version of &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;. On radio, Rayburn became one of the many hosts of the NBC program &quot;Monitor&quot; in 1961 and remained with the show until 1973.

In an uncredited role (he reportedly did not want his name to appear), Rayburn played a TV interviewer in the movie &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot; (1959) starring Doris Day. Rayburn was also a frequent panelist in the 1960s and 1970s on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

===&quot;Match Game&quot;===
From 1962 to 1969, Rayburn hosted &quot;The Match Game&quot;. In the original version, which aired from New York on NBC, Rayburn read questions to two panels, each consisting of a celebrity and two audience members. The questions in the original game were ordinary, like &quot;Name a kind of muffin,&quot; or &quot;John loves his ____________.&quot; Rayburn usually played it straight, though he would make jokes as the situation warranted. Very few episodes have been preserved; only four are known to exist. The show was canceled in 1969 to make room for the topical, short-lived game show &quot;Letters to Laugh-In&quot;.

Goodson-Todman revived &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1973 for CBS, this time as a California-based game show. Rayburn returned as host and introduced a new format in which two contestants tried to match the responses of six celebrities. Writer Dick DeBartolo, a veteran of the original show, created funnier and often risqué questions (&quot;After being hit by a steamroller, Norman had to slide his ____________ under the door.&quot;) Rayburn reveled in this freewheeling new approach and often indulged in funny voices, banter with the celebrities, and mock arguments with the technical crew. It soon became the highest-rated show on daytime television.

From 1973 to 1977, &quot;Match Game&quot; was number one among all daytime network game shows—three of those years it was the highest rated of all daytime shows. The daytime revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;, which featured regular panelists Richard Dawson, Brett Somers, and Charles Nelson Reilly, ran until 1979 on CBS and another three years in first-run syndication. A concurrent nighttime version, &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, aired in syndication from 1975 to 1981. Rayburn was nominated three times for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host.

During the years when &quot;Match Game&quot; was taped in Los Angeles (1973–1982), Rayburn lived in Osterville, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. He commuted to California every two weeks to tape 12 shows over the course of a weekend (five daytime shows and one nighttime show per taping day).

In 1983, a year after the syndicated &quot;Match Game&quot; ended, the show was revived as part of the &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;. Rayburn hosted the &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Super Match&quot; segments and sat on the panel for the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; segment, which was hosted by Jon Bauman. This show lasted nine months on NBC. Rayburn, by most accounts, was disappointed with how the show turned out.

===Other game shows and television appearances===

During and between his &quot;Match Game&quot; years, Rayburn served as guest panelist on two other Goodson-Todman shows: &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Also during the run of the 1970s &quot;Match Game&quot;, Rayburn and his wife Helen appeared on the game show &quot;Tattletales&quot;, hosted by Bert Convy. Rayburn also hosted some episodes of &quot;Tattletales&quot;. Three years after the original &quot;Match Game&quot; was canceled, Rayburn hosted the short-lived Heatter-Quigley Productions show &quot;The Amateur&#x27;s Guide to Love&quot;. In 1983, he hosted a pilot for Reg Grundy Productions titled &quot;Party Line&quot;, which later became &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot;.

In 1980, Rayburn was a guest star on the television show &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Rayburn appeared as a contestant during a tournament of game show hosts on the original version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; in 1980 and was a celebrity guest on &quot;Password Plus&quot; several times between 1980 and 1982. He appeared on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as a game show host—he and another host, played by Jan Murray, were game show rivals who vied to win the woman they both loved by creating the ultimate game show, with life-or-death consequences. He once hosted a local New York City show on WNEW-TV, &quot;Helluva Town&quot;, and between game show stints in 1982–1983, he returned to WNEW-TV as host of a weekly talk and lifestyles show titled &quot;Saturday Morning Live&quot;. He ended his brief tenure to return as co-host of &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;.

Rayburn&#x27;s last game show hosting duties were on 1985&#x27;s &quot;Break the Bank&quot; (he was replaced by Joe Farago after 13 weeks), and &quot;The Movie Masters&quot;, an AMC game show that ran from 1989 to 1990. Just before production was to begin on a new Rayburn-emceed &quot;Match Game&quot; revival in 1987, an &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; reporter publicly disclosed that Rayburn was 69 years old, much older than many believed. Rayburn had trouble finding jobs after that, blaming the reporter for revealing his age and subjecting him to age discrimination. His daughter Lynne blamed this and the subsequent lack of work he received for sending him into a downward spiral.

Rayburn portrayed himself on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in 1990, which featured Susan Lucci (as her character from &quot;All My Children&quot;, Erica Kane). He returned as one of Kane&#x27;s many previous husbands, to stop another marriage (officiated by his old &quot;Choose Up Sides&quot; co-star Don Pardo) with the host of a game show portrayed by Phil Hartman. He also continued to make appearances on talk shows throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, usually to discuss classic game shows, including appearances on &quot;Vicki!&quot; and &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot; and &quot;The Late Show with Ross Shafer&quot; (Shafer hosted the 1990 &quot;Match Game&quot; revival). In 1992, Rayburn also made an appearance on New York shock jock Howard Stern&#x27;s late-night TV variety show as one of the stars of his &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; parody, &quot;Homeless Howiewood Squares&quot;, in which homeless people were supposedly the contestants.

Rayburn co-hosted—with his wife and Peter Emmons—the Drum Corps International finals of the DCI Championship for two years, which were telecast on PBS from Philadelphia&#x27;s Franklin Field in 1976 and Denver&#x27;s original Mile High Stadium in 1977.

==Personal life and death==
Rayburn was married to Helen Ticknor from 1940 until her death in October 1996. They had one child, daughter Lynne.

One of Rayburn&#x27;s last TV appearances was a 1998 interview with &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of &quot;Match Game &#x27;73&quot;. Portions of the interview have been rebroadcast on Game Show Network, which in 2001 showed portions of another previously unaired interview during the first airing of its &quot;Match Game Blankathon&quot;.

Rayburn identified as a liberal politically and was a supporter of Planned Parenthood. Rayburn was also concerned that human overpopulation would become a problem in the 21st century and that it would become more difficult to supply resources such as food if the population grew too large. He expressed these concerns when he appeared on Game Show Hosts week on &quot;Card Sharks&quot; in 1980, where he played for Planned Parenthood as his favorite charity.

Rayburn enjoyed needlepoint and did it regularly on his many flights to and from California. He took it up when he knitted socks as a gag on &quot;Rayburn and Finch.&quot; Mark Goodson presented him with a needlepoint kit on the air as a gift when &quot;Match Game&quot; became the number one show on daytime television.

Though in poor health and suffering from dementia, Rayburn appeared in person to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. A month later, on November 29, 1999, he died of heart failure at his daughter&#x27;s home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, at age 81. He was cremated and his ashes spread in the garden of his daughter&#x27;s home.

Rayburn&#x27;s final TV appearance was in an interview for the &quot;A&amp;E Biography&quot; episode profiling the life of his longtime boss Mark Goodson; though taped in late 1999, the episode did not air until June 4, 2000, over six months after Rayburn had died.

<text>The common carp (Cyprinus carpio), also known as European carp, Eurasian carp or just referred as Carp is a widespread freshwater fish of eutrophic waters in lakes and large rivers in Europe and Asia. The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the species has also been domesticated and introduced (see aquaculture) into environments worldwide, and is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species. It gives its name to the carp family, Cyprinidae.

==Taxonomy==

The type subspecies is &quot;Cyprinus carpio carpio&quot;, native to much of Europe (notably the Danube and Volga rivers).

The subspecies &quot;Cyprinus carpio haematopterus&quot; (Amur carp), native to eastern Asia, was recognized in the past, but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name &quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;. The common carp and various Asian relatives in their pure forms can be separated by meristics and also differ in genetics, but they are able to interbreed. Common carp can also interbreed with the goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;); the result is called Kollar carp. Another artificial hybrid is Ghost Carp, which is bred between common carp and Japanese Purachina Koi. The large variation of colours produced makes ghost carp a popular commercial species.

==History==
The common carp is native to Europe and Asia and has been introduced to every part of the world except the poles. They are the third most frequently introduced fish species worldwide, and their history as a farmed fish dates back to Roman times. Carp are used as food in many areas but are also regarded as a pest in several regions due to their ability to out-compete native fish stocks. The original common carp was found in the inland delta of the Danube River about 2000 years ago and was torpedo-shaped and golden-yellow in colour. It had two pairs of barbels and a mesh-like scale pattern. Although this fish was initially kept as an exploited captive, it was later maintained in large, specially built ponds by the Romans in south-central Europe (verified by the discovery of common carp remains in excavated settlements in the Danube delta area). As aquaculture became a profitable branch of agriculture, efforts were made to farm the animals, and the culture systems soon included spawning and growing ponds. The common carp&#x27;s native range also extends to the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Aral Sea.

Both European and Asian subspecies have been domesticated. In Europe, domestication of carp as food fish was spread by monks between the 13th and 16th centuries. The wild forms of carp had already reached the delta of the Rhine in the 12th century, probably with some human help. Variants that have arisen with domestication include the mirror carp, with large, mirror-like scales (linear mirror – scaleless except for a row of large scales that run along the lateral line; originating in Germany), the leather carp (virtually unscaled except near dorsal fin), and the fully scaled carp. Koi carp (錦鯉 (&quot;nishikigoi&quot;) in Japanese, 鯉魚 (pinyin: &quot;lĭ yú&quot;) in Chinese) is a domesticated ornamental variety that originated in the Niigata region of Japan in the 1820s, but its parent species are likely the East Asian carp, possibly &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot;.

==Physiology and life history==

The carp has a robust build, with a dark gold sheen that is most prominent on its head. Its body is adorned with large conspicuous scales that are very shiny. It has large pectoral fins and a tapering dorsal fin running down the last two thirds of its body, getting progressively higher as it nears the carp&#x27;s head. Its caudal and anal fins may either be a dark bronze or washed with a rubbery orange hue. There are two or three spines on the anal fin, the first being serrated, and the dorsal fin has three or four anterior spines, the first of which is also serrated. The mouth of the carp is downward-turned, with two pairs of barbels, one pair at the corners of the upper lip, and the other on the lower. Wild common carp are typically slimmer than domesticated forms, with body length about four times body height, red flesh, and a forward-protruding mouth. Common carp can grow to very large sizes if given adequate space and nutrients. Their average growth rate by weight is about half the growth rate of domesticated carp. They do not reach the lengths and weights of domesticated carp, which (range, 3.2–4.8 times) can grow to a maximum length of , a maximum weight of over . The longest-lived common carp documented was of wild-origin (in non-native habitat of North America), and was 64 years of age. The largest recorded carp, caught by British angler, Colin Smith, in 2013 at Etang La Saussaie Fishery, France, weighed . The average size of the common carp is around and .

===Habitat===
Although tolerant of most conditions, common carp prefer large bodies of slow or standing water and soft, vegetative sediments. As schooling fish, they prefer to be in groups of five or more. They naturally live in temperate climates in fresh or slightly brackish water with a pH of 6.5–9.0 and salinity up to about 0.5%, and temperatures of . The ideal temperature is , with spawning beginning at ; they easily survive winter in a frozen-over pond, as long as some free water remains below the ice. Carp are able to tolerate water with very low oxygen levels, by gulping air at the surface.

===Diet===
Common carp are omnivorous. They can eat a herbivorous diet of aquatic plants, plant tubers, and seeds, but prefer to scavenge the bottom for insects, crustaceans (including zooplankton and crawfish), molluscs, benthic worms, fish eggs, and fish remains. Common carp feed throughout the day with the most intensive feeding at night and around sunrise.

===Feeding mechanisms===
Common carp are benthic feeders and root in sediment for food items. Their barbels may help to feel for food embedded in the sediment, like plant tubers or annelids. Carp pick up sediment by generating suction and mouth the content to identify and select food items by taste and size. Gill rakers form a branchial sieve that may aid in food separation, but the carp is also able to clamp down on food items it detects using a muscular palatal pad and inferior postlingual organ. The sediment is passed back and forth between the mouth and pharynx repeatedly as food is found. The carp may end up spitting out sediment, which contributes to water turbidity.

While common carp have no oral teeth, ten pharyngeal teeth are used for crushing or grinding food. The carp has no stomach, and the intestinal length can vary based partially on dietary composition in early life.

===Reproduction===
An egg-layer, a typical adult female can lay 300,000 eggs in a single spawn. Although carp typically spawn in the spring, in response to rising water temperatures and rainfall, carp can spawn multiple times in a season. In commercial operations, spawning is often stimulated using a process called hypophysation, where lyophilized pituitary extract is injected into the fish. The pituitary extract contains gonadotropic hormones which stimulate gonad maturation and sex steroid production, ultimately promoting reproduction.

===Predation===
A single carp can lay over a million eggs in a year. Eggs and fry often fall victim to bacteria, fungi, and the vast array of tiny predators in the pond environment. Carp which survive to the juvenile stage are preyed upon by other fish such as the northern pike and largemouth bass, and several birds (including cormorants, herons, goosanders, and ospreys) and mammals (including otter and mink).

===Salinity=== 
Common carp are quite salt tolerant compared to other types of freshwater fish, research studies showed that they can withstand salinity of at least 12g/L (12ppt).

==Mirror carp==

Mirror carp, regionally known as Israeli carp, are a type of domesticated fish commonly found in Europe but widely introduced or cultivated elsewhere. They are a variety of the common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) developed through selective breeding. The name &quot;mirror carp&quot; originates from their scales&#x27; resemblance to mirrors.

===Genetics===
The most striking difference between mirror and common carp is the presence of large mirror-like scales on the former. The mirror-scale phenotype is caused by a genetic mutation present at one of two scale trait loci, denoted by their S and N alleles, respectively. The genotype that produces a mirror scale phenotype is &quot;ssnn&quot; (all recessive), while wild-type carp may have either SSnn or Ssnn genotype. The &quot;S&quot; locus has been identified as containing the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor Fgfr1A1, which was duplicated during the course of carp evolution and consequently does not typically produce lethal phenotypes when only one locus is mutated. The &quot;N&quot; locus has not been identified, but is hypothesized to have bearing on the development of embryonic mesenchyme.

Contrary to popular belief, a leather carp is not always a mirror carp without scales. Similar to mirror carp, leather, or &quot;nude&quot; carp, are homozygous recessive at the &quot;S&quot; locus, but unlike mirror carp, true leather carp are heterozygous for a dominant mutant allele at the &quot;N&quot; locus (ssNn genotype). Leather carp also have reduced numbers of red blood cells and slower growth rates than scaled carp. Mirror carp from Hungarian and Asian stocks have been observed to have fewer pharyngeal teeth than scaled carp, while nude carp had fewer still.

A population of mirror carp in Madagascar (there an invasive species) was found to have reverted to full scale cover after being introduced from France in the early twentieth century. The feral Malagasy carp still possessed large scales due to their mirror phenotype, but had increased scale coverage approaching that of wild-type carp. Hubert et al. (2016) found that the recessive allele at the &quot;S&quot; locus was still fixed in the population. They believe that the phenotypic reversion was due to compensation by quantitative trait loci as a result of a selective disadvantage for partial scaling in the wild, perhaps related to an impairment in parasite resistance.

==Introduction into other habitats==

Common carp have been introduced to most continents and some 59 countries. In absence of natural predators or commercial fishing, they may extensively alter their environments due to their reproductive rate and their feeding habit of grubbing through bottom sediments for food. In feeding, they may destroy, uproot, disturb and eat submerged vegetation, causing serious damage to food sources and habitats of native duck (such as canvasbacks) and fish populations.

In 2020, scientists demonstrated that a small proportion of fertilized common carp eggs ingested by waterfowl survive passing through the digestive tract and hatch after being retrieved from the feces. Birds exhibit strong preference for fish eggs, while cyprinids produce hundreds of thousands of eggs at a single spawning event. These data indicate that despite the low proportion of eggs surviving the digestive tract of birds, endozoochory might provide a potentially overlooked dispersal mechanism of invasive cyprinid fish. If proven under natural circumstances, endozoochorous dispersal of invasive fish could be a strong conservation concern for freshwater biodiversity.

=== Australia ===
Carp were introduced to Australia over 150 years ago but were not seen as a recognised pest species until the &quot;Boolarra&quot; strain appeared in the 1960s. After spreading massively through the Murray–Darling basin, aided by massive flooding in 1974, they have established themselves in every Australian territory except for the Northern Territory. In Victoria, the common carp has been declared a noxious fish species, and the quantity a fisherman can take is unlimited. In South Australia, it is an offence for this species to be released back to the wild. An Australian company produces plant fertilizer from carp.

Efforts to eradicate a small colony from Lake Crescent in Tasmania, without using chemicals, have been successful, but the long-term, expensive and intensive undertaking is an example of both the possibility and difficulty of safely removing the species once it is established. One proposal, regarded as environmentally questionable, is to control common carp numbers by deliberately exposing them to the carp-specific koi herpes virus with its high mortality rate. In 2016, the Australian Government announced plans to release this virus into the Murray–Darling basin in an attempt to reduce the number of invasive common carp in the water system. However, in 2020, this plan was found to be unlikely to work. The CSIRO has also developed a technique for genetically modifying carp so that they only produce male offspring. This daughterless carp method shows promise for totally eradicating carp from Australia&#x27;s waterways.

=== North America ===
Common carp were brought to the United States in 1831. In the late 19th century, they were distributed widely throughout the country by the government as a food fish, but they are now rarely eaten in the United States, where they are generally considered pests. As in Australia, their introduction has been shown to have negative environmental consequences.

In Utah, the common carp&#x27;s population in Utah Lake is expected to be reduced by 75 percent by using nets to catch millions of them, and either giving them to people who will eat them or processing them into fertilizer. This, in turn, will give the declining population of the native June sucker a chance to recover. Another method of control is to trap them with seine nets in tributaries they use to spawn, and exposing them to the piscicide rotenone. This method has been shown to reduce their impact within 24 hours and greatly increase native vegetation and desirable fish species. It also allows native fish to prey more easily on young carp.

Common carp are thought to have been introduced into the Canadian province of British Columbia from the neighboring Washington state. They were first noted in the Okanagan Valley in 1912, as was their rapid growth in population. Carp are currently distributed in the lower Columbia (Arrow Lakes), lower Kootenay, Kettle (Christina Lake), and throughout the Okanagan system.

==Common carp aquaculture==

Common carp contributed around 4.67 million tons on a global scale during 2015–2016, roughly accounting for 7.4% of the total global inland fisheries production. In Europe, common carp contributed 1.8% (0.17 Mt) of the total inland fisheries production (9.42 Mt) during 2015–2016. It is a major farmed species in European freshwater aquaculture with production localized in central and eastern European countries. The Russian Federation (0.06 Mt) followed by Poland (0.02 Mt), Czech Republic (0.02 Mt), Hungary (0.01 Mt) and Ukraine (0.01 Mt) represents about 70% of carp production in Europe during 2016. In fact, the land‐locked central European countries rely heavily on common carp aquaculture in fishponds. The average productivity of carp culture systems in central European countries ranges between 0.3 and 1 ton ha−1. The European common carp production, in terms of volume, reached its peak (0.18 Mt) during 2009–2010 and has been declining since. Carp farming is often criticized as an anthropogenic driver of eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies - especially in the Central Eastern European Region (CEER). There has been some debate between environmentalists and carp farmers concerning eutrophication of water bodies, manifested into lobbying at ministry levels surrounding fishpond legislations. European carp aquaculture in fish ponds most likely has a lower nutrient burden to the environment than most food production sectors in the European Union.

==As food and sport==

===Breeding and Fishing===

The Romans farmed carp and this pond culture continued through the monasteries of Europe and to this day. In China, Korea, and Japan, carp farming took place as early as the Yayoi period (c. 300 BC – AD 300).

The annual tonnage of common carp produced in China alone, not to mention the other cyprinids, exceeds the weight of all other fish, such as trout and salmon, produced by aquaculture worldwide. Roughly three million tonnes are produced annually, accounting for 14% of all farmed freshwater fish in 2002. China is by far the largest commercial producer, accounting for about 70% of carp production. Carp is eaten in many parts of the world both when caught from the wild and raised in aquaculture.

Common carp are extremely popular with anglers in many parts of Europe, and their popularity as quarry is slowly increasing among anglers in the United States (though they are still generally considered pests and destroyed in most areas of the U.S.), and southern Canada. Carp are also popular with spear, bow, and fly fishermen.

===Food culture===
In Central Europe, it is a traditional part of a Christmas Eve dinner. Hungarian fisherman&#x27;s soup, a specially prepared fish soup of carp alone or mixed with other freshwater fish, is part of the traditional meal for Christmas Eve in Hungary along with stuffed cabbage and poppy seed roll and walnut roll. A traditional Czech Christmas Eve dinner is a thick soup of carp&#x27;s head and offal, fried carp meat (sometimes the meat is skinned and baked instead) with potato salad or boiled carp in black sauce. A Slovak Christmas Eve dinner is quite similar, with soup varying according to the region and fried carp as the main dish. Also in Austria, parts of Germany, and Poland, a fried carp is one of the traditional dishes on Christmas Eve.

Carp are mixed with other common fish to make gefilte fish, popular in Jewish cuisine. 

In Western Europe, the carp is cultivated more commonly as a sport fish, although there is a small market for it as a food fish. 

In the United States, carp is mostly ignored as a food fish. Almost all U.S. shoppers bypass carp, due to a preference for filleted fish as opposed to cooking whole. Carp have smaller intramuscular bones called y-bones, which makes them a whole fish species for cooking.

When Eurasian Carp was introduced to Lake Toba in Sumatra, it was adapted to be used for the traditional dish Arsik.

<doc id="60909" wikidata="Q6786214" url="?curid=60909" title="Match Game">
<text>Match Game is an American television panel game show that premiered on NBC in 1962 and has been revived several times over the course of the last six decades. The game features contestants trying to match answers given by celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank questions. Beginning with the CBS run of the 1970s, the questions are often formed as humorous double entendres.

&quot;The Match Game&quot; in its original version ran on NBC&#x27;s daytime lineup from 1962 until 1969. The show returned with a significantly changed format in 1973 on CBS (also in daytime) and became a major success, with an expanded panel, larger cash payouts, and emphasis on humor. The CBS series, referred to on-air as &quot;Match Game 73&quot; to startwith its title updated every new year, ran until 1979 on CBS, at which point it moved to first-run syndication (without the year attached to the title, as &quot;Match Game&quot;) and ran for three more seasons, ending in 1982. Concurrently with the weekday run, from 1975 to 1981, a once-a-week fringe time version, &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, was also offered in syndication for airing just before prime time hours.

&quot;Match Game&quot; returned to NBC in 1983 as part of a 60-minute hybrid series with &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, then saw a daytime run on ABC in 1990 and another for syndication in 1998; each of these series lasted one season. It returned to ABC in a weekly prime time edition on June 26, 2016, running as an off-season replacement series, all using the 1970s format as their basis, with varying modifications.

The series was a production of Mark Goodson/Bill Todman Productions, along with its successor companies, and has been franchised around the world, sometimes under the name &quot;Blankety Blanks&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the 1973–79 CBS version of &quot;Match Game&quot; as No. 4 on its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever. It was twice nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show, in 1976 and 1977.

Since 2010, &quot;Match Game&quot; has been parodied by drag artist RuPaul in the reality competition series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, as &quot;Snatch Game&quot;: a regular challenge in the series where the contestants each impersonate a different celebrity for comedic effect.

==1962–69, NBC==
&quot;The Match Game&quot; premiered on December 31, 1962. Gene Rayburn was the host, and Johnny Olson served as announcer, for the series premiere, Arlene Francis and Skitch Henderson were the two celebrity panelists. The show was taped in Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, NBC&#x27;s largest New York studio, which since 1975 has housed &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, among other shows. The show originally aired in black and white and moved to color on June 24, 1963.

Both teams were given a question and each player privately wrote down their response, raising their hand when done. Then each player was asked individually to reveal their response. A team scored 25 points if two teammates matched answers or 50 points if all three contestants matched. The first team to score 100 points won $100 and played the audience match, which featured three survey questions (some of which, especially after 1963, featured a numeric-answer format, e.g., &quot;we surveyed 50 women and asked them how much they should spend on a hat,&quot; a format similar to the one that was later used on &quot;Family Feud&quot; and &quot;Card Sharks&quot;). Each contestant who agreed with the most popular answer to a question earned the team $50, for a possible total of $450.

The questions used in the game were pedestrian in nature to begin: &quot;Name a kind of muffin,&quot; &quot;Write down one of the words to &#x27;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&#x27; other than &#x27;Row,&#x27; &#x27;Your,&#x27; or &#x27;Boat,&#x27;&quot; or &quot;John loves his _____.&quot; The humor in the original series came largely from the panelists&#x27; reactions to the other answers (especially on the occasional all-star episodes). In 1963, NBC canceled the series with six weeks left to be recorded. Question writer Dick DeBartolo came up with a funnier set of questions, like &quot;Mary likes to pour gravy all over John&#x27;s _____,&quot; and submitted it to Mark Goodson. With the knowledge that the show could not be canceled again, Goodson gave the go-ahead for the more risqué-sounding questions, a decision that caused a significant boost in ratings and an &quot;un-cancellation&quot; by NBC.

&quot;The Match Game&quot; consistently won its time slot from 1963 to 1966 and again from April 1967 to July 1968, with its ratings allowing it to finish third among all network daytime TV game shows for the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons (by the latter season, NBC was the dominant network in the game show genre, ABC was not as successful and CBS had mostly dropped out of the genre). NBC also occasionally used special episodes of the series as a gap-filling program in prime time if one of its movies had an irregular time slot. Although the series still did well in the ratings (despite the popularity of ABC&#x27;s horror-themed soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;), it was canceled in 1969 along with other game shows in a major daytime programming overhaul, being replaced by &quot;Letters to Laugh-In&quot; which, although a spin-off of the popular primetime series &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, ended in just three months, on December 26.

&quot;The Match Game&quot; continued through September 26, 1969, on NBC for 1,760 episodes, airing at 4:00 p.m. Eastern (3:00 p.m. Central), running 25 minutes due to a five-minute newscast slot. Since Olson split time between New York and Miami to announce &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, one of the network&#x27;s New York staff announcers (such as Don Pardo or Wayne Howell) filled in for Olson when he could not attend a broadcast.

On February 27, 1967, the show added a &quot;telephone match&quot; game, in which a home viewer and a studio audience member attempted to match a simple fill-in-the-blank question, similar to the 1970s&#x27; &quot;head-to-head match.&quot; A successful match won a jackpot, which started at $500 and increased by $100 per day until won.

Very few episodes of the 1960s &quot;The Match Game&quot; survive (see episode status below).

==&quot;Match Game 73–79&quot; (1973–79, CBS)==
In the early 1970s, CBS vice president Fred Silverman began overhauling the network&#x27;s programming as part of what has colloquially become known as the rural purge. As part of this overhaul, the network reintroduced game shows, beginning in 1972. One of the first new offerings was &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;, a radically overhauled version of the 1950s game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. The success of &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; prompted Silverman to commission more game shows. In the summer of 1973, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman took a similar approach in adapting &quot;The Match Game&quot; by reworking the show, moving it to Los Angeles, adding more celebrities, and increasing the amount of prize money that could be won. It was this show (along with the Bob Stewart game shows &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, &quot;Jackpot&quot;, and the Heatter-Quigley show &quot;Gambit&quot;) that reintroduced five-figure payouts for the first time since the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s.

The new version had Rayburn returning as the host and Olson returning as the announcer. The gameplay for this version had two solo contestants attempting to match the answers given by a six-celebrity panel. Richard Dawson was the first regular panelist. CBS News coverage of the Watergate hearings delayed the premiere one week from its slated date of June 25 to July 2.

The first week&#x27;s panelists were Dawson, Michael Landon, Vicki Lawrence, Jack Klugman, Jo Ann Pflug, and Anita Gillette. Rayburn reassured viewers of the first week of CBS shows that &quot;This is your old favorite, updated with more action, more money, and, as you can see, more celebrities.&quot; The first few weeks of the show were somewhat different from the rest of the run. At first, many of the questions fit into the more bland and innocuous mold of the earlier seasons of the original series. In addition, many of the frequent panelists on the early episodes were not regulars later in the series but had appeared on the 1960s version, including Klugman, Arlene Francis, and Bert Convy.

However, the double entendre in the question &quot;Johnny always put butter on his _____&quot; marked a turning point in the questions on the show. Soon, the tone of Rayburn&#x27;s questions changed notably, leaving behind the staid topics that &quot;The Match Game&quot; had first disposed of in 1963 for more risqué humor. Celebrity panelists Brett Somers (Klugman&#x27;s wife at the time) and Charles Nelson Reilly began as guest panelists on the program, with Somers brought in at the request of Klugman, who felt she would make a nice fit on the program. The chemistry between Somers and Reilly prompted Goodson–Todman and CBS to hire them as regular panelists, Somers remained on the show until 1982, while Reilly continued appearing through the 1983–84 and 1990–91 revivals, with a brief break in 1974–75 when Gary Burghoff, Nipsey Russell, and Rip Taylor substituted for him. Burghoff and Russell continued to appear as semi-regular panelists afterward.

Celebrity panelists appeared in week-long blocks, due to the show&#x27;s production schedule. A number of celebrities, including Betty White, Dick Martin, Marcia Wallace, Bill Daily, Fannie Flagg, Elaine Joyce, Sarah Kennedy, Patti Deutsch, Mary Wickes, Bill Anderson, and Joyce Bulifant, were semi-regular panelists, usually appearing several times a year. Celebrity panelists also included personalities from other Goodson–Todman-produced game shows, such as &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s Bob Barker, Anitra Ford, Janice Pennington, and Holly Hallstrom and &quot;Password&quot;″s Allen Ludden. The panelists were all seated in a strict order: The male guest panelist of the week, Somers, and Reilly usually sat in the top row from the viewer&#x27;s left to right (occasionally a recurring panelist sat in for Somers or Reilly), and the female guest panelist of the week, Dawson (after 1978, a semi-regular male panelist), and a semi-regular female panelist (most frequently White, Flagg, Deutsch, Bulifant, or Wallace) occupied the bottom row.

===Format===
Two contestants competed on each episode. On the CBS version, the champion was seated in the upstage (red circle) seat and the challenger (opponent) was seated in the downstage (green triangle) seat. On the syndicated versions, which had no returning champions, positions were determined by a backstage coin toss. The object was to match the answers of the six celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank statements.

The main game was played in two rounds (three on &quot;Match Game PM&quot; after the first season). The opponent was given a choice of two statements labeled either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. Rayburn read the statement, and the six celebrities wrote their answers on index cards. After they finished, the contestant verbally gave an answer. Rayburn then asked the celebrities, one at a time beginning in the upper left-hand corner of the panel, to respond with their answers.

While early questions were similar to those from the NBC version (e.g., &quot;Every morning, John puts [blank] on his cereal&quot;), the questions quickly became more humorous and risqué. Comedy writer Dick DeBartolo (who stayed in New York), who had participated in the 1960s &quot;Match Game&quot;, contributed broader and saucier questions. Frequently, the statements were written with bawdy, double entendre answers in mind. One example was, &quot;Did you catch a glimpse of that girl on the corner? She has the world&#x27;s biggest [blank].&quot;

Frequently, the audience responded appropriately as Rayburn critiqued the contestant&#x27;s answer. For the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest&quot; question, Rayburn might show disdain to an answer such as &quot;fingers&quot; or &quot;bag&quot; and compliment an answer such as &quot;rear end&quot; or &quot;boobs&quot;, often also commenting on the audience&#x27;s approving or disapproving response. The audience usually groaned or booed when a contestant or celebrity gave a bad or inappropriate answer, whereas they cheered and applauded in approval of a good answer. Sometimes, they howled at a risqué answer. At other times, their reaction was deliberately inappropriate, such as howling at a good answer or applauding a risqué answer, to perverse effect.

The contestant earned one point for each celebrity who wrote down the same answer (or a reasonably similar one as determined by the judges; for example, &quot;rear end&quot; matched &quot;bottom&quot; or a similar euphemism), up to six points for matching everyone on the celebrity panel. After one contestant played, the second contestant played the other question.

A handful of potential answers were prohibited, the most notable being any synonym for genitalia. In instances where a celebrity gave the censorable answer, the word &quot;Oops!&quot; was superimposed over the index card and the celebrity&#x27;s mouth, accompanied by a slide whistle masking the spoken response.

Popular questions featured a character named &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; or &quot;Dumb Donald.&quot; These questions often began, &quot;Dumb Dora/Donald is &quot;so&quot; dumb...&quot; To this, in a routine taken from &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,&quot; the audience responded en masse, &quot;How dumb &quot;is&quot; she/he?&quot; This expanded to the generalized question form &quot;[adjective]-[alliterative-name] is &quot;SO&quot; [adjective]...&quot; To this, the audience responded, &quot;How [adjective] &quot;is&quot; he/she?&quot; Rayburn finished the question or, occasionally, praised the audience or derided the audience&#x27;s lack of union and made them try the response again. Other common subjects of questions were Superman/Lois Lane, King Kong/Fay Wray, Tarzan/Jane, The Lone Ranger/Tonto, panelists on the show (most commonly Brett Somers), politicians, and Howard Cosell. Questions also often featured characters such as &quot;Ugly Edna&quot; (later &quot;Ugly Ulfrea&quot;), &quot;Unlucky Louie/Louise,&quot; &quot;Horrible Hannah/Hank,&quot; &quot;Rodney Rotten,&quot; and occasionally &quot;Voluptuous Velma.&quot;

Some questions dealt with the fictitious (and often sleazy) country of &quot;Nerdo Crombezia&quot; or the world&#x27;s greatest salesman, who could sell anything to anyone. Other questions, usually given in the second round (or third round in &quot;Match Game PM&quot;) to allow trailing contestants to catch up quickly, hinted at more obvious answers based on the context of the question. One such question was &quot;James Bond went to an all-night restaurant. When the waitress told him they were out of coffee, he ordered a [blank].&quot; Because James Bond&#x27;s signature drink is a martini, shaken, not stirred, the panelists and contestants were expected to choose that answer. In the most extreme cases, the questions were puns with only one answer that made sense. &quot;Did you hear about the religious group of dentists? They call themselves the Holy [blank]&quot; was written so that only &quot;Molars&quot; made sense.

Rayburn always played the action for laughs and frequently tried to read certain questions in character, such as &quot;Old Man Periwinkle&quot; or &quot;Old Mrs. Pervis.&quot; He also did the same with Confucius and Count Dracula. Regular panelist Charles Nelson Reilly, a Broadway director, often responded with comments such as &quot;I like it when you act&quot; and &quot;That character was really very good. Along with the other two that you do,&quot; to the amusement of the audience.

In the second round, the contestants attempted to match the celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars, in which case the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had answered only one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected his or her question in the previous round made the selection in the tiebreaker round.

On &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, the third round was added after the first season as games proved to be too short to fill the half-hour. Again, the only celebrities who played were those who did not match that contestant in previous rounds. On &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, the questions with the most obvious answers were typically used in the third round.

If the contestants had the same score at the end of the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker question each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. Tiebreaker rounds were repeated until a winner was determined. On &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, or on the syndicated daytime show if time was running short, a time-saving variant of the tiebreaker that reversed the gameplay was used. The contestants wrote their answers first on cards in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly, and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant&#x27;s answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tiebreaker went on until there was a clear winner. If it came to the sudden-death tiebreaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.

The CBS daytime version had returning champions, and the gameplay &quot;straddled&quot; between episodes, meaning episodes often began and ended with games in progress. In this version, champions stayed until they were defeated or had won $25,000, whichever occurred first. Originally, this amount was the network&#x27;s winnings limit. Anything above that amount was forfeited, but the rule was later changed so that although champions retired after winning $25,000, they kept any winnings up to $35,000. During the six-year run of &quot;Match Game&quot; on CBS, only one champion, Carolyn Raisner, retired undefeated with $32,600, the highest total ever won on &quot;Match Game&quot;.

On the daily 1979–82 syndicated version, two contestants competed against each other in two games, with two new contestants replacing them afterward. The show was timed so that two new contestants appeared each Monday. This was necessary as the tapes of the show were shipped between stations, and weeks could not be aired in any discernible order. This was a common syndication practice at the time, known as &quot;bicycling.&quot; Usually, three pairs of contestants competed in a total of six games over the five episodes for each week.

On Friday episodes that ran short, during the first season, a game was played with audience members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank was asked of Somers, and she wrote it down on her card. Rayburn then circulated amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, they won $50. Rayburn continued picking audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game was played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess.

Episodes of &quot;Match Game PM&quot; were self-contained, with two new contestants appearing each week.

===Super Match===
The contestant who matched more celebrities than the other contestant at the end of the game won the game and went on to play the Super Match, which consisted of the audience match and the head-to-head match segments, for additional money. On the CBS version, the winner of the main game won $100.

====Audience Match====
The contestant was shown a short fill-in-the-blank phrase (example: &quot;Tell it to ______&quot;), for which the members of a previous studio audience had provided responses. The three most popular responses were hidden on the board, and the contestant attempted to match one of them. The contestant chose any three celebrities to offer suggestions, and could either use one of their ideas or give a different one. Matching one of the three responses on the board awarded $500, $250, or $100 in descending order of popularity. If the contestant failed to match any of them, the round ended immediately and the contestant won nothing. The premise for &quot;Family Feud&quot; (which Dawson began hosting in 1976) was derived from the audience match.

Two audience matches were played on &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, allowing the contestant to win up to $1,000 in this half of the Super Match. If a contestant failed to win any money in either audience match, Rayburn then read a question similar to those in the main game. The contestant earned $100 per celebrity matched, for a maximum of $600.

====Head-to-Head Match====
A contestant who won money in the audience match then had the opportunity to win an additional 10 times that amount (therefore, $5,000, $2,500, or $1,000) by exactly matching another fill-in-the-blank response with one celebrity panelist. Originally, the contestant chose the celebrity. Later, the celebrity who played this match was determined by spinning a wheel (see &quot;Star Wheel&quot; below). At the very start of the 1970s series, Rayburn read the question before the celebrity was chosen, but this was changed after the first two episodes. The format of these matches was much shorter and non-humorous, typically requiring the contestant and celebrity to choose from a number of similar familiar phrases, such as for &quot;Baseball _____&quot; (baseball game, baseball diamond, etc.). The contestant was instructed that his or her response must be an exact match, although singular/plural matches were usually accepted, whereas synonyms, derivatives, and partial word phrases were not.

The panelist chosen most often by contestants to play the head-to-head match was Richard Dawson, who usually matched with the contestants who chose him. Dawson, in fact, was such a popular choice for the second half of the Super Match that the producers instituted a rule in 1975 that forbade contestants from choosing the same panelist for consecutive head-to-head matches in an effort to give the other celebrities a chance to play. After six weeks, the rule was rescinded.

====Star Wheel====
On June 28, 1978, the producers made a second attempt to ensure that each celebrity received a chance to play the head-to-head match. Instead of simply choosing a celebrity, the contestant spun a wheel that was divided into six sections, each marked with a different celebrity&#x27;s name. Once the wheel stopped, the contestant attempted to match with the indicated celebrity. If the wheel did not make at least one complete revolution, the contestant was required to spin again.

The introduction of the star wheel also brought about a change in the bonus payout structure. Each section included several gold stars, which doubled the stakes if the wheel stopped on one of them. The maximum prize was $10,000 on the daytime series and $20,000 on &quot;Match Game PM&quot;.

When the star wheel was introduced, each section contained five stars in a continuous white border, and the prize was doubled if the wheel stopped with its pointer anywhere in that area. Beginning with the premiere of the 1979 syndicated version, the wheel was re-designed so that each section had three stars in separate, evenly spaced squares. The pointer now had to be on a square in order to double the money.

Ironically, the wheel stopped on Dawson the first time it was used, inspiring four of the panelists (Somers, Reilly, guest panelist Mary Wickes, and Dawson himself) to stand up from their places and leave the set momentarily out of disbelief, leaving recurring panelist Scoey Mitchell and guest panelist Sharon Farrell behind. As the others returned, Wickes said to host Rayburn, &quot;Do you know what that wheel costs us? And it&#x27;s right back to Richard!&quot;

At the time, Dawson was becoming weary as a regular panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; as he had concurrently been hosting the (by then) more-popular &quot;Family Feud&quot; since 1976. Dawson was tired from appearing on both shows regularly and wished to focus solely on the latter. The addition of the Star Wheel ended what effectively was Dawson&#x27;s &quot;spotlight&quot; feature on the show, which distressed him further, and he left the panel of &quot;Match Game&quot; permanently a few weeks later.

The subsequent 1990–91 version of the show used a redesigned version of the star wheel. The wheel itself was stationary, and the contestant spun the pointer on a concentric ring to determine which celebrity he or she had to match. The prize was doubled if the pointer stopped on either of two circles within each section.

===Staffing and ratings===

The 1973–82 versions were produced by veteran Goodson–Todman producer Ira Skutch, who also wrote some questions and acted as the on-stage judge. Marc Breslow directed while Robert Sherman was associate producer and head writer.

When CBS revamped &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1973 with more of a focus on risqué humor, ratings more than doubled in comparison with the NBC incarnation. Within three months, &quot;Match Game &#x27;73&quot; was the most-watched program on daytime television. By summer 1974, it grew into an absolute phenomenon with high school students and housewives, scoring remarkable ratings among the 12–34 age demographic. The best ratings this version of &quot;Match Game&quot; saw were in the 1975–76 season when it drew a 12.5 rating with a 35 share, higher numbers than that of some prime-time series. It surpassed records as the most popular daytime program ever with a record 11 million daily viewers, one that held until the &quot;Luke and Laura&quot; supercouple storyline gripped viewers on ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot; some years later.

Every New Year&#x27;s Eve, when the two-digit year designation in the &quot;Match Game&quot; sign was updated, there was a New Year&#x27;s party with the cast and studio audience. Up to and including the 1977–78 changeover, a new sign was built each year. Coinciding with a redesign of the set, a new sign was built with interchangeable digits that could be swapped as the years changed. Additionally, this sign allowed for a &quot;PM&quot; logo to be attached for tapings of the syndicated program instead of using an entirely different sign. Charles Nelson Reilly swapped out the &quot;78&quot; portion of the sign and installed the new &quot;79&quot; on-air, to the playing of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; and wished the audience a happy new year.

In 1976, the show&#x27;s success, and celebrity panelist Richard Dawson&#x27;s popularity, prompted Goodson–Todman to develop a new show for ABC, titled &quot;Family Feud,&quot; with Dawson hosting. This show became a major hit in its own right, eventually surpassing the parent program. &quot;Family Feud&quot; was said to be based on Dawson&#x27;s expertise in the audience match segment of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;Match Game&quot; kept its high standing in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show&#x27;s time slot. Taking note of a ratings boon that resulted when &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot; were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved &quot;Match Game&quot; to 11:00 a.m., immediately following &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; at 10:00 a.m. However, because much of &quot;Match Game&quot;″s audience was composed of students who were in school at that time of day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; many of these students did not return. As a result, &quot;Family Feud&quot; quickly supplanted &quot;Match Game&quot; as television&#x27;s highest-rated game show.

CBS attempted to correct the problem on December 12, 1977, with a scheduling shuffle among &quot;Match,&quot; &quot;Price,&quot; and &quot;Tattletales.&quot; However, in a move that turned out to do even more damage, the network moved &quot;Match Game&quot; to its 1960s time slot of 4:00 p.m., a time slot which, by this point, many local stations were preempting in favor of local or syndicated programming. As a result, &quot;Match Game&quot; was unable to get the audience it once did in the 1960s at 4:00.

===1978 changes and cancellation===
On July 19, 1978, a new &quot;Match Game&quot; set was built by CBS, changed from the original bright orange to a new set with blue and white colors, as well as revamping the logo. The newly designed &quot;Match Game&quot; sign meant that a whole new sign no longer had to be built each year as had been done previously. An attachment designating the year was simply taken off the end of the revamped &quot;Match Game &#x27;78&quot; sign and replaced with a new one numbered &#x27;79 on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1978, which actually aired January 2, 1979, becoming &quot;Match Game &#x27;79.&quot; (An alternate attachment was used for &quot;Match Game PM.&quot;)

At 4:00 p.m., the show trailed &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, and it fell out of the top three game shows in 1979 for the first time in the CBS run (as opposed to a solid and twice top-3 hit in the 1960s). The 1,439th and final CBS episode aired on April 20, 1979. The Tom Kennedy-hosted game show &quot;Whew!&quot; replaced &quot;Match Game&quot; on the schedule when it premiered in the 10:30 a.m. time slot on April 23, 1979.

===&quot;Match Game PM&quot; (1975–81, weekly syndication)===
On September 8, 1975, the first syndicated version, a weekly nighttime series dubbed &quot;Match Game PM&quot; premiered. The series, sold to many ABC affiliates (including the network&#x27;s owned and operated stations such as WABC-TV in New York), was produced by Goodson–Todman and distributed by Jim Victory Television, G-T&#x27;s syndication partner for &quot;Concentration.&quot;

&quot;Match Game PM&quot; was the first version of the game with self-contained episodes. The front game was originally played the same way as the daytime &quot;Match Game&quot; with two rounds of questions, but in the second season, the third round of questioning was added to fill time in the half-hour. The maximum score a contestant could achieve remained six points, with matched celebrities not playing subsequent questions.

Beginning with the second season, tiebreakers were conducted differently from the daytime version. A &quot;Super Match&quot;-style question was asked, and the contestants wrote their answers, then called on celebrities for a match. Originally, only Somers, Reilly and Dawson played in the tiebreaker, but after Dawson&#x27;s departure in 1978, all six celebrities played.

&quot;Match Game PM&#x27;s&quot; Super Match used two audience matches, with the answer values combined and multiplied by ten for the head-to-head match, with a maximum of $10,000 available. When the star wheel was introduced, that potential payout grew to $20,000 if a contestant spun a double.

&quot;Match Game PM&quot; ran until the end of the 1980–81 TV season. For its last two seasons, the show&#x27;s affiliate count went down significantly due in large part to a daily syndicated version that debuted in September 1979, although some markets kept both shows on the air–in New York, WCBS-TV ran the daily syndicated version as WABC-TV continued to air episodes of &quot;Match Game PM&quot; into its final season. The show aired 230 episodes over six seasons, and remains the longest-running version to air in syndication.

==Later revivals==

===1979–82, daily syndication===
After the cancellation of &quot;Match Game 79&quot;, there was still enough interest in the series for Goodson–Todman and Jim Victory Television to consider a continuation of the daily series in syndication as the weekly &quot;Match Game PM&quot; was still airing and had not stopped production. The consideration eventually came to fruition as a daily syndicated &quot;Match Game&quot;, without a year attached and often referred to on-air as &quot;The Match Game&quot;, debuted on September 10, 1979.

The rules and gameplay were the same as before, including the star wheel bonus, but the format was altered slightly. Each contestant on this version of &quot;Match Game&quot; played a two-game match against another contestant, and the Super Match was played after each game. As is the case with &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, a contestant did not win any money for winning the game. There were also no returning champions on the daily syndicated series, as two new contestants began each match. The star wheel reduced the golden star sections to three, making it more difficult to double the winnings in the head-to-head match.

The maximum payout for a contestant was $21,000 (two $500 audience matches and two $10,000 head-to-head match wins), the same its syndicated sister series &quot;Match Game PM&quot; was offering during this time.

For the first two seasons Bill Daily, Dick Martin, Richard Paul, and Bob Barker were among the male semi-regulars who filled Dawson&#x27;s old spot on the panel. McLean Stevenson, who appeared once in September 1978 and twice near the end of the second year of this version, appeared in nearly all of the third season (1981–82) and became a regular from the eleventh taped week through the end of the season.

The syndicated &quot;Match Game&quot; helped exacerbate the perception of the 4:00 p.m. time slot being a &quot;death slot&quot; for network programming. After CBS canceled &quot;Match Game 79&quot;, the network moved the long-running soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot; into the vacant time slot. Although the syndicated &quot;Match Game&quot; was not a direct cause of the ratings problems &quot;Love of Life&quot; faced—the 4:00 p.m. time slot, the last network daytime slot, had been a problem for all three networks for years and &quot;Love of Life&quot; had seen a precipitous drop in ratings since the April 1979 move to the late afternoon—many stations ran the syndicated &quot;Match Game&quot; against the veteran soap opera, and several more stations, including many CBS-owned stations and affiliates, dropped &quot;Love of Life&quot; in favor of the new &quot;Match Game&quot;. (&quot;Love of Life&quot; aired its final episode on February 1, 1980, five months after the debut of the new &quot;Match Game&quot;.) The daytime syndicated show produced 525 episodes, running until September 10, 1982 – exactly three years after its debut.

&quot;Match Game&quot;″s 1973–82 run was taped in Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, except for one week of shows in 1974 in which it was shot in Studio 41.

===&quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; (1983–84, NBC)===
In 1983, producer Mark Goodson teamed up with Orion Television (who had recently acquired the rights to &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;) and NBC to create &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;. Rayburn, after a year as a morning show host in New York, agreed to return as host. However, few of the regular &quot;Squares&quot; cast appeared on this version. Jon Bauman (Sha Na Na) was tapped to host the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; segment of the game and he and Rayburn swapped seats while the other hosted his portion of the show. The primary announcer was Gene Wood, with Johnny Olson, Bob Hilton, and Rich Jeffries substituting.

These rules were roughly the same as those of &quot;Match Game PM&quot; with both contestants given three chances apiece to match each panelist once. The lone noticeable difference was in the tie-breaker. Played similarly to the Super Match, four answers to a statement were secretly shown to the contestants (e.g., &quot;_____, New Jersey&quot;, with the choices of &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;Hoboken&quot;, &quot;Newark&quot; and &quot;Trenton&quot;). They each chose one by number. Then, as was the case in &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, the host polled the celebrities for verbal responses, and the first panelist to give an answer selected by one of the contestants won the game for that contestant. The winner of the &quot;Match Game&quot; segment played the returning champion in the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; segment with the eventual winner of &quot;Squares&quot; playing the Super Match.

In the Super Match, the audience match featured payoffs of $1,000, $500, and $250. If a contestant did not make an audience match, the game did not end, but the contestant was given $100 and the game continued to the head-to-head match.

For the head-to-head match, the game reverted to the contestant picking the celebrity, and each celebrity had a hidden multiplier (10, 20, 30). The audience match winnings were multiplied by the hidden number to determine the Super Match jackpot for the head-to-head match, with the maximum amount available being $30,000. Champions remained on the program for up to five days unless defeated.

&quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; ran from October 31, 1983, to July 27, 1984. Several music cues from the program were used as background music during prize descriptions on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

===1990–91, ABC===
In 1989, ABC, which had not carried a daytime game show since &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot; in 1987, ordered a revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; for its lineup. A week&#x27;s worth of pilot episodes were commissioned with Bert Convy as host, who was also hosting &quot;3rd Degree&quot; for his own production company at the time. The network agreed to pick up the revival for a summer 1990 premiere making it the first Mark Goodson-produced game show to run on the network since &quot;Family Feud&quot; was cancelled in June 1985.
Just before the new series was to begin, producers were forced to find a new host when Convy was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor in April 1990. Although original host Gene Rayburn expressed interest in returning, the producers declined, with Rayburn suspecting that public knowledge of his age (72 at the time) led to his being snubbed. Ross Shafer, the former host of Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; and the USA Network dating series &quot;Love Me, Love Me Not&quot;, took over as host. Charles Nelson Reilly returned as a regular panelist and Brett Somers appeared as a guest panelist for several weeks. Vicki Lawrence, Sally Struthers, Brad Garrett, Bill Kirchenbauer, and Ronn Lucas were among the semi-regulars for this version of the show. Gene Wood returned as an announcer, with Bob Hilton filling in for two weeks. Marcia Wallace, Betty White, Dick Martin, Dolly Martin, Jo Anne Worley, Edie McClurg &amp; Jimmie Walker were among other panelists who also appeared on earlier versions of the show.

====Gameplay====
For this edition of &quot;Match Game&quot;, two contestants competed, with one usually a returning champion. Instead of attempting to match as many of the six panelists as possible over the course of two rounds, the two contestants won money by making matches, with the high scorer becoming champion at the end of the game. Two rounds of fill-in-the-blank questions were played, with each match paying off at $50.

After both contestants played a question of their own, each separately played a speed round of Super Match-style questions called &quot;Match-Up&quot; with a celebrity partner of his or her choice. The contestant was presented with a question with two possible answers and secretly selected one, after which the panelist was told the choices and then tried to match the contestant&#x27;s choice by giving a verbal response. Each contestant had 30 seconds to make as many matches as possible as $50 per match. Gameplay began with the trailing contestant, who chose from any of the six panelists. The leading contestant chose from the remaining five panelists for his or her match-up round.

Following Match-Up, another traditional question round was played with all six celebrities for $50 per match with all six panelists. After round two, contestants then played Final Match-Up (each choosing from the remaining panelists) for 45 seconds, with matches paying off at $100 each. The contestant ahead at the end of Final Match-Up won the game and kept any money earned.
If the game ended in a tie, one tie breaking Match-Up phrase was shown to both contestants along with three choices. The champion chose an answer first and the challenger chose one of the remaining two answers. After the choices were made, the last celebrity who played Final Match-Up was told which answers the contestants selected and was then asked to choose one of them. The contestant whose chosen answer matched the answer said by that celebrity won an additional $100 and the game.

The Super Match was played similar to the 1978–82 version of the round, beginning with the audience match. Initially, the payouts were the same as in the 1970s series, with the top answer worth $500, the second $250, and the third $100, failing to match any of the top three answers awarded $50. After three weeks, the payouts for the second- and third-place answers were increased to $300 and $200, respectively, and the consolation amount was doubled to $100.

Following the audience match, the contestant spun the Star Wheel to choose a celebrity for the head-to-head match and set the stakes. The wheel was fixed in place, and each celebrity&#x27;s section contained two large red dots. The contestant spun a pointer attached to the rim of the wheel and played for 20 times the audience match value if it stopped on a dot, or 10 times the value otherwise. The contestant had to match the chosen celebrity&#x27;s response exactly in order to win. The maximum somebody could win in the Super Match was $10,000.

Champions could stay for up to five days or until they were defeated, and kept all their winnings. This version of &quot;Match Game&quot; was the first not to have a network-imposed winnings limit, ABC had previously set a $20,000 limit on its game shows, but dropped the practice by 1990.

ABC aired the show at 12:00 p.m. because many of its stations in major Eastern Time markets carried local news at that timeslot, which was a major problem among the three networks throughout the 1970s and 1980s; the show was mostly seen in smaller markets and on independent stations in some larger markets without network clearances (which had affected the previous occupier of the time slot, soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;), and was canceled after one season. The show&#x27;s final episode aired on June 21, 1991, Ross Shafer announced the show would be moving to &quot;another channel, another time, very shortly&quot; on the finale, but this never materialized. On July 15, 1991, &quot;Home&quot; temporarily expanded to 90 minutes to fill the show&#x27;s timeslot, until ABC returned the half-hour to its affiliates in September 1992. &quot;Match Game&quot; was ABC&#x27;s last daytime game show to date.

===1998–99, daily syndication===
In 1996, a pilot was produced for a new revival of the show as &quot;MG2: The Match Game&quot;, just five years after the previous incarnation had left the air, with Charlene Tilton as host (who had previously been a panelist herself on the PM version). While that version (which did not air) had a much greater departure from the game&#x27;s original format, the producers significantly retooled the format to create a somewhat more faithful remake of the program, which was picked up in syndication and began in fall 1998.

Michael Burger hosted this revived version of the show, with Paul Boland announcing. The only celebrity guests who had appeared on previous versions of the show were Vicki Lawrence (who appeared on two weeks of the 1970s version and regularly on the 1990–91 version) and Nell Carter (who had appeared on the final week in 1991). The regular panelists on this version were Carter, Lawrence, and Judy Tenuta, and semi-regulars were George Hamilton, John Salley, Coolio, and Rondell Sheridan (the only panelist from &quot;MG2&quot; to carry over to the regular series). Production returned to Studio 33 at Television City Studios on this version.

This incarnation of &quot;Match Game&quot; was played with rules similar to that of the 1973–82 versions. However, the show featured a panel of only five celebrities instead of the usual six. Questions in this version were not labeled A or B, instead, titles with puns were a clue as to the content. As on the 1990–91 version, all five panelists played each round regardless of whether they matched a contestant on the first question. Correct matches in the first round were worth one point while those in the second were worth two.

After two rounds, the higher scorer played the Super Match, which was played similar to its 1973–78 incarnation (with the exception of the 1983 rule change, $50 in this version, for an unsuccessful match), including the $5,000 top prize and in the head to head match the contestant faced the celebrity which was never allowed on any other version and the celebrity stood at a podium to write their answer instead of writing the answer at their seat.

This version was placed in many late night slots due to the celebrities giving answers that were inappropriate and otherwise risqué jokes about body parts and genitals; this is likely the reason why this version only lasted one season, running from September 21, 1998 to May 21, 1999, with repeats airing until September 17, 1999.

===&quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; (2006, CBS)===
On June 22, 2006, &quot;Match Game&quot; was the sixth of seven classic game shows featured in CBS&#x27;s month-long &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; hosted by Ricki Lake and announced by Rich Fields, and the second of two &quot;semi-final&quot; games in the tournament. The contestants were Kathy Najimy and Lance Bass with Betty White, George Foreman, Kathy Griffin, Bruce Vilanch, Adam Carolla, and Adrianne Curry as the panel. White retained her normal sixth-seat position and was the only one from the original series to appear for this segment of &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;.

Lake used the same signature long-thin Sony ECM-51 telescoping microphone Rayburn used during the CBS version, and the set was rebuilt to be almost an exact match of that used from 1973 to 1978. Najimy won the game, scoring five matches to Bass&#x27;s three.

The format was that of &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, except that in the Super Match the head-to-head match was played for 50 times the amount won in the two audience matches ($50,000), which was won.

===&quot;Match Game&quot; (Canada)===
A Canadian revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; debuted on March 5, 2010, as &quot;Atomes crochus,&quot; a Québécois version on V, with Alexandre Barrette as host and produced by Zone 3, in association with FremantleMedia North America. A coinciding English-language version debuted on The Comedy Network October 15, 2012 and was hosted by Darrin Rose, with Seán Cullen and Debra DiGiovanni as permanent panelists. On April 4, 2013, it was announced that due to high ratings, the show returned for a 60-episode second season, which premiered on September 2.

The first English-language season shared studios with the French-language version in Montreal, with production of the English version moving to Showline Studios in Toronto for season 2.

Gameplay is similar to the 1990 U.S. revival, two rounds are played, with all six celebrities participating in both rounds, and each match is worth 50 points (100 points starting in season 2). The third round is called match-up!, with each contestant given 45 seconds to match/his her chosen celebrity partner, and successful matches are again worth 50 points (100 starting in season 2). The contestant with more points at the end of this round wins the game and receives the cash equivalent of his or her score (for example, if the champion&#x27;s final score was 450 points, the payoff would be $450). If there is a tie after Match-Up, one tiebreaking Match-up is shown with three choices. Both contestants secretly chose their picks and the celebrity that last played Match-Up gets to break the tie with his/her verbal response.

Unlike any previous version, the audience match portion of the Super Match is not played for a payoff, but simply to determine the value of the head-to-head match. The potential payoffs are $2,500–$2,000–$1,500, or $1,000 for an unsuccessful match. If the champion manages a lucky star wheel spin, as in earlier versions, the value is doubled for a payoff of up to $5,000. Originally, in season 1 the payoffs were $2,000–$1,500–$1,000, or $500 for an unsuccessful match, with a potential top payoff of $4,000 for a lucky star wheel spin.

===2016–21, ABC revival===
The first of ten 60-minute episodes of another revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; premiered on ABC (which had previously aired the 1990 version) on June 26, 2016. Alec Baldwin served as host and executive producer. The show aired as part of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Fun and Games&quot; block alongside the returning &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; starring Steve Harvey and &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; starring Michael Strahan. It also marked the series&#x27; return to New York, having taped there during the 1960s. On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed &quot;Match Game&quot; for a second season.

Gameplay was similar to the 1973–79 version, featuring two full games, each with two new contestants. Each game is self-contained, with two questions per contestant, the winner advances to the Super Match. If the score was tied after two rounds, a tiebreaker round with all stars was played, if the tie persisted, a sudden-death tiebreaker was played. Values for the audience match portion of the bonus game were $5,000, $3,000, and $2,000, with $1,000 awarded for not matching any of the top three answers. The contestant then selected a celebrity for the head-to-head match, which multiplied the audience match winnings by five if successful, for a potential top prize of $25,000.

On many episodes, answers deemed inappropriate for broadcast were edited out with comical effects, including a slide whistle sound effect dubbed over the audible answer in place of the usual bleep censor. In addition, the answer card and celebrity&#x27;s mouth could be blurred or pixelated.

The show was picked up to fill ABC&#x27;s winter programming schedule on January 4, 2017.

On April 2, 2017, the show began to be used as a mid-season replacement on Sunday evenings with newly produced episodes filling in for three weeks to replace the canceled period drama/sci-fi series &quot;Time After Time&quot; before the start of May sweeps, when extended season finales and awards ceremonies fill out the remainder of the season.

On August 6, 2017, ABC announced that &quot;Match Game&quot; was renewed for a third season, which later premiered on January 9, 2018. Season four of the show debuted in June 2019. On November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on May 31, 2020. After the last series of episodes aired over summer 2020 and July 2021, ABC confirmed in April 2022 that the series had been cancelled; the decision was made before Baldwin fatally shot a crew member on the set of the film &quot;Rust&quot; in October 2021.

==Episode status==
Only 11 episodes of the 1962–69 series are known to survive—the pilot and 10 kinescope recordings, all of which are archived at the Paley Center for Media. Nine of these are black-and-white kinescopes and one is a color episode (from 1969 and on videotape). The pilot has since fallen into the public domain.

===Reruns===
The 1973–82 incarnations are shown in reruns daily on Buzzr and GSN.

Virtually all episodes of this version are still extant, although some are reportedly not shown due to celebrities&#x27; refusals of clearances, while others have been banned for various reasons (usually for answers from either celebrities or contestants that are now deemed to no longer be politically correct) or pulled from reruns due to tape damage. The 1990–91 ABC version has also had runs on GSN until 2005. On December 25, 2012, an episode of the 1998 version along with a Bert Convy pilot aired on GSN for the first time as part of a &quot;Match Game&quot; marathon.

Buzzr also airs reruns of the 1970s Match Game incarnation. Buzzr added the &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; episodes to its lineup in February 2019, initially with the first week of episodes, more episodes were eventually added in September after the network updated the show&#x27;s archive for 21st-century broadcasting standards. Those episodes had not been seen on television since their original broadcasts.

==&quot;The Real Match Game Story: Behind the Blank&quot;==
On November 26, 2006, GSN aired an hour-long documentary titled &quot;The Real Match Game Story: Behind The Blank&quot;, narrated by Jamie Farr. The documentary features rarely seen footage of the 1960s version, many odd or memorable moments from the main 1973–82 runs, and interviews with Rayburn (including the final interview before his death in 1999), Somers, Dawson, DeBartolo, producer Ira Skutch, and others involved in the show&#x27;s production.

==Music==
&quot;Match Game&quot; featured several theme songs throughout its various runs. From 1962 to 1967, Bert Kaempfert&#x27;s instrumental &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Safari&quot; was used as the theme. Kaempfert&#x27;s commercial single, recorded in Europe, was used for the pilot, an American cover version by the Billy Vaughn orchestra was used through 1967. From 1967 to 1969, a new theme composed by Score Productions was used.

When the program returned in 1973, Goodson–Todman once again turned to Score Productions for a music package. A new theme, performed by The Midnight Four, was composed by Score staff composer Ken Bichel with a memorable &quot;funk&quot; guitar intro, and similar elements and instruments from this theme were also featured in the numerous &quot;think cues&quot; heard when the panel wrote down their answers. Alternate think cues were extracted from the music packages for &quot;Tattletales&quot; and &quot;The Money Maze&quot;. In keeping with the zany atmosphere, the music supervisors also used other notable musical works to add to humorous situations. Among the non-Score Productions music heard on occasion was the &quot;burlesque&quot; music titled &quot;The Stripper&quot;, and a version of &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (usually humorously played in response to Rayburn&#x27;s call for &quot;belly dancing&quot; music).

The music for &quot;The Match Game–Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; was composed by Edd Kalehoff. None of the music used from the 1970s version was used in this version. The main theme song and several of its cue variations were used on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

In 1990, Bichel re-orchestrated his 1970s theme with more modern instruments with new think cues (with the classic intro/think cue re-orchestrated). The 1998 version again used music from Score Productions. The 2016 revival utilizes Bichel&#x27;s original 1973 theme and think cues.

==International versions==
==Merchandise==
===Home games===
Several home game versions based on the 1960s and 1970s American television version were published by Milton Bradley from 1963 through 1978, in multiple editions.

====&quot;The Match Game&quot; (1963–69)====
Starting in 1963, Milton Bradley made six editions of the NBC version. Each game contained crayons, wipe-off papers, 100 perforated cards with six questions per card, a plastic scoreboard tray with colored pegs and chips, and 6 &quot;scribble boards&quot;. After the first edition, the vinyl scribble boards and crayons were replaced with six &quot;magic slates&quot; and wooden styli.

The main object of the game is for a contestant to try to write answers to questions that will match the answers of his or her partner. The rules for a six-contestant game are the same as on the TV show (with similar scoring, such as receiving points for matching two answers and more points for matching all three answers), but the home game also has variations for fewer than six contestants. No bonus game is included.

Milton Bradley also created a Fine Edition and a Collector&#x27;s Edition with more questions. The magic slates came enclosed in a gold folder, plus a dial to keep score instead of the pegboard. The scoring and point values were just like the TV show. The only difference between the Fine Edition and the Collector&#x27;s Edition is that instead of being packaged in a normal cardboard box, it came in a leatherette case with buttons on the front apron.

====&quot;Match Game&quot; (1974–78)====
Starting in 1974, Milton Bradley created three more editions based on the most famous CBS version. Each edition contained a game board with a plastic stand, two game booklets (one with instructions) with material for 92 complete games (368 Main Game Questions and 92 audience match and head-to-head match questions), two magic slates and styli (only of the head-to-head match portion), and play money.

As in the 1970s version, two contestants have two chances to match as many of the six celebrities as possible. Celebrity answers are printed in the booklets, and after the contestant gives an answer, the M.C. reads the celebrity responses one by one, marking correct answers on the game board. A contestant can get up to six matches in one game. The contestant with the most matches plays the Super Match round (the MC reads the question and the responses) for a chance to win money (with an audience match and a head-to-head match similar to the TV show) of up to $5,000.

===Interactive online versions===
After much success with its online version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, Uproar.com released a single-contestant version of &quot;Match Game&quot; in 2001. However, as of September 30, 2006, the website has been temporarily shut down, no longer offering any game show-based games of any kind.

GSN offered a version called &quot;Match Game: Interactive&quot; on its own website that allowed users to play along with the show while watching. However, as of January 1, 2007, only those shows airing between 7:00pm and 10:00pm were interactive as &quot;Match Game&quot; itself was not one of them.

===Slot machine===
A five reels video slot machine based on the 1973–82 version was released at various US casinos by WMS Gaming in 2004. The game features caricatures of Jimmie Walker, Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, Morgan Fairchild (even though she has never appeared on any incarnations of the show itself), Rip Taylor and Vicki Lawrence as the panel and Gene Rayburn as the host. The slot machine&#x27;s bonus round stays faithful to the original game format where round one is adapted from the main game while round two features the Super Match bonus round.

===Home media===
A DVD set called &quot;The Best of Match Game&quot; featuring a collection of more than 30 episodes of the 1970s version including the original 1962 pilot episode (which was originally called &quot;The Match Game&quot;) was released in 2006. An eight-episode collection, called &quot;The Best of &quot;Match Game&quot;: Dumb Dora Is So Dumb Edition!&quot;, was released later on in 2007 by BCI Eclipse Company LLC (under license from FremantleMedia Enterprises), which contained 8 original episodes, uncut and unedited, and digitally restored, re-mastered and transferred from the original 2-inch videotape recording masters for optimum video quality.

In 2007, Endless Games released a DVD game featuring questions and clips from the 1970s version. Its gameplay was similar to that of the 1970s version; however, it allowed up to six contestants rather than two. Scoring for the game was also slightly different as well, as every match in round one was worth $50 each while in round two, every match was worth $100. Also, the Super Match round was played differently. The audience match portion was played after round one by the leading contestants, and the head-to-head match by the winning contestants, with a correct match doubling the winnings of the contestant&#x27;s scores.

<text>Guinan is a recurring character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, portrayed by American actress Whoopi Goldberg. The character first appeared in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 1988 and went on to appear in the films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; as well as the television series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. She was also played as a child by Isis Carmen Jones in the episode &quot;Rascals&quot; and a younger version of the character by Ito Aghayere in &quot;Picard&quot;.

Guinan is a bartender in the Ten-Forward lounge aboard the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. The character first appears in the second-season opening episode &quot;The Child&quot;, and makes recurring appearances during the next four seasons. Guinan was partly inspired by the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Yoda, and is said to be hundreds of years old with corresponding wisdom and insight which she often uses to defuse difficult situations or comfort other characters.

==History==

Following the departure of Denise Crosby from the role of Tasha Yar during the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, established actress Whoopi Goldberg believed there was a vacancy for a female actress on the series. She had been a lifelong fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, having been inspired to become an actress by Nichelle Nichols&#x27; appearances as Uhura in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. Goldberg later recalled that she first saw an episode of the series in her youth and after Uhura appeared on-screen, she went running through her house shouting &quot;Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there&#x27;s a black lady on television and she ain&#x27;t no maid!&quot; Goldberg approached her friend LeVar Burton, who played Geordi La Forge in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, but the producers of the series ignored her, by one account believing they were being pranked until Goldberg telephoned the production office directly. However, executive producer Rick Berman later recalled it was Goldberg&#x27;s manager who made the call, inviting him and series creator Gene Roddenberry out to lunch with Goldberg to discuss her appearing on the series.

At the time, plans were already underway to add a lounge set to the series. Named Ten-Forward, it was created to have a setting where the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D could be shown interacting with each other as well as various aliens in a more casual setting. At the lunch between Berman, Roddenberry and Goldberg, she explained that &quot;Star Trek&quot; was the only futuristic science fiction series at the time she knew of that featured black people prominently. She asked whether they had already cast the new Doctor, following the firing of Gates McFadden from the role of Beverly Crusher. Roddenberry and Berman instead suggested the creation of a new character specifically for Goldberg. Goldberg was unable to commit to appearing as a permanent member of the cast, which fit in with plans for Ten-Forward as they were not expecting the lounge to appear in every episode.
The character of Guinan was based on Mary Louise Cecilia &quot;Texas&quot; Guinan, a prohibition-era emcee and owner of the 300 Club in New York City. While the name was adopted, the characterization was changed to a worldly mystic, in line with Yoda from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, had envisaged the character Guinan as extremely old, leading Goldberg to suggest that she could be the ancestor of some of the other characters on the series.

When Goldberg made her first appearance as Guinan, in the episode &quot;The Child&quot;, she was credited as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; alongside Diana Muldaur who appeared throughout the second season as Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Guinan-centric episodes were scheduled throughout the rest of the run of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; to coincide with the availability of Goldberg, who at the time was continuing to appear in films and other work. In one instance, for &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot;, Guinan was written in at short notice, taking lines intended for other characters after Goldberg became available at short notice unexpectedly.

There were plans to introduce a son of Guinan at some point in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, but this never occurred. The idea was resurrected during the writing process of the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Rivals&quot;, with the character of Martus Mazur intended to be Guinan&#x27;s son. After Goldberg was unable to make a guest appearance, the relationship between the two characters was written out. However, the first time that the El-Aurian species was mentioned by name was in this episode, but this may have been inspired by the scripts for &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; which the writing team would have seen by that point in the production of the series.
Goldberg became intrinsically linked to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and she became a personal friend of creator Gene Roddenberry, subsequently being one of the eulogists at his funeral in 1991. During the initial production of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, she met with director Nicholas Meyer to discuss appearing as a Klingon in the film. This was vetoed by actor Leonard Nimoy, who had taken the lead on arrangements for the film, as with Christian Slater already set to appear in the film he did not want to be overwhelmed with celebrity cameos. She later described Guinan as a combination of Yoda, herself and Andrei Sakharov, adding that she was &quot;more grateful for &quot;Star Trek&quot; now as a mother and grandmother&quot; and described the prospect of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, saying &quot;We all need to believe there is a good, positive future for us.&quot;

Goldberg stated at her first &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention in 2016 that she wishes to return to the franchise and appear on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; in the future since the character was specifically designed to be able to appear at any point in the timeline. Returning actor-character combinations are famous in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, and popular also; &quot;TNG&quot;″s &quot;Unification&quot; (1991) episodes featuring Leonard Nimoy as Spock in Part II brought in the highest Nielsen ratings (15.4) of that season, and the highest for &quot;TNG&quot; except for the pilot and finale (see also &quot;Star Trek&quot; crossovers). During a January 22, 2020, appearance on &quot;The View&quot;, the talk show of which Goldberg is a co-host, Patrick Stewart helped realize Goldberg&#x27;s wish, inviting her to appear as Guinan during the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard,&quot; which she ultimately did.

===Films===
The decision was made to feature Goldberg prominently in the first feature film based on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. This was due in part to her being far more well known to the general public than the majority of the main cast, having won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 for her role in the film &quot;Ghost&quot;. During the course of the film, the character is revealed to be an El-Aurian for the first time. Upon arriving on the first day of production of &quot;Generations&quot;, Goldberg began looking around the set for Nichols, having expected her to be there since it was a cross-over film between &quot;The Original Series&quot; and &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. It was later reported by Walter Koenig that Goldberg was annoyed as she saw that the fans wanted a scene with Guinan and Uhura together. Nichols did not appear in &quot;Generations&quot;.

==Production==
Producer Rick Berman was noted as being &quot;extremely sensitive&quot; about who interacted with Goldberg on the set, according to the book &quot;The Making of Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; by Eric A. Stillwell. In one instance where a co-writer of &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; talked with Goldberg, Berman found out about it and said he did not want this kind of interaction which was oriented towards the production office.

==Appearances==
In &quot;Rascals&quot;, Guinan&#x27;s younger self is played by Isis Carmen Jones, who also played Goldberg&#x27;s character as a child in the film &quot;Sister Act&quot; (1992). Guinan works in Ten-Forward and often appears in episodes to converse with characters to help them resolve their issue at hand. She most commonly interacts with long-time friend Picard, but is know to help others as well. 

Guinan made her first appearance in the second season opening episode &quot;The Child&quot; on November 21, 1988, on first-run syndicated television. During the course of the episode, she gives advice to Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) about whether he should leave the ship to join his mother when she transferred to Starfleet Medical on Earth. In this episode, she refers to meeting Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) for the first time when she came on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, something which was later ignored and discounted. She made further appearances in the second season, including in &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; where she advises Data to use the holodeck to help him better understand comedy, and again in the Data-centric episode &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;, as well as &quot;The Dauphin&quot; where she and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) attempt to explain flirting to Wesley Crusher.

The first revelation of Guinan being something more than a simple barkeeper came later that season in the episode &quot;Q Who&quot;. After Q (John de Lancie) sends the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D across the galaxy, causing them to encounter the Borg, she trades barbs with the omnipotent being who reveals that he knows Guinan from past encounters and suggests she may have been known by other names in the past. Q attempts to remove Guinan from the Enterprise, only to have her hold up her hands to him in response implying she possessed the power to do battle with him or at the very least to defend herself. She also informs Picard that the Borg drove her species into near extinction over a century earlier. She returned once more in the second episode of the third season, &quot;Evolution&quot;, in which she explains she has many children, and later in the season in &quot;Booby Trap&quot; where she reveals that she finds the heads of bald men attractive. She once again comes face to face with Q in &quot;Deja Q&quot;. Guinan is central to the plot of &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;, when the timeline is changed after the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C appears from a spatial rift. Guinan is the only member of the crew who is aware that something has changed, and believes that Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) should not be on the ship. The timeline is restored when the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C re-enters the rift.

Guinan appears in part one of &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, where she and Captain Picard mull over his tactics defending the ship from a Borg vessel, contemplating the potential end of human civilization. Guinan assures Picard that, based on her experience with the Borg, &quot;humanity will survive&quot; even if only a handful of humans live to &quot;keep the spirit alive&quot;. Guinan also plays a role in the second part which started the fourth season. She advises Commander Riker in his predicament in dealing with the Borg-assimilated Picard. She tells him that her relationship with Picard &quot;goes beyond friendship and beyond family&quot;, but advises Riker that he must find a way to stop the assimilated Locutus by &quot;not&quot; thinking like Picard. She appears in the following episode broadcast, which follows up on Picard&#x27;s experiences as a Borg, &quot;Family&quot;. In &quot;The Loss&quot;, Guinan advises Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) when she loses her empathic senses, telling her that she still has her skills as a counselor to rely on. Guinan joins Picard in his holodeck program Dixon Hill in the episode &quot;Clues&quot;. Her other appearances in the season included &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;Night Terrors&quot; where she reveals she keeps a rifle behind the bar, &quot;In Theory&quot;, and the first part of &quot;Redemption&quot; where she scores higher than Klingon Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) on a firing range on the holodeck.

Her first appearance in the fifth season comes in the first episode, the second part of &quot;Redemption&quot;. In &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, she strikes up a friendship with Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) which continued for the rest of the other recurring character&#x27;s appearances in the series. In &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot;, Guinan discusses the nearby nebula with Data in Ten-Forward. In the following episode, &quot;I, Borg&quot;, Guinan objects to the presence of the Borg known as Hugh on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Further revelations of Guinan&#x27;s backstory are made in the season finale, the first part of &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;, when after travelling back to 19th century San Francisco, Data discovers a photograph of Guinan in a local newspaper. Meanwhile, on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, Guinan advises Picard that he must lead the away team to travel through a temporal rift to save Data in the past.

Central to the plot of the second half of &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; which opened the sixth season, Guinan meets Picard for the first time in her timeline and works with him and Samuel Clemens to prevent a plot by the aliens of Devidia II. In &quot;Rascals&quot;, alongside Picard, Ro, and Keiko O&#x27;Brien (Rosalind Chao), her body is de-aged to that of a child following a transporter accident, where the younger Guinan was portrayed by actress Isis Jones. Guinan reveals that her father is still alive at the time, having previously been hiding from him on Earth during &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;. In &quot;Suspicions&quot;, she advises Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) on whether to trust her instincts when a Ferengi scientist is killed during an experiment on board.

Guinan is originally from El-Auria. Her people, sometimes called &quot;listeners&quot;, had been scattered throughout the galaxy after the Borg invaded their homeworld. As a refugee aboard the El-Aurian vessel &quot;Lakul&quot;, she is rescued from the Nexus by the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B. This is part of the opening act of &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, the 1994 film made after the series&#x27; seven-year run concluded. Guinan did not appear in the next two &quot;Star Trek&quot; films (&quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;Insurrection&quot;).

Guinan reveals in &quot;Nemesis&quot; that she has been married 23 times. She states in &quot;Evolution&quot; that she has many children, including a son who went through a phase when &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t listen to anybody&quot;—something unusual &quot;in a species of listeners&quot;.

Guinan appears in the second season premiere of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, when Jean-Luc Picard visits her at her bar in Los Angeles called 10 Forward Avenue. Guinan has also adjusted her physical age so that she appears older as humans do not like to be reminded of their mortality. After time traveling back to 2024 in order to correct the timeline, Picard and his crew encounter a younger version of Guinan living on Earth in the 21st century who aids them. Following Picard&#x27;s return to the present, he visits Guinan who had kept their history in the past a secret in order to preserve the timeline and reveals what had become of Cristobal Rios and Picard&#x27;s friends from the 21st century. As seen in the third season premiere, Guinan decided to capitalize on the upcoming Frontier Day holiday by selling small models of the various &quot;Enterprise&quot;s in her bar.

===Television===
Guinan appears in 29 episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, five episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; and in two theatrical films, &quot;Generations&quot; (1994) and &quot;Nemesis&quot; (2002).

This novel included elements from both &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–1969) and &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. The later &quot;Stargazer&quot; novel &quot;Oblivion&quot; features Picard&#x27;s first meeting with Guinan when he was still captain of the &quot;Stargazer&quot;, where the meeting helps Guinan overcome her severe depression after she was pulled out of the Nexus.

==Reception and commentary==

Lina Morgan in her article for Syfy Wire on Guinan&#x27;s quintessential moments, described her as &quot;easily one of the best characters in the history of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. His list of moments consisted of the one in &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; where Guinan explains slavery to Picard; the time that she stabbed Q with a fork in &quot;Deja Q&quot;; the discussion she has with Commander Riker in &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; and her lack of sympathy for the Borg in &quot;I, Borg&quot;. Morgan did state that her favourite moment came in the second part of &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; where she and Picard are trapped in the cave and the sexual tension between the pair, comparing the relationship between that of River Song and The Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; whereby they meet each other for the first time but out of sequence.

Terry Erdmann and Paula Block state in their 2008 book &quot;Star Trek 101&quot; that the key Guinan episode is &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;. They describe her role in the episode as that of a Greek chorus to explain that a change has taken place in the timeline.

Film reviewer Roger Ebert described Guinan as &quot;the Enterprise&#x27;s resident mystic&quot;.

In 2016, SyFy rated Guinan as among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, noting that she was a mysterious character that kept audiences guessing. In 2017, IndieWire rated Guinan as the third-best character on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, noting her as a &quot;fascinating character&quot;. In the summer of 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; suggested that Guinan could get her own series more easily, due to the character being hundreds of years old there would be many, many stories to tell. In 2018, CBR ranked Guinan the 8th best recurring character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Guinan as one of the top eight most powerful characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, remarking &quot;Guinan is one of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s greatest enigmas.&quot; In July 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Guinan the 7th smartest character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

<text>Press Your Luck is an American television game show created by Bill Carruthers and Jan McCormack. Contestants answer trivia questions to earn &quot;spins&quot; on a randomly cycling game board. The board&#x27;s spaces display cash, prizes, extra spins, special items, or the show&#x27;s mascot, a cartoon creature known as the Whammy. Landing on a Whammy eliminates any cash and prizes accumulated while also displaying a short comedic animation. Its format is a revival of an earlier Carruthers production, &quot;Second Chance&quot;, which was hosted by Jim Peck and aired on ABC in 1977. The original version of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; aired on CBS between 1983 and 1986. This version featured Peter Tomarken as host, Rod Roddy as announcer, and Carruthers as both director and voice of the Whammy. The original incarnation of the show gained significant media attention in 1984 for contestant Michael Larson, who won over $100,000 after memorizing the original pattern of the game board.

Following the show&#x27;s cancellation by CBS in 1986, it aired frequently in reruns, first on USA Network and then on Game Show Network. &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot;, a revival of the series, aired from 2002 to 2003 also on Game Show Network with Todd Newton as host and Gary Kroeger as announcer. A weekly primetime version (reverting to the name &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;) began airing on ABC in 2019, with Elizabeth Banks as host. Neil Ross served as both announcer and voice of the Whammy until 2023, when he was replaced in both capacities by Chris Ahearn. Adaptations of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; have also aired in other countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany, while an adaptation of &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot; also aired in the Philippines. The show has also been adapted into a number of video games for computers and video game consoles.

==Gameplay==
Three contestants compete on each episode. Gameplay consists of four rounds: two question rounds and two &quot;big board&quot; rounds.
In a question round, contestants earn spins by correctly answering a series of trivia questions asked by the host. Each question is initially presented as a toss-up open to all; after a contestant buzzes in and answers, the host reads that response and two more to the opponents as a multiple choice selection. Contestants earn three spins for buzzing in and giving the correct answer, and one for choosing it from the three options. If no one buzzes in, the host reads three answers and each contestant can earn one spin by choosing the correct one. There is no penalty for an incorrect answer at any time. However, if a contestant buzzes in and fails to respond, they are frozen out of the question and the host reads three answers to the opponents.

After the question round is completed, the &quot;big board&quot; round begins, with the contestants using their accumulated spins in an attempt to win cash and prizes. The game board consists of 18 spaces laid out in a rectangular loop that is six spaces wide and five high. Each space cycles through two or more items, which can include cash amounts (sometimes with an extra spin), prizes, spaces which offer a change in direction or alteration to score, and the show&#x27;s mascot, a mischievous red cartoon creature known as the Whammy. A light flashes randomly around the board, marking one space at a time, and the contestant in control uses a spin by hitting their buzzer to freeze the board and collect whatever is lit at that moment. Landing on a cash or prize space adds its value to the contestant&#x27;s total, while landing on a Whammy resets the total to zero and plays a short animation involving the Whammy for the viewing audience. Any contestant who lands on the Whammy a total of four times (known as &quot;Whammying out&quot;) is immediately eliminated from the game and forfeits all remaining spins. When a prize is hit, a new one is put on the board to replace it.

Specialty spaces on the board include:

* Big Bucks: awards the highest cash amount on the board at the time to the contestant
* Pick a Corner: appears in one corner of the board and allows the contestant to choose one of the items in the other three
* Add a One: adds enough cash to place a one next to the contestant&#x27;s score as its new leftmost digit (e.g., $500 becoming $1,500)
* Double Your Money + One Spin: adds enough cash to double the contestant&#x27;s entire score and awards an extra spin
* Money or Lose a Whammy: contestant can either take the displayed cash amount or remove a previously hit Whammy, if any
* Take the Lead + One Spin: awards an extra spin, and adds enough cash to move the contestant into the lead by $1 if they are trailing (2019 revival only)
* The Big 40: awards 40 of a mystery prize or cash amount (introduced in 2023 in conjunction with the series&#x27; 40th anniversary; changed to The Big 50 in 2024 to mark 50 episodes of the revival, awarding 50 prizes)

Except for Big Bucks, Money or Lose a Whammy, and Pick a Corner, all of these spaces are taken out of play after being hit once.

For the first &quot;big board&quot; round, initial control is awarded to the contestant who has earned the fewest spins in the question round (or is seated farthest away from the host in the event of a tie). If the contestant in control has any spins remaining after stopping the board, they may choose to either spin again or pass those spins to the opponent with the higher score (or the opponent of that contestant&#x27;s choice in the event of a tie). Passed spins must be played by their recipient, but are converted to earned spins in the event of hitting a Whammy. Play during the &quot;big board&quot; round ends when all accumulated spins have been exhausted or forfeited.

The second half of the game also consists of a question round followed by a &quot;big board&quot; round. Initial control for the latter is given to the contestant with the lowest score, and the cash and prize values are higher than in the first round. Once all spins have been exhausted, the contestant with the highest score becomes the champion and keeps everything they have accumulated, while the other two receive parting gifts. The 1983 version of the program allowed the champion to return for the next day&#x27;s episode; champions retired after reaching/exceeding CBS&#x27;s winnings limit (originally $25,000, later raised to $50,000) or appearing on five consecutive episodes, whichever came first. The 2019 version does not feature returning champions, but allows the day&#x27;s champion to play a bonus game.

If two contestants Whammy out and the third one has any spins remaining, that contestant may play one spin at a time and stop at any point if desired. The game ends when the remaining contestant uses up all spins, chooses to stop voluntarily, or hits a fourth Whammy.

===Bonus game===
The 2019 revival features a bonus game not present in the original, in which the day&#x27;s champion plays the &quot;big board&quot; for a chance to win up to $1,000,000. The champion plays through five rounds, taking a set number of spins in each round: five in the first, four in the second, and three in all others. The board displays cash, prizes, directional/specialty spaces, and Whammys as in the main game, and cash/prize values increase from one round to the next. Some prizes are tailored to the champion&#x27;s particular interests. Landing on a Whammy eliminates all winnings within the bonus round, but main-game winnings are not affected. If the champion ends a round with a bank total greater than zero, they may either end the bonus game at that point and keep all winnings, or continue into the next round with any personalized prizes lost to a Whammy being returned to the board. The game ends immediately upon collecting a fourth Whammy. The champion wins the entire bank for completing all rounds; however, if the bank reaches or exceeds $500,000 at any point, the game ends and cash is added to increase the bank to $1,000,000. Beginning in Season 4, a &quot;Prize-a-Palooza&quot; space appears on the board during the final round, awarding every currently displayed prize if hit.

==History==

&quot;Press Your Luck&quot; is a revival of an earlier game show format created by producer Bill Carruthers, known as &quot;Second Chance&quot;. This show was hosted by Jim Peck and aired on ABC in 1977. Like &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, it also featured contestants answering trivia questions to assume control of a randomly generated board with cash and prizes. This game board also featured spaces labeled with a devil, who would take away all cash and prizes if the contestant landed on one. Carruthers and Jan McCormack began developing &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in 1983.

Peter Tomarken, prior to working in television, was an editor for &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; magazine. His first major television role came earlier in 1983 on the NBC game show &quot;Hit Man&quot;, and he was chosen to host &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; after the former was canceled. &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; began both tapings and airings in September 1983. The show premiered on September 19, 1983, on CBS at 10:30a.m. ET (9:30 CT/MT/PT), replacing &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;. Serving as announcer on the show was Rod Roddy, with whom Tomarken had previously worked on &quot;Hit Man&quot;, and who later became known for announcing on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. John Harlan and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell filled in on a few episodes when Roddy was unavailable. In addition to creating the show, Carruthers served as both director and the voice of the Whammy. The animations featuring this character were created by animator Savage Steve Holland; Carruthers personally selected Holland to design the character, and immediately liked Holland&#x27;s first concept, which he sketched out on a napkin. Holland animated the character via computer software, thus making &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; one of the first game shows to use computer-designed graphics. Author David Baber noted that the Whammy animations were &quot;popular with the viewers&quot;. Some of the animations featured the Whammy taunting the contestant and becoming injured or harmed in a manner which Baber compared to a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. Others featured satires of then-contemporary pop culture figures such as Boy George or Tina Turner. Ed Flesh designed the show&#x27;s set, and Lee Ringuette composed the show&#x27;s music.

On January 6, 1986, CBS moved &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; to a different timeslot in order to make room for a Bob Eubanks-hosted revival of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; replaced &quot;Body Language&quot; in the network&#x27;s 4:00p.m. afternoon time slot. Tomarken stated that by the end of 1985, the contract for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; was up for renewal, but CBS was unable to pay Mark Goodson Productions the kind of money they wanted to continue that show on their network. Goodson came up with the solution of taking over the 10:30a.m. timeslot. The last episode of the CBS version aired on September 26, 1986. The final tapings took place in August of that same year, when its cancellation was first announced. Following the cancellation, Tomarken went on to host other game shows including the syndicated show &quot;Wipeout&quot; in 1988-89, as well as a number of infomercials. He and his wife both died in 2006 when a private plane he was piloting crashed in Santa Monica Bay.

===Michael Larson===

&quot;Press Your Luck&quot; gained media attention in 1984 for the winnings of a contestant named Michael Larson. A self-described unemployed ice cream truck driver from Lebanon, Ohio, he applied to be on the show that year. By recording episodes at home on a videocassette recorder and playing them back frame-by-frame, Larson discovered that the presumed random patterns of the game board were not actually random and he was able to memorize the sequences. On the single game in which he appeared, an initially tentative Larson spun a Whammy on his very first turn, but then went 45 consecutive spins without hitting another one. The majority of his spins landed on the highest-valued spaces, which offered $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000, all with an extra spin. The game ran for so long that CBS aired the episode in two parts, on June 8 and 11, 1984. In the end, Larson earned a total of $110,237 in cash and prizes.

After an investigation, CBS executives concluded that Larson&#x27;s memorization of the board patterns did not constitute cheating and allowed him to keep his winnings. The board was then reprogrammed with over 30 new patterns to prevent subsequent contestants from duplicating his feat. In 1994, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine interviewed Larson and revealed the background of this episode including his decision to pass his remaining spins after he lost concentration and missed his target squares. The story was featured in a two-hour documentary on Game Show Network titled &quot;Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal&quot; in March 2003, which Tomarken hosted. In July 2010, Michael&#x27;s brother James, and his former wife at the time of winning, were interviewed for PRI&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot; for the episode &quot;Million Dollar Idea&quot;. His story was also featured on the first episode of Game Show Network&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Cover Story&quot; in 2018.

Paul Walter Hauser played Larson in the 2024 film &quot;The Luckiest Man in America&quot;.

===Rebroadcasts, syndication, and digital television networks===
In early 1987, 130 episodes of the show were packaged by Republic Pictures for off-network syndication to a handful of local stations. These episodes originally aired on CBS from February 25 to August 23, 1985, and were also the first to be shown on USA Network from September 14, 1987 to December 30, 1988. &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; remained on its schedule until October 13, 1995, when USA dropped its game show block altogether.

Game Show Network aired the show from September 2001 to March 2009, airing episodes from February 1984 to November 1985. Game Show Network resumed airing the show in 2012, airing episodes from the September 1983 premiere to February 1984. From 2014 to 2016, Game Show Network aired episodes 561 to 696, which originally ran from November 1985 to May 1986; after this, Game Show Network aired episodes from 1984 to February 1985 until the show was removed from Game Show Network&#x27;s schedule again in May 2017. From December 2017 to February 2018, Game Show Network aired episodes from 1984 as part of a Saturday night game show block. On July 2, 2018, reruns of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; started airing on GameTV in Canada.

===&quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot;===

On April 15, 2002, Game Show Network debuted a revival titled &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot; (sometimes abbreviated to just &quot;Whammy!&quot;), with Todd Newton as host and Gary Kroeger as announcer, although Tomarken hosted a pilot episode. This incarnation of the show featured similar gameplay to the original, and was described by Game Show Network executives as being a modern incarnation of the show. One feature unique to this revival was the addition of a &quot;Double Whammy&quot;, which would not only remove all cash and prizes accumulated by the contestant, but also subject the contestant to a physical stunt such as having objects drop from the ceiling. &quot;Whammy!&quot; aired in first-run from April 2002 to December 2003.

===2019 revival===

On February 21, 2019, a casting announcement was released by Fremantle for a new version of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, advertising opportunities for potential contestants to apply. ABC confirmed in early 2019 that the network was partnering with Fremantle to reboot the series, with pre-production on new hour-long episodes of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; and &quot;Card Sharks&quot; already underway and taping slated to begin sometime in the first portion of the year. John Quinn (a producer on &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;) is the executive producer. Actress Elizabeth Banks was selected to host. Neil Ross was the announcer and the voice of the Whammy for the first four seasons of the ABC version, with Chris Ahearn assuming both roles beginning in season five, while the Whammy animations featuring Ross continue to be used.

The series premiered on June 12, 2019 following an early premiere the day before. The first season featured eight weekly hour-long episodes. ABC confirmed in mid-2023 that, despite the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, the show&#x27;s fifth season would premiere in late 2023 as intended. A sixth season was announced in May 2024, which premiered on July 18.

==International versions==

Since its inception, &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; has also been adapted internationally. An Australian version, with Ian Turpie as host and John Deeks as announcer, aired on Seven Network from 1987 to 1988. Grundy Worldwide packaged this version, with Bill Mason as executive producer. A German version entitled &quot;Glück am Drücker&quot; (&quot;Good Luck on the Trigger&quot;) aired on RTLplus in 1992 with Al Munteanu as host. It had an animated vulture named &quot;Raffi&quot; steal cash and prizes from contestants instead of Whammys. Another remake, &quot;Drück Dein Glück&quot; (&quot;Push Your Luck&quot;), aired daily in 1999 on RTL II with Guido Kellerman as host; this show&#x27;s mascot was an animated shark. In the United Kingdom, an ITV version ran in the HTV West region, with Paul Coia as host. &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot; was also adapted in the Philippines as &quot;Whammy! Push Your Luck&quot; on GMA Network from 2007 to 2008. It was hosted by Paolo Bediones and Rufa Mae Quinto.

==Merchandise==
In 1988, GameTek released a home computer game of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; for IBM PC compatibles and the Commodore 64. Ludia Inc. (now part of RTL Group, which owns the show franchise) along with Ubisoft released an adaptation called &quot;Press Your Luck: 2010 Edition&quot; on October 27, 2009 for PC, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Nintendo DS, and Wii. Prior to this, on August 24, 2010, the game was released for the PlayStation 3 (via PSN) as part of the &quot;Game Show Party&quot; bundle pack (PS3 only) that also included &quot;Family Feud: 2010 Edition&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right: 2010 Edition&quot;, and on PlayStation 3&#x27;s PSN download service from August 24, 2010.

A video game adaption of the show titled &quot;Press Your Luck 2010 Edition&quot; was released in the U.S. on multiple home consoles and with a PC version. Actor Terry McGovern is the off-screen host. In January 2012, an app developed by former Fremantle subsidiary Ludia and based on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; debuted on Facebook. Ten contestants compete in a single-question round together, all answering the same multiple-choice questions. There are six questions in total, each worth between $500 and $1,000, or a Whammy. A correct answer earns the question&#x27;s value multiplied by the number of contestants who answered incorrectly or ran out of time (e.g., answering the $500 question correctly with three other contestants answering incorrectly earns $1,500). Bonus cash is given to the three contestants who answer the questions correctly in the shortest amount of time. Answering the Whammy question incorrectly causes the contestant to lose any money accumulated to that point. In September 2012, Ludia released &quot;Press Your Luck Slots&quot; on Facebook.

<text>Q is a character in the James Bond films and novelisations. Q is the head of Q Branch (later Q Division), the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Service charged with oversight of top secret field technologies.

Q (standing for quartermaster), like M, is a job title rather than a name. The use of letters as pseudonyms for senior officers in the British Secret Service was started by its first director, Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming (1859–1923), who signed himself with a C written in green ink.

Q has appeared in 22 of the 25 Eon Productions James Bond films, the exceptions being &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006) and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008). Q also featured in both non-Eon Bond films, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983). Between 1963 and 1999, Q was portrayed in the Eon films by Desmond Llewelyn until his death in late 1999. He was played in subsequent films first by John Cleese and then by Ben Whishaw.

==Novels==
The character Q never appears in the novels by the author Ian Fleming, where Q and the Q Branch are only mentioned; however, Q does appear in the novelisations by Christopher Wood as well as the later novels by John Gardner and Raymond Benson, who adopted Eon&#x27;s decision to combine the character with Major Boothroyd, the armourer from &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

In John Gardner&#x27;s novels, the post of Q is taken over by Ann Reilly (called Q&#x27;ute by her colleagues). She also forms a relationship with Bond. It is supposed that she held the post for a short while only, because Raymond Benson&#x27;s novels return Boothroyd to the post without explanation. Jeffrey Deaver&#x27;s &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; introduces the character Sanu Hirani, who is referred to as &#x27;Q&#x27; in that novel.

Charles Fraser-Smith is widely credited as the inspiration for Q due to the spy gadgets he built for the Special Operations Executive. These were called Q-devices, after the Royal Navy&#x27;s World War I Q-ships. In the Fleming novels there are frequent references to Q and Q Branch with phrases like &quot;see Q for any equipment you need&quot; (&quot;Casino Royale&quot;) and &quot;Q Branch would handle all of that&quot; (&quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;), with a reference to &quot;Q&#x27;s craftsmen&quot; in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;.

===Major Boothroyd===
In the sixth novel, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, the service armourer Major Boothroyd appears for the first time. Fleming named the character after Geoffrey Boothroyd, a firearms expert who lived in Glasgow, who had written to the novelist suggesting that Bond was not using the best firearms available.

===Ann Reilly===
Boothroyd is also referenced occasionally in the Bond novels of John Gardner, but the author preferred instead to focus on a new character, Ann Reilly, who is introduced in the first Gardner novel, &quot;Licence Renewed&quot;, and promptly dubbed &quot;Q&#x27;ute&quot; by Bond.

=== Kim Sherwood novels ===
Q is a quantum computer in the Double 00 Trilogy by Kim Sherwood. 

==Films==
Major Boothroyd appears in &quot;Dr. No&quot; and in the script of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Desmond Llewelyn stated that, although he was credited as playing &quot;Major Boothroyd&quot; in the latter film, his name as said by M was replaced with &quot;the equipment officer&quot;, as director Terence Young stated that Boothroyd was a different character.

Beginning in Guy Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and in each film thereafter Major Boothroyd is most often referred to as Q; however, in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) he is referred to once again as Major Boothroyd in dialogue.

In most films in which Q appears, he is restricted to a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; involvement, either based in London or in secret bases out in the field. Two notable exceptions in which Q becomes directly involved in Bond&#x27;s missions occur in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, in which Q actually participates in field work—including the final battle against the villain&#x27;s henchmen—and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; in which he joins Bond in the field after 007 goes rogue.

===Eon Productions===

====Peter Burton: 1962 (as &quot;Major Boothroyd&quot;)====
In the first film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, Boothroyd is played by Peter Burton in only one scene, in which he replaces Bond&#x27;s .25 ACP Beretta 418 (on-screen portrayed by a .32 Beretta 35) pistol with the signature .32 Walther PPK handgun. He is referred to by M as &quot;the armourer,&quot; and later as Major Boothroyd. Scheduling conflicts prevented Burton from reprising the role in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, although he made two later uncredited appearances in Bond films, first as an RAF officer in &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965) and later as a secret agent in the satirical &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

====Desmond Llewelyn: 1963–1999====
Beginning with &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, Desmond Llewelyn portrayed the character in every official film except &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; until his death in 1999. In the 1977 film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, as Q delivered the submersible Lotus, Major Anya Amasova / Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) greets Q as &quot;Major Boothroyd&quot;.

Starting with &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the notion that Bond and Q would have an often strained relationship with each other was introduced by Guy Hamilton; it continued in the series thereafter. While briefing Bond on the gadgets that he is going to use on his mission, Q often expresses irritation and impatience at Bond&#x27;s short attention span, often telling him to &quot;pay attention, 007&quot;, and Bond&#x27;s playful lack of respect for his equipment, telling the agent, &quot;I &quot;never&quot; joke about my work, 007&quot;. In &quot;Thunderball&quot;, Bond can be heard muttering &quot;Oh no&quot; when Q joins him in the Bahamas. A running gag appeared in later films where Q&#x27;s prized gadget would be destroyed in a mishap often caused by necessity or Bond&#x27;s recklessness – examples include the Glastron jet boat in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (Bond sends it over the Iguazu Falls to escape pursuit by Jaws), the Aston Martin Vantage in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (Bond is forced to prime its self-destruct device in order to evade the Czech police forces), and the BMW Z8 in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; – which is cut in half by a helicopter buzz-saw.

However, on occasion, Q has shown a warm and fatherly concern for 007&#x27;s welfare, such as at Bond&#x27;s wedding in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, when he assures Bond that he is available if Bond ever requires his help. Q has also assisted Bond in a more active role in his missions in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, remaining to aid Bond in person even after another ally is killed, and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; saw him travel to assist Bond while he is officially on leave from MI6 even after Bond has resigned from MI6 to pursue his own vendetta. He frequently refers to Bond as &quot;007&quot;, rather than by his name. In &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Q shares a joke with Bond for the first time, and in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; Bond is saddened at the prospect of Q&#x27;s impending retirement. Q signs off with &quot;Now pay attention, 007,&quot; and then offers some words of advice:
Q: &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to teach you two things: First, never let them see you bleed.&quot;
Bond: &quot;And the second?&quot;Q: &quot;Always have an escape plan.&quot; – before he is lowered out of view.
This was the final film appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the James Bond series, although he would revive the role once again as Q in a Heineken commercial, a TV cross-promotion for &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Llewelyn died in a car crash just weeks after the film&#x27;s release. Between films he also starred as Q in various commercials for a diversity of products and companies. These included Bond collectable merchandise, Hyundai motorcars, LG video recorders, Highland Superstores, Visa credit cards, and Reach electric toothbrushes, the latter of which featured Q briefing himself in the mirror.

Llewelyn also portrays Q in the Eon Productions-produced 1967 TV special &quot;Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond&quot;, as well as portraying Q in the documentary &quot;Highly Classified: The World of 007&quot;, which is included on the &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; Ultimate Edition DVD. Llewelyn&#x27;s likeness was also used to portray the Q character in 2005&#x27;s video game &quot;James Bond 007: From Russia with Love&quot;, though the voice of Q was portrayed by Phil Proctor. Llewelyn has appeared in more Bond films — seventeen — than any other actor to date.

==== John Cleese: 1999 (as &quot;R&quot;), 2002 (as Q) ====

In &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; an assistant to Q was introduced, played by John Cleese. His real name was never revealed, but he was initially credited as &quot;R&quot; in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, stemming from a joke in which Bond asks the elder Q, &quot;If you&#x27;re Q, does that make him R?&quot;

Between films, Cleese was still referred to as &quot;R&quot; in the video games &quot;007: The World is Not Enough&quot; (2000), &quot;007 Racing&quot; (2000) and &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; (2001). He was officially referred to as &quot;Q&quot; in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) following Llewelyn&#x27;s death in 1999. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;.

Much like his predecessor, R is a consummate professional who is frequently annoyed by Bond&#x27;s cavalier attitude. In &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, Bond at first refers to R as &quot;Quartermaster&quot; but, silently impressed by the gadgets he is given, calls him &quot;Q&quot; at the end of their meeting. (The &quot;Die Another Day&quot; DVD reveals that Bond initially saw R as an &#x27;interloper&#x27;, only awarding the proper title of &#x27;Q&#x27; after R has proven himself.)

According to an interview on the &quot;Die Another Day&quot; DVD, Pierce Brosnan was very glad to rename Cleese&#x27;s character &#x27;Q&#x27;, rather than &#x27;R&#x27;, because his native Irish accent made it difficult to pronounce &#x27;R&#x27; with a convincing English accent.

In the 007 video game, &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, Cleese&#x27;s Q has an assistant, Miss Nagai, portrayed by Misaki Ito.

====Ben Whishaw: 2012–present====

The character of Q did not appear in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; or its sequel, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008). Bond actor Daniel Craig expressed concern over the character&#x27;s absence, and expressed his hope that Q would return in &quot;Skyfall&quot;. In November 2011, it was announced that British actor Ben Whishaw had been cast in the role. Bond first meets Q in front of the painting &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot; at the National Gallery in London, where he at first expresses disbelief at the relative youth of his new quartermaster, but the two quickly earn each other&#x27;s respect. In &quot;Skyfall&quot;, Q&#x27;s gadgets were comparatively simple, consisting of a miniaturized radio and a gun coded to Bond&#x27;s palmprint so only Bond can fire it. When Bond appears disappointed, Q says, &quot;Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don&#x27;t really go in for that anymore,&quot; in reference to a miniature grenade featured in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Q is demonstrated to be highly knowledgeable on the subject of computer security to the point where he designed some of the most sophisticated security protocols in existence. As with Llewelyn&#x27;s Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond&#x27;s knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets – at the end of &quot;Skyfall&quot; the Aston Martin DB5 is burned out in the final showdown with Silva.

In &quot;Spectre&quot;, Q injects Bond with &quot;smart blood&quot; which will allow MI6 to track him at all times. He then shows off an Aston Martin DB10 to Bond only to disappoint him by revealing it was reassigned to 009. He provides Bond with a new watch, while hinting the alarm is &quot;rather loud&quot; (eventually revealed to be explosive in the film&#x27;s climax). He also oversees the restoration of Bond&#x27;s Aston Martin DB5 after the events of &quot;Skyfall&quot;. Bond asks Q to help him disappear during his downtime; despite initial reluctance, Q agrees and helps Bond. Bond later steals (and ultimately destroys) the DB10, much to Q&#x27;s dismay, although he still covers for him when M asks Q where Bond has gone. Similar to Q&#x27;s assistance to Bond in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, Q travels to Austria to help him in the field independent of MI6. While there, he outruns SPECTRE agents after a ring he eventually decodes, revealing the organisation&#x27;s existence. Q returns to London to assist Miss Moneypenny and M in foiling corrupt MI6 bureaucrat Max Denbeigh&#x27;s launch of the Nine Eyes intelligence network. At the end he provides Bond with his remodeled Aston Martin DB5.

In &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, it is implied that Q is gay when Bond and Moneypenny interrupt him preparing a romantic dinner for another man. He provides Bond and 00 agent Nomi with a watch that generates an electromagnetic pulse and a portable radar mapping device, and instructs them on how to operate the &quot;stealthy bird&quot;, a small submersible jet aircraft, before they infiltrate villain Lyutsifer Safin&#x27;s hideout. Q keeps in contact with Bond during the mission, and patches him through to his love interest Madeleine Swann after he decides to sacrifice himself. This was also the first and only instance where Q called Bond by his first name. Before he sacrificed himself, Q implored Bond to leave the island and called him James. Q later joins M, Moneypenny, Nomi, and Bill Tanner in a toast to Bond&#x27;s memory at the end of the film.

===Non-Eon films===

====Geoffrey Bayldon: 1967====
In the 1967 version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Q is portrayed by Geoffrey Bayldon, but instead of outfitting James Bond, he provides gadgets for Evelyn Tremble (who is portrayed by Peter Sellers). In the film, Q is assisted by Fordyce (John Wells). The sequence parodies the regular series&#x27; outfitting, and features Q presenting Tremble with an elaborate bullet-proof vest, laden with preposterous features (&quot;a Beretta in the buttonhole, and a cute little mini-gun in the gusset&quot;).

====Alec McCowen: 1983====
In the 1983 film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, Bond received his gadgets from a man (played by Alec McCowen) he referred as Algernon and Algy. His opening line is &quot;Nice to know old Q can still surprise you 00s&quot;. In sharp contrast to the personality of Q in EON film series, Algy hopes to hear about &quot;Lots of sex and violence&quot; from James Bond following his mission. In the closing credits, he is named as &quot;Q&quot; Algy. Q Branch itself is depicted as underfunded and ramshackle compared to the high-tech surroundings of the Eon films.

==Legacy==
The real MI6&#x27;s head of technology is one of the agency&#x27;s four directors-general, reporting directly to Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. While the Chief of SIS is called &quot;C&quot; and not &quot;M&quot;, the head of technology is named &quot;Q&quot; after the Bond character, and the department&#x27;s ethos is known as &quot;Q culture&quot;.

<text>Stigmergy ( ) is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent. Agents that respond to traces in the environment receive positive fitness benefits, reinforcing the likelihood of these behaviors becoming fixed within a population over time.

Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who may lack memory or individual awareness of each other.

==History==
The term &quot;stigmergy&quot; was introduced by French biologist Pierre-Paul Grassé in 1959 to refer to termite behavior. He defined it as: &quot;Stimulation of workers by the performance they have achieved.&quot; It is derived from the Greek words &quot;stigma&quot; &quot;mark, sign&quot; and &quot;ergon&quot; &quot;work, action&quot;, and captures the notion that an agent’s actions leave signs in the environment, signs that it and other agents sense and that determine and incite their subsequent actions.

Later on, a distinction was made between the stigmergic phenomenon, which is specific to the guidance of additional work, and the more general, non-work specific incitation, for which the term &quot;sematectonic&quot; communication was coined by E. O. Wilson, from the Greek words &quot;sema&quot; &quot;sign, token&quot;, and &quot;tecton&quot; &quot;craftsman, builder&quot;: &quot;There is a need for a more general, somewhat less clumsy expression to denote the evocation of any form of behavior or physiological change by the evidences of work performed by other animals, including the special case of the guidance of additional work.&quot;

Stigmergy is now one of the key concepts in the field of swarm intelligence.

==Stigmergic behavior in non-human organisms==
Stigmergy was first observed in social insects. For example, ants exchange information by laying down pheromones (the trace) on their way back to the nest when they have found food. In that way, they collectively develop a complex network of trails, connecting the nest in an efficient way to various food sources. When ants come out of the nest searching for food, they are stimulated by the pheromone to follow the trail towards the food source. The network of trails functions as a shared external memory for the ant colony.

In computer science, this general method has been applied in a variety of techniques called ant colony optimization, which search for solutions to complex problems by depositing &quot;virtual pheromones&quot; along paths that appear promising. In the field of artificial neural networks, stigmergy can be used as a computational memory. Federico Galatolo showed that a stigmergic memory can achieve the same performances of more complex and well established neural networks architectures like LSTM.

Other eusocial creatures, such as termites, use pheromones to build their complex nests by following a simple decentralized rule set. Each insect scoops up a &#x27;mudball&#x27; or similar material from its environment, infuses the ball with pheromones, and deposits it on the ground, initially in a random spot. However, termites are attracted to their nestmates&#x27; pheromones and are therefore more likely to drop their own mudballs on top of their neighbors&#x27;. The larger the heap of mud becomes, the more attractive it is, and therefore the more mud will be added to it (positive feedback). Over time this leads to the construction of pillars, arches, tunnels and chambers.

Stigmergy has been observed in bacteria, various species of which differentiate into distinct cell types and which participate in group behaviors that are guided by sophisticated temporal and spatial control systems. Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the myxobacteria. Myxobacteria travel in &quot;swarms&quot; containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Most myxobacteria are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into &quot;fruiting bodies&quot;, within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls. The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the cellular slime molds. The best known of the myxobacteria, &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; and &quot;Stigmatella aurantiaca&quot;, are studied in various laboratories as prokaryotic models of development.

==Analysis of human behavior==
Stigmergy studied in eusocial creatures and physical systems, has been proposed as a model of analyzing some robotics systems, multi-agent systems, communication in computer networks, and online communities.

On the Internet there are many collective projects where users interact only by modifying local parts of their shared virtual environment. Wikipedia is an example of this. The massive structure of information available in a wiki, or an open source software project such as the FreeBSD kernel could be compared to a termite nest; one initial user leaves a seed of an idea (a mudball) which attracts other users who then build upon and modify this initial concept, eventually constructing an elaborate structure of connected thoughts.

In addition the concept of stigmergy has also been used to describe how cooperative work such as building design may be integrated. Designing a large contemporary building involves a large and diverse network of actors (e.g. architects, building engineers, static engineers, building services engineers). Their distributed activities may be partly integrated through practices of stigmergy.

===Analysis of human social movements===
The rise of open source software in the 21st century has disrupted the business models of some proprietary software providers, and open content projects like Wikipedia have threatened the business models of companies like &quot;Britannica&quot;. Researchers have studied collaborative open source projects, arguing they provide insights into the emergence of large-scale peer production and the growth of gift economy.

===Stigmergic society===
Heather Marsh, associated with the Occupy Movement, Wikileaks, and Anonymous, has proposed a new social system where competition as a driving force would be replaced with a more collaborative society. This proposed society would not use representative democracy but new forms of idea and action based governance and collaborative methods including stigmergy. &quot;With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project.&quot;

Some at the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement in 2014 were quoted recommending stigmergy as a way forward.

<text>Muhammad Abd-al-Rahman Barker (born Phillip Barker; November 3, 1929 – March 16, 2012) was an American linguist who was professor of Urdu and South Asian Studies and created one of the first roleplaying games, &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot;. He wrote several fantasy/science fantasy novels based in his associated world setting of Tékumel.

Between 1990 and 2002, he was a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the &quot;Journal of Historical Review&quot;, which advocated Holocaust denial. In 1991 he published a neo-Nazi novel, &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot;, under the pseudonym Randolph D. Calverhall.

==Early life==
Born in Spokane, Washington, descended from ancestors who had originally settled in America in 1626, Barker&#x27;s childhood was spent around Washington and Idaho. As a youth he had an interest in &quot;fairy stories, history and literature&quot; which would be further influenced by such films as &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;; all of this helped to turn his casual &quot;wargames&quot; with toy soldiers more towards fantasy. From this, his fictional lands of Tsolyanu and others, in what was later to become Tékumel, emerged and were embellished further in middle and high school years during which time he commenced construction of armies of hand-carved figures to represent his creations. Also at an early age, Barker&#x27;s interest in languages was piqued by neighboring children of Basque origin who were able to exclude others from their secret conversations in their native tongue.

==Academic life and creative networking==
In, and just before, 1950, while Barker was studying at the University of Washington under Melville Jacobs, he became involved with science fiction fanzines, writing articles, short stories and contributing reviews to Portland-based &quot;Fanscient&quot; and to the local clubzine &quot;Sinisterra&quot;, the latter of which contained his review of, and content from, Jack Vance relating to his recently published book, &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;. Also at this time, Barker corresponded with other authors who contributed to those same publications, including Lin Carter in whose writings and linguistic experiments he took an interest and with whom he finally put to paper the story line of his own created world.

He graduated from the University of Washington in 1951. That year, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study the languages of India, and on his first trip to India, converted to Islam. Gary Fine wrote that Barker would attribute his conversion to &quot;purely theological reasons [and that] it seemed like a more logical religion&quot;, though Barker himself admitted at the time to an &quot;[unimaginable] feeling of awe and religious ecstasy&quot; upon hearing the recitations of the 99 Names of Allah at the Taj Mahal.

==Later academic studies and career==
Barker attended the University of California, Berkeley for graduate studies, writing a dissertation on Klamath language, collecting traditional myths, legends, tales, and oral histories and later publishing a grammar and dictionary on the language.

He taught at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University from around 1958/59 until 1972 and became active in the development of Urdu and Baluchi instruction materials for English-speaking students following a period of two years from 1960 when he was attached to the University of the Punjab. Some of these were still recommended university course study materials as of 2010. From 1972 he moved to teach at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where he chaired the Department of South Asian studies until his retirement in the early 1990s; a few years after, the department was disbanded due to reduced funding.

==Tékumel==
While at Berkeley, Barker had not set aside his world creation project. Indeed, despite stepping back from an active role in science fiction fandom, he had commenced &quot;proto-gaming&quot; with a group of like-minded science fiction fans including fellow linguist Bill Shipley and Victor Golla, producing elaborate documents to support the exploration of that shared world.

Having watched the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games started by Mike Mornard, one of the original testers for D&amp;D, when Mornard moved to Minneapolis from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, Barker resolved to create his own ruleset based on his own created world and the game mechanics from D&amp;D. After six weeks, this was self-published in August 1974 as &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; and play commenced forthwith, including such occasional members as Dave Arneson – who singled out Barker and Tékumel as being his favorite Dungeon Master and roleplaying game, respectively – from early days.

Once Gary Gygax&#x27;s attention had been drawn to Barker&#x27;s work, it was decided that TSR would publish a revised version of the game mechanics along with a condensed version of his campaign setting. &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; was published by TSR in August 1975 for Gen Con VIII, making it the third role-playing game from TSR. In a December 1976 editorial for &quot;The Dragon&quot; magazine, editor Tim Kask drew comparisons between the world of Tékumel and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth not in terms of literature created, nor that his work was derivative of Tolkien&#x27;s, but rather regarding the in-depth detail in the setting, mythos and linguistic backgrounds and concluded that &quot;In terms of development of detail, I think EPT [Empire of the Petal Throne] has it over Middle Earth in the matters that most concern gamers&quot; since it had been developed by a &quot;wargamer&quot;, whereas Tolkien had no such background and having died prior to the release of D&amp;D was thus unable to address this new pastime personally.

Barker disliked the limited support TSR gave to the setting, and after 1977 he took his Tékumel setting back from TSR and ultimately brought it from one publisher to another: Imperium Publishing (1978), Adventure Games (1981), Gamescience (1983–1984), Tékumel Games (1983–1986), Different Worlds Publications (1987–1988), TOME (1991–1994), Tita&#x27;s House of Games (1997–2002), Zottola Publishing (2002–2003), and Guardians of Order (2005). Barker had a personal friendship with Dave Arneson, which led to Arnesons&#x27;s company Adventures Games releasing several books for Tékumel, such as army lists, maps and reference material. DAW published the novel &quot;The Man of Gold&quot; (July 1984) by Barker, which took place in Tékumel. His second novel, &quot;Flamesong&quot; (1985), was also published by DAW.

Despite having had a head start on other in-depth campaign settings and seeing his game released no less than four times with various supplements and magazine articles, many of which he contributed to, and having authored five books using the same setting, Barker&#x27;s Tékumel in both roleplaying and literary domains is still well known to only a relatively small audience, leading German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 2009 to publish an article on Barker&#x27;s life entitled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The forgotten Tolkien&quot;). The article quotes friends and acquaintances who posit that this may be, at least in part, due to the unfamiliarity of the setting compared with Western society, echoing Fine&#x27;s observations from 1983, and possibly even that Tékumel was released to the gaming world too early on, when players had only just started to experiment with their own invented worlds rather than fitting their play into preconfigured, non-literary domains with novel backgrounds.

In 2008, Barker founded the Tékumel Foundation along with many of his long-time players &quot;to support and protect the literary works and all related products and activities surrounding [his] world of Tékumel and the Empire of the Petal Throne.&quot; The Foundation acts as his literary executor.

==&quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot; and Holocaust denial==
Barker wrote a sixth novel, &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot;, under the pseudonym Randolph D. Calverhall. Randolph D. Calverhall is an allusion to one of Barker&#x27;s ancestors, and the book is attributed to him in a library catalog. &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot; is a science fiction story, presenting an alternate history in which SS soldiers begin an underground resistance after the end of World War II. A hundred years later, their descendants take over the United States of America. The book&#x27;s protagonist becomes the and worldwide dictator of the Fourth Reich. The book espouses the belief in an international Jewish conspiracy, suggests the solution to the &quot;Jewish question&quot; is genocide, and extensively quotes &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The novel was published in 1991 by National Vanguard Books, the book publishing division of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance, which published white supremacist and neo-Nazi material including &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. 

Between 1990 and 2002, Barker also served as a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the &quot;Journal of Historical Review&quot;, a journal that advocates Holocaust denial and revisionist pseudohistory. In March 2022, the Tékumel Foundation confirmed Barker&#x27;s authorship of &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot; and association with the &quot;Journal of Historical Review&quot;. The Foundation repudiated Barker&#x27;s views in the novel, from which it does not receive royalties, and apologized for not acknowledging its authorship earlier.

==Death==

Barker died in home hospice on March 16, 2012. He was survived by his wife, Ambereen.

<doc id="60917" wikidata="Q3258772" url="?curid=60917" title="Lola Ridge">
<text>Lola Ridge (born Rose Emily Ridge; 12 December 1873 – 19 May 1941) was an Irish-born New Zealand-American anarchist and modernist poet, and an influential editor of avant-garde, feminist, and Marxist publications. She is best known for her long poems and poetic sequences, published in numerous magazines and collected in five books of poetry.

Along with other political poets of the early Modernist period, Ridge has received renewed critical attention since the late 20th century and has been lauded by contemporary poets for her choice and ability to write about urban spaces in her poems. A selection of her poetry was published in 2007, and a biography, &quot;Anything That Burns You: A Portrait of Lola Ridge, Radical Poet&quot; (by Terese Svoboda) was published in 2016.

==Early life==

Rose Emily Ridge was born in 1873 in Dublin, Ireland, to Emma Ridge (née Reilly) and Joseph Henry. She was her parents&#x27; only surviving child. John Henry died when Ridge was three-years-old, and Ridge and her mother subsequently emigrated to Hokitika, New Zealand, when she was six-years-old. In 1895, she married Peter Webster, the manager of a Hokitika gold mine. In 1903 she left Webster and moved to Sydney, Australia with their three-year-old son Keith to attend Trinity College and study painting at the Sydney Art School with Julian Ashton.

After her mother died, Ridge emigrated to the United States in 1907 and reinvented herself as Lola Ridge, a poet and painter. She settled in San Francisco and published in &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. Ridge placed her son in a Californian orphanage and moved to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. Working as a model for artists, in a factory and as a poet and illustrator, she became involved in working class politics and protests, and worked with Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger. Her first book of poetry was published in 1918. On 22 October 1919, Ridge married David Lawson, a fellow radical.

==Literary career==
Ridge sent a collection of her poems entitled &quot;Verses&quot; (1905) inspired by her childhood in Hokitika to A.G. Stephens at the &quot;Sydney Bulletin,&quot; but he declined to publish the collection. In 1918, Ridge gained considerable notice with her long poem, &quot;The Ghetto&quot;, first published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. It was included in her first book, &quot;The Ghetto and Other Poems,&quot; published that year. The title poem portrays the Jewish immigrant community of Hester Street in the Lower East Side of New York, where Ridge lived for a time. It explores the effects of capitalism, gender, and generational conflict in ways that bear comparison to the works of Charles Reznikoff. In addition, Ridge gave an empathetic portrayal of America&#x27;s urban masses and immigrant communities. The book was a critical success.

This recognition led to opportunities for Ridge; she became involved with and edited new &quot;avant-garde&quot; magazines such as &quot;&quot; in 1919, and &quot;Broom,&quot; founded in 1921 by Harold Loeb, for which she was the American editor from 1922 to 1923, while he published in Rome. While working with Loeb, she had an apartment next to the basement office of &quot;Broom&quot; in the townhouse of his estranged wife Marjorie Content. As part of her work at &quot;Others&quot;, Ridge gave a lecture tour in 1919 on &quot;Women and the Creative Will,&quot; arguing that traditional gender roles were a form of patriarchal control used to suppress female creativity.

Ridge published 61 poems from 1908 to 1937 in such leading magazines as &quot;Poetry,&quot; &quot;New Republic,&quot; &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot; and &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. She was a contributing editor to &quot;The New Masses.&quot;

She wrote and published four more books of poetry through 1935, and single poems into 1937. Her collections include &quot;The Ghetto, and Other Poems&quot; (1918), &quot;Sun-up, and Other Poems&quot; (1920), &quot;Red Flag&quot; (1927), &quot;Firehead&quot; (1930), and &quot;Dance of Fire&quot; (1935). Her work was also collected in anthologies. Her third book, &quot;Red Flag&quot; (1927) collected much of her political poetry.

In 1929, Ridge was accepted for a residency at the writers colony of Yaddo. That year she published &quot;Firehead&quot;, a long poem that was a radical retelling of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. It and her last book, published in 1935 were more philosophical compared to her earlier work.

She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. She received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America in 1934 and 1935. Publishing until 1937, she died in 1941 of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Ridge did not join any political party, but was active in radical causes. She protested against the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927, and was among those arrested that day. In the 1930s, she supported the defence of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings, who had been framed for a 1916 bombing at the Preparedness Day Parade in San Francisco.

Her actions during the demonstration in front of the prison on the day Sacco and Vanzetti were executed were described by Katherine Anne Porter in her long essay, &quot;The Never Ending Wrong.&quot; She wrote, &quot;One tall, thin figure of a woman stepped out alone, a good distance into the empty square, and when the police came down at her and the horse&#x27;s hoofs beat over her head, she did not move, but stood with her shoulders slightly bowed, entirely still. The charge was repeated again and again, but she was not to be driven away. A man near me said in horror, suddenly recognizing her, &#x27;That&#x27;s Lola Ridge!&#x27; and dashed into the empty space toward her. Without any words or a moment&#x27;s pause, he simply seized her by the shoulders and walked her in front of him back to the edge of the crowd, where she stood as if she were half-conscious. I came near her and said, &#x27;Oh no, don&#x27;t let them hurt you! They&#x27;ve done enough damage already.&#x27; And she said, &#x27;This is the beginning of the end – we have lost something we shan&#x27;t find again.&#x27; I remember her bitter hot breath and her deathlike face.&quot;

Peter Quartermain described her in the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot; as &quot;the nearest prototype in her time of the proletarian poet of class conflict, voicing social protest or revolutionary idealism.&quot;

==Renewed scholarly interest==
With renewed scholarly interest in Ridge&#x27;s work since the late 20th century, selections from her first three books of poetry were published posthumously as, &quot;Light in Hand: Selected Early Poems&quot; (2007), edited and with an introduction by Daniel Tobin. Tobin notes that Ridge was, &quot;part of the confluence of politics, culture and the burgeoning of women&#x27;s voices at the advent of modernism to the start of World War II.&quot; Furthermore, Tobin highlights the importance of Ridge&#x27;s depiction of urban settings in contrast to other modernist writers like Ezra Pound or T.S. Eliot. For Ridge, the modern city becomes a &quot;community shaped by ritual and mutual need rather than an exposé of modern angst and alienation and dissipation.&quot;

Robert Pinsky, former Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote that contemporary readers need, &quot;to appreciate the magnitude and freshness of her enterprise: to make poetry out of the actual city.&quot; Pinsky likens Ridge to 18th-century British poet William Blake in her ability to express the perspective of children, evoking, &quot;innocence and experience in a way that blurs the ambiguous boundary between them.&quot; Pinsky also notes that Ridge preceded American Hart Crane, known for his long poem &quot;The Bridge&quot; about the Brooklyn Bridge, in her assigning &quot;ecstatic, high language of the past, especially of the Elizabethans, to the squalid and the sublime realities of the actual, 20th-century American city.&quot;

==Quotation==
:My doll Janie has no waist
:and her body is like a tub with feet on it.
:Sometimes I beat her
:but I always kiss her afterwards.
:When I have kissed all the paint off her body
:I shall tie a ribbon about it
:so she shan&#x27;t look shabby.
:But it must be blue –
:it mustn&#x27;t be pink –
:pink shows the dirt on her face
:that won&#x27;t wash off.

:I beat Janie
:and beat her...
:but still she smiled...
:so I scratched her between the eyes with a pin.
:Now she doesn&#x27;t love me any more...
:she scowls... and scowls...
:though I&#x27;ve begged her to forgive me
:and poured sugar in the hole at the back of her head.

<text>The Scottish Football League (SFL; ) is a defunct league featuring professional and semi-professional football clubs mostly from Scotland. From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL was the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League.

The SFL was associated with a title sponsor from the 1985–86 season. As this sponsor changed over the years the league was known in turn as the Fine Fare League, B&amp;Q League, Bell&#x27;s Scottish Football League and finally as the Irn-Bru Scottish Football League. The SFL also organised two knock-out cup competitions, the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup.

==History==
===Formation===
Organised football in Scotland began in 1873 with the formation of the Scottish Football Association (SFA). During the next 15 years or so, clubs would play friendly matches, Scottish Cup ties and local cup (e.g. Glasgow Cup or East of Scotland Shield) ties. The Football League, initially containing clubs from the North West and Midlands of England, was formed in 1888. This had been done in response to the professionalisation of football in England in 1885, with the regular diet of league fixtures replacing the haphazard arrangement of friendlies. Many Scottish players, known as the Scotch Professors, moved to the English league clubs to receive the relatively high salaries on offer.

This prompted Scottish clubs into thinking about forming their own league. In March 1890, the secretary of Renton wrote to thirteen other clubs inviting them to discuss the organisation of a league. All of the clubs accepted the invitation, except Queen&#x27;s Park and Clyde. Amateur club Queen&#x27;s Park, who were the oldest organised club in Scotland and had played a key role in the development of football, were opposed to the league because it would lead to professionalism and eliminate many of the smaller clubs. These concerns were to prove well-founded, as six of the founder members would leave the league before 1900.

The Scottish Football League (SFL) was inaugurated on 30 April 1890. The first season of competition, 1890–91, commenced with 11 clubs because St Bernard&#x27;s were not elected. The eleven original clubs in membership were Abercorn, Cambuslang, Celtic, Cowlairs, Dumbarton, Heart of Midlothian, Rangers, Renton, St Mirren, Third Lanark and Vale of Leven. Renton were expelled after five games of the 1890–91 season for playing against St Bernard&#x27;s, who had been found guilty of concealed professionalism. Renton raised an action against the SFA in the Court of Session and won, which meant that their SFA and SFL memberships were restored.

In the 1890–91 season, Rangers and Dumbarton were level at the top of the league on 29 points. The teams drew 2–2 in a play-off match, but no further thought had been given to separating teams by another method and the championship was shared. Goal average was introduced for the 1921–22 season and replaced by goal difference for the 1971–72 season.

===Split into divisions===

The league proved to be highly successful, and in 1893, a second tier was formed by the inclusion of a number of clubs previously in the Scottish Football Alliance. Promotion was initially based on a ballot of clubs; automatic promotion was not introduced until 1922.

The onset of World War I saw Division Two but not Division One being suspended, not restarting again until 1921 when the Central Football League was absorbed as a new division with automatic promotion.

Note: in contemporary sources the divisions were often referred to as &#x27;First&#x27; and &#x27;Second&#x27; rather than &#x27;One&#x27; and &#x27;Two&#x27;; the latter format has been used throughout the site to avoid confusion with the league&#x27;s First and Second Division, each one tier lower than their predecessor, introduced in the 1970s (see below).

===Division Three===

In 1923, the League decided to introduce a third tier. The Western League was used as its backbone but the new set-up lasted only three years before it collapsed under heavy financial losses. From 1926 until 1946, the League reverted to two divisions with many of the third tier clubs joining the second iteration of Scottish Football Alliance.

Post-World War II reforms saw the League resume with three divisions, renamed &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; with the last section also including reserve sides. In 1947, league championship trophies were introduced for the first time for the top two divisions, until then only flags had been presented to the winners. The new trophies were engraved with the names of all previous winners. 

In 1949, the &#x27;C&#x27; Division was expanded to two sections – South-East (North-East from 1950) and South-West. The withdrawal of the reserves from &#x27;C&#x27; Division in 1955 saw a return to two divisions with the 5 first teams in Division C being given automatic promotion. There were then 18 clubs in Division A and 19 in Division B. In 1956 the divisions were renamed Division 1 and Division 2.

Clydebank were elected to Division Two as the 20th club in 1966, but following the demise of Third Lanark in 1967, Division Two kept operating with just 19 clubs; the situation would not be corrected until the next change of format, which happened in 1975.

This change of structure split the league into three divisions, Premier, First, and Second Divisions. This permitted more frequent fixtures between the top clubs; the expectation was that meant greater revenue for them, and it was hoped it would stimulate greater interest, at a time when attendance at league matches had dropped alarmingly. One year before the restructuring, a new club entered the league, Meadowbank Thistle (which would eventually become Livingston). This three-divisional structure of 38 clubs continued until 1994.

===Four-division period and SPL split===
After a couple of decades, in 1994 the league again reorganised (following an attempted &#x27;Super League&#x27; breakaway by the top clubs in 1992) with four divisions of 10 teams, as Highland League clubs Inverness Caledonian Thistle (a merger of two existing clubs in the city) and Ross County were elected to round out the league. At the same time, the SFL adopted the system of three points for a win. In 1998 the Premier Division clubs split from the league to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The remaining leagues, of ten clubs each, kept their names and the Premier Division was not reconstituted, leaving First, Second and Third Divisions. Part of the agreement was that the SPL would expand to 12 clubs in 2000. The SFL then took in two new members to replace the two clubs lost to the SPL; Highland League clubs Elgin City and Peterhead were admitted, increasing the total number of clubs in the Scottish football league system to 42.

From 2005, the SFL determined a promotion and relegation place between each division according to playoffs between four clubs. The playoffs were contested between the ninth placed (second bottom) club in the higher division and the second, third and fourth placed clubs in the lower division. It was therefore possible for a team finishing fourth in the Second Division or Third Division to be promoted, rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings. It was also possible for the ninth placed club to retain their position in the higher division.

In March 2007, a self-conducted review found the league to be three times more expensive to run than equivalent leagues in England, with a report stating the league structure was &quot;outdated&quot;: the report found that the Football Conference had four employees looking after 68 clubs, while the SFL had 14 people running leagues with just 30 clubs.

===Merger===
No clubs were relegated from the bottom end of the Scottish Football League, although there were changes of membership due to clubs going out of business. The Scottish Football Association were keen for a pyramid system to be instituted. SFL First Division clubs wanted to gain a greater share of the media revenue generated by the SPL. In 2013, both the SPL and SFL voted in favour of merging to form the new Scottish Professional Football League. The number of divisions and clubs in each division remained the same, but there were changes to the financial distribution model. The first club to be promoted to the SPFL from the new Lowland League via playoffs was Edinburgh City in 2016 at the expense of East Stirlingshire, while in 2019 Cove Rangers were the first Highland League champions to go up, replacing Berwick Rangers.

==Cup competitions==

The Scottish Football League organised two knock-out cup competitions: the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup. The League Cup was established in 1946, succeeding the wartime Southern League Cup. Unlike the Scottish Cup, organised by the Scottish Football Association, the League Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs. Scottish Premier League clubs continued to participate in the League Cup after the top tier clubs broke away in 1998. Until the mid-1990s, the competition winner was eligible to participate in the UEFA Cup, but this was discontinued due to a loss of European places.

The Scottish Challenge Cup was instituted in 1990, to celebrate the League&#x27;s centenary. The Challenge Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs outside the top division of the Scottish football league system. From 2011, two Highland Football League clubs were allowed to participate each year in the Challenge Cup, to give a round number of 32 clubs participating. Both the League Cup and the Challenge Cup continued under the auspices of the Scottish Professional Football League.

==League sponsorship and media rights==
From 1985, the League accepted sponsorships for its main competition. Below is a list of sponsors and the League&#x27;s name under their sponsorship:

*1985–1988: Fine Fare (Fine Fare League)
*1988–1992: B&amp;Q (B&amp;Q League)
*1992–1994: &quot;No sponsor&quot;
*1994–1998: Bell&#x27;s whisky (Bell&#x27;s League)
*1998–1999: &quot;No sponsor&quot;
*1999–2006: Bell&#x27;s whisky (Bell&#x27;s League)
*2006–2007: &quot;No sponsor&quot;
*2007–2013: Irn-Bru (Irn-Bru League)

The League&#x27;s cup competitions have had different sponsors, with the Scottish League Cup first attracting sponsorship in 1979. The competition was revamped in 1984, adopting a straight knock-out format, when Skol Lager began its sponsorship. The Co-operative Insurance company sponsored the League Cup for 12 seasons, until the 2010–11 competition. It has since been sponsored by the Scottish Government, under the name of the &quot;Scottish Communities League Cup&quot;. The Scottish Challenge Cup was created by League sponsor B&amp;Q in 1990, but it was cancelled in 1998–99 due to a lack of sponsorship. Since 2008, the Challenge Cup has attracted its own sponsor, with BBC Alba and Ramsdens providing support.

Before 1979, the major source of revenue to Scottish Football League clubs, apart from their attendances, was from the football pools. In the year ended 31 March 1983, the pools generated £1.08 million out of a total of £1.46 million. By 1990, this source of income had been overtaken by revenue from sponsorships and television rights. As of 1990, 75% of these central revenues were split equally between the 38 member clubs, with the remaining 25% allocated according to each club&#x27;s position in the league ladder. During the 1970s and 1980s, the main terrestrial television companies (STV and BBC Scotland) produced shows (&quot;Scotsport&quot; and &quot;Sportscene&quot; respectively) containing highlights of league matches. The revenues from these broadcasts were relatively small, with the companies paying less than £1000 per match in the mid-1970s. BBC Radio Scotland had exclusive rights for live radio coverage of matches at this time, with independent stations such as Radio Clyde providing coverage via score updates and analysis.

The first live television broadcast of a Scottish league match was not until April 1986. Earlier in the 1985–86 season, there had been no television coverage at all due to a dispute between the League and the broadcasters. The birth of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting (Sky TV) changed the situation significantly. As ITV had an exclusive contract for live coverage of games in the English league, the first match shown on Sky was a Scottish Premier Division match between Rangers and Dundee United in April 1991. A year later, the top division English clubs formed a breakaway Premier League, signing an exclusive television contract with Sky. Live Scottish Premier Division games were shown on STV during the 1990s, but the top division clubs formed the breakaway Scottish Premier League in 1998 and signed an exclusive broadcast contract with Sky.

This left the remaining Scottish Football League clubs without live coverage, although STV continued to show highlights of First Division games in their &quot;Football First&quot; show. Scots Gaelic channel BBC Alba provided coverage of Scottish Football League games, including the Challenge Cup, from its launch in 2008. Live coverage on English language channels returned to Scottish Football League games in the 2012–13 season, as Sky and ESPN agreed contracts to show Third Division matches involving Rangers. These arrangements secured revenues that had been under threat due to the financial collapse of Rangers.

==Member clubs==

Of the original SFL clubs, Celtic, Heart of Midlothian, St Mirren and Dumbarton are the only clubs today playing in the successor Scottish Professional Football League. Every other club is either defunct or out of the League.

==Past winners==

When the Scottish Football League was established in 1890, all of the clubs played in just one division. In 1893 the Scottish Football League absorbed many clubs from the Scottish Football Alliance and had enough clubs to form another division. The existing division was renamed Division One and the new division was called Division Two. Nevertheless, promotion and relegation between the top two divisions was not automatic until 1921–22 when Division Two was brought back after a hiatus provoked by World War I which affected only that division; hence some teams of the era winning Division Two twice in a row before being promoted, and some Division Two winners being never promoted at all.

A third tier of Scottish league football was first established in the 1923–24 season, but it only lasted for two full seasons due to financial difficulties. A third tier league (called Division C) was reintroduced in 1946–47. Division C, which also included reserve teams of higher division clubs, operated as a national competition for the first three seasons but thereafter it was split into two regional sections. During this period only full-strength clubs (not reserve teams) were promoted if they finished as champions. The two-division tier was abolished after the 1954–55 season.

Since the 1975–76 season there has been a third tier, known as the Second Division. The top tier became the Premier Division and the second tier became known as the First Division. A fourth tier, known as the Third Division, was introduced in 1994. The last major change within the Scottish football league system was in 1998–99, when the Premier Division clubs broke away from the Scottish Football League to form the Scottish Premier League. The remaining Scottish Football League divisions continued as before.

==Scottish Football League XI==

The SFL was the organising body of the Scottish Football League XI, a select side which represented the SFL in matches against other leagues, including the English Football League, the League of Ireland, the Northern Irish league and the Italian Serie A. These matches began in 1892, soon after the foundation of the SFL. Before the Second World War, inter-league matches were only second in importance to Scotland international matches. After the war, however, the inter-league matches became less important as European club football was instituted and clubs withdrew players due to fixture congestion. The last inter-league match was played in 1980, while a Scottish Football League XI was last selected in 1990 for a match against the Scotland national team to mark the centenary of the SFL.

<text>The University of London (UoL; abbreviated as Lond or more rarely Londin in post-nominals) is a federal public research university located in London, England, United Kingdom. The university was established by royal charter in 1836 as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London, King&#x27;s College London and &quot;other such institutions, corporate or unincorporated, as shall be established for the purpose of Education, whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom&quot;. It is one of three institutions to have advertised themselves as the third-oldest university in England. It moved to a federal structure with constituent colleges in 1900. It is now incorporated by its fourth (1863) royal charter and governed by the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii).

The university consists of 17 member institutions and three central academic bodies. The university has around 48,000 distance learning external students and around 219,410 campus-based internal students, making it the largest university by number of students in the United Kingdom. For most practical purposes, ranging from admissions to funding, the member institutions operate on an independent basis, with many awarding their own degrees whilst remaining in the federal university.

Under the 2018 act, member institutions ceased to be termed colleges and gained the right to seek university status without having to leave the federal university: Birkbeck, City, Goldsmiths, King&#x27;s College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, Royal Veterinary College, School of Oriental and African Studies, St George&#x27;s, and University College London have all indicated that they intend to do so.

As of 2015, there are around 2 million University of London alumni across the world, including at least 14 monarchs or royalty, more than 60 presidents or prime ministers in the world (including five prime ministers of the United Kingdom), two Cabinet Secretaries of the UK, 98 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medallists, four Turing Award winners, six Grammy winners, two Oscar winners, three Olympic gold medalists and the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; of several countries. The university owns the University of London Press.

==History==
===19th century===
University College London (UCL) was founded under the name &quot;London University&quot; (but without recognition by the state) in 1826 as a secular alternative to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which limited their degrees to members of the established Church of England. As a result of the controversy surrounding UCL&#x27;s establishment, King&#x27;s College London was founded as an Anglican college by royal charter in 1829.

In 1830, UCL applied for a royal charter as a university which would allow it to confer degrees. This was rejected, but renewed in 1834. In response to this, opposition to &quot;exclusive&quot; rights grew among the London medical schools. The idea of a general degree awarding body for the schools was discussed in the medical press and in evidence taken by the Select Committee on Medical Education. However, the blocking of a bill to open up Oxford and Cambridge degrees to dissenters led to renewed pressure on the Government to grant degree awarding powers to an institution that would not apply religious tests, particularly as the degrees of the new University of Durham were also to be closed to non-Anglicans.

In 1835, the government announced the response to UCL&#x27;s petition for a charter. Two charters would be issued, one to UCL incorporating it as a college rather than a university, without degree awarding powers, and a second &quot;establishing a Metropolitan University, with power to grant academical degrees to those who should study at the London University College, or at any similar institution which his Majesty might please hereafter to name&quot;.

Following the issuing of its charter on 28 November 1836, the new University of London started drawing up regulations for degrees in March 1837. The death of William IV in June, however, resulted in a problemthe charter had been granted &quot;during our Royal will and pleasure&quot;, meaning it was annulled by the king&#x27;s death. Queen Victoria issued a second charter on 5 December 1837, reincorporating the university. The university awarded its first degrees in 1839, all to students from UCL and King&#x27;s College.

The university established by the charters of 1836 and 1837 was essentially an examining board with the right to award degrees in arts, laws and medicine. However, the university did not have the authority to grant degrees in theology, considered the senior faculty in the other three English universities. In medicine, the university was given the right to determine which medical schools provided sufficient medical training. In arts and law, by contrast, it would examine students from UCL, King&#x27;s College, or any other institution granted a royal warrant, effectively giving the government control of which institutions could submit students for examination by the university. Beyond this right to submit students for examination, there was no other connection between the colleges and the university.

In 1849 the university held its first graduation ceremony at Somerset House following a petition to the senate from the graduates, who had previously received their degrees without any ceremony. About 250 students graduated at this ceremony. The London academic robes of this period were distinguished by their &quot;rich velvet facings&quot;.

The list of institutions whose students could enter University of London examinations grew rapidly by 1858, including all other British universities as well as more than 30 other schools and colleges outside of London. In that year, a new charter opened up the examinations to everyone, effectively abolishing the weak link between the university and the colleges. This led the Earl of Kimberley, a member of the university&#x27;s senate, to tell the House of Lords in 1888 &quot;that there were no Colleges affiliated to the University of London, though there were some many years ago&quot;. The reforms of 1858 also incorporated the graduates of the university into a convocation, similar to those of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, and authorised the granting of degrees in science, the first BSc being awarded in 1860.

The expanded role meant the university needed more space, particularly with the growing number of students at the provincial university colleges. Between 1867 and 1870 a new headquarters was built at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices.

In 1863, via a fourth charter, the university gained the right to grant degrees in surgery. This 1863 charter remains the authority under which the university is incorporated, although all its other provisions were abolished under the University of London Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 62).
In 1878, the university set another first when it became the first university in the UK to admit women to degrees, via the grant of a supplemental charter. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country.
In the late 19th century, the university came under criticism for merely serving as a centre for the administration of tests, and there were calls for a &quot;teaching university&quot; for London. UCL and KCL considered separating from the university to form a separate university, variously known as the Albert University, Gresham University and Westminster University. Following two royal commissions the (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 62) was passed, reforming the university and giving it a federal structure with responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions. This was implemented in 1900 with the approval of new statutes for the university.

===20th century===
The reforms initiated by the 1898 act came into force with the approval of the new federal statutes in 1900. Many of the colleges in London became schools of the university, including UCL, King&#x27;s College, Bedford College, Royal Holloway and the London School of Economics. Regent&#x27;s Park College, which had affiliated in 1841, became an official divinity school of the university in 1901 (the new statutes having given London the right to award degrees in theology) and Richmond (Theological) College followed as a divinity school of the university in 1902; Goldsmiths College joined in 1904; Imperial College was founded in 1907; Queen Mary College joined in 1915; the School of Oriental and African Studies was founded in 1916; and Birkbeck College, which was founded in 1823, joined in 1920.

The previous provision for colleges outside London was not abandoned on federation, instead London offered two routes to degrees: &quot;internal&quot; degrees offered by schools of the university and &quot;external&quot; degrees offered at other colleges (now the University of London flexible and distance learning programmes).

UCL and King&#x27;s College, whose campaign for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university&#x27;s reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL&#x27;s merger, under the University College London (Transfer) Act 1905 (5 Edw. 7. c. xci), happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL&#x27;s property became the University of London&#x27;s. King&#x27;s College followed in 1910 under the King&#x27;s College London (Transfer) Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. xxxix). This was a slightly more complicated case, as the theological department of the college (founded in 1846) did not merge into the university but maintained a separate legal existence under King&#x27;s College&#x27;s 1829 charter.
The expansion of the university&#x27;s role meant that the Burlington Garden premises were insufficient, and in March 1900 it moved to the Imperial Institute in South Kensington. However, its continued rapid expansion meant that it had outgrown its new premises by the 1920s, requiring yet another move. A large parcel of land in Bloomsbury near the British Museum was acquired from the Duke of Bedford and Charles Holden was appointed architect with the instruction to create a building &quot;not to suggest a passing fashion inappropriate to buildings which will house an institution of so permanent a character as a University.&quot; This unusual remit may have been inspired by the fact that William Beveridge, having just become director of LSE, upon asking a taxi driver to take him to the University of London was met with the response &quot;Oh, you mean the place near the Royal School of Needlework&quot;. Holden responded by designing Senate House, the current headquarters of the university, and at the time of completion the second largest building in London.
The University of London contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps (OTC) was formed in 1908 and had enrolled 950 students by autumn 1914. During the First World War, the OTC supplied 500 officers to the British Army between August 1914 and March 1915. Some 665 officers associated with the university died during the First World War and 245 officers in the Second World War. the London University Officers&#x27; Training Corps (UOTC), drawn from 52 universities and colleges in the London area (not just the University of London), was the largest UOTC in the country, with about 400 officer cadets. It has been based at Yeomanry House in Handel Street, London since 1992. In 2011, Canterbury Company was founded to recruit officer cadets from universities in Kent.

During the Second World War, the colleges of the university (with the exception of Birkbeck) and their students left London for safer parts of the UK, while Senate House was used by the Ministry of Information, with its roof becoming an observation point for the Royal Observer Corps. Though the building was hit by bombs several times, it emerged from the war largely unscathed; rumour at the time had it that the reason the building had fared so well was that Adolf Hitler had planned to use it as his headquarters in London.

The latter half of the last century was less eventful. In 1948, Athlone Press was founded as the publishing house for the university, and sold to the Bemrose Corporation in 1979, subsequent to which it was acquired by Continuum publishing. However, the post-WWII period was mostly characterised by expansion and consolidation within the university, such as the acquisition as a constituent body of the Jesuit theological institution Heythrop College on its move from Oxfordshire in 1969.`

The University of London Act 1978 (c. ii) saw the university defined as a federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation that would lead to a marked transference of academic and financial power in this period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King&#x27;s College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporated in 1977, while King&#x27;s College&#x27;s new charter in 1980 reunited the main body of the college with the corporation formed in 1829. In 1992 centralised graduation ceremonies at the Royal Albert Hall were replaced by individual ceremonies at the colleges. One of the largest shifts in power of this period came in 1993, when HEFCE (now the Office for Students, OfS) switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the university.

There was also a tendency in the late 20th century for smaller colleges to be amalgamated into larger &quot;super-colleges&quot;. Some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King&#x27;s College, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university, although no steps were taken to actually putting this into action until the early 21st century.

===21st century===

In 2002, Imperial College and UCL mooted the possibility of a merger, raising the question of the future of the University of London and the smaller colleges within it. Subsequently, considerable opposition from academic staff of both UCL and Imperial led to a rejection of the merger.

Despite this failure, the trend of decentralising power continued. A significant development in this process was the closing down of the Convocation of all the university&#x27;s alumni in October 2003; this recognised that individual college alumni associations were now increasingly the centre of focus for alumni. However, the university continued to grow even as it moved to a looser federation, and, in 2005, admitted the Central School of Speech and Drama.

On 9 December 2005, Imperial College became the second constituent body (after Regent&#x27;s Park College) to make a formal decision to leave the university. Its council announced that it was beginning negotiations to withdraw from the university in time for its own centenary celebrations, and in order to be able to award its own degrees. On 5 October 2006, the University of London accepted Imperial&#x27;s formal request to withdraw from it. Imperial became fully independent on 9 July 2007, as part of the celebrations of the college&#x27;s centenary.

The &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; announced in February 2007 that the London School of Economics, University College London and King&#x27;s College London all planned to start awarding their own degrees, rather than degrees from the federal University of London as they had done previously, from the start of the academic year starting in Autumn 2007. Although this plan to award their own degrees did not amount to a decision to leave the University of London, the &quot;THES&quot; suggested that this &quot;rais[ed] new doubts about the future of the federal University of London&quot;.

The School of Pharmacy, University of London, merged with UCL on 1 January 2012, becoming the UCL School of Pharmacy within the Faculty of Life Sciences. This was followed on 2 December 2014 by the Institute of Education also merging with UCL, becoming the UCL Institute of Education.

Since 2010, the university has been outsourcing support services such as cleaning and portering. This has prompted industrial action by the largely Latin American workforce under the &quot;3Cosas&quot; campaign (the 3Cosas – &quot;3 things&quot; – being sick pay, holiday pay, and pensions for outsourced workers on parity with staff employed directly by the university). The 3Cosas campaigners were members of the UNISON trade union. However, documents leaked in 2014 revealed that UNISON representatives tried to counter the 3Cosas campaign in meetings with university management. The 3Cosas workers subsequently transferred to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain.

Following good results in the Research Excellence Framework in December 2014, City University London said that they were exploring the possibility of joining the University of London. It was subsequently announced in July 2015 that City would join the University of London in August 2016. It will cease to be an independent university and become a college as &quot;City, University of London&quot;.

In 2016 reforms were proposed that would see the colleges become member institutions and be allowed to legally become universities in their own right. A bill to amend the university&#x27;s statutes was introduced into the House of Lords in late 2016. The bill was held up by procedural matters in the House of Commons, with MP Christopher Chope objecting to it receiving a second reading without debate and no time having been scheduled for such debate. Twelve of the colleges, including UCL and King&#x27;s, said that they would seek university status once the bill was passed. The bill was debated and passed its second reading on 16 October 2018. It received royal assent on 20 December 2018, becoming the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii) The twelve colleges (namely, all except The Courtauld, ICR, LBS, RAM and RCSSD) subsequently applied for university status, although stating they did not intend to change their names, with notice being given in the London Gazette on 4 February 2019.

In 2018, Heythrop College became the first major British higher education institution to close since the medieval University of Northampton in 1265. Its library of more than 250,000 volumes was moved to Senate House Library.

In 2019, the University of London Press, founded in 1910, was relaunched as a fully open-access publisher specializing in &quot;distinctive scholarship at the forefront of the Humanities&quot;.

==Campuses==

The university owns a considerable central London estate of 12 hectares of freehold land in Bloomsbury, near Russell Square tube station.

Some of the university&#x27;s colleges have their main buildings on the estate. The Bloomsbury Campus also contains eight Halls of Residence and Senate House, which houses Senate House Library, the chancellor&#x27;s official residence and previously housed the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, now part of University College London (UCL) and housed in its own new building. Almost all of the School of Advanced Study is housed in Senate House and neighbouring Stewart House.

The university also owns many of the squares that formed part of the Bedford Estate, including Gordon Square, Tavistock Square, Torrington Square and Woburn Square, as well as several properties outside Bloomsbury, with many of the university&#x27;s colleges and institutes occupying their own estates across London:
* Clare Market,
* The Aldwych, where the London School of Economics and Political Science and part of King&#x27;s College London are based
* The North and East Wings of Somerset House, the location for the Courtauld Institute of Art and King&#x27;s College London, respectively
* St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital,
* the University of London Boat Club in Chiswick, and
* The campus of Royal Holloway and Bedford New College including the historic Founder&#x27;s Building.

The university also has several properties outside London, including a number of residential and catering units further afield and the premises of the University of London Institute in Paris, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in French and historical studies.

==Organisation and administration==

The university&#x27;s board of trustees, the governing and executive body of the university, comprises eleven appointed independent persons – all of whom are non-executive; the vice-chancellor, the deputy vice chancellor and four heads of member institutions, appointed by the Collegiate Council.

The board of trustees is supported by the Collegiate Council, which comprises the heads of the member institutions of the university, the deputy vice-chancellor, the dean and chief executive of the School of Advanced Study, the chief executive of the University of London Worldwide and the Collegiate Council&#x27;s chair, the vice-chancellor.

===Chancellors===
The chancellors of the University of London since its founding are as follows:
* William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Burlington, 1836–1856
* Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, 1856–1891
* Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby, 1891–1893
* Farrer Herschell, 1st Baron Herschell, 1893–1899
* John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, 1899–1902
* Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, 1902–1929
* William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, 1929–1931
* Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, 1932–1955
* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, 1955–1981
* Princess Anne (The Princess Royal from 1987), 1981–present

==Member institutions==
For most practical purposes, ranging from admission of students to negotiating funding from the government, the 17 member institutions are treated as individual universities. Legally speaking they are known as &quot;Recognised Bodies&quot;, with the authority to examine students and award them degrees of the university. Some member institutions also have the power to award their own degrees instead of those of the university; those which exercise that power include:
* Birkbeck, University of London
* Brunel University of London
* City St George&#x27;s, University of London
* Goldsmiths, University of London
* King&#x27;s College London
* London Business School
* London School of Economics and Political Science
* London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine
* Queen Mary University of London
* Royal Academy of Music
* Royal Central School of Speech and Drama
* Royal Holloway, University of London
* Royal Veterinary College
* SOAS University of London
* University College London

Most decisions affecting the member institutions and institutes of the University of London are made at the level of the member institutions or institutes themselves. The University of London does retain its own decision-making structure, however, with the Collegiate Council and board of trustees, responsible for matters of academic policy. The Collegiate Council is made up of the heads of member institutions of the university.

The 12 institutes, or &quot;Listed Bodies&quot;, within the University of London offer courses leading to degrees that are both examined and awarded by the University of London. Additionally, twelve universities in England, several in Canada and many in other Commonwealth countries (notably in East Africa) began life as associate colleges of the university offering such degrees. By the 1970s, almost all of these colleges had achieved independence from the University of London. An increasing number of overseas and UK-based academic institutes offer courses to support students registered for the University of London flexible and distance learning diplomas and degrees and the Teaching Institutions Recognition Framework enables the recognition of these institutions.

===Member Institutions===

Under the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii), a member institution is defined as &quot;an educational, academic or research institution which is a constituent member of the University and has for the time being―(a) the status of a college under the statutes; or (b) the status of a university&quot;. As of February 2019, 12 of the colleges of the university have said they are seeking university status. This does not affect their status as member institution of the university or the degrees they award. The member institutions of the University of London (as of September 2018) are:
===Central academic bodies===

* University of London Worldwide
* University of London Institute in Paris, formerly known as the British Institute in Paris
* School of Advanced Study comprising the following institutes:
** the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies
** the Institute of Classical Studies
** the Institute of Commonwealth Studies
** the Institute of English Studies
** the Institute of Historical Research
** the Institute of Modern Languages Research
** the Institute of Philosophy
** the Warburg Institute

A number of major universities originated as university colleges teaching external degrees of the University of London. These include:
* Mason College, Birmingham, awarded a royal charter in 1900 as the University of Birmingham.
* Owen&#x27;s College Manchester, became part of the Victoria University in 1880, awarded a royal charter in 1903 as the Victoria University of Manchester.

* University College of North Wales, Bangor, joined the University of Wales in 1893 and became Bangor University in 2007.

A number of other colleges had degrees validated and awarded by the University of London.
* St Patrick&#x27;s, Carlow College, Ireland – from 1840 to 1892 students studied for primary degrees in Arts (BA) and Law (BLL).
* St Patrick&#x27;s College, Thurles, Ireland – from 1849 the University of London, allowed Thurles to offer degrees.

* Northwest College for Advanced Learning, India

===Colleges in special relation===

Between 1946 and 1970, the university entered into &#x27;schemes of special relation&#x27; with university colleges in the Commonwealth of Nations. These schemes encouraged the development of independent universities by offering a relationship with the University of London. University colleges in these countries were granted a royal charter. An academic board of the university college negotiated with the University of London over the entrance requirements for the admission of students, syllabuses, examination procedures and other academic matters. During the period of the special relationship, graduates of the colleges were awarded University of London degrees.

Some of the colleges which were in special relation are listed below, along with the year in which their special relation was established.
* 1946 – The University College of the West Indies, until 1961 (now the University of the West Indies)
* 1948 – University College of the Gold Coast (now University of Ghana)
* 1948 – University College, Ibadan, until 1967 (now the University of Ibadan)
* 1956 – University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now the University of Zimbabwe).
* 1961 – Royal College Nairobi (now the University of Nairobi).
* 1963 – University of East Africa (In 1970, it was split into three independent universities, which are now: University of Nairobi, Makerere University, and University of Dar es Salaam)

In 1970, the &#x27;Schemes of Special Relation&#x27; were phased out.

==Coat of arms==
The University of London received a grant of arms in April 1838. The arms depict a cross of St George upon which there is a Tudor rose surrounded by detailing and surmounted by a crown. Above all of this there is a blue field with an open book upon it.

The arms are described in the grant as:
==Academic dress==

The University of London had established a rudimentary code for academic dress by 1844. The university was the first to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours, an innovation that was subsequently followed by many other universities.

Colleges that award their own degrees have their own academic dress for those degrees.

==Student life==
In , approximately 5% of all UK students attended one of the University of London&#x27;s affiliated schools. Additionally, more than 50,000 students are part of University of London Worldwide.

The ULU building on Malet Street (close to Senate House) was home to the University of London Union, which acted as the student union for all University of London students alongside the individual college and institution unions. The building is now rebranded as &quot;Student Central, London&quot;, offering full membership to current University of London students, and associate membership to students at other universities, and other groups. The union previously owned &quot;London Student,&quot; the largest student newspaper in Europe, which now runs as a digital news organisation

===Sports, clubs and traditions===
Though most sports teams are organised at the college level, ULU ran several sports clubs of its own, some of which (for example the rowing team) compete in BUCS leagues. The union also organised leagues for college teams to participate in. These leagues and sports clubs are supported by Friends of University of London Sport which aims to promote them.

In addition to these, ULU catered for sports not covered by the individual colleges through clubs such as the University of London Union Lifesaving Club, which helps students gain awards and learn new skills in lifesaving as well as sending teams to compete throughout the country in the BULSCA league.

ULU also organised several societies, ranging from Ballroom and Latin American Dance to Shaolin Kung Fu, and from the University of London Big Band to the Breakdancing Society. Affiliated to the university is the University of London Society of Change Ringers, a society for bellringers at all London universities.

The university runs the University of London Boat Club.

===Student housing===

The university operates eight intercollegiate halls of residence, which accommodate students from most of its colleges and member institutions:
* Bonham Carter and Warwickshire House, Gower Street, WC1E
* College Hall, Malet Street, WC1E
* Connaught Hall, Tavistock Square, WC1H
* Eleanor Rosa House, Lett Road, E15
* Garden Halls, Cartwright Gardens, WC1H
* Handel Mansions, Handel Street, WC1N
* International Hall, Lansdown Terrace, WC1N
* Nutford House, Brown Street, W1H

==Notable people==
===Alumni===
A large number of famous individuals have passed through the University of London, either as staff or students, including at least 12 monarchs or royalty, 52 presidents or prime ministers, 84 Nobel laureates, 6 Grammy winners, 2 Oscar winners, 1 Ekushey Padak winner and 3 Olympic gold medalists. The collegiate research university has also produced Father of the Nation for several countries, including several members of Colonial Service and Imperial Civil Service during the British Raj and the British Empire.

Staff and students of the university, past and present, have contributed to a number of important scientific advances, including the discovery of vaccines by Edward Jenner and Henry Gray (author of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;). Additional vital progress was made by University of London people in the following fields: the discovery of the structure of DNA (Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin); the invention of modern electronic computers (Tommy Flowers); the discovery of penicillin (Alexander Fleming and Ernest Chain); the development of X-ray technology (William Henry Bragg and Charles Glover Barkla); discoveries on the mechanism of action of Interleukin 10 (Anne O&#x27;Garra); the formulation of the theory of electromagnetism (James Clerk Maxwell); the determination of the speed of light (Louis Essen); the development of antiseptics (Joseph Lister); the development of fibre optics (Charles K. Kao); and the invention of the telephone (Alexander Graham Bell).

Notable political figures who have passed through the university include Billy Strachan, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, Romano Prodi, Junichiro Koizumi, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ramsay MacDonald, Desmond Tutu, Basdeo Panday, Taro Aso, Walter Rodney, Nelson Mandela, B. R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi. 35th President of the United States John F. Kennedy filed an application and paid fees for a year&#x27;s study at the LSE, but later fell ill and left the university without taking a single class.

Hon Justice Alfred Eyewumi Awala, Justice of the Nigerian Court of Appeal.

===Academic staff===

In the arts, culture and literature the university has produced many notable figures. Writers include novelists Malcolm Bradbury, G. K. Chesterton, H. G. Wells, Thomas Hardy, Arthur C. Clarke and J. G. Ballard. Futurologist Donald Prell. Artists associated with the university include Jonathan Myles-Lea, and several of the leading figures in the Young British Artists movement (including Ian Davenport, Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst). Outstanding musicians across a wide range include the conductor Sir Simon Rattle, the soprano Felicity Lott and both members of Gilbert and Sullivan, to Mick Jagger, Elton John, Dido, Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan (known in South Asia as the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;), and Hong Kong singer Karen Mok, composer Florence Margaret Spencer Palmer, and members of the bands Coldplay, Keane, Suede, the Velvet Underground, Blur, Iron Maiden, Placebo, the Libertines, and Queen.

The university has also played host to film directors (Christopher Nolan, Derek Jarman), philosophers (Karl Popper, Roger Scruton), explorers (David Livingstone), international academics (Sam Karunaratne), Riccarton High School Head of Commerce, Tom Neumann and leading businessmen (Michael Cowpland, George Soros).

===Honorary alumni===
The University of London presented its first honorary degrees in June 1903. This accolade has been bestowed on several monarchs of the United Kingdom, many members of British royal family and a wide range of distinguished individuals from both the academic and non-academic worlds. Honorary degrees are approved by the Collegiate Council, part of the university&#x27;s governance structure. 
==Controversy==
In recent years the University of London has seen much controversy surrounding its treatment of staff and students.

In 2012, outsourced cleaning staff ran the &quot;3 Cosas&quot; campaign, fighting for improvements in three areas – sick pay, holiday and pensions. After over a year of high-profile strikes, protests and occupations, concessions were made by the university in terms of sick pay and holidays; however, these improvements were nowhere near to the extent of what was being demanded by the campaign.

In 2013, after a student occupation in favour of ten demands, including fair pay for workers, a halt to privatisation of the university and an end to plans to shut down the university&#x27;s student union ULU, police were called, resulting in the violent eviction and arrests of more than 60 students, as well as police violence towards students outside supporting the occupation. After these events, a high-profile &quot;Cops Off Campus&quot; demonstration was held against the university&#x27;s security policies, with thousands in attendance.

In 2018, an article was published by Vice that reported on concerns over the university&#x27;s security arrangements at Senate House, where more than 25 extra private security staff had been brought in. Students who had been involved in an occupation of Senate House were barred from using university facilities, and there were numerous allegations of students being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by the temporary security staff.

In December 2018, the Independent Workers&#x27; Union of Great Britain called for a boycott of events at the university&#x27;s central administration buildings, including Senate House, with the aim of putting pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced cleaning, catering and security staff in-house by targeting a revenue stream worth around £40 million per year.

In May 2019, the congress of the University and College Union voted to boycott the University of London&#x27;s central administration buildings including Senate House, raising the pressure on the University of London. Dion Georgiou, an academic supporting the boycott and a member of UCU, wrote a comment piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; shortly before the vote, urging the congress to approve the motion and claiming that &quot;[outsourced workers] face an intransigent university management, whose response has frequently blended short-termism with heavy-handedness&quot;. The motion was passed two days later.

==The federal model elsewhere==
In 1850, Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland was created as a federal university to provide degrees for students from the colleges established at Belfast, Cork and Galway. This was succeeded in 1879 by the Royal University of Ireland, an examining university along the model of the University of London, which was in turn succeeded by the federal National University of Ireland in 1908. When the University of New Zealand was constituted in 1874, it was a federal university modelled on the University of London, functioning principally as an examining body. University of the Cape of Good Hope, when it was constituted in 1875 and authorised to be responsible for examinations throughout South Africa. In Canada, similar structures were adopted, but on a regional basis. The University of Toronto acted as an examining and degree awarding body for the province of Ontario from 1853 to 1887, by utilising an operating model based on that of University of London.

In India, to satisfy the urge for higher education and learning, three universities were set up at three presidency towns in 1857 on the model of University of London as affiliating universities, viz., University of Calcutta, University of Mumbai and University of Madras.

The University of Wales was established in 1893 on a federal model incorporating (originally) colleges in Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff. A decision to dissolve the University of Wales was made in 2017.

==Literature and popular culture==
===Literature===
Dr. Watson, a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, received his medical degree from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (now part of QMUL) and met Sherlock Holmes in the chemical laboratory there. Jim Hacker, a fictional character in the 1980s British sitcom &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and its sequel &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, received his degree, a third, from the university (LSE).

The use of Senate House by the Ministry of Information during the Second World War inspired books two noted English writers: Graham Greene set his novel &quot;The Ministry of Fear&quot; (1943) and its film adaptation &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot; by Fritz Lang (1944) in Bloomsbury. George Orwell&#x27;s wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired the description of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

===Films and others===
A lecturer at the university (SOAS) named William McGovern was one of the real-life inspirations of the film character Indiana Jones.

Senate House and the constituent colleges of the University of London have been featured in Hollywood and British films.

In 1916, Alfred Hitchcock enrolled at the University of London and took evening courses and drawing and design classes, which later in 1920 helped land him a spot designing title cards.

<doc id="60920" wikidata="Q190067" url="?curid=60920" title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">
<text>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid found in cannabis. It is the principal psychoactive constituent of &quot;cannabis&quot; and one of at least 113 total cannabinoids identified on the plant. Although the chemical formula for THC (C21H30O2) describes multiple isomers, the term &quot;THC&quot; usually refers to the delta-9-THC isomer with chemical name (−)-&quot;trans&quot;-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. It is a colorless oil.

==Medical uses==
THC, referred to as dronabinol in the pharmaceutical context, is approved in the United States as a capsule or solution to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia.

THC is an active ingredient in nabiximols, a specific extract of &quot;Cannabis&quot; that was approved as a botanical drug in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray for people with multiple sclerosis to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms. Nabiximols (as Sativex) is available as a prescription drug in Canada. In 2021, nabiximols was approved for medical use in Ukraine.

==Side effects==
Side effects of THC include red eyes, dry mouth, drowsiness, short-term memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, ataxia, increased appetite, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis (i.e., hallucinations, delusions), decreased motivation, and time dilation, among others.

Chronic usage of THC may result in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a condition characterized by cyclic nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that may persist for months to years after discontinuation.

==Overdose==
The median lethal dose of THC in humans is not fully known as there is conflicting evidence. A 1972 study gave up to 90 mg/kg of THC to dogs and monkeys without any lethal effects. Some rats died within 72 hours after a dose of up to 36 mg/kg. A 2014 case study based on the toxicology reports and relative testimony in two separate cases gave the median lethal dose in humans at 30 mg/kg (2.1 grams THC for a person who weighs 70 kg; 154 lb; 11 stone), observing cardiovascular death in the one otherwise healthy subject of the two cases studied. A different 1972 study gave the median lethal dose for intravenous THC in mice and rats at 30–40 mg/kg. A 2020 fact sheet published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration stated that &quot;[n]o deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported.&quot;

==Interactions==
Formal drug–drug interaction studies with THC have not been conducted and are limited. The elimination half-life of the barbiturate pentobarbital has been found to increase by 4hours when concomitantly administered with oral THC.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
The actions of Δ9-THC result from its partial agonist activity at the cannabinoid receptor CB1 (Ki = 40.7 nM), located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor (Ki = 36 nM), mainly expressed in cells of the immune system. The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of (mostly G-coupled) cannabinoid receptors, which result in a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The presence of these specialized cannabinoid receptors in the brain led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG).

THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat). THC, as well as other cannabinoids that contain a phenol group, possess mild antioxidant activity sufficient to protect neurons against oxidative stress, such as that produced by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.

THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor affinity. THC is also limited in its efficacy compared to other cannabinoids due to its partial agonistic activity, as THC appears to result in greater downregulation of cannabinoid receptors than endocannabinoids. Furthermore, in populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may even act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. However while THC&#x27;s pharmacodynamic tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that this tolerance mitigates undesirable effects, thus enhancing the drug&#x27;s therapeutic window.

Recently, it has been shown that THC is also a partial autotaxin inhibitor, with an apparent IC50 of 407 ± 67 nM for the ATX-gamma isoform. THC was also co-crystallized with autotaxin, deciphering the binding interface of the complex. These results might explain some of the effects of THC on inflammation and neurological diseases, since autotaxin is responsible of LPA generation, a key lipid mediator involved in numerous diseases and physiological processes. However, clinical trials need to be performed in order to assess the importance of ATX inhibition by THC during medicinal cannabis consumption.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
With oral administration of a single dose, THC is almost completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to first-pass metabolism in the liver and the high lipid solubility of THC, only about 5 to 20% reaches circulation. Following oral administration, concentrations of THC and its major active metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) peak after 0.5 to 4hours, with median time to peak of 1.0 to 2.5hours at different doses. In some cases, peak levels may not occur for as long as 6hours. Concentrations of THC and 11-hydroxy-THC in the circulation are approximately equal with oral administration. There is a slight increase in dose proportionality in terms of peak and area-under-the-curve levels of THC with increasing oral doses over a range of 2.5 to 10mg. A high-fat meal delays time to peak concentrations of oral THC by 4hours on average and increases area-under-the-curve exposure by 2.9-fold, but peak concentrations are not significantly altered. A high-fat meal additionally increases absorption of THC via the lymphatic system and allows it to bypass first-pass metabolism. Consequently, a high-fat meal increases levels of 11-hydroxy-THC by only 25% and most of the increase in bioavailability is due to increased levels of THC.

The bioavailability of THC when smoking or inhaling is approximately 25%, with a range of 2% to 56% (although most commonly between 10 and 35%). The large range and marked variability between individuals is due to variation in factors including product matrix, ignition temperature, and inhalational dynamics (e.g., number, duration, and intervals of inhalations, breath hold time, depth and volume of inhalations, size of inhaled particles, deposition site in the lungs). THC is detectable within seconds with inhalation and peak levels of THC occur after 3 to 10minutes. Smoking or inhaling THC results in greater blood levels of THC and its metabolites and a much faster onset of action than oral administration of THC. Inhalation of THC bypasses the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral administration. The bioavailability of THC with inhalation is increased in heavy users.

Transdermal administration of THC is limited by its extreme water insolubility. Efficient skin transport can only be obtained with permeation enhancement. Transdermal administration of THC, as with inhalation, avoids the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral administration.

====Distribution====
The volume of distribution of THC is large and is approximately 10L/kg (range 4–14L/kg), which is due to its high lipid solubility. The plasma protein binding of THC and its metabolites is approximately 95 to 99%, with THC bound mainly to lipoproteins and to a lesser extent albumin. THC is rapidly distributed into well-vascularized organs such as lung, heart, brain, and liver, and is subsequently equilibrated into less vascularized tissue. It is extensively distributed into and sequestered by fat tissue due to its high lipid solubility, from which it is slowly released. THC is able to cross the placenta and is excreted in human breast milk.

====Metabolism====
The metabolism of THC occurs mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes involving in metabolizing THC. Pharmacogenomic research has found that oral THC exposure is 2- to 3-fold greater in people with genetic variants associated with reduced CYP2C9 function. When taken orally, THC undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation. The principal active metabolite of THC is 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC), which is formed by CYP2C9 and is psychoactive similarly to THC. This metabolite is further oxidized to 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). In animals, more than 100 metabolites of THC could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the predominant metabolites.

====Elimination====
More than 55% of THC is excreted in the feces and approximately 20% in the urine. The main metabolite in urine is the ester of glucuronic acid and 11-OH-THC and free THC-COOH. In the feces, mainly 11-OH-THC was detected.

Estimates of the elimination half-life of THC are variable. THC was reported to have a fast initial half-life of 6minutes and a long terminal half-life of 22hours in a population pharmacokinetic study. Conversely, the Food and Drug Administration label for dronabinol reports an initial half-life of 4hours and a terminal half-life of 25 to 36hours. Many studies report an elimination half-life of THC in the range of 20 to 30hours. 11-Hydroxy-THC appears to have a similar terminal half-life to that of THC, for instance 12 to 36hours relative to 25 to 36hours in one study. The elimination half-life of THC is longer in heavy users. This may be due to slow redistribution from deep compartments such as fatty tissues, where THC accumulates with regular use.

==List of related compounds==

==Chemistry==
THC is a molecule that combines polyketides (derived from acetyl CoA) and terpenoids (derived from isoprenylpyrophosphate). It is hydrophobic with very low solubility in water, but good solubility in many organic solvents. As a phytochemical, THC is assumed to be involved in the plant&#x27;s evolutionary adaptation against insect predation, ultraviolet light, and environmental stress.
The preparation of THC was reported in 1965. that procedure called for the intramolecular alkyl lithium attack on a starting carbonyl to form the fused rings, and a tosyl chloride mediated formation of the ether.

===Biosynthesis===
In the &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant, THC occurs mainly as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, 2-COOH-THC). Geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid react, catalysed by an enzyme to produce cannabigerolic acid, which is cyclized by the enzyme THC acid synthase to give THCA. Over time, or when heated, THCA is decarboxylated, producing THC. The pathway for THCA biosynthesis is similar to that which produces the bitter acid humulone in hops. It can also be produced in genetically modified yeast.

==History==
Cannabidiol was isolated and identified from &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; in 1940 by Roger Adams who was also the first to document the synthesis of THC (both Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC) from the acid-based cyclization of CBD in 1942. THC was first isolated from Cannabis by Raphael Mechoulam and Yehiel Gaoni in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1021/ja01062a046&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Comparisons with medical cannabis===
Female cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis, and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis.

===Drug testing===
THC and its 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH metabolites can be detected and quantified in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using a combination of immunoassay and chromatographic techniques as part of a drug use testing program or in a forensic investigation. There is ongoing research to create devices capable of detecting THC in breath.

===Regulation===
THC, along with its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers, is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act for having &quot;no accepted medical use&quot; and &quot;lack of accepted safety&quot;. However, dronabinol, a pharmaceutical form of THC, has been approved by the FDA as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an antiemetic for people receiving chemotherapy under the trade names Marinol and Syndros.

In 2003, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring THC to Schedule IV of the convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse and addiction potential. In 2019, the Committee recommended transferring Δ9-THC to Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, but its recommendations were rejected by the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs.

====In the United States====
As of 2023, 38 states, four territories, and the District of Columbia in the United States allow medical use of cannabis (in which THC is the primary psychoactive component), with the exception of Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. As of 2022, the U.S. federal government maintains cannabis as a schedule I controlled substance, while dronabinol is classified as Schedule III in capsule form (Marinol) and Schedule II in liquid oral form (Syndros).

====In Canada====
As of October 2018 when recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada, some 220 dietary supplements and 19 veterinary health products containing not more than 10 parts per million of THC extract were approved with general health claims for treating minor conditions.

==Research==
The status of THC as an illegal drug in most countries imposes restrictions on research material supply and funding, such as in the United States where the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Drug Enforcement Administration continue to control the sole federally-legal source of cannabis for researchers. Despite an August 2016 announcement that licenses would be provided to growers for supplies of medical marijuana, no such licenses were ever issued, despite dozens of applications. Although cannabis is legalized for medical uses in more than half of the states of the United States, no products have been approved for federal commerce by the Food and Drug Administration, a status that limits cultivation, manufacture, distribution, clinical research, and therapeutic applications.

In April 2014, the American Academy of Neurology found evidence supporting the effectiveness of the cannabis extracts in treating certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis and pain, but there was insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness for treating several other neurological diseases. A 2015 review confirmed that medical marijuana was effective for treating spasticity and chronic pain, but caused numerous short-lasting adverse events, such as dizziness.

Based on the results of 3 high quality trials and 5 of lower quality, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective, for improving people&#x27;s subjective experience of spasticity. Oral cannabis extract and THC both were rated as possibly effective for improving objective measures of spasticity.
* &quot;Centrally mediated pain and painful spasms&quot;. Based on the results of 4 high quality trials and 4 low quality trials, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective in treating central pain and painful spasms.
* &quot;Bladder dysfunction&quot;. Based on a single high quality study, oral cannabis extract and THC were rated as probably ineffective for controlling bladder complaints in multiple sclerosis

===Neurodegenerative disorders===
* &quot;Huntington disease&quot;. No reliable conclusion could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of THC or oral cannabis extract in treating the symptoms of Huntington disease as the available trials were too small to reliably detect any difference
* &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s disease&quot;. Based on a single study, oral CBD extract was rated probably ineffective in treating levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot;. A 2009 Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to conclude whether cannabis products have any utility in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Other neurological disorders===
* &quot;Tourette syndrome&quot;. The available data was determined to be insufficient to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract or THC in controlling tics.
* &quot;Cervical dystonia&quot;. Insufficient data was available to assess the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract of THC in treating cervical dystonia.

===Potential for toxicity===
Preliminary research indicates that prolonged exposure to high doses of THC may interfere with chromosomal stability, which may be hereditary as a factor affecting cell instability and cancer risk. The carcinogenicity of THC in the studied populations of so-called &quot;heavy users&quot; remains dubious due to various confounding variables, most significantly concurrent tobacco use.

<text>The Battle of the Somme (; ), also known as the Somme offensive, was a major battle of the First World War fought by the armies of the British Empire and the French Third Republic against the German Empire. It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the river Somme in France. The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies. More than three million men fought in the battle, of whom more than one million were either wounded or killed, making it one of the deadliest battles in all of human history.

The French and British had committed themselves to an offensive on the Somme during the Chantilly Conference in December 1915. The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies, with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution. Initial plans called for the French army to undertake the main part of the Somme offensive, supported on the northern flank by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). When the Imperial German Army began the Battle of Verdun on the Meuse on 21 February 1916, French commanders diverted many of the divisions intended for the Somme and the &quot;supporting&quot; attack by the British became the principal effort. The British troops on the Somme comprised a mixture of the remains of the pre-war army, the Territorial Force, and Kitchener&#x27;s Army, a force of wartime volunteers.

On the first day on the Somme (1 July) the German 2nd Army suffered a serious defeat opposite the French Sixth Army, from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert–Bapaume road. The 57,470 casualties suffered by the British, including 19,240 killed, were the worst in the history of the British Army. Most of the British casualties were suffered on the front between the Albert–Bapaume road and Gommecourt to the north, which was the area where the principal German defensive effort () was made. The battle became notable for the importance of air power and the first use of the tank in September but these were a product of new technology and proved unreliable.

At the end of the battle, British and French forces had penetrated into German-occupied territory along the majority of the front, their largest territorial gain since the First Battle of the Marne in 1914. The operational objectives of the Anglo-French armies were unfulfilled, as they failed to capture Péronne and Bapaume, where the German armies maintained their positions over the winter. British attacks in the Ancre valley resumed in January 1917 and forced the Germans into local withdrawals to reserve lines in February before the strategic retreat by about in Operation Alberich to the (Hindenburg Line) in March 1917. Debate continues over the necessity, significance, and effect of the battle.

== Strategic developments ==
Allied war strategy for 1916 was decided at the Chantilly Conference from 6th to 8th December 1915. Simultaneous offensives on the Eastern Front by the Russian army, on the Italian Front by the Italian army and on the Western Front by the Franco-British armies were to be carried out to deny time for the Central Powers to move troops between fronts during lulls. In December 1915, General Sir Douglas Haig replaced Field Marshal Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Haig favoured a British offensive in Flanders, close to BEF supply routes, to drive the Germans from the Belgian coast and end the U-boat threat from Belgian waters. Haig was not formally subordinate to Marshal Joseph Joffre but the British played a lesser role on the Western Front and complied with French strategy.

In January 1916, Joffre had agreed to the BEF making its main effort in Flanders but in February 1916 it was decided to mount a combined offensive where the French and British armies met, astride the Somme River in Picardy before the British offensive in Flanders. A week later the Germans began the Battle of Verdun against the French army. The costly defence of Verdun forced the army to divert divisions intended for the Somme offensive, eventually reducing the French contribution to in the Sixth Army, against divisions. By 31 May, the ambitious Franco-British plan for a decisive victory had been reduced to a limited offensive to relieve pressure on the French at Verdun and inflict attrition on the German armies in the west.

The Chief of the German General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn, intended to end the war by splitting the Anglo-French Entente in 1916, before its material superiority became unbeatable. Falkenhayn planned to defeat the large number of reserves which the Entente could move into the path of a breakthrough, by threatening a sensitive point close to the existing front line and provoking the French into counter-attacking German positions. Falkenhayn chose to attack towards Verdun to take the Meuse heights and make Verdun untenable. The French would have to conduct a counter-offensive on ground dominated by the German army and ringed with masses of heavy artillery, leading to huge losses and bringing the French army close to collapse. The British would mount a hasty relief offensive and suffer similar losses. Falkenhayn expected the relief offensive to fall south of Arras against the 6th Army and be destroyed. (Despite the certainty by mid-June of an Anglo-French attack on the Somme against the 2nd Army, Falkenhayn sent only four divisions, keeping eight in the western strategic reserve. No divisions were taken from the Sixth Army, despite it holding a shorter line with divisions and three of the divisions in OHL reserve behind the 6th Army. The maintenance of the strength of the 6th Army, at the expense of the 2nd Army on the Somme, indicated that Falkenhayn intended the counter-offensive against the British to be made north of the Somme front, once the British offensive had been shattered.) If such Franco-British defeats were not enough, Germany would attack the remnants of both armies and end the western alliance for good. The unexpected length of the Verdun offensive, and the need to replace many drained units at Verdun, depleted the German strategic reserve placed behind the 6th Army, which held the Western Front from Hannescamps, south-west of Arras to St Eloi, south of Ypres and reduced the German counter-offensive strategy north of the Somme to one of passive and unyielding defence.

=== Battle of Verdun ===
The Battle of Verdun ( December 1916) began a week after Joffre and Haig agreed to mount an offensive on the Somme. The German offensive at Verdun was intended to threaten the capture of the city and induce the French to fight an attrition battle, in which German advantages of terrain and firepower would cause the French disproportionate casualties. The battle changed the nature of the offensive on the Somme, as French divisions were diverted to Verdun, and the main effort by the French diminished to a supporting attack for the British. German overestimation of the cost of Verdun to the French contributed to the concentration of German infantry and guns on the north bank of the Somme. By May, Joffre and Haig had changed their expectations of an offensive on the Somme, from a decisive battle to a hope that it would relieve Verdun and keep German divisions in France, which would assist the Russian armies conducting the Brusilov Offensive. The German offensive at Verdun was suspended in July, and troops, guns, and ammunition were transferred to Picardy, leading to a similar transfer of the French Tenth Army to the Somme front. Later in the year, the Franco-British were able to attack on the Somme and at Verdun sequentially and the French recovered much of the ground lost on the east bank of the Meuse in October and December.

=== Brusilov offensive ===

The Brusilov offensive () on the Eastern Front absorbed the extra forces that had been requested on 2 June by Fritz von Below, commanding the German Second Army, for a spoiling attack on the Somme. On 4 June, Russian armies attacked on a front, from the Romanian frontier to Pinsk and eventually advanced , reaching the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, against German and Austro-Hungarian troops of and . During the offensive the Russians inflicted including . Three divisions were ordered from France to the Eastern Front on 9 June and the spoiling attack on the Somme was abandoned. Only four more divisions were sent to the Somme front before the Anglo-French offensive began, bringing the total to divisions. Falkenhayn, and then Hindenburg and Ludendorff, were forced to send divisions to Russia throughout the summer to prevent a collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army and then to conduct a counter-offensive against Romania, which declared war against the Central Powers on 27 August. In July there were divisions on the Western Front and in Russia and in November there were in the west and in the east.

=== Tactical developments ===
The original British Expeditionary Force (BEF) of 6 divisions and the Cavalry Division, had lost most of the British pre-war regulars in the battles of 1914 and 1915. The bulk of the army was made up of volunteers of the Territorial Force and Kitchener&#x27;s Army, which had begun forming in August 1914. Rapid expansion created many vacancies for senior commands and specialist functions, which led to many appointments of retired officers and inexperienced newcomers. In 1914, Douglas Haig had been a lieutenant-general in command of I Corps and was promoted to command the First Army in early 1915 and then the BEF in December, which eventually comprised five armies with sixty divisions. The swift increase in the size of the army reduced the average level of experience within it and created an acute equipment shortage. Many officers resorted to directive command to avoid delegating to novice subordinates, although divisional commanders were given great latitude in training and planning for the attack of 1 July, since the heterogeneous nature of the 1916 army made it impossible for corps and army commanders to know the capacity of each division.

Despite considerable debate among German staff officers, Erich von Falkenhayn continued the policy of unyielding defence in 1916. Falkenhayn implied after the war that the psychology of German soldiers, shortage of manpower and lack of reserves made the policy inescapable, as the troops necessary to seal off breakthroughs did not exist. High losses incurred in holding ground by a policy of no retreat were preferable to higher losses, voluntary withdrawals and the effect of a belief that soldiers had discretion to avoid battle. When a more flexible policy was substituted later, decisions about withdrawal were still reserved to army commanders. On the Somme front, Falkenhayn&#x27;s construction plan of January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two, wide and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one trench line to a position of three lines apart, the first trench () occupied by sentry groups, the second () for the bulk of the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for . An intermediate line of strongpoints (the ) about behind the front line was also built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second position, which was as well-built and wired as the first position. The second position was beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the position.

== Prelude ==
=== Anglo-French plan of attack ===
French losses at Verdun reduced the contribution available for the offensive on the Somme and increased the urgency for the commencement of operations on the Somme. The principal role in the offensive devolved to the British and on 16 June, Haig defined the objectives of the offensive as the relief of pressure on the French at Verdun and the infliction of losses on the Germans. After a five-day artillery bombardment, the British Fourth Army was to capture of the German first line, from Montauban to Serre and the Third Army was to mount a diversion at Gommecourt. In a second phase, the Fourth Army was to take the German second position, from Pozières to the Ancre and then the second position south of the Albert–Bapaume Road, ready for an attack on the German third position south of the road towards Flers, when the Reserve Army which included three cavalry divisions, would exploit the success to advance east and then north towards Arras. The French Sixth Army, with one corps on the north bank from Maricourt to the Somme and two corps on the south bank southwards to Foucaucourt, would make a subsidiary attack to guard the right flank of the main attack being made by the British.

=== Betrayal of British plans ===
Research in German archives revealed in 2016 that the date and location of the British offensive had been betrayed to German interrogators by two politically disgruntled soldiers several weeks in advance. The German military accordingly undertook significant defensive preparatory work on the British section of the Somme offensive. Other intelligence which warned the Germans included POW reports, interception of Rawlinson&#x27;s message to his troops and early detonation of a mine. Thus alerted, the Germans were waiting in their trenches when the British troops went over the top.

=== German defences on the Somme ===

After the Autumn Battles () of 1915, a third defensive position another back from the (Support line) begun in February 1916 and was almost complete on the Somme front when the battle began. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors); each officer was expected to know the batteries covering his section of the front line and the batteries ready to engage fleeting targets. A telephone system was built, with lines buried deep for behind the front line, to connect the front line to the artillery. The Somme defences had two inherent weaknesses that the rebuilding had not remedied. The front trenches were on a forward slope, lined by white chalk from the subsoil and easily seen by ground observers. The defences were crowded towards the front trench with a regiment having two battalions near the front-trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second position, all within of no man&#x27;s land and most troops within of the front line, accommodated in the new deep dugouts. The concentration of troops at the front line on a forward slope guaranteed that it would face the bulk of an artillery bombardment, directed by ground observers on clearly marked lines.

== Battles of the Somme, 1916 ==
=== First phase: 1–17 July 1916 ===
==== Battle of Albert, 1–13 July ====
The Battle of Albert was the first two weeks of Anglo-French offensive operations in the Battle of the Somme. The Allied preparatory artillery bombardment began on 24 June and the Anglo-French infantry attacked on 1 July, on the south bank from Foucaucourt to the Somme and from the Somme north to Gommecourt, beyond Serre. The French Sixth Army and the right wing of the British Fourth Army inflicted a considerable defeat on the German Second Army, but from the Albert–Bapaume road to Gommecourt the British attack was a disaster where most of the casualties were incurred. Against Joffre&#x27;s wishes, Haig abandoned the offensive north of the road, to reinforce the success in the south, where the Anglo-French forces pressed forward towards the German second line, preparatory to a general attack on 14 July.

===== First day =====


The Battle of the Somme lasted beginning with the opening day of the Battle of Albert. The attack was made by five divisions of the French Sixth Army on the east side of the Somme, eleven British divisions of the Fourth Army north of the Somme to Serre and two divisions of the Third Army opposite Gommecourt, against the German Second Army of General Fritz von Below. The German defence south of the Albert–Bapaume road mostly collapsed and the French had &quot;complete success&quot; on both banks of the Somme, as did the British from the army boundary at Maricourt to the Albert–Bapaume road. On the south bank the German defence was made incapable of resisting another attack and a substantial retreat began; on the north bank the abandonment of Fricourt was ordered. The defenders on the commanding ground north of the road inflicted a huge defeat on the British infantry, who took an unprecedented number of casualties. Several truces were negotiated to recover wounded from no man&#x27;s land north of the road. The Fourth Army took , of which were killed. The French Sixth Army had , and the 2nd German Army had .

==== Battle of Bazentin Ridge, 14–17 July ====


The Fourth Army attacked the German second defensive position from the Somme past Guillemont and Ginchy, north-west along the crest of the ridge to Pozières on the Albert–Bapaume road. The objectives of the attack were the villages of Bazentin le Petit, Bazentin le Grand and Longueval which was adjacent to Delville Wood, with High Wood on the ridge beyond. The attack was made by four divisions on a front of at after a five-minute hurricane artillery bombardment. Field artillery fired a creeping barrage and the attacking waves pushed up close behind it in no man&#x27;s land, leaving them only a short distance to cross when the barrage lifted from the German front trench. Most of the objective was captured and the German defence south of the Albert–Bapaume road put under great strain but the attack was not followed up due to British communication failures, casualties and disorganisation.

==== Battle of Fromelles, 19–20 July ====
The Battle of Fromelles was a subsidiary attack to support the Fourth Army on the Somme to the south, to exploit any weakening of the German defences opposite. Preparations for the attack were rushed, the troops involved lacked experience in trench warfare and the power of the German defence was &quot;gravely&quot; underestimated, the attackers being . On 19 July, von Falkenhayn had judged the British attack to be the anticipated offensive against the 6th Army. Next day, Falkenhayn ordered the Guard Reserve Corps to be withdrawn to reinforce the Somme front. The Battle of Fromelles had inflicted some losses on the German defenders but gained no ground and deflected few German troops bound for the Somme. The attack was the debut of the Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front and, according to McMullin, &quot;the worst 24 hours in Australia&#x27;s entire history&quot;. Of , were incurred by the 5th Australian Division; German losses were prisoner.

=== Second phase: July–September 1916 ===
==== Battle of Delville Wood, 14 July – 15 September ====


The Battle of Delville Wood was an operation to secure the British right flank, while the centre advanced to capture the higher-lying areas of High Wood and Pozières. After the Battle of Albert the offensive had evolved to the capture of fortified villages, woods, and other terrain that offered observation for artillery fire, jumping-off points for more attacks, and other tactical advantages. The mutually costly fighting at Delville Wood eventually secured the British right flank and marked the Western Front debut of the South African 1st Infantry Brigade (incorporating a Southern Rhodesian contingent), which held the wood from 15 to 20 July. When relieved, the brigade had lost , similar to the casualties of many brigades on 1 July.

==== Battle of Pozières, 23 July – 7 August ====
The Battle of Pozières began with the capture of the village by the 1st Australian Division (Australian Imperial Force) of the 

Reserve Army, the only British success in the Allied fiasco of when a general attack combined with the French further south, degenerated into a series of separate attacks due to communication failures, supply failures and poor weather. German bombardments and counter-attacks began on 23 July and continued until 7 August. The fighting ended with the Reserve Army taking the plateau north and east of the village, overlooking the fortified village of Thiepval from the rear.

==== Battle of Guillemont, 3–6 September ====
The Battle of Guillemont was an attack on the village which was captured by the Fourth Army on the first day. Guillemont was on the right flank of the British sector, near the boundary with the French Sixth Army. German defences ringed the British salient at Delville Wood to the north and had observation over the French Sixth Army area to the south towards the Somme river. The German defence in the area was based on the second line and numerous fortified villages and farms north from Maurepas at Combles, Guillemont, Falfemont Farm, Delville Wood and High Wood, which were mutually supporting. The battle for Guillemont was considered by some observers to be the supreme effort of the German army during the battle. Numerous meetings were held by Joffre, Haig, Foch, General Sir Henry Rawlinson (commander of the British Fourth Army) and Fayolle to co-ordinate joint attacks by the four armies, all of which broke down. A pause in Anglo-French attacks at the end of August, coincided with the largest counter-attack by the German army in the Battle of the Somme.

==== Battle of Ginchy, 9 September ====


In the Battle of Ginchy the 16th Division captured the German-held village. Ginchy was north-east of Guillemont, at the junction of six roads on a rise overlooking Combles, to the south-east. After the end of the Battle of Guillemont, British troops were required to advance to positions which would give observation over the German third position, ready for a general attack in mid-September. British attacks from Leuze Wood northwards to Ginchy had begun on 3 September, when the 7th Division captured the village and was then forced out by a German counter-attack. The capture of Ginchy and the success of the French Sixth Army on 12 September, in its biggest attack of the battle of the Somme, enabled both armies to make much bigger attacks, sequenced with the Tenth and Reserve armies, which captured much more ground and inflicted casualties on the German defenders during the month.

=== Third phase: September–November 1916 ===
==== Battle of Flers–Courcelette, 15–22 September ====
The Battle of Flers–Courcelette was the third and final general offensive mounted by the British Army, which attacked an intermediate line and the German third line to take Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt, which was combined with a French attack on Frégicourt and Rancourt to encircle Combles and a supporting attack on the south bank of the Somme. The strategic objective of a breakthrough was not achieved but the tactical gains were considerable, the front line being advanced by and many casualties were inflicted on the German defenders. The battle was the debut of the Canadian Corps, the New Zealand Division and tanks of the Heavy Branch of the Machine Gun Corps on the Somme.

==== Battle of Morval, 25–28 September ====


The Battle of Morval was an attack by the Fourth Army on Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on Combles, south of Morval and because of rain. The combined attack was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west, near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. Combles, Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt were captured and a small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon. Many casualties were inflicted on the Germans but the French made slower progress. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a Salients, re-entrants and pockets salient near Combles. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.

==== Battle of Thiepval Ridge, 26–28 September ====


The Battle of Thiepval Ridge was the first large offensive mounted by the Reserve Army of Lieutenant General Hubert Gough and was intended to benefit from the Fourth Army attack at Morval by starting afterwards. Thiepval Ridge was well fortified and the German defenders fought with great determination, while the British co-ordination of infantry and artillery declined after the first day, due to confused fighting in the maze of trenches, dug-outs and shell-craters. The final British objectives were not reached until the Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October – 11 November). Organisational difficulties and deteriorating weather frustrated Joffre&#x27;s intention to proceed by vigorous co-ordinated attacks by the Anglo-French armies, which became disjointed and declined in effectiveness during late September, at the same time as a revival occurred in the German defence. The British experimented with new techniques in gas warfare, machine-gun bombardment and tank–infantry co-operation, as the Germans struggled to withstand the preponderance of men and material fielded by the Anglo-French, despite reorganisation and substantial reinforcements of troops, artillery and aircraft from Verdun. September became the worst month for casualties for the Germans.

==== Battle of Le Transloy, 1 October – 11 November ====
The Battle of Le Transloy began in good weather and Le Sars was captured on 7 October. Pauses were made from due to rain and to allow time for a methodical bombardment, when it became clear that the German defence had recovered from earlier defeats. Haig consulted with the army commanders and on reduced the scope of operations by cancelling the Third Army plans and reducing the Reserve Army and Fourth Army attacks to limited operations, in co-operation with the French Sixth Army. Another pause followed before operations resumed on 23 October on the northern flank of the Fourth Army, with a delay during more bad weather on the right flank of the Fourth Army and on the French Sixth Army front, until 5 November. Next day, the Fourth Army ceased offensive operations, except for small attacks intended to improve positions and divert German attention from attacks being made by the Reserve/Fifth Army. Larger operations resumed in January 1917.

==== Battle of the Ancre Heights, 1 October – 11 November ====
The Battle of the Ancre Heights was fought after Haig made plans for the Third Army to take the area east of Gommecourt, the Reserve Army to attack north from Thiepval Ridge and east from Beaumont Hamel–Hébuterne and for the Fourth Army to reach the Péronne–Bapaume road around Le Transloy and Beaulencourt–Thilloy–Loupart Wood, north of the Albert–Bapaume road. The Reserve Army attacked to complete the capture of Regina Trench/Stuff Trench, north of Courcelette to the west end of Bazentin Ridge around and Stuff Redoubts, during which bad weather caused great hardship and delay. The Marine Brigade from Flanders and fresh German divisions brought from quiet fronts counter-attacked frequently and the British objectives were not secured until 11 November.

==== Battle of the Ancre, 13–18 November ====


The Battle of the Ancre was the last big British operation of the year. The Fifth (formerly Reserve) Army attacked into the Ancre valley to exploit German exhaustion after the Battle of the Ancre Heights and gain ground ready for a resumption of the offensive in 1917. Political calculation, concern for Allied morale and Joffre&#x27;s pressure for a continuation of attacks in France, to prevent German troop transfers to Russia and Italy also influenced Haig. The battle began with another mine being detonated beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The attack on Serre failed, although a brigade of the 31st Division, which had attacked in the disaster of 1 July, took its objectives before being withdrawn later. South of Serre, Beaumont Hamel and Beaucourt-sur-l&#x27;Ancre were captured. South of the Ancre, St. Pierre Division was captured, the outskirts of Grandcourt reached and the Canadian 4th Division captured Regina Trench north of Courcelette, then took Desire Support Trench on 18 November. Until January 1917 a lull set in, as both sides concentrated on enduring the weather.

After the Battle of the Ancre (13–18 November 1916), British attacks on the Somme front were stopped by the weather and military operations by both sides were mostly restricted to survival in the rain, snow, fog, mud fields, waterlogged trenches and shell-holes. As preparations for the offensive at Arras continued, the British attempted to keep German attention on the Somme front. British operations on the Ancre from , forced the Germans back on a front, ahead of the schedule of the Alberich Bewegung ( Manoeuvre/Operation Alberich) and eventually took . On the Germans fell back another on a front. The Germans then withdrew from much of the to the on 11 March, forestalling a British attack, which was not noticed by the British until dark on 12 March; the main German withdrawal from the Noyon salient to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) commenced on schedule on 16 March.

=== Hindenburg Line ===
Von Falkenhayn was sacked and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff at the end of August 1916. At a conference at Cambrai on 5 September, a decision was taken to build a new defensive line well behind the Somme front. The was to be built from Arras to St. Quentin, La Fère and Condé, with another new line between Verdun and Pont-à-Mousson. These lines were intended to limit any Allied breakthrough and to allow the German army to withdraw if attacked; work began on the (Hindenburg Line) at the end of September. Withdrawing to the new line was not an easy decision and the German high command struggled over it during the winter of 1916–1917. Some members wanted to take a shorter step back to a line between Arras and Sailly, while the 1st and 2nd army commanders wanted to stay on the Somme. &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; von Fuchs on 20 January 1917 said that,
and that half measures were futile, retreating to the was unavoidable. After the loss of a considerable amount of ground around the Ancre valley to the British Fifth Army in February 1917, the German armies on the Somme were ordered on 14 February, to withdraw to reserve lines closer to Bapaume. A further retirement to the Hindenburg Line () in Operation Alberich began on 16 March 1917, despite the new line being unfinished and poorly sited in some places.

Defensive positions held by the German army on the Somme after November 1916 were in poor condition; the garrisons were exhausted and censors of correspondence reported tiredness and low morale in front-line soldiers. The situation left the German command doubtful that the army could withstand a resumption of the battle. The German defence of the Ancre began to collapse under British attacks, which on 28 January 1917 caused Rupprecht to urge that the retirement to the (Hindenburg Line) begin. Ludendorff rejected the proposal the next day, but British attacks on the First Army – particularly the action of Miraumont (also known as the Battle of Boom Ravine, 17–18 February) – caused Rupprecht on the night of 22 February to order a preliminary withdrawal of c. to the (R. I Position). On 24 February the Germans withdrew, protected by rear guards, over roads in relatively good condition, which were then destroyed. The German withdrawal was helped by a thaw, which turned roads behind the British front into bogs and by disruption, to the railways, which supplied the Somme front. On the night of 12 March, the Germans withdrew from the between Bapaume and Achiet le Petit and the British reached the (R. II Position) on 13 March. The withdrawal took place from with a retirement of about , giving up more French territory than that gained by the Allies from September 1914 until the beginning of the operation.

== Analysis ==

At the start of 1916, most of the British Army was an inexperienced and patchily trained mass of volunteers. The Somme was a great test for Kitchener&#x27;s Army, created by Kitchener&#x27;s call for recruits at the start of the war. The British volunteers were often the fittest, most enthusiastic and best-educated citizens but were inexperienced and it has been claimed that their loss was of lesser military significance than the losses of the remaining peacetime-trained officers and men of the Imperial German Army. British casualties on the first day were the worst in the history of the British Army, with whom were killed.

British survivors of the battle had gained experience and the BEF learned how to conduct the mass industrial warfare which the continental armies had been fighting since 1914. The European powers had begun the war with trained armies of regulars and reservists, which were wasting assets. Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria wrote, &quot;What remained of the old first-class peace-trained German infantry had been expended on the battlefield&quot;. A war of attrition was a logical strategy for Britain against Germany, which was also at war with France and Russia. A school of thought holds that the Battle of the Somme placed unprecedented strain on the German army and that after the battle it was unable to replace casualties like-for-like, which reduced it to a militia. Philpott argues that the German army was exhausted by the end of 1916, with loss of morale and the cumulative effects of attrition and frequent defeats causing it to collapse in 1918, a process which began on the Somme, echoing Churchill&#x27;s argument that the German soldiery was never the same again.

The destruction of German units in battle was made worse by lack of rest. British and French aircraft and long-range guns reached well behind the front line, where trench-digging and other work meant that troops returned to the line exhausted. Despite the strategic predicament of the German army, it survived the battle, withstood the pressure of the Brusilov Offensive and conquered almost all of Romania. In 1917, the German army in the west survived the large British and French offensives of the Nivelle Offensive and the Third Battle of Ypres, though at great cost.
The British and French had advanced about on the Somme, on a front of at a cost of to British and about casualties, against to or perhaps German casualties. Until the 1930s the dominant view of the battle in English-language writing was that the battle was a hard-fought victory against a brave, experienced and well-led opponent. Winston Churchill had objected to the way the battle was being fought in August 1916, and Prime Minister David Lloyd George criticised attrition warfare frequently and condemned the battle in his post-war memoirs. In the 1930s a new orthodoxy of &quot;mud, blood and futility&quot; emerged and gained more emphasis in the 1960s when the 50th anniversaries of the Great War battles were commemorated.

===Transport===
Until 1916, transport arrangements for the BEF were based on an assumption that the war of movement would soon resume and make it pointless to build infrastructure, since it would be left behind. The British relied on motor transport from railheads which was insufficient where large masses of men and guns were concentrated. When the Fourth Army advance resumed in August, the wisdom of not building light railways which would be left behind was argued by some, in favour of building standard gauge lines. Experience of crossing the beaten zone showed that such lines or metalled roads could not be built quickly enough to sustain an advance, and that pausing while communications caught up allowed the defenders to recover. On the Somme the daily carry during attacks on a front was and a few wood roads and rail lines were inadequate for the number of lorries and roads. A comprehensive system of transport was needed, which required a much greater diversion of personnel and equipment than had been expected.

=== Casualties ===

The Battle of the Somme was one of the costliest battles of World War I. The original Allied estimate of casualties on the Somme, made at the Chantilly Conference on 15 November 1916, was that the Germans suffered 630,000 casualties, exceeding the 485,000 suffered by the British and French. As one German officer wrote,

However, Churchill wrote that Allied casualties had exceeded German losses. In &quot;The World Crisis&quot; (first published in the early 1920s, reprinted in 1938), he quoted the German &quot;Reichsarchiv&quot; data, showing that on the Western Front between February and June 1916, the Germans had suffered against the French and July and the end of the year (Appendix J); he wrote that the Germans suffered at Verdun and that around one eighth of their casualties were suffered on &quot;quiet&quot; sectors. According to the tables, between July and October 1916, German forces on the Western Front suffered by the French and by the British; German forces inflicted on the Entente.

In 1931, Hermann Wendt published a comparison of German and British–French casualties which showed an average of 30 per cent more Allied casualties than German losses on the Somme. In the first 1916 volume of the British Official History (1932), J. E. Edmonds wrote that comparisons of casualties were inexact, because of different methods of calculation by the belligerents but that British casualties were total British casualties in France in the period of French Somme casualties were German casualties were to which should be added for woundings, which would have been counted as casualties using British criteria; Anglo-French casualties on the Somme were over German casualties were In the second 1916 volume of the British Official History (1938), Wilfrid Miles wrote that German casualties were and Anglo-French casualties were just under &quot;fresh data&quot; from the French and German official accounts.

The addition by Edmonds of to German figures, supposedly to make them comparable to British criteria, was criticised as &quot;spurious&quot; by M. J. Williams in 1964. McRandle and Quirk in 2006 cast doubt on the Edmonds calculations but counted casualties on the Western Front from July to December against Churchill, concluding that there had been fewer German losses than Anglo-French casualties but that the ability of the German army to inflict disproportionate losses had been eroded by attrition. In 2003 British historian Gary Sheffield wrote that the calculation by Edmonds of Anglo-French casualties was correct but the one for German casualties was &quot;discredited&quot;, quoting the official German figure of 

Doughty wrote that French losses on the Somme were &quot;surprisingly high&quot; at of the at Verdun. Prior and Wilson used Churchill&#x27;s research and wrote that the British suffered from 1 July to mid-November ( day) in inflicting casualties and offer no figures for French casualties or the losses they inflicted on the Germans. Sheldon wrote that the British lost &quot;over Harris wrote that British losses were casualties were over and German losses were to the &quot;best&quot; German sources. Sheffield wrote that the losses were &quot;appalling&quot;, with casualties, and &quot;perhaps&quot; casualties.

In a commentary on the debate about Somme casualties, Philpott used Miles&#x27;s figures of casualties and the French official figures of Army losses and Army casualties. Philpott described German losses as &quot;disputed&quot;, with estimates ranging from The high Allied casualties of July 1916 are not representative of the way attrition turned in the Allies&#x27; favour in September, although this was not sustained as the weather deteriorated. Philpott quoted Robin Prior (in &quot;Churchill&#x27;s World Crisis As History&quot; [1983]) that the &quot;blood test&quot; is a crude measure compared to manpower reserves, industrial capacity, farm productivity and financial resources and that intangible factors were more influential on the course of the war, which the Allies won despite &quot;losing&quot; the purely quantitative test.

== Commemoration ==

In the United Kingdom and Newfoundland, the Battle of the Somme became the central memory of World War I. The Royal British Legion with the British Embassy in Paris and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission commemorate the battle on 1 July each year, at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. For their efforts on the first day of the battle, the 1st Newfoundland Regiment was given the name &quot;The Royal Newfoundland Regiment&quot; by George V on 28 November 1917. The first day of the Battle of the Somme is commemorated in Newfoundland, remembering the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; at 11am on the Sunday nearest to 1 July. The Somme is remembered in Northern Ireland due to the participation of the 36th (Ulster) Division and commemorated by veterans&#x27; groups and by unionist/Protestant groups such as the Orange Order. The British Legion and others commemorate the battle on 1 July.
On 1 July 2016, at 7:28 a.m. British Summer Time, the UK observed a two minute silence to mark the start of the battle which began 100 years earlier. A special ceremony was broadcast on BBC1 and all BBC radio stations participated in the silence. At the start of the silence, the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a gun every four seconds for one hundred seconds and a whistle was blown to end it. Just like a Remembrance Sunday silence, a bugler played The Last Post after the silence. The silence was announced during a speech by the prime minister David Cameron who said, &quot;There will be a national two-minute silence on Friday morning. I will be attending a service at the Thiepval Memorial near the battlefield and it&#x27;s right that the whole country pauses to remember the sacrifices of all those who fought and lost their lives in that conflict.&quot; On 1 July 2016, a ceremony was held in Heaton Park in north Manchester in England, which was the site of a large army training camp during the war.

In Britain on 1 July 2016, 1,400 actors dressed in replica Great War British Army uniforms, walked about in streets and public open areas, from 7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. Each took on temporarily the identity of a British soldier who died on the first day of the Somme and handed out information cards about that soldier. They did not talk, except for occasionally singing &quot;We&#x27;re here because we&#x27;re here&quot; to the tune of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. This event was called &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot;.

==Histories of the battle==
The Battle of the Somme has been called the beginning of modern all-arms warfare, during which Kitchener&#x27;s Army learned to fight the mass-industrial war in which the continental armies had been engaged for two years. This view sees the British contribution to the battle as part of a coalition war and part of a process, which took the strategic initiative from the German Army and caused it irreparable damage, leading to its collapse in late 1918.

Haig and General Rawlinson have been criticised ever since 1916 for the human cost of the battle and for failing to achieve their territorial objectives. On 1 August 1916, Churchill, then out of office, criticised the British Army&#x27;s conduct of the offensive to the British Cabinet, claiming that though the battle had forced the Germans to end their offensive at Verdun, attrition was damaging the British armies more than the German armies. Though Churchill was unable to suggest an alternative, a critical view of the British on the Somme has been influential in English-language writing ever since. In 2016, historian Peter Barton argued in a series of three television programmes that the Battle of the Somme should be regarded as a German defensive victory.

John Terraine, Gary Sheffield, Christopher Duffy, Roger Chickering, Holger Herwig, William Philpott &quot;et al.&quot; wrote that there was no strategic alternative for the British in 1916 and that an understandable horror at British losses is insular, given the millions of casualties borne by the French and Russian armies since 1914. This school of thought sets the battle in a context of a general Allied offensive in 1916 and notes that German and French writing on the battle puts it in a continental perspective. Little German and French writing on this topic has been translated, leaving much of their historical perspective and detail of German and French military operations inaccessible to the English-speaking world.

<text>Ship commissioning is the act or ceremony of placing a ship in active service and may be regarded as a particular application of the general concepts and practices of project commissioning. The term is most commonly applied to placing a warship in active duty with its country&#x27;s military forces. The ceremonies involved are often rooted in centuries-old naval tradition.

Ship naming and launching endow a ship hull with her identity, but many milestones remain before it is completed and considered ready to be designated a commissioned ship. The engineering plant, weapon and electronic systems, galley, and other equipment required to transform the new hull into an operating and habitable warship are installed and tested. The prospective commanding officer, ship&#x27;s officers, the petty officers, and seamen who will form the crew report for training and familiarization with their new ship.

Before commissioning, the new ship undergoes sea trials to identify any deficiencies needing correction. The preparation and readiness time between christening-launching and commissioning may be as much as three years for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to as brief as twenty days for a World War II landing ship. USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, of American Civil War fame, was commissioned less than three weeks after launch.

== Pre-commissioning ==
Regardless of the type of ship in question, a vessel&#x27;s journey towards commissioning in its nation&#x27;s navy begins with a process known as sea trials. Sea trials usually take place some years after a vessel was laid down, and mark the interim step between the completion of a ship&#x27;s construction and its official acceptance for service with its nation&#x27;s navy.

Sea trials begin when the ship is floated out of its dry dock (or more rarely, moved by a vehicle to the sea from its construction hangar, as was the case with the submarine ), at which time the initial crew for a ship (usually a skeleton crew composed of yard workers and naval personnel; in the modern era of increasingly complex ships the crew will include technical representatives of the ship builder and major system subcontractors) will assume command of the vessel in question. The ship is then sailed in littoral waters to test the design, equipment, and other ship specific systems to ensure that they work properly and can handle the equipment that they will be using in the future. Tests during this phase can include launching missiles from missile magazines, firing the ship&#x27;s gun (if so equipped), conducting basic flight tests with rotary and fixed-wing aircraft that will be assigned to the ship, and various tests of the electronic and propulsion equipment. Often during this phase of testing problems arise relating to the state of the equipment on the ship, which can require returning to the builder&#x27;s shipyard to address those concerns.

In addition to problems with a ship&#x27;s arms, armament, and equipment, the sea trial phase a ship undergoes prior to commissioning can identify issues with the ship&#x27;s design that may need to be addressed before it can be accepted into service. During her sea trials in 1999 French Naval officials determined that the was too short to safely operate the E2C Hawkeye, resulting in her return to the builder&#x27;s shipyard for enlargement.

After a ship has successfully cleared its sea trial period, it will officially be accepted into service with its nation&#x27;s navy. At this point, the ship in question will undergo a process of degaussing and/or deperming, to reduce the ship&#x27;s magnetic signature.

== Commissioning ==
Once a ship&#x27;s sea trials are successfully completed, plans for the commissioning ceremony will take shape. Depending on the naval traditions of the nation in question, the commissioning ceremony may be an elaborately planned event with guests, the ship&#x27;s future crew, and other persons of interest in attendance, or the nation may forgo a ceremony and administratively place the ship in commission.

At a minimum, on the day on which the ship is to be commissioned the crew will report for duty aboard the ship and the commanding officer will read through the orders given for the ship and its personnel. If the ship&#x27;s ceremony is a public affair, the Captain may make a speech to the audience, along with other VIPs as the ceremony dictates. Religious ceremonies, such as blessing the ship or the singing of traditional hymns or songs may also occur.

Once a ship has been commissioned its final step toward becoming an active unit of the navy it serves is to report to its home port and officially load or accept any remaining equipment (such as munitions).

==Decommissioning==

To decommission a ship is to terminate its career in service in the armed forces of a nation. Unlike wartime ship losses, in which a vessel lost to enemy action is said to be struck, decommissioning confers that the ship has reached the end of its usable life and is being retired from a country&#x27;s navy. Depending on the naval traditions of the country, a ceremony commemorating the decommissioning of the ship may take place, or the vessel may be removed administratively with minimal fanfare. The term &quot;paid off&quot; is alternatively used in British and Commonwealth contexts, originating in the age-of-sail practice of ending an officer&#x27;s commission and paying crew wages once the ship completed its voyage.

Ship decommissioning usually occurs some years after the ship was commissioned and is intended to serve as a means by which a vessel that has become too old or obsolete can be retired with honor from the country&#x27;s armed forces. Decommissioning of the vessel may also occur due to treaty agreements (such as the Washington Naval Treaty) or for safety reasons (such as a ship&#x27;s nuclear reactor and associated parts reaching the end of their service life), depending on the type of ship being decommissioned. In a limited number of cases a ship may be decommissioned if the vessel in question is judged to be damaged beyond economical repair, as was the case with , or . In rare cases, a navy or its associated country may recommission or leave a ship that is old or obsolete in commission with the regular force rather than decommissioning the vessel in question due to the historical significance or public sentiment for the ship in question. This is the case with the ships and . Vessels preserved in this manner typically do not relinquish their names to other, more modern ships that may be in the design, planning, or construction phase of the parent nation&#x27;s navy.

Prior to its formal decommissioning, the ship in question will begin the process of decommissioning by going through a preliminary step called inactivation or deactivation. During this phase, a ship will report to a naval facility owned by the country to permit the ship&#x27;s crew to offload, remove, and dismantle the ship&#x27;s weapons, ammunition, electronics, and other material that is judged to be of further use to the nation. The removed material from a ship usually ends up either rotating to another ship in the class with similar weapons and/or capabilities, or in storage pending a decision on equipment&#x27;s fate. During this time a ship&#x27;s crew may be thinned out via transfers and reassignments as the ongoing removal of equipment renders certain personnel (such as missile technicians or gun crews) unable to perform their duties on the ship in question. Certain aspects of a ship&#x27;s deactivation – such as the removal or deactivation of a ship&#x27;s nuclear weapons capabilities – may be governed by international treaties, which can result in the presence of foreign officials authorized to inspect the weapon or weapon system to ensure compliance with treaties. Other aspects of a ship&#x27;s decommissioning, such as the reprocessing of nuclear fuel from a ship utilizing a nuclear reactor or the removal of hazardous materials from a ship, are handled by the government according to the nation&#x27;s domestic policies. When a ship finishes its inactivation, it is then formally decommissioned, after which the ship is usually towed to a storage facility.

In addition to the economic advantages of retiring a ship that has grown maintenance intensive or obsolete, the decommissioning frees up the name used by the ship, allowing vessels currently in the planning or building stages to inherit the name of that warship. Often, but not always, ships that are decommissioned spend the next few years in a reserve fleet before their ultimate fate is decided.

==Practices by nation==
===United States Navy===

Commissioning in the early United States Navy under sail was attended by no ceremony. An officer designated to command a new ship received orders similar to those issued to Captain Thomas Truxtun in 1798:
In Truxtun&#x27;s time, the prospective commanding officer had responsibility for overseeing construction details, outfitting the ship, and recruiting his crew. When a captain determined that his new ship was ready to take to sea, he mustered the crew on deck, read his orders, broke the national ensign and distinctive commissioning pennant, and caused the watch to be set and the first entry to be made in the log. Thus, the ship was placed in commission.

Commissionings were not public affairs, and unlike christening-and-launching ceremonies, were not recorded by newspapers. The first specific reference to commissioning located in naval records is a letter of November 6, 1863, from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to all navy yards and stations. The Secretary directed: &quot;Hereafter the commandants of navy yards and stations will inform the Department, by special report of the date when each vessel preparing for sea service at their respective commands, is placed in commission.&quot;

Subsequently, various editions of Navy regulations mentioned the act of putting a ship in commission, but details of a commissioning ceremony were not prescribed. Through custom and usage, a fairly standard practice emerged, the essentials of which are outlined in current Navy regulations. Craft assigned to Naval Districts and shore bases for local use, such as harbor tugs and floating drydocks, are not usually placed in commission but are instead given an &quot;in service&quot; status. They do fly the national ensign, but not a commissioning pennant.

In modern times, officers and crew members of a new warship are assembled on the quarterdeck or other suitable area. Formal transfer of the ship to the prospective commanding officer is done by the Chief of Naval Operations or his representative. The national anthem is played, the transferring officer reads the commissioning directive, the ensign is hoisted, and the commissioning pennant broken. The prospective commanding officer reads his orders, assumes command, and the first watch is set. Following, the sponsor is traditionally invited to give the first order to the ship&#x27;s company: &quot;Man our ship and bring her to life!&quot;, whereupon the ship&#x27;s assigned crew would run on board and man the rails of the ship.

In recent years, commissionings have become more public occasions. Most commonly assisted by a Commissioning Support Team (CST), the Prospective Commanding Officer and ship&#x27;s crew, shipbuilder executives, and senior Navy representatives gather for a formal ceremony placing the ship in active service (in commission). Guests, including the ship&#x27;s sponsor, are frequently invited to attend, and a prominent individual delivers a commissioning address. On May 3, 1975, more than 20,000 people witnessed the commissioning of at Norfolk, Virginia. The carrier&#x27;s sponsor, daughter of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, was introduced, and U.S. President Gerald R. Ford was the principal speaker.

Regardless of the type of ship, the brief commissioning ceremony completes the cycle from christening and launching to bring the ship into full status as a warship of her nation.

<doc id="60930" wikidata="Q596643" url="?curid=60930" title="Ceremonial ship launching">
<text>Ceremonial ship launching involves the performing of ceremonies associated with the process of transferring a vessel to the water. It is a nautical tradition in many cultures, dating back millennia, to accompany the physical process with ceremonies which have been observed as public celebration and a solemn blessing, usually but not always, in association with the launch itself.

Ship launching imposes stresses on the ship not met during normal operation and in addition to the size and weight of the vessel represents a considerable engineering challenge as well as a public spectacle. The process also involves many traditions intended to invite good luck, such as christening by breaking a sacrificial bottle of champagne over the bow as the ship is named aloud and launched.

==Methods==
There are three principal methods of conveying a new ship from building site to water, only two of which are called &quot;launching&quot;. The oldest, most familiar, and most widely used is the end-on launch, in which the vessel slides down an inclined slipway, usually stern first. With the side launch, the ship enters the water broadside. This method came into use in the 19th century on inland waters, rivers, and lakes, and was more widely adopted during World War II. The third method is float-out, used for ships that are built in basins or dry docks and then floated by admitting water into the dock.

If launched in a restrictive waterway, drag chains are used to slow the ship speed to prevent it striking the opposite bank.

===Stern-first===

Normally, ways are arranged perpendicular to the shore line (or as nearly so as the water and maximum length of vessel allows) and the ship is built with its stern facing the water. Where the launch takes place into a narrow river, the building slips may be at a shallow angle rather than perpendicular, even though this requires a longer slipway when launching. Modern slipways take the form of a reinforced concrete mat of sufficient strength to support the vessel, with two &quot;barricades&quot; that extend well below the water level taking into account tidal variations. The barricades support the two launch ways. The vessel is built upon temporary cribbing that is arranged to give access to the hull&#x27;s outer bottom and to allow the launchways to be erected under the complete hull. When it is time to prepare for launching, a pair of standing ways is erected under the hull and out onto the barricades. The surface of the ways is greased. (Tallow and whale oil were used as grease in sailing ship days.) 
A pair of sliding ways is placed on top, under the hull, and a launch cradle with bow and stern poppets is erected on these sliding ways. The weight of the hull is then transferred from the build cribbing onto the launch cradle. Provision is made to hold the vessel in place and then release it at the appropriate moment in the launching ceremony; common mechanisms include weak links designed to be cut at a signal and mechanical triggers controlled by a switch from the ceremonial platform.

On launching, the vessel slides backwards down the slipway on the ways until it floats by itself.

===Sideways===

Some slipways are built so that the vessel is side-on to the water and is launched sideways. This is done where the limitations of the water channel would not allow lengthwise launching, but occupies a much greater length of shore. &quot;The Great Eastern&quot; designed by Brunel was built this way, as were many landing craft during World War II. This method requires many more sets of ways to support the weight of the ship.

===Air-bag===

Sometimes ships are launched using a series of inflated tubes underneath the hull, which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water. This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull of the ship and aid its launching motion into the water, thus this method is arguably safer than other options such as sideways launching. These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with hemispherical heads at both ends.

==Traditions==
===Ancient===
A Babylonian narrative dating from the 3rd millennium BC describes the completion of a ship:
Openings to the water I stopped;&lt;br&gt;
I searched for cracks and the wanting parts I fixed:&lt;br&gt;
Three &quot;sari&quot; of bitumen I poured over the outside;&lt;br&gt;
To the gods I caused oxen to be sacrificed.
It is believed that ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans called on their gods to protect seamen. Favor was evoked from the monarch of the seas—Poseidon in Greek mythology, Neptune in Roman mythology. Ship launching participants in ancient Greece wreathed their heads with olive branches, drank wine to honor the gods, and poured water on the new vessel as a symbol of blessing. Shrines were carried on board Greek and Roman ships, and this practice extended into the Middle Ages. The shrine was usually placed at the quarterdeck, an area which continues to have special ceremonial significance.

Different peoples and cultures shaped the religious ceremonies surrounding a ship launching. Jews and Christians customarily used wine and water as they called upon God to safeguard them at sea. Intercession of the saints and the blessing of the church were asked by Christians. Ship launchings in the Ottoman Empire were accompanied by prayers to Allah, the sacrifice of sheep, and appropriate feasting.

Chaplain Henry Teonge of Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy left an interesting account of a warship launch, a &quot;briganteen of 23 oars,&quot; by the Knights of Malta in 1675:

Two fryers and an attendant went into the vessel, and kneeling down prayed halfe an houre, and layd their hands on every mast, and other places of the vessel, and sprinkled her all over with holy water. Then they came out and hoysted a pendent to signify she was a man of war; then at once thrust her into the water.
===Early Modern Age===
The liturgical aspects of ship christenings, or baptisms, continued in Catholic countries, while the Reformation seems to have put a stop to them for a time in Protestant Europe. By the 17th century, for example, English launchings were secular affairs. The christening party for the launch of the 64-gun ship of the line in 1610 included the Prince of Wales and famed naval constructor Phineas Pett, who was master shipwright at the Woolwich yard. Pett described the proceedings:

The &quot;standing cup&quot; was a large cup fashioned of precious metal. When the ship began to slide down the ways, the presiding official took a ceremonial sip of wine from the cup, and poured the rest on the deck or over the bow. Usually the cup was thrown overboard and belonged to the lucky retriever. As navies grew larger and launchings more frequent, economy dictated that the costly cup be caught in a net for reuse at other launchings. Late in 17th century Britain, the standing-cup ceremony was replaced by the practice of breaking a bottle across the bow.

==By country==

Launching could be said to mark the birth of a vessel; and people throughout history have performed launching ceremonies, in part to appeal for good fortune and the safety of each new vessel.

===Canada===
In Canada, Aboriginal peoples will perform ceremonies at the launching of vessels along with other methods of launching.

===France===
French ship launchings and christenings in the 18th and early 19th centuries were accompanied by unique rites closely resembling marriage and baptismal ceremonies. A godfather for the new ship presented a godmother with a bouquet of flowers as both said the ship&#x27;s name. No bottle was broken, but a priest pronounced the vessel&#x27;s name and blessed it with holy water.

===India===
In India, ships have historically been launched with a Puja ceremony that dedicates the ship to a Hindu god or goddess, and seeks blessings for her and her sailors. Historically, Hindu priests would perform the &quot;puja&quot; ceremony at launch. In the 20th century, ships were launched with a lady breaking a coconut on the bow of the vessel, which is sometimes followed by a small Puja.

===Japan===
Japanese ship launchings incorporate silver axes which are thought to bring good luck and scare away evil. Japanese shipbuilders traditionally order the crafting of a special axe for each new vessel; and after the launching ceremony, they present the axe to the vessel&#x27;s owner as a commemorative gift. The axe is used to cut the rope which tethers the ship to the place where she was built.

===United Kingdom===
Sponsors of British warships were customarily members of the royal family, senior naval officers, or Admiralty officials. A few civilians were invited to sponsor Royal Navy ships during the nineteenth century, and women became sponsors for the first time. In 1875, a religious element was returned to naval christenings by Princess Alexandra, wife of the Prince of Wales, when she introduced an Anglican choral service in the launching ceremony for battleship . The usage continues with the singing of Psalm 107 with its special meaning to mariners:
They that go down to the sea in ships;&lt;br&gt;
That do business in great waters;&lt;br&gt;
These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.
In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II named the ocean liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; after herself, instead of the older liner , by saying, &quot;I name this ship &quot;Queen Elizabeth the Second&quot;. May God bless her and all who sail in her.&quot; On 4 July 2014, the Queen named the Royal Navy&#x27;s new aircraft carrier with a bottle of single malt Scotch whisky from the Bowmore distillery on the island of Islay instead of champagne because the ship had been built and launched in Scotland. The Duchess of Rothesay similarly launched by pulling a lever which smashed a bottle of single malt Scotch whisky at the side of the ship.
At the 2024 launching of CalMac ferry &quot;Glen Rosa&quot;, newly-qualified welder Beth Atkinson named the ship and pulled a lever to similarly smash a bottle, of single malt from the Ardgowan distillery at nearby Inverkip.

Shipyard ephemera is a rich source of detail concerning a launch and this was often material produced for the audience of the day and then thrown away. Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums has many of these items from Tyne and Wear shipyards. A number can be seen in Commons. The 1900 piece for reproduced in this article lists a woman performing the launch.

===United States===

Ceremonial practices for christening and launching ships in the United States have their roots in Europe. Descriptions are not plentiful for launching American Revolutionary War naval vessels, but a local newspaper detailed the launch of Continental frigate at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in May 1776:

It was customary for the builders to celebrate a ship launching. Rhode Island authorities were charged with overseeing construction of frigates and . They voted the sum of fifty dollars () to the master builder of each yard &quot;to be expended in providing an entertainment for the carpenters that worked on the ships.&quot; Five pounds () was spent for lime juice for the launching festivities of frigate at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suggesting that the &quot;entertainment&quot; included a potent punch with lime juice as an ingredient.

No mention has come to light of christening a Continental Navy ship during the American Revolution. The first ships of the Continental Navy were , , , and . These were former merchantmen, and their names were assigned during conversion and outfitting. Later, Congress authorized the construction of thirteen frigates, and no names were assigned until after four had launched.

The first description that we have of an American warship christening is that of at Boston, October 21, 1797, famous as &quot;Old Ironsides.&quot; Her sponsor was Captain James Sever, USN, who stood on the weather deck at the bow. &quot;At fifteen minutes after twelve she commenced a movement into the water with such steadiness, majesty and exactness as to fill every heart with sensations of joy and delight.&quot; As &quot;Constitution&quot; ran out, Captain Sever broke a bottle of fine old Madeira over the heel of the bowsprit.

Frigate had an interesting launching on April 10, 1800, at New York:

As the 19th century progressed, American ship launchings continued to be festive occasions, but with no set ritual except that the sponsor(s) used some &quot;christening fluid&quot; as the ship received her name.

Sloop of war was launched in 1828 and was &quot;christened by a young lady of Portsmouth.&quot; This is the first known instance of a woman sponsoring a United States Navy vessel. The contemporaneous account does not name her. The first &quot;identified&quot; woman sponsor was Lavinia Fanning Watson, daughter of a prominent Philadelphian. She broke a bottle of wine and water over the bow of sloop-of-war at Philadelphia Navy Yard on August 22, 1846.

Women as sponsors became increasingly the rule, but not universally so. As sloop-of-war &quot;glided along the inclined plane&quot; in 1846, &quot;two young sailors, one stationed at each side of her head, anointed her with bottles, and named her as she left her cradle for the deep.&quot; As late as 1898, the torpedo boat was christened by the son of the builder.

Wine is the traditional christening fluid, although numerous other liquids have been used. and were sent on their way in 1843 with whisky. Seven years later, &quot;a bottle of best brandy was broken over the bow of steam sloop .&quot; Steam frigate earned her place in naval history as Confederate States of America ironclad , and she was baptized with water from the Merrimack River. Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s famous American Civil War flagship steam sloop was christened by three sponsors; two young ladies broke bottles of Connecticut River water and Hartford, Connecticut spring water, while a naval lieutenant completed the ceremony with a bottle of sea water.

Champagne came into popular use as a christening fluid as the 19th century closed. A granddaughter of Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy wet the bow of , the Navy&#x27;s first steel battleship, with champagne at the New York Navy Yard on November 18, 1890. The effects of national prohibition on alcoholic beverages were reflected to some extent in ship christenings. Cruisers and , for example, were christened with water; the submarine &quot;V-6&quot; with cider. However, battleship appropriately received her name with California wine in 1919. Champagne returned in 1922, but only for the launch of light cruiser .
Rigid naval airships , , , and were built during the 1920s and early 1930s, carried on the Naval Vessel Register, and each was formally commissioned. The earliest First Lady of the United States to act as sponsor was Grace Coolidge who christened the airship &quot;Los Angeles&quot;. Lou Henry Hoover christened &quot;Akron&quot; in 1931, but the customary bottle was not used. Instead, the First Lady pulled a cord which opened a hatch in the airship&#x27;s towering nose to release a flock of pigeons.

Thousands of ships of every description came off the ways during World War II, the concerted effort of a mobilized American industry. The historic christening and launching ceremonies continued, but travel restrictions, other wartime considerations, and sheer numbers dictated that such occasions be less elaborate than those in the years before the war. 

On 15 December 1941, the United States Maritime Commission announced that all formal launching ceremonies would be discontinued for merchant ships being constructed under its authority, though simple informal ceremonies could continue without reimbursement to builders.

In recent history, all U.S. Navy sponsors have been female. In addition to the ceremonial breaking of a champagne bottle on the bow, the sponsor remains in contact with the ship&#x27;s crew and is involved in special events such as homecomings.

==Incidents==

* sank moments after her launching at a shipyard in Govan, Glasgow, Scotland on 3 July 1883. As &quot;Daphne&quot; moved into the river, the anchors failed to stop the ship&#x27;s forward progress. The starboard anchor moved only , but the port anchor was dragged . The current of the river caught &quot;Daphne&quot; and flipped it onto its port side, sinking it in deep water. 124 died including many young boys, some of whose relatives were there on shore.
* launched on 21 June 1898. &quot;Albion&quot; created a wave with her entry into the water after the Duchess of York christened her. The wave caused a stage to collapse on which 200 people were watching; it slid into a side creek, and 34 people drowned, mostly women and children. This was probably one of the first-ever ship launchings to be filmed.
* In 1907, the Italian ocean liner capsized and sank upon launch.
* In 2011, the luxury boat SS &quot;Jiugang&quot; sank at launch in Lanzhou, China.

<text>A phenomenon (: phenomena), sometimes spelled phaenomenon, is an observable event. The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the noumenon, which &quot;cannot&quot; be directly observed. Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. Far predating this, the ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus also used &quot;phenomenon&quot; and &quot;noumenon&quot; as interrelated technical terms.

== Common usage ==
In popular usage, a &quot;phenomenon&quot; often refers to an extraordinary, unusual or notable event. According to the &quot;Dictionary of Visual Discourse&quot;:In ordinary language &#x27;phenomenon/phenomena&#x27; refer to any occurrence worthy of note and investigation, typically an untoward or unusual event, person or fact that is of special significance or otherwise notable.

== Philosophy ==

In modern philosophical use, the term &quot;phenomena&quot; means things as they are experienced through the senses and processed by the mind as distinct from things in and of themselves (&quot;noumena&quot;). In his inaugural dissertation, titled &quot;On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World&quot;, Immanuel Kant (1770) theorizes that the human mind is restricted to the logical world and thus can only interpret and understand occurrences according to their physical appearances. He wrote that humans could infer only as much as their senses allowed, but not experience the actual object itself. Thus, the term &quot;phenomenon&quot; refers to any incident deserving of inquiry and investigation, especially processes and events which are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance.

==Science==
In scientific usage, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, including the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data. Especially in physics, the study of a phenomenon may be described as measurements related to matter, energy, or time, such as Isaac Newton&#x27;s observations of the Moon&#x27;s orbit and of gravity; or Galileo Galilei&#x27;s observations of the motion of a pendulum.

In natural sciences, a phenomenon is an observable happening or event. Often, this term is used without considering the causes of a particular event. Example of a physical phenomenon is an observable phenomenon of the lunar orbit or the phenomenon of oscillations of a pendulum.

A mechanical phenomenon is a physical phenomenon associated with the equilibrium or motion of objects. Some examples are Newton&#x27;s cradle, engines, and double pendulums.

== Sociology ==

Group phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its own behaviors not possible for an individual because of the herd mentality.

Social phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term. Attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group, and either be adapted by the larger society, or seen as aberrant, being punished or shunned.

<text>The Sudarium of Oviedo, or Shroud of Oviedo, is a bloodstained piece of cloth measuring c. 84 x 53 cm (33 x 21 inches) kept in the Cámara Santa of the Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo, Spain. The Sudarium (Latin for &quot;sweat cloth&quot;) is thought to be the cloth that was wrapped around the head of Jesus Christ after he died as described in John 20:6–7.

The cloth has been dated to around AD 700 by radiocarbon dating. However, at the same conference at which this information was presented, it was noted that in actuality the cloth has a definite history extending back to approximately AD 570. The laboratory noted that later oil contamination could have resulted in the late dating.

The small chapel housing it was built specifically for the cloth by King Alfonso II of Asturias in AD 840; the Arca Santa is an elaborate reliquary chest with a Romanesque metal frontal for the storage of the Sudarium and other relics. The Sudarium is displayed to the public three times a year: Good Friday, the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross on 14 September, and its octave on 21 September.

==Background and history==
The Sudarium shows signs of advanced deterioration, with dark flecks that are symmetrically arranged but form no image, unlike the markings on the Shroud of Turin. The face cloth is mentioned as having been present in the empty tomb in . Outside of the Bible the Sudarium is first mentioned in AD 570 by Antoninus of Piacenza, who writes that the Sudarium was being cared for in the vicinity of Jerusalem in a cave near the monastery of Saint Mark.

The Sudarium is presumed to have been taken from Israel in AD 614, after the invasion of the Byzantine provinces by the Sassanid Persian King Khosrau II. In order to avoid destruction in the invasion, it was taken away first to Alexandria by the presbyter Philip, then carried through northern Africa when Khosrau II conquered Alexandria in AD 616 and arrived in Spain shortly thereafter. The Sudarium entered Spain at Cartagena, along with people who were fleeing from the Persians. Fulgentius, bishop of Ecija, welcomed the refugees and the relics, and gave the chest containing the Sudarium to Leandro, bishop of Seville. He took it to Seville, where it spent some years.

In AD 657, it was moved to Toledo, then in AD 718 on to northern Spain to escape the advancing Moors. The Sudarium was hidden in the mountains of Asturias in a cave known as Montesacro until king Alfonso II, having battled back the Moors, built a chapel in Oviedo to house it in AD 840.

On 14 March 1075, King Alfonso VI, his sister and Rodrigo Diaz Vivar (El Cid) opened the chest after days of fasting. The event was recorded on a document preserved in the Capitular Archives at the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo. The king had the oak chest covered in silver with an inscription which reads, &quot;The Sacred Sudarium of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;

<doc id="60933" wikidata="Q876377" url="?curid=60933" title="Triboelectric effect">
<text>The triboelectric effect (also known as triboelectricity, triboelectric charging, triboelectrification, or tribocharging) describes electric charge transfer between two objects when they contact or slide against each other. It can occur with different materials, such as the sole of a shoe on a carpet, or between two pieces of the same material. It is ubiquitous, and occurs with differing amounts of charge transfer (tribocharge) for all solid materials. There is evidence that tribocharging can occur between combinations of solids, liquids and gases, for instance liquid flowing in a solid tube or an aircraft flying through air.

Often static electricity is a consequence of the triboelectric effect when the charge stays on one or both of the objects and is not conducted away. The term triboelectricity has been used to refer to the field of study or the general phenomenon of the triboelectric effect, or to the static electricity that results from it. When there is no sliding, tribocharging is sometimes called contact electrification, and any static electricity generated is sometimes called contact electricity. The terms are often used interchangeably, and may be confused.

Triboelectric charge plays a major role in industries such as packaging of pharmaceutical powders, and in many processes such as dust storms and planetary formation. It can also increase friction and adhesion. While many aspects of the triboelectric effect are now understood and extensively documented, significant disagreements remain in the current literature about the underlying details.

== History ==

The historical development of triboelectricity is interwoven with work on static electricity and electrons themselves. Experiments involving triboelectricity and static electricity occurred before the discovery of the electron. The name (ἤλεκτρον) is Greek for amber, which is connected to the recording of electrostatic charging by Thales of Miletus around 585 BCE, and possibly others even earlier. The prefix &quot;&quot; (Greek for &#x27;rub&#x27;) refers to sliding, friction and related processes, as in tribology.

From the axial age (8th to 3rd century BC) the attraction of materials due to static electricity by rubbing amber and the attraction of magnetic materials were considered to be similar or the same. There are indications that it was known both in Europe and outside, for instance China and other places. Syrian women used amber whorls in weaving and exploited the triboelectric properties, as noted by Pliny the Elder.

The effect was mentioned in records from the medieval period. Archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica, Greek scholar and writer of the 12th century, records that Woliver, king of the Goths, could draw sparks from his body. He also states that a philosopher was able, while dressing, to draw sparks from his clothes, similar to the report by Robert Symmer of his silk stocking experiments, which may be found in the 1759 Philosophical Transactions.
It is generally considered that the first major scientific analysis was by William Gilbert in his publication De Magnete in 1600. He discovered that many more materials than amber such as sulphur, wax, glass could produce static electricity when rubbed, and that moisture prevented electrification. Others such as Sir Thomas Browne made important contributions slightly later, both in terms of materials and the first use of the word electricity in Pseudodoxia Epidemica. He noted that metals did not show triboelectric charging, perhaps because the charge was conducted away. An important step was around 1663 when Otto von Guericke invented a machine that could automate triboelectric charge generation, making it much easier to produce more tribocharge; other electrostatic generators followed. For instance, shown in the Figure is an electrostatic generator built by Francis Hauksbee the Younger. Another key development was in the 1730s when C. F. du Fay pointed out that there were two types of charge which he named &quot;vitreous&quot; and &quot;resinous&quot;. These names corresponded to the glass (vitreous) rods and bituminous coal, amber, or sealing wax (resinous) used in du Fay&#x27;s experiments. These names were used throughout the 19th century. The use of the terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; for types of electricity grew out of the independent work of Benjamin Franklin around 1747 where he ascribed electricity to an over- or under- abundance of an electrical fluid.

At about the same time Johan Carl Wilcke published in his 1757 PhD thesis a triboelectric series. In this work materials were listed in order of the polarity of charge separation when they are touched or slide against another. A material towards the bottom of the series, when touched to a material near the top of the series, will acquire a more negative charge.

The first systematic analysis of triboelectricity is considered to be the work of Jean Claude Eugène Péclet in 1834. He studied triboelectric charging for a range of conditions such as the material, pressure and rubbing of surfaces. It was some time before there were further quantitative works by Owen in 1909 and Jones in 1915. The most extensive early set of experimental analyses was from 1914–1930 by the group of Professor Shaw, who laid much of the foundation of experimental knowledge. In a series of papers he: was one of the first to mention some of the failings of the triboelectric series, also showing that heat had a major effect on tribocharging; analyzed in detail where different materials would fall in a triboelectric series, at the same time pointing out anomalies; separately analyzed glass and solid elements and solid elements and textiles, carefully measuring both tribocharging and friction; analyzed charging due to air-blown particles; demonstrated that surface strain and relaxation played a critical role for a range of materials, and examined the tribocharging of many different elements with silica.

Much of this work predates an understanding of solid state variations of energies levels with position, and also band bending. It was in the early 1950s in the work of authors such as Vick that these were taken into account along with concepts such as quantum tunnelling and behavior such as Schottky barrier effects, as well as including models such as asperities for contacts based upon the work of Frank Philip Bowden and David Tabor.

== Basic characteristics ==
Triboelectric charging occurs when two materials are brought into contact then separated, or slide against each other. An example is rubbing a plastic pen on a shirt sleeve made of cotton, wool, polyester, or the blended fabrics used in modern clothing. An electrified pen will attract and pick up pieces of paper less than a square centimeter, and will repel a similarly electrified pen. This repulsion is detectable by hanging both pens on threads and setting them near one another. Such experiments led to the theory of two types of electric charge, one being the negative of the other, with a simple sum respecting signs giving the total charge. The electrostatic attraction of the charged plastic pen to neutral uncharged pieces of paper (for example) is due to induced dipoles in the paper.

The triboelectric effect can be unpredictable because many details are often not controlled. Phenomena which do not have a simple explanation have been known for many years. For instance, as early as 1910, Jaimeson observed that for a piece of cellulose, the sign of the charge was dependent upon whether it was bent concave or convex during rubbing. The same behavior with curvature was reported in 1917 by Shaw, who noted that the effect of curvature with different materials made them either more positive or negative. In 1920, Richards pointed out that for colliding particles the velocity and mass played a role, not just what the materials were. In 1926, Shaw pointed out that with two pieces of identical material, the sign of the charge transfer from &quot;rubber&quot; to &quot;rubbed&quot; could change with time.

There are other more recent experimental results which also do not have a simple explanation. For instance the work of Burgo and Erdemir, which showed that the sign of charge transfer reverses between when a tip is pushing into a substrate versus when it pulls out; the detailed work of Lee et al and Forward, Lacks and Sankaran and others measuring the charge transfer during collisions between particles of zirconia of different size but the same composition, with one size charging positive, the other negative; the observations using sliding or Kelvin probe force microscope of inhomogeneous charge variations between nominally identical materials.
The details of how and why tribocharging occurs are not established science as of 2023. One component is the difference in the work function (also called the electron affinity) between the two materials. This can lead to charge transfer as, for instance, analyzed by Harper. As has been known since at least 1953, the contact potential is part of the process but does not explain many results, such as the ones mentioned in the last two paragraphs. Many studies have pointed out issues with the work function difference (Volta potential) as a complete explanation. There is also the question of why sliding is often important. Surfaces have many nanoscale asperities where the contact is taking place, which has been taken into account in many approaches to triboelectrification. Alessandro Volta and Hermann von Helmholtz suggested that the role of sliding was to produce more contacts per second. In modern terms, the idea is that electrons move many times faster than atoms, so the electrons are always in equilibrium when atoms move (the Born–Oppenheimer approximation). With this approximation, each asperity contact during sliding is equivalent to a stationary one; there is no direct coupling between the sliding velocity and electron motion. An alternative view (beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation) is that sliding acts as a quantum mechanical pump which can excite electrons to go from one material to another. A different suggestion is that local heating during sliding matters, an idea first suggested by Frenkel in 1941. Other papers have considered that local bending at the nanoscale produces voltages which help drive charge transfer via the flexoelectric effect. There are also suggestions that surface or trapped charges are important. More recently there have been attempts to include a full solid state description.

== Explanations and mechanisms ==
From early work starting around the end of the 19th century a large amount of information is available about what, empirically, causes triboelectricity. While there is extensive experimental data on triboelectricity there is not as yet full scientific consensus on the source, or perhaps more probably the sources. Some aspects are established, and will be part of the full picture:
* Work function differences between the two materials.
* Local curvature, strain and roughness.
* The forces used during sliding, and the velocities when particles collide as well as the sizes.
* The electronic structure of the materials, and the crystallographic orientation of the two contacting materials.
* Surface or interface states, as well as environmental factors such as humidity.

=== Triboelectric series ===
An empirical approach to triboelectricity is a triboelectric series&quot;.&quot; This is a list of materials ordered by how they develop a charge relative to other materials on the list. Johan Carl Wilcke published the first one in a 1757 paper. The series was expanded by Shaw and Henniker by including natural and synthetic polymers, and included alterations in the sequence depending on surface and environmental conditions. Lists vary somewhat as to the order of some materials.

Another triboelectric series based on measuring the triboelectric charge density of materials was proposed by the group of Zhong Lin Wang. The triboelectric charge density of the tested materials was measured with respect to liquid mercury in a glove box under well-defined conditions, with fixed temperature, pressure and humidity.

It is known that this approach is too simple and unreliable. There are many cases where there are triangles: material A is positive when rubbed against B, B is positive when rubbed against C, and C is positive when rubbed against A, an issue mentioned by Shaw in 1914. This cannot be explained by a linear series; cyclic series are inconsistent with the empirical triboelectric series. Furthermore, there are many cases where charging occurs with contacts between two pieces of the same material. This has been modelled as a consequence of the electric fields from local bending (flexoelectricity).

=== Work function differences ===

In all materials there is a positive electrostatic potential from the positive atomic nuclei, partially balanced by a negative electrostatic potential of what can be described as a sea of electrons. The average potential is positive, what is called the &quot;mean inner potential&quot; (MIP). Different materials have different MIPs, depending upon the types of atoms and how close they are. At a surface the electrons also spill out a little into the vacuum, as analyzed in detail by Kohn and Liang. This leads to a dipole at the surface. Combined, the dipole and the MIP lead to a potential barrier for electrons to leave a material which is called the work function.

A rationalization of the triboelectric series is that different members have different work functions, so electrons can go from the material with a small work function to one with a large. The potential difference between the two materials is called the Volta potential, also called the &quot;contact potential&quot;. Experiments have validated the importance of this for metals and other materials. However, because the surface dipoles vary for different surfaces of any solid the contact potential is not a universal parameter. By itself it cannot explain many of the results which were established in the early 20th century.

=== Electromechanical contributions ===
Whenever a solid is strained, electric fields can be generated. One process is due to linear strains, and is called piezoelectricity, the second depends upon how rapidly strains are changing with distance (derivative) and is called flexoelectricity. Both are established science, and can be both measured and calculated using density functional theory methods. Because flexoelectricity depends upon a gradient it can be much larger at the nanoscale during sliding or contact of asperity between two objects.

There has been considerable work on the connection between piezoelectricity and triboelectricity. While it can be important, piezoelectricity only occurs in the small number of materials which do not have inversion symmetry, so it is not a general explanation. It has recently been suggested that flexoelectricity may be very important in triboelectricity as it occurs in all insulators and semiconductors. Quite a few of the experimental results such as the effect of curvature can be explained by this approach, although full details have not as yet been determined. There is also early work from Shaw and Hanstock, and from the group of Daniel Lacks demonstrating that strain matters.

=== Capacitor charge compensation model ===
An explanation that has appeared in different forms is analogous to charge on a capacitor. If there is a potential difference between two materials due to the difference in their work functions (contact potential), this can be thought of as equivalent to the potential difference across a capacitor. The charge to compensate this is that which cancels the electric field. If an insulating dielectric is in between the two materials, then this will lead to a polarization density formula_1 and a bound surface charge of formula_2, where formula_3 is the surface normal. The total charge in the capacitor is then the combination of the bound surface charge from the polarization and that from the potential.

The triboelectric charge from this compensation model has been frequently considered as a key component. If the additional polarization due to strain (piezoelectricity) or bending of samples (flexoelectricity) is included this can explain observations such as the effect of curvature or inhomogeneous charging.

=== Electron and/or ion transfer ===
There is debate about whether electrons or ions are transferred in triboelectricity. For instance, Harper discusses both possibilities, whereas Vick was more in favor of electron transfer. The debate remains to this day with, for instance, George M. Whitesides advocating for ions, while Diaz and Fenzel-Alexander as well as Laurence D. Marks support both, and others just electrons.

=== Thermodynamic irreversibility ===

In the latter half of the 20th century the Soviet school led by chemist Boris Derjaguin argued that triboelectricity and the associated phenomenon of triboluminescence are fundamentally irreversible. A similar point of view to Derjaguin&#x27;s has been more recently advocated by Seth Putterman and his collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

A proposed theory of triboelectricity as a fundamentally irreversible process was published in 2020 by theoretical physicists Robert Alicki and Alejandro Jenkins. They argued that the electrons in the two materials that slide against each other have different velocities, giving a non-equilibrium state. Quantum effects cause this imbalance to pump electrons from one material to the other. This is a fermionic analog of the mechanism of rotational superradiance originally described by Yakov Zeldovich for bosons. Electrons are pumped in both directions, but small differences in the electronic potential landscapes for the two surfaces can cause net charging. Alicki and Jenkins argue that such an irreversible pumping is needed to understand how the triboelectric effect can generate an electromotive force.

=== Humidity ===
Generally, increased humidity (water in the air) leads to a decrease in the magnitude of triboelectric charging. The size of this effect varies greatly depending on the contacting materials; the decrease in charging ranges from up to a factor of 10 or more to very little humidity dependence. Some experiments find increased charging at moderate humidity compared to extremely dry conditions before a subsequent decrease at higher humidity. The most widespread explanation is that higher humidity leads to more water adsorbed at the surface of contacting materials, leading to a higher surface conductivity. The higher conductivity allows for greater charge recombination as contacts separate, resulting in a smaller transfer of charge. Another proposed explanation for humidity effects considers the case when charge transfer is observed to increase with humidity in dry conditions. Increasing humidity may lead to the formation of water bridges between contacting materials that promote the transfer of ions.

== Examples ==
=== Friction and adhesion from tribocharging ===
Friction is a retarding force due to different energy dissipation process such as elastic and plastic deformation, phonon and electron excitation, and also adhesion. As an example, in a car or any other vehicle the wheels elastically deform as they roll. Part of the energy needed for this deformation is recovered (elastic deformation), some is not and goes into heating the tires. The energy which is not recovered contributes to the back force, a process called rolling friction.

Similar to rolling friction there are energy terms in charge transfer, which contribute to friction. In static friction there is coupling between elastic strains, polarization and surface charge which contributes to the frictional force. In sliding friction, when asperities contact and there is charge transfer, some of the charge returns as the contacts are released, some does not and will contribute to the macroscopically observed friction. There is evidence for a retarding Coulomb force between asperities of different charges, and an increase in the adhesion from contact electrification when geckos walk on water. There is also evidence of connections between jerky (stick–slip) processes during sliding with charge transfer, electrical discharge and x-ray emission. How large the triboelectric contribution is to friction has been debated. It has been suggested by some that it may dominate for polymers, whereas Harper has argued that it is small.

=== Liquids and gases ===

The generation of static electricity from the relative motion of liquids or gases is well established, with one of the first analyses in 1886 by Lord Kelvin in his water dropper which used falling drops to create an electric generator. Liquid mercury is a special case as it typically acts as a simple metal, so has been used as a reference electrode. More common is water, and electricity due to water droplets hitting surfaces has been documented since the discovery by Philipp Lenard in 1892 of the &quot;spray electrification&quot; or &quot;waterfall effect&quot;. This is when falling water generates static electricity either by collisions between water drops or with the ground, leading to the finer mist in updrafts being mainly negatively charged, with positive near the lower surface. It can also occur for sliding drops.

Another type of charge can be produced during rapid solidification of water containing ions, which is called the &quot;Workman–Reynolds effect&quot;. During the solidification the positive and negative ions may not be equally distributed between the liquid and solid. For instance, in thunderstorms this can contribute (together with the waterfall effect) to separation of positive hydrogen ions and negative hydroxide ions, leading to static charge and lightning.

A third class is associated with contact potential differences between liquids or gases and other materials, similar to the work function differences for solids. It has been suggested that a triboelectric series for liquids is useful. One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938.

Finally, with liquids there can be flow-rate gradients at interfaces, and also viscosity gradients. These can produce electric fields and also polarization of the liquid, a field called electrohydrodynamics. These are analogous to the electromechanical terms for solids where electric fields can occur due to elastic strains as described earlier.

=== Powders ===
During commercial powder processing or in natural processes such as dust storms, triboelectric charge transfer can occur. There can be electric fields of up to 160kV/m with moderate wind conditions, which leads to Coulomb forces of about the same magnitude as gravity. There does not need to be air present, significant charging can occur, for instance, on airless planetary bodies. With pharmaceutic powders and other commercial powders the tribocharging needs to be controlled for quality control of the materials and doses. Static discharge is also a particular hazard in grain elevators owing to the danger of a dust explosion, in places that store explosive powders, and in many other cases. Triboelectric powder separation has been discussed as a method of separating powders, for instance different biopolymers. The principle here is that different degrees of charging can be exploited for electrostatic separation, a general concept for powders.

=== In industry ===

There are many areas in industry where triboelectricity is known to be an issue. some examples are:

* Non-conducting pipes carrying combustible liquids or fuels such as petrol can result in tribocharge accumulation on the walls of the pipes, which can lead to potentials as large as 90 kV. Pneumatic transport systems in industry can lead to fires due to the tribocharge generated during use.
* On ships, contact between cargo and pipelines during loading and unloading, as well as flow in steam pipes and water jets in cleaning machines can lead to dangerous charging. Courses exist to teach mariners the dangers.
* US authorities require nearly all industrial facilities to measure particulate dust emissions. Various sensors based on triboelectricity are used, and in 1997 the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued guidelines for triboelectric fabric-filter bag leak-detection systems. Commercial sensors are available for triboelectric dust detection.
* Wiping a rail near a chemical tank while it is being filled with a flammable chemical can lead to sparks which ignite the chemical. This was the cause of a 2017 explosion that killed one and injured many.

=== Other examples ===

While the simple case of stroking a cat is familiar to many, there are other areas in modern technological civilization where triboelectricity is exploited or is a concern: 
* Air moving past an aircraft can lead to a buildup of charge called &quot;precipitation static&quot; or &quot;P-static&quot;; aircraft typically have one or more static wicks to remove it. Checking the status of these is a standard task for pilots. Similarly, helicopter blades move fast, and tribocharging can generate voltages up to 200 kV.
* During planetary formation, a key step is aggregation of dust or smaller particles. There is evidence that triboelectric charging during collisions of granular material plays a key role in overcoming barriers to aggregation.
* Single-use medical protective clothing must fulfill certain triboelectric charging regulations in China.
* Space vehicles can accumulate significant tribocharge which can interfere with communications such as the sending of self-destruct signals. Some launches have been delayed by weather conditions where tribocharging could occur.
* Triboelectric nanogenerators are energy harvesting devices which convert mechanical energy into electricity.
* Triboelectric noise within medical cable assemblies and lead wires is generated when the conductors, insulation, and fillers rub against each other as the cables are flexed during movement. Keeping triboelectric noise at acceptable levels requires careful material selection, design, and processing. It is also an issue with underwater electroacoustic transducers if there are flexing motions of the cables; the mechanism is believed to involve relative motion between a dielectric and a conductor in the cable.

* Vehicle tires are normally dark because carbon black is added to help conduct away tribocharge that can shock passengers when they exit. There are also discharging straps than can be purchased.

<text>Year 395 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cossus, Medullinus, Scipio, Fidenas, Ambustus and Lactucinus (or, less frequently, year 359 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 395 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* The Persian satrap Tissaphernes&#x27; enemy Parysatis, mother of Cyrus, succeeds in persuading Persian King Artaxerxes II to have him executed at Colossae, Phrygia (now Turkey). Parysatis cannot forgive Tissaphernes for the rough treatment he has handed out to her favourite son, the late Cyrus.
* After spending the winter in organizing a cavalry force, Agesilaus II, the King of Sparta, makes a successful incursion into Lydia in the spring.
* Tithraustes replaces Tissaphernes. An armistice is concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus. Tithraustes bribes the Spartans to move north into the satrapy of Pharnabazus.
* Unable to defeat Agesilaus&#x27;s army, Pharnabazus decides to force Agesilaus to withdraw by stirring up trouble on the Greek mainland. He dispatches Timocrates of Rhodes to visit Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos to incite and bribe them to act against Sparta. Timocrates succeeds in persuading powerful factions in each of those states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy.

==== Greece ====
* The &quot;Corinthian War&quot; begins, with Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos (with the backing of Persia) against Sparta. The Spartans prepare to send out an army against this new alliance, and order Agesilaus to return to Greece. Agesilaus sets out for Sparta with his troops, crossing the Hellespont and marching west through Thrace.
* The Spartans arrange for two armies, one under the Spartan general Lysander and the other under the Spartan King Pausanias, to rendezvous at and attack the Boeotian city of Haliartus. Lysander, arriving before Pausanias, persuades the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian confederacy, and then advances to Haliartus with his troops. There, he is killed after bringing his forces too near the walls of the city.
* The Battle of Haliartus between the Spartans and the Thebans ends inconclusively. Pausanias, arriving a day later, takes back the bodies of the Spartan dead under a truce, and returns to Sparta. There, he is put on trial for his life and flees to Tegea before he can be convicted. Pausanias is replaced as king of Sparta by his son Agesipolis I.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Lysander, Spartan general and admiral
* Tissaphernes, Persian satrap
* Shishunaga, founder of the Shishunaga dynasty of South Asia

<text>Pleochroism is an optical phenomenon in which a substance has different colors when observed at different angles, especially with polarized light.

==Etymology==
The roots of the word are from Greek (). It was first made compound in the German term &quot;Pleochroismus&quot; by mineralogist Wilhelm Haidinger in 1854, in the journal &quot;Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot;. Its first known English usage is by geologist James Dana in 1854.

== Background ==
Anisotropic crystals will have optical properties that vary with the direction of light. The direction of the electric field determines the polarization of light, and crystals will respond in different ways if this angle is changed. These kinds of crystals have one or two optical axes. If absorption of light varies with the angle relative to the optical axis in a crystal then pleochroism results.

Anisotropic crystals have double refraction of light where light of different polarizations is bent different amounts by the crystal, and therefore follows different paths through the crystal. The components of a divided light beam follow different paths within the mineral and travel at different speeds. When the mineral is observed at some angle, light following some combination of paths and polarizations will be present, each of which will have had light of different colors absorbed. At another angle, the light passing through the crystal will be composed of another combination of light paths and polarizations, each with their own color. The light passing through the mineral will therefore have different colors when it is viewed from different angles, making the stone seem to be of different colors.

Tetragonal, trigonal, and hexagonal minerals can only show two colors and are called dichroic. Orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic crystals can show three and are trichroic. For example, hypersthene, which has two optical axes, can have a red, yellow, or blue appearance when oriented in three different ways in three-dimensional space. Isometric minerals cannot exhibit pleochroism. Tourmaline is notable for exhibiting strong pleochroism. Gems are sometimes cut and set either to display pleochroism or to hide it, depending on the colors and their attractiveness.

The pleochroic colors are at their maximum when light is polarized parallel with a principal optical vector. The axes are designated X, Y, and Z for direction, and alpha, beta, and gamma in magnitude of the refractive index. These axes can be determined from the appearance of a crystal in a conoscopic interference pattern. Where there are two optical axes, the acute bisectrix of the axes gives Z for positive minerals and X for negative minerals and the obtuse bisectrix gives the alternative axis (X or Z). Perpendicular to these is the Y axis. The color is measured with the polarization parallel to each direction. An absorption formula records the amount of absorption parallel to each axis in the form of X &lt; Y &lt; Z with the left most having the least absorption and the rightmost the most.

== In mineralogy and gemology ==
Pleochroism is an extremely useful tool in mineralogy and gemology for mineral and gem identification, since the number of colors visible from different angles can identify the possible crystalline structure of a gemstone or mineral and therefore help to classify it. Minerals that are otherwise very similar often have very different pleochroic color schemes. In such cases, a thin section of the mineral is used and examined under polarized transmitted light with a petrographic microscope. Another device using this property to identify minerals is the dichroscope.
