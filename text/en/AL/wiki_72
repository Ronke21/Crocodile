<text>A nun is a woman who vows to dedicate her life to religious service and contemplation, typically living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience in the enclosure of a monastery or convent. The term is often used interchangeably with religious sisters who do take simple vows but live an active vocation of prayer and charitable work.

In Christianity, nuns are found in the Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican and some Presbyterian traditions, as well as other Christian denominations. In the Buddhist tradition, female monastics are known as Bhikkhuni, and take several additional vows compared to male monastics (bhikkhus). Nuns are most common in Mahayana Buddhism, but have more recently become more prevalent in other traditions.

== Christianity ==
=== Catholicism ===

In the Catholic tradition, there are many religious institutes of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male monks or friars), each with its own charism or special character. Traditionally, nuns are members of enclosed religious orders and take solemn religious vows, while sisters do not live in the papal enclosure and formerly took vows called &quot;simple vows&quot;.

As monastics, nuns living within an enclosure historically commit to recitation of the full Divine Office throughout the day in church, usually in a solemn manner. They were formerly distinguished within the monastic community as &quot;choir nuns&quot;, as opposed to lay sisters who performed upkeep of the monastery or errands outside the cloister. This last task is still often entrusted to women, called &quot;externs&quot;, who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either oblates or members of the associated Third Order, often wearing a different habit or the standard woman&#x27;s attire of the period.

====Membership and vows====
In general, when a woman enters a religious order or monastery she first undergoes a period of testing life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a vocation to the life, she receives the habit of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from professed members) and undertakes the novitiate, a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking vows. Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows. Temporary vows last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six. Finally, she will petition to make her &quot;perpetual profession&quot;, taking permanent, solemn vows.

In the branches of the Benedictine tradition, (Benedictines, Cistercians, Camaldolese, and Trappists, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an abbess or prioress), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the Poor Clares (the Franciscan Order) and the Dominican nuns, they take the threefold vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. These are known as the &#x27;evangelical counsels&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;monastic vows&#x27; proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).


Cloistered nuns (Carmelites, for example) observe &quot;papal enclosure&quot; rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).

They often undertake contemplative ministries – that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of Corpus Christi Monastery in the Bronx, New York, pray in support of the priests of the Archdiocese of New York). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the Maryknoll Missionary Sisters have small houses of contemplative sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers, and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostolate; the Sister Disciples of the Divine Master are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation, the Daughters of St. Paul in their media ministry.

====Leadership====
A canoness is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of canon, usually following the Rule of St. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the canoness regular, taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern Lutheran convents of Germany.

A nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an abbess if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as &quot;Mother Superior&quot; and styled &quot;Reverend Mother&quot;. The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a convent is any home of a community of sisters – or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term &quot;monastery&quot; is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and &quot;convent&quot; when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. &#x27;Convent&#x27; is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.

The traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a tunic, which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a scapular which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white wimple and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some orders – such as the Dominicans – wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.

After the Second Vatican Council, many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a religious name. Catholic Church canon law states: &quot;Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty.&quot;

==== Distinction between a nun and a religious sister ====
Although usage has varied throughout church history, typically &quot;nun&quot; (Latin: &quot;monialis&quot;) is used for women who have taken &quot;solemn&quot; vows, and &quot;sister&quot; (Latin: &quot;soror&quot;) is used for women who have taken &quot;simple&quot; vows (that is, vows other than solemn vows).

During the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and contemplation. These monasteries were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a precinct wall. The mendicant orders, founded in the 13th century, combined a life of prayer and dedication to God with active works of preaching, hearing confessions, and service to the poor, and members of these orders are known as friars rather than monks. At that time, and into the 17th century, Church custom did not allow women to leave the cloister if they had taken religious vows. Female members of the mendicant orders (Dominican, Augustinian and Carmelite nuns and Poor Clares) continued to observe the same enclosed life as members of the monastic orders.

Originally, the vows taken by profession in any religious institute approved by the Holy See were classified as solemn. This was declared by Pope Boniface VIII (1235–1303). The situation changed in the 16th century. In 1521, two years after the Fourth Lateran Council had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, Pope Leo X established a religious Rule with simple vows for those tertiaries attached to existing communities who undertook to live a formal religious life. In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of congregation, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval. Finally in the 20th century, Pope Leo XIII recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows. Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to social service and to evangelization, both in Europe and in mission areas. Their number had increased dramatically in the upheavals brought by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of religious of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living the religious life. But members of these new associations were not recognized as &quot;religious&quot; until Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s Constitution &quot;Conditae a Christo&quot; of 8 December 1900.

The 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the term &quot;nun&quot; (Latin: &quot;monialis&quot;) for religious women who took solemn vows or who, while being allowed in some places to take simple vows, belonged to institutes whose vows were normally solemn. It used the word &quot;sister&quot; (Latin: &quot;soror&quot;) exclusively for members of institutes for women that it classified as &quot;congregations&quot;; and for &quot;nuns&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot; jointly it used the Latin word &quot;religiosae&quot; (women religious). The same religious order could include both &quot;nuns&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;, if some members took solemn vows and others simple vows.

The new legal code of the Catholic Church which was adopted in 1983, however, remained silent on this matter. Whereas previously the code distinguished between orders and congregations, the code now refers simply to religious institutes.

Since the code of 1983, the Vatican has addressed the renewal of the contemplative life of nuns. It produced the letter &quot;Verbi Sponsa&quot; in 1999, the apostolic constitution in 2016, and the instruction &quot;Cor Orans&quot; in 2018 &quot;which replaced the 1999 document &quot;Verbi Sponsa&quot; and attempted to bring forward the ideas regarding contemplative life born during the Second Vatican Council&quot;.

==== United States ====
Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century. In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. There were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers. Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added. Since the Second Vatican Council the sisters have directed their ministries more to the poor, working more directly among them and with them.

==== Canada ====
Nuns have played an important role in Canada, especially in heavily Catholic Quebec. Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Catholic nuns, especially in Québec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the Counter Reformation, new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by dowries provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, homes for unwed mothers, and schools.

==== Early modern Spain ====

Prior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process. The process was ensured by the Council of Trent, which King Philip II (1556–1598) adopted within Spain. King Phillip II acquired the aid of the Hieronymite order to ensure that monasteries abided by the decrees of the Council of Trent. This changed the way in which nuns would live. One edict of the Council of Trent was that female monasteries be enclosed in order to limit nuns&#x27; relationship with the secular world. Enclosure of monasteries during this time was associated with chastity. Another decree issued by the Council of Trent was that religious devotion be &quot;true and voluntary&quot;. A male clergy member would ask the aspiring nuns if whether or not their vocation was &quot;true and voluntary&quot; in order to ensure no enforced conversion.

To be considered as a nun, one must have the economic means to afford the convent dowry. During this time convent dowries were affordable, compared to secular marriages between a man and a woman. Typically during early modern Spain many nuns were from elite families who had the means to afford the convent dowry and &quot;maintenance allowances&quot;, which were annual fees. Monasteries were economically supported through convent dowries. Convent dowries could be waived if the aspiring nun had an artistic ability benefiting the monastery.

Once an aspiring nun has entered the convent and has the economic means to afford the dowry, she undergoes the process of apprenticeship known as the novitiate period. The novitiate period typically lasts 1–2 years, and during this time the aspiring nun lives the life of a nun without taking the official vows. As she lives in the convent she is closely monitored by the other women in the community to determine if her vocation is genuine. This would be officially determined by a vote from the choir nuns. If the aspiring nun passes the scrutiny of the women of the religious community, she then can make her solemn vows. Prior to making the vows, the family of the nun is expected to pay the convent dowry. Nuns were also expected to renounce their inheritance and property rights.

Religious class distinctions:
* Choir nuns: Usually from elite families, they held office, could vote within the convent, and were given the opportunity to read and write.
* Lay-sisters: Lower-class women, assigned tasks related to the labour of the convent, generally were not given the opportunities to read and write, and paid a lower dowry.

=== Eastern Orthodox ===


In the Eastern Orthodox Church there is no distinction between a monastery for women and one for men. In Greek, Russian, and other languages of primarily Christian Orthodox nations, both domiciles are called &quot;monasteries&quot; and the ascetics who live therein are &quot;monastics&quot;. In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms &quot;nun&quot; and &quot;convent&quot; for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (&quot;hegumen&quot;) – Greek: ἡγουμένη (&quot;hegumeni&quot;); (&quot;igumanija&quot;); Russian: игумения (&quot;igumenia&quot;). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct &quot;orders&quot; as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives. There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. &quot;typica&quot;) dependent on the abbess or abbot. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no priest, bishop, or even patriarch can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in ecumenical councils. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear confessions (but do not absolve) and dispense blessings on their charges, though they still require the services of a presbyter (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the Divine Liturgy and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.

In general, Orthodox monastics have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become &quot;dead to the world&quot; and therefore be unavailable for social visits.

There are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:

*Novice – When one enters a monastery the first three to five years are spent as a novice. Novices may or may not (depending on the abbess&#x27;s wishes) dress in the black inner robe (Isorassa); those who do will also usually wear the apostolnik or a black scarf tied over the head (see photo, above). The isorassa is the first part of the monastic &quot;habit&quot; of which there is only one style for Orthodox monastics (this is true in general, there have been a few slight regional variations over the centuries, but the style always seems to precipitate back to a style common in the 3rd or 4th century). If a novice chooses to leave during the novitiate period no penalty is incurred.
*Rassaphore – When the abbess deems the novice ready, the novice is asked to join the monastery. If she accepts, she is tonsured in a formal service during which she is given the outer robe (Exorassa) and veil (Epanokamelavkion) to wear, and (because she is now dead to the world) receives a new name. Nuns consider themselves part of a sisterhood; however, tonsured nuns are usually addressed as &quot;Mother&quot; (in some convents, the title of &quot;Mother&quot; is reserved to those who enter into the next level of Stavrophore).
*Stavrophore – The next level for monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbess feels the nun has reached a level of discipline, dedication, and humility. Once again, in a formal service the nun is elevated to the &quot;Little Schema&quot; which is signified by additions to her habit of certain symbolic articles of clothing. In addition, the abbess increases the nun&#x27;s prayer rule, she is allowed a stricter personal ascetic practice.
*Great Schema – The final stage, called &quot;Megaloschemos&quot; or &quot;Great Schema&quot; is reached by nuns whose Abbess feels they have reached a high level of excellence. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.
=== Protestantism ===
After the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum) and convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith. Other convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry.

A modern resurgence of the early Christian Deaconess office for women began in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Scandinavia, Britain and the United States, with some elements of the religious life, such as simple vows, and a daily obligation of prayer. Lutherans were especially active, and within both Lutheranism and Anglicanism some Deaconesses formed religious communities, with community living, and the option of life vows in religion. The modern movement reached a zenith about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe, and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women. A small movement still exists, and its legacy is seen in the names of numerous hospitals.

The example of the Deaconess communities eventually led to the establishment of religious communities of monks and nuns within some Protestant traditions, particularly those influenced by the more liturgical Protestant reformers (such as Martin Luther) rather than the more extreme reformers (such as John Calvin). This has allowed for communities of nuns (or, in some cases, mixed communities of nuns and monks) to be re-established in some Protestant traditions. Many of these are within the episcopal Lutheran tradition and the closeness of Lutheranism with Anglicanism in its belief and practice has led to local arrangements of inter-Communion between the two traditions, such as the Porvoo Communion.

==== Lutheranism ====
There are a plethora of religious orders within the Lutheran Churches, such as the Order of Lutheran Franciscans and Daughters of Mary. Nearly all are located in Europe.

The Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, an order of Lutheran nuns, operates a guesthouse for Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.

==== Anglicanism ====

Religious communities throughout England were destroyed by King Henry VIII when he separated the Church of England from papal authority during the English Reformation (see Dissolution of the Monasteries). Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country. Many Catholic nuns went to France.

Anglican religious orders are organizations of laity or clergy in the Anglican Communion who live under a common rule. The term &quot;religious orders&quot; is distinguished from Holy Orders (the sacrament of ordination which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.

The structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.

With the rise of the Oxford Movement in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of &quot;religious life&quot; in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at Wantage and the Society of Saint Margaret at East Grinstead.

In the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.

Whilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at Church House, Westminster, the headquarters of the Church of England&#x27;s Church Commissioners, General Synod, Archbishops&#x27; Council, and National Society. This department publishes the biennial &quot;Anglican Religious Life&quot;, a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. &quot;Anglican Religious Life&quot; defines four categories of community.
* &quot;Traditional celibate religious orders and communities&quot;: Members take a vow of celibacy (amongst other vows) and follow a common Rule of life. They may be enclosed and contemplative or open and engaged in apostolic works.
* &quot;Dispersed communities&quot;: These are orders or communities whose members, whilst taking vows (including celibacy), do not live together in community. In most cases the members are self-supporting and live alone, but follow the same Rule of life, and meet together frequently in assemblies often known as &#x27;Chapter meetings&#x27;. In some cases some members may share a common life in very small groups of two or three.
* &quot;Acknowledged communities&quot;: These communities live a traditional Christian life, including the taking of vows, but the traditional vows are adapted or changed. In many cases these communities admit both single and married persons as members, requiring celibacy on the part of those who are single, and unfailing commitment to their spouse on the part of married members. They also amend the vow of poverty, allowing personal possessions, but requiring high standards of tithing to the community and the wider church. These communities often have residential elements, but not full residential community life, as this would be incompatible with some elements of married family life.
* &quot;Other communities&quot;: This group contains communities that are ecumenical (including Anglicans) or that belong to non-Anglican churches that have entered into relationships of full communion with the Anglican Church (particularly, but not only, certain Lutheran churches).

In the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between &quot;orders&quot; and &quot;communities&quot;, as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of &quot;religious orders&quot; (equivalent to the first two groups above) and &quot;Christian communities&quot; (equivalent to the third group above). The &quot;Anglican Religious Life&quot; directory affirms this, stating &quot;This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where &#x27;communities&#x27; is also used for those who take traditional vows.&quot;

In some Anglican orders, there are sisters who have been ordained and can celebrate the Eucharist.

==== Presbyterian ====

The Emmanuel Sisterhood in Cameroon, Africa, is part of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (PCC).

==== Methodism ====
The Saint Brigid of Kildare Benedictine Monastery is a United Methodist double monastery with both monks and nuns.

== Buddhism ==


All Buddhist traditions have nuns, although their status is different among Buddhist countries. The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the &quot;sangha&quot; only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism&#x27;s collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.) Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (&quot;bhikkhunis&quot;) have more &quot;Patimokkha&quot; rules than the monks (&quot;bhikkhus&quot;). The important vows are the same, however.

As with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns&#x27; dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full &quot;bhikkuni&quot; ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In Theravada countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of &quot;bhikkunis&quot; died out, though in many places they wear the &quot;saffron&quot; colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (&quot;bhikkhuni&quot;), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called &quot;mae chi&quot;. However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners&#x27; community. There are in Thai Forest Tradition foremost nuns such as Mae Ji Kaew Sianglam, the founder of the Nunnery of Baan Huai Saai, who is believed by some to be enlightened as well as Upasika Kee Nanayon. At the beginning of the 21st century, some Buddhist women in Thailand have started to introduce the &quot;bhikkhuni sangha&quot; in their country as well, even if public acceptance is still lacking. Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly the successful academic scholar Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, established a controversial monastery for the training of Buddhist nuns in Thailand.

=== Taiwan ===

The relatively active roles of Taiwanese nuns were noted by some studies. Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1951 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:

Wei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang 香光) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan&#x27;s Zhaijiao tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.

=== Tibet ===
The August 2007 International Congress on Buddhist Women&#x27;s Role in the Sangha, with the support of the XIVth Dalai Lama, reinstated the Gelongma (Dharmaguptaka vinaya bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.

It is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in Vietnam. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like Thubten Chodron, took full ordination in another tradition.

The ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getshül-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and &quot;gelong&quot; robes.

===Japan===
Hokke-ji in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period. Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the Five Hindrances, which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men. However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.

<text>Edwin Meese III (born December 2, 1931) is an American attorney, law professor, author and member of the Republican Party who served in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s gubernatorial administration (1967–1974), the Reagan presidential transition team (1980–81), and the Reagan administration (1981–1985). Following the 1984 presidential election, Reagan considered him for the White House Chief of Staff position, but James Baker was chosen instead. Meese was eventually appointed and confirmed as the 75th United States Attorney General (1985–1988), a position he held until resigning in 1988 amidst the Wedtech scandal.

Meese currently serves as a member of the board of trustees for The Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank. He was also a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He is a member of the national advisory board of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education and a member of the board of directors of the Federalist Society. He has served on the board of Cornerstone closed-end funds.

== Early life and education ==
Meese was born on December 2, 1931, in Oakland, California, the eldest of four sons born to Leone (née Feldman) and Edwin Meese, Jr. He was raised in a practicing Lutheran family, of German descent. His father was an Oakland city government official, president of the Zion Lutheran Church, and served 24 years in the non-partisan office of Treasurer of Alameda County.

At age 10, Meese published along with his brothers a mimeographed neighborhood newspaper, the &quot;Weekly Herald&quot;, and used the proceeds to buy a war bond. The young Meese also rode a bicycle on a paper route and worked in a drugstore. At Oakland High School, Meese was involved in the Junior State of America and led his high school debate team to statewide championships. He was valedictorian of Oakland High School&#x27;s class of 1949.

Two weeks prior to graduation, Meese was accepted to Yale University and granted a scholarship. At Yale, Meese served as president of the Yale Political Union, chairman of the Conservative Party, chairman of the Yale Debate Association, and a member of the secret society Spade and Grave. Meese made the dean&#x27;s list, and graduated with a B.A. in political science in 1953.

=== Military service ===
At Yale, Meese was a member of ROTC. Upon graduating in 1953, he obtained a commission in the U.S. Army as a Second Lieutenant. He spent 24 months at Fort Sill near Lawton, Oklahoma. Meese worked in logistics, conducting installation and operations of the 240 mm howitzer M1. Meese completed active duty in 1956 and continued in the U.S. Army Reserve, specializing in military intelligence. Meese retired from the Army Reserve as a colonel in 1984.

==Career==
Meese returned to California, where he obtained a law degree from UC Berkeley School of Law in 1958 and was a state Moot Court champion. 

He accepted a position with the district attorney&#x27;s office of Alameda County, California as a law clerk. While there, he worked under district attorney J. Frank Coakley and future district attorney Delwen Lowell Jensen. Jensen received a LEAA grant to develop DALITE (District Attorney&#x27;s Automated Legal Information System), a case management software program, like PROMIS (Prosecutor&#x27;s Management Information System), developed by Inslaw. Meese prosecuted felony cases while maintaining a private practice on nights and weekends, where he focused on civil law. During this service, he first drew the attention of Republican State Senator Donald L. Grunsky, who would later recommend him to governor-elect Ronald Reagan.

In 1959, he married his high school sweetheart Ursula Herrick, daughter of Oakland&#x27;s postmaster.

===California governor&#x27;s office===
Meese joined Ronald Reagan&#x27;s gubernatorial staff in 1967 as legal affairs secretary, serving in that role for a year, until 1968. In 1969, he became Governor Reagan&#x27;s executive assistant and chief of staff, and served in that capacity until 1974. Despite his later well-known reputation of being fond of Reagan, Meese was initially reluctant to accept the appointment. &quot;I was not particularly interested&quot;, he later said of the position.

Meese was known for his ability to explain complex ideas to Reagan in a way that often mirrored Reagan&#x27;s own speaking style and mannerisms, leading Reagan biographer Lou Cannon to describe him as &quot;Reagan&#x27;s geographer&quot;.

After being named Reagan&#x27;s chief of staff, Meese convinced his predecessor&#x27;s deputy, Mike Deaver, to stay on with him, beginning a partnership that would last more than two decades. For his role in Reagan&#x27;s office, Meese earned reluctant praise from across the aisle. Bob Moretti, a Democrat and former Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, said, &quot;Were I in the governor&#x27;s seat, I would want someone like [Ed Meese] on my side.&quot;

====Berkeley protests====

As Reagan&#x27;s chief of staff, Meese was instrumental in the decision to crack down on student protesters at People&#x27;s Park in Berkeley, California, on May 15, 1969. Meese was widely criticized for escalating the official response to the People&#x27;s Park protest, during which law enforcement officers killed one student, on his way to class, who was not a protester and injured hundreds of others, including bystanders. Meese advised Reagan to declare a state of emergency in Berkeley, contrary to the recommendation of the Berkeley City Council. That resulted in a two-week occupation of People&#x27;s Park by National Guard troops.

The first governor to turn to Meese for advice on riot control was Democrat Edmund (Pat) Brown, who first telephoned Meese seeking advice on how to best handle the situation. &quot;I told him,&quot; Meese said, &quot;that the people in that building should be arrested and taken out of there. I told him that if they were allowed to stay, there would be another mob scene, even bigger, the next day.&quot; Meese and Deputy District Attorney Lowell Jensen later served as co-counsels in the trial of Berkeley demonstrators. Meese was recognized as one of five &quot;Outstanding Young Men of California&quot; by the California Junior Chamber of Commerce for his role in countering the Berkeley demonstrators. Meese&#x27;s role in quelling the riots at UC Berkeley has been identified by critics and supporters as an example of a conservative law-enforcement philosophy at work.

===Industry and academia===
From January 1975 to May 1976, in Chula Vista, San Diego County, California, Meese served as vice president for administration of Rohr Industries, manufacturer of railcars for the San Francisco Bay Area Bay Area Rapid Transit. He left Rohr to enter private law practice in San Diego County, California.

After receiving a grant from the Sarah Scaife Foundation, Meese developed what he called &quot;a plan for a law school center for criminal justice policy and management&quot;. The plan was accepted by the University of San Diego, a private Catholic school. From the fall of 1977 to January 1981, Meese served as professor of law at the university, where he also directed the Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management. During the same time, Meese served as vice chairman of California&#x27;s Organized Crime Control Commission and participated in the California Bar Association&#x27;s criminal law section.

== Reagan presidency ==

=== Presidential campaign and transition ===
Following the Iowa caucuses, Meese joined the 1980 Reagan presidential campaign full-time as chief of staff in charge of day-to-day campaign operations and senior issues adviser. After the 1980 election, Meese headed Reagan&#x27;s transition effort.

At the advice of Meese, Reagan secretly allowed his campaign to establish a transition office to avoid difficulties similar to those faced by the Nixon administration in its transition following the 1969 election. &quot;Ed had an uncanny ability to look down the road,&quot; said Pen James, Assistant to the President for Presidential Personnel. Meese&#x27;s presidential transition team employed more than 1,000 individuals, with 311 being paid in federal funds, 331 working for a &quot;token&quot; $1, and the rest serving as volunteers. When accounting for inflation, the Reagan transition team spent slightly less money than the Carter transition team, $1.75 million versus $1.78 million.
=== Counselor to the President ===
On November 17, 1980, Meese and James Baker held a meeting to divide their list of White House responsibilities, since both saw the potential for future conflict because of their positions being somewhat similar in nature. The one-page memorandum listed Meese&#x27;s responsibilities as:
* &quot;Counselor to the President for Policy (with cabinet rank);
* member Super Cabinet Executive Committee (in absence of the President and V-P preside over meetings);
* participate as a principal in all meetings of full Cabinet;
* coordination and supervision of responsibilities of the Secretary to the Cabinet; *coordination and supervision of work of the Domestic Policy Studies and the National Security Council;
* with Baker coordination and supervision of work of OMB, CEA, CEQ, Trade Rep and S&amp;T; *participation as principal in all policy group meetings;
* attend any meeting which Pres attends – w/his consent.&quot;

Meese became Counselor to the President, who appointed him as a member of both his Cabinet and the National Security Council from 1981 to 1985. On Monday, September 14, 1981, Meese chaired the first White House discussion of what would become Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the missile defense program.

Meese served as a liaison to the conservative evangelical community, arranging for meetings between social conservative leaders and the president. Meese was lauded by social conservatives for his address to the Congress on the Bible in March 1982, when he said, &quot;Someone has estimated that throughout the course of history man has adopted over four billion laws. It seems to me, with all that effort, we haven&#x27;t improved one iota on the Ten Commandments.&quot;

Near the end of Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Meese&#x27;s involvement in the Iran–Contra affair as a counselor and friend to Reagan was scrutinized by the independent counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, which stated in its official report that Meese&#x27;s knowledge of the 1985 HAWK transaction &quot;raised serious legal questions&quot;.

Meese was considered a powerful and influential figure in the White House. Former Reagan advisor and journalist David Gergen said, &quot;He&#x27;s a tremendously influential and highly valued adviser to the President who advises on issues all across the board. He&#x27;s one of the men who has known [the President] so long and so well he&#x27;s become almost an alter ego of Ronald Reagan.&quot;

===Comments on hunger in America===
Meese created a storm of controversy in December 1983 after his responses to questions about hunger in America. In response to a question about balancing spending cuts against the need to feed hungry children, he said that he had seen no &quot;authoritative&quot; evidence that children in America were going hungry and that some of the allegations &quot;are purely political.&quot; When asked about soup kitchens, he said that &quot;some people are going to soup kitchens voluntarily... I know we&#x27;ve had considerable information that people go to soup kitchens because the food is free and that that&#x27;s easier than paying for it.&quot; 

Democratic leaders and social welfare activists called his comments &quot;disgraceful,&quot; &quot;an outrage,&quot; &quot;unkind,&quot; &quot;mean-spirited,&quot; and &quot;absolutely ridiculous&quot;. Tip O&#x27;Neill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, compared Meese to Ebenezer Scrooge. 

Shortly after, Meese offered a tongue-in-cheek defense of Scrooge, saying that he &quot;had his faults, but he wasn&#x27;t unfair to anyone&quot; and that he suffered from &quot;a bad press&quot;.

===Attorney General===
Reagan nominated Meese to be William French Smith&#x27;s successor as U.S. Attorney General on January 23, 1984. For more than a year, Democrats repeatedly charged Meese with unethical conduct to bar his confirmation as attorney general, including a report by Archibald Cox to the Senate, which alleged that Meese had a &quot;lack of ethical sensitivity&quot; and &quot;blindness to abuse of position&quot;.

Meese was finally confirmed by a vote of 63–31, with more opposition than any other Attorney General nominee had received since the 1920s. He began serving as Attorney General in February 1985.

In 1985, Meese received &quot;Government Executive magazine&#x27;s annual award for excellence in management for his service in this role.

====Bechtel scandal====
In the mid-1980s, there was a federal investigation into Meese&#x27;s connections and alleged financial improprieties related to his efforts to help the Bechtel Corporation build a pipeline in Iraq. The pipeline was to extend from Iraq to Jordan and was negotiated by Meese, Shimon Peres, Bruce Rappaport, Robert C. McFarlane, and others. A report by special prosecutor James C. McKay cleared Meese of criminal wrongdoing but criticized him for ethical lapses, especially regarding bribes to Israel not to attack an Iraqi oil pipeline that benefited associates of Meese.

====Iran-Contra scandal====

In the late-1980s, Meese was investigated for his role in covering up the Iran-Contra affair to limit damage to Reagan. Although evidence supporting this accusation came to light, Meese was ultimately not charged with any obstruction.

====Wedtech scandal====

In February 1987, James C. McKay was named independent counsel in the Wedtech case. The investigation centered on actions Meese took that benefited him and his longtime friend and former lawyer, E. Robert Wallach. McKay looked into Meese&#x27;s involvement, while Attorney General, in negotiations involving the company Wedtech. (E. Robert Wallach worked as a lobbyist for the company and sought help from Meese on Wedtech contract matters.)

McKay never prosecuted or sought indictment of Meese, but in his official report, which is still confidential, he was highly critical of Meese&#x27;s ethics and urged further investigation of Meese&#x27;s role in that scandal and others such as Meese&#x27;s efforts to help Bechtel Corporation. Meese described it as a &quot;full vindication&quot;. While Meese was never convicted of any wrongdoing, he resigned in 1988 when the independent counsel delivered the report on Wedtech.

Prior to his resignation, several top Justice Department officials resigned in protest of what they and others viewed as improper acts by the Attorney General.

Reagan publicly voiced support for Meese in his role as Attorney General, during a press conference: &quot;If Ed Meese is not a good man, there are no good men.&quot; That was in response to questions about his actions at the Justice Department.

====Meese Report====

On May 21, 1984, Reagan announced his intention to appoint the Attorney General to study the effect of pornography on society. The Meese Report, convened in the spring of 1985 and published its findings in July 1986. The Meese Report advised that pornography was in varying degrees harmful. Following the release of the report, guidelines of the Meese-led Department of Justice were modified to enable the government to file multiple cases in various jurisdictions at the same time which eroded some of the markets for pornography.

==== Drug control policy ====
As Attorney General, Meese chaired the National Drug Policy Board, which coordinated with Nancy Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Just Say No,&quot; national anti-drug educational campaign. One of Meese&#x27;s innovations was to seek the cooperation of drug-producing countries.

&quot;One of our most effective weapons against drug traffickers,&quot; Meese wrote in his autobiography, &quot;was to confiscate the assets of their criminal activity, such as expensive autos, yachts, businesses and homes... To make this technique even more effective, we shared the proceeds with cooperating local law enforcement agencies to enhance their drug-fighting activities.&quot;

====Supreme Court views====
In 1985, Meese delivered a speech calling for a &quot;jurisprudence of original intent&quot; and criticizing the Supreme Court for straying from the original intention of the U.S. Constitution. Justices William J. Brennan and John Paul Stevens disagreed with Meese publicly later that year. The dispute foreshadowed the contentious Robert Bork hearings of 1987.

Meese was known for his opposition to the Miranda Warning ruling by the Supreme Court, which required a suspect&#x27;s rights to be read to him before he is questioned by authorities.
==Iraq Study Group==

In May 2006, Meese was named a member of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group by the group co-chairmen, James Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton. The Iraq Study Group was commissioned to assess and report on the contemporary status of the Iraq War. Meese co-authored the group&#x27;s final December 2006 report.

== Fellowships and honors ==
In 1982, Meese was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. Meese serves on the boards of several institutions. Meese has held the Ronald Reagan Chair in Public Policy at The Heritage Foundation since 1988, when he joined the think tank. It is the only policy chair in the United States officially named for the 40th president. He is also chairman of Heritage&#x27;s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, founded in 2001 to advance conservative views about the Constitution, legal principles and their impact on public policy.

Meese is currently the second vice chairman of Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative non-profit legal group. He serves as an adjunct fellow at the Discovery Institute and is a member of the board of directors of the Junior State of America Meese is also on the board of directors of the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank devoted to the research of non-profit groups.

Meese served on the executive committee (1994) and as president (1996) of the Council for National Policy (CNP), and he was co-chairman of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Sentencing Committee.

Meese served two terms as a member of the board of visitors of George Mason University from 1996 to 2004. From 1998 to 2004, he served as rector (chairman) of the board.

For his lifetime of service and leadership, Meese was named the first-ever Honorary Reagan Fellow at Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. in 2008. Recognizing Meese as a model for young people, the honor was given on behalf of the Reagan Fellows program President Ronald Reagan, established at his own alma mater in 1982. Meese is a charter member of the Ronald W. Reagan Society of Eureka College and was a featured speaker at the &quot;Reagan and the Midwest&quot; academic conference held on the college&#x27;s campus to launch the Reagan Centennial in 2011.

In 2017, Meese became a veteran companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

Meese serves as a member of the board of directors of the Mercatus Center, a non-profit market-oriented research, education, and outreach think tank located on George Mason University&#x27;s Arlington campus.

The Republican National Lawyers Association annually bestows the &quot;Edwin Meese Award&quot; to a notable Republican attorney or official. Previous recipients have included Lindsey Graham, John Ashcroft, Don McGahn, C. Boyden Gray, and Michael Mukasey.

On October 8, 2019, U.S. president Donald Trump presented Meese the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. Former Meese chief of staff Mark Levin paid tribute to him at the ceremony.

<doc id="62996" wikidata="Q407308" url="?curid=62996" title="Theophylline">
<text>Theophylline, also known as 1,3-dimethylxanthine, is a drug that inhibits phosphodiesterase and blocks adenosine receptors. It is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Its pharmacology is similar to other methylxanthine drugs (e.g., theobromine and caffeine). Trace amounts of theophylline are naturally present in tea, coffee, chocolate, yerba maté, guarana, and kola nut.

The name &#x27;theophylline&#x27; derives from &quot;Thea&quot;—the former genus name for tea + Legacy Greek φύλλον (phúllon, &quot;leaf&quot;) + -ine.

== Medical uses ==
The main actions of theophylline involve:
* relaxing bronchial smooth muscle
* increasing heart muscle contractility and efficiency (positive inotrope)
* increasing heart rate (positive chronotropic)
* increasing blood pressure
* increasing renal blood flow
* anti-inflammatory effects
* central nervous system stimulatory effect, mainly on the medullary respiratory center

The main therapeutic uses of theophylline are for treating:

* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Asthma
* infant apnea
* Blocks the action of adenosine; an inhibitory neurotransmitter that induces sleep, contracts the smooth muscles and relaxes the cardiac muscle.
* Treatment of post-dural puncture headache.

== Performance enhancement in sports ==
Theophylline and other methylxanthines are often used for their performance-enhancing effects in sports, as these drugs increase alertness, bronchodilation, and increase the rate and force of heart contraction. There is conflicting information about the value of theophylline and other methylxanthines as prophylaxis against exercise-induced asthma.

==Adverse effects==
The use of theophylline is complicated by its interaction with various drugs and by the fact that it has a narrow therapeutic window (&lt;20 mcg/mL). Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity. It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, and CNS excitation (headaches, insomnia, irritability, dizziness and lightheadedness). Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency. 

Its toxicity is increased by erythromycin, cimetidine, and fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin. Some lipid-based formulations of theophylline can result in toxic theophylline levels when taken with fatty meals, an effect called dose dumping, but this does not occur with most formulations of theophylline. Theophylline toxicity can be treated with beta blockers. In addition to seizures, tachyarrhythmias are a major concern. Theophylline should not be used in combination with the SSRI fluvoxamine.

== Spectroscopy ==
=== UV-visible ===
Theophylline is soluble in 0.1N NaOH and absorbs maximally at 277 nm with an extinction coefficient of 10,200 (cm−1 M−1).

=== Proton NMR ===
The characteristic signals, distinguishing theophylline from related methylxanthines, are approximately 3.23δ and 3.41δ, corresponding to the unique methylation possessed by theophylline. The remaining proton signal, at 8.01δ, corresponds to the proton on the imidazole ring, not transferred between the nitrogen. The transferred proton between the nitrogen is a variable proton and only exhibits a signal under certain conditions.

=== 13C-NMR ===
The unique methylation of theophylline corresponds to the following signals: 27.7δ and 29.9δ. The remaining signals correspond to carbons characteristic of the xanthine backbone.

== Natural occurrences ==
Theophylline is naturally found in cocoa beans. Amounts as high as 3.7 mg/g have been reported in Criollo cocoa beans.

Trace amounts of theophylline are also found in brewed tea, although brewed tea provides only about 1 mg/L, which is significantly less than a therapeutic dose.

Trace amounts of theophylline are also found in guarana (&quot;Paullinia cupana&quot;) and in kola nuts.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Like other methylated xanthine derivatives, theophylline is both a

# competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which increases intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF-alpha and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity
# nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, antagonizing A1, A2, and A3 receptors almost equally, which explains many of its cardiac effects. Theophylline activates histone deacetylases.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
When theophylline is administered intravenously, bioavailability is 100%.

====Distribution====
Theophylline is distributed in the extracellular fluid, in the placenta, in the mother&#x27;s milk and in the central nervous system. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg. The protein binding is 40%.

====Metabolism====
Theophylline is metabolized extensively in the liver. It undergoes &quot;N&quot;-demethylation via cytochrome P450 1A2. It is metabolized by parallel first order and Michaelis-Menten pathways. Metabolism may become saturated (non-linear), even within the therapeutic range. Small dose increases may result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentration. Methylation to caffeine is also important in the infant population. Smokers and people with hepatic (liver) impairment metabolize it differently. Cigarette and marijuana smoking induces metabolism of theophylline, increasing the drug&#x27;s metabolic clearance.

====Excretion====
Theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine (up to 10%). Clearance of the drug is increased in children (age 1 to 12), teenagers (12 to 16), adult smokers, elderly smokers, as well as in cystic fibrosis, and hyperthyroidism. Clearance of the drug is decreased in these conditions: elderly, acute congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism and febrile viral illnesses.

The elimination half-life varies: 30 hours for premature neonates, 24 hours for neonates, 3.5 hours for children ages 1 to 9, 8 hours for adult non-smokers, 5 hours for adult smokers, 24 hours for those with hepatic impairment, 12 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, 24 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-IV, 12 hours for the elderly.

==History==
Theophylline was first extracted from tea leaves and chemically identified around 1888 by the German biologist Albrecht Kossel. Seven years later, a chemical synthesis starting with 1,3-dimethyluric acid was described by Emil Fischer and Lorenz Ach. The Traube purine synthesis, an alternative method to synthesize theophylline, was introduced in 1900 by another German scientist, Wilhelm Traube. Theophylline&#x27;s first clinical use came in 1902 as a diuretic. It took an additional 20 years until it was first reported as an asthma treatment. The drug was prescribed in a syrup up to the 1970s as Theostat 20 and Theostat 80, and by the early 1980s in a tablet form called Quibron.

<text>Pope Mark () was the bishop of Rome from 18 January to his death on 7 October 336.

Little is known of Mark&#x27;s early life. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, he was a Roman, and his father&#x27;s name was Priscus. Mark succeeded Sylvester I as pope on 18 January 336.
Some evidence suggests that the early lists of bishops and martyrs known as the &quot;Depositio episcoporum&quot; and &quot;Depositio martyrum&quot; were begun during his pontificate. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Pope Mark issued a constitution investing the bishop of Ostia with a pallium and confirming his power to consecrate newly elected popes. Likewise according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Pope Mark is credited with the foundation of the Basilica of San Marco, a basilica in Rome, and a cemetery church over the Catacomb of Balbina, just outside the city on lands obtained as a donation from Emperor Constantine.

Mark died of natural causes on 7 October and was buried in the catacomb of Balbina. In 1048, his remains were removed to the town of Velletri, and in 1145 were relocated to the Basilica of San Marco in Rome, where they are kept in an urn under the altar. His feast day is celebrated on 7 October. He is particularly venerated at the Abbadia San Salvatore at Monte Amiata.

<doc id="63005" wikidata="Q168741" url="?curid=63005" title="Pope Simplicius">
<text>Pope Simplicius (died 2 or 10 March 483) was the bishop of Rome from 468 to his death. He combated the Eutychian heresy, ended the practice of consecrating bishops only in December, and sought to offset the effects of Germanic invasions.

==Election==

Simplicius was born in Tivoli, Italy, the son of a citizen named Castinus. After a vacancy of 10 days following the death of Pope Hilarius, Simplicius was consecrated on 25 February 468.

==Pontificate==
Simplicius defended the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon against the Eutychian heresy. When the Eutychians rose up in Antioch and installed Petrus Mongus, Simplicius made repeated complaints for action to Basiliscus and Leo I, emperors of the Eastern Roman Empire, for the restoration of the Catholic bishop; he did the same when Petrus Fullo usurped the seat of the patriarch of Alexandria. He rehabilitated Patriarch Timotheos Solofaciolus. In 478, Simplicius held a synod in Rome, which pronounced anathemas against eastern heretical bishops Peter Fullo, John of Apamea, and Paul of Ephesus. Simplicius worked to maintain the authority of Rome in the West. He named Zeno, Bishop of Hispalis (Seville) as Papal Vicar in Spain.

In 482, Bishop Gregory of Modena was consecrated a bishop against his will by Archbishop Joannes I of Ravenna. This brought the archbishop a sharp rebuke from Pope Simplicius.

According to the Carolingian liturgist Amalarius of Metz, Pope Simplicius was the first pope to carry out consecrations at any other time than in December before Christmas. He began to confer holy orders in February as well.

Simplicius is credited with the construction of a church named Santa Bibiana, in memory of the virgin and martyr St. Bibiana. He also dedicated the Church of San Stefano Rotondo on the Celian Hill, the church of S. Andrea near S. Maria Maggiore, and a church dedicated to Saint Lawrence in the Campo Verano. He labored to help the people of Italy against the marauding raids of barbarian invaders. He saw the Heruliian mercenaries revolt, depose Romulus Augustulus, the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, and proclaim Odoacer king of Italy in 476. Odoacer made few changes in the administration in Rome, leaving the city firmly in the hands of its bishop, Simplicius.

==Death and aftermath==
He was buried in the Basilica of St. Peter on 2 March 483. Rome was without a pope for six days. Since 1971, St. Simplicius&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on 10 March in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church.

<doc id="63006" wikidata="Q174029" url="?curid=63006" title="Pope Felix III">
<text>Pope Felix III (died 1 March 492) was the bishop of Rome from 13 March 483 to his death. His repudiation of the &quot;Henotikon&quot; is considered the beginning of the Acacian schism. He is commemorated on March 1.

==Family==
Felix was born into a Roman senatorial family – possibly the son of a priest. He was married and widowed before he was elected as pope. He fathered two children, and through his son Gordianus (a priest) was thought to be great-great-grandfather to Pope Gregory I, and possibly related to Pope Agapetus I.

It was also said that Felix appeared as an apparition to another of his descendants, his great-granddaughter Trasilla (an aunt of Pope Gregory I), and asked her to enter Heaven, and &quot;on the eve of Christmas Trasilla died, seeing Jesus Christ beckoning&quot;.

==Eutychian heresy==
Eutyches was an archimandrite at Constantinople. In his opposition to Nestorianism he seemed to have taken the opposite view to extremes.
In an effort to defuse controversy regarding the teachings of Eutyches, in 482 Emperor Zeno, at the suggestion of Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, had issued an edict known as the Henoticon. The edict was intended as a bond of reconciliation between Catholics and Eutychians, but it caused greater conflicts than ever, and split the Church of the East into three or four parties. The Henotikon endorsed the condemnations of Eutyches and Nestorius made at Chalcedon and explicitly approved the twelve anathemas of Cyril of Alexandria, but in attempting to appease both sides of the dispute, avoided any definitive statement on whether Christ had one or two natures.

Felix&#x27;s first act was to repudiate the Henoticon. He also addressed a letter of remonstrance to Acacius. The latter proved refractory and sentence of deposition was passed against Acacius.

As Catholics spurned Zeno&#x27;s edict, the emperor had driven the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria from their sees. Peter the Fuller deposed Martyrius of Antioch and assumed the See of Antioch in 470. Peter Mongus took the See of Alexandria. In his first synod, Felix excommunicated Peter the Fuller. In 484, Felix also excommunicated Peter Mongus, an act that brought about a schism between East and West that was not healed until 519.

==Aftermath of the Vandals==
In North Africa, conquered by the fervently Arian Vandals, persecution by king Genseric and his son and successor Huneric had driven many Catholic Romans into exile. When Huneric died, the persecutions were eased, and many of those who through fear had been rebaptized as Arians desired to return to the Church. However, the Vandals remained resolutely Arian. The Catholics appealed to Felix, who convened a synod in 487 and sent a letter to the bishops of Africa, expounding the conditions under which the unwilling apostates were to be taken back.

<doc id="63007" wikidata="Q105570" url="?curid=63007" title="20 July plot">
<text>The 20 July plot was a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, the chancellor and leader of Nazi Germany, and overthrow the Nazi regime on 20 July 1944. The plotters were part of the German resistance, mainly composed of Wehrmacht officers. The leader of the conspiracy, Claus von Stauffenberg, tried to kill Hitler by detonating an explosive hidden in a briefcase. However, due to the location of the bomb at the time of detonation, the blast only dealt Hitler minor injuries. The planners&#x27; subsequent coup attempt also failed and resulted in a purge of the Wehrmacht.

As early as 1938, German military officers had plotted to overthrow Hitler, but indecisive leadership and the pace of global events stymied action. Plotters gained a sense of urgency in 1943, after Germany lost the Battle of Stalingrad and Soviet forces began to push towards Germany. Under the leadership of Stauffenberg, plotters tried to assassinate Hitler at least five different times in 1943 and 1944. With the Gestapo closing in on the plotters, a final attempt was organized in July 1944. Stauffenberg personally took a briefcase full of explosives to a conference in the Wolf&#x27;s Lair. The explosives were armed and placed next to Hitler, but it appears they were moved unwittingly at the last moment behind a table leg by Heinz Brandt, inadvertently saving Hitler&#x27;s life. When the bomb detonated, it killed Brandt and two others, while the rest of the room&#x27;s occupants were injured, one of whom, Rudolf Schmundt, later died from his injuries. Hitler&#x27;s trousers were singed by the blast, and he suffered a perforated eardrum and conjunctivitis, but was otherwise unharmed.

The plotters, unaware of their failure, then attempted a coup d&#x27;état. A few hours after the blast, the conspiracy used Wehrmacht units to take control of several cities, including Berlin, right after giving them disinformation on the intention of the orders they were given. This part of the coup d&#x27;état attempt is referred to by the name &quot;Operation Valkyrie&quot;, which also has become associated with the entire event. Within hours, the Nazi regime had reasserted its control of Germany. A few members of the conspiracy, including Stauffenberg, were executed by firing squad the same night. In the months after the coup d&#x27;état attempt, the Gestapo arrested more than 7,000 people, 4,980 of whom were executed. Roughly 200 conspirators were executed.

The apparent aim of the coup d&#x27;état attempt was to wrest political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the Western Allies as soon as possible. The details of the conspirators&#x27; peace initiatives remain unknown, but they would have included unrealistic demands for the confirmation of Germany&#x27;s extensive annexations of European territory.

== Background ==

Since 1938, there had been groups plotting an overthrow of some kind within the German Army and in the German Military Intelligence Organization. Early leaders of these plots included Major General Hans Oster, the deputy head of the Military Intelligence Office; Colonel General Ludwig Beck, a former Chief of Staff of the German Army High Command (OKH); and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, a former commander of the German 1st Army and the former Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Command in the West. They soon established contacts with several prominent civilians, including Carl Goerdeler, the former mayor of Leipzig, and Helmuth James von Moltke, the great-grandnephew of Moltke the Elder, hero of the Franco-Prussian War.

Groups of military plotters exchanged ideas with civilian, political, and intellectual resistance groups in the Kreisauer Kreis (which met at the von Moltke estate in Kreisau) and in other secret circles. Moltke was against killing Hitler; instead, he wanted him placed on trial. Moltke said, &quot;we are all amateurs and would only bungle it&quot;. Moltke also believed killing Hitler would be hypocritical: Hitler and National Socialism had turned wrongdoing into a system, something which the resistance should avoid.

Plans to stage an overthrow and prevent Hitler from launching a new world war were developed in 1938 and 1939, but were aborted because of the indecision of Army General Franz Halder and Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, and the failure of the Western powers to oppose Hitler&#x27;s aggression until 1939.

In 1942, a new conspiratorial group formed, led by Colonel Henning von Tresckow, a member of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock&#x27;s staff, who commanded Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa. Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists into the Group&#x27;s staff, making it the nerve centre of the army resistance. Little could be done against Hitler as he was heavily guarded, and none of the plotters could get near enough to him.

During 1942, Oster and Tresckow nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. Their most important recruit was General Friedrich Olbricht, head of the General Army Office headquarters at the Bendlerblock in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units throughout Germany. Linking this asset to Tresckow&#x27;s resistance group in Army Group Centre created a viable coup apparatus.

In late 1942, Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage an overthrow during Hitler&#x27;s visit to the headquarters of Army Group Centre at Smolensk in March 1943, by placing a bomb on his plane (Operation Spark). The bomb failed to detonate, and a second attempt a week later with Hitler at an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin also failed. These failures demoralised the conspirators. During 1943 Tresckow tried without success to recruit senior army field commanders such as Field Marshal Erich von Manstein and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, to support a seizure of power. Tresckow, in particular, worked on his Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, to persuade him to move against Hitler and at times succeeded in gaining his consent, only to find him indecisive at the last minute. However, despite their refusals, none of the Field Marshals reported their treasonous activities to the Gestapo or Hitler.

=== Motivation and goals ===
==== Opposition to Hitler and to Nazi policies ====
While the primary goal of the plotters was to remove Hitler from power, they did so for various reasons. The majority of the group behind the 20 July plot were conservative nationalists—idealists, but not necessarily of a democratic stripe. Martin Borschat portrays their motivations as a matter of aristocratic resentment, writing that the plot was mainly carried out by conservative elites who were initially integrated by the Nazi government but during the war lost their influence and were concerned about regaining it. However, at least in Stauffenberg&#x27;s case, the conviction that Nazi Germany&#x27;s atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war were a dishonour to the nation and its military was likely a major motivating factor. Historian Judith Michel assesses the circle around the 20 July Group as a diverse and heterogeneous group that included liberal democrats, conservatives, social democrats, authoritarian aristocrats, and even communists. The common goal was to overthrow Hitler&#x27;s regime and bring the war to a swift end. There is evidence of the plot encompassing a broad spectrum of plotters which included Communists that April, before the attempted coup, Stauffenberg agreed to cooperate with the Operational Leadership of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) remaining in Germany. Contacts were established through the Social Democrats Adolf Reichwein and Julius Leber.

==== Territorial demands ====
Among demands initially countenanced by the plotters for issue towards the Allies were such points as re-establishment of Germany&#x27;s 1914 boundaries with Belgium, France and Poland and no reparations. Like most of the rest of German resistance, the 20 July plotters believed in the idea of Greater Germany and as a condition for peace demanded that the western allies recognize as a minimum the incorporation of Austria, Alsace-Lorraine, Sudetenland, and the annexation of Polish-inhabited territories that Germany ceded to Poland after 1918, with the restoration of some of the overseas colonies. They believed that Europe should be controlled under German hegemony.

The overall goals towards Poland were mixed within the plotters. Most of the plotters found it desirable to restore the old German borders of 1914, while others pointed out that the demands were unrealistic, and amendments had to be made. Some like Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg even wanted all of Poland annexed to Germany.

To Poland, which was fighting against Nazi Germany with both its army and government in exile, the territorial demands and traditional nationalistic visions of resistance were not much different from the racist policies of Hitler. Stauffenberg, as one of the leaders of the plot, stated five years before the coup in 1939 during the Poland campaign: &quot;It is essential that we begin a systemic colonisation in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur.&quot;

==== Political vision of post-Hitler Germany ====
Many members of the plot had helped the Nazis gain power and shared revisionist foreign policy goals pursued by Hitler, and even at the time of the plot were anti-democratic, hoping to replace Hitler with a conservative-authoritarian government involving aristocratic rule. They opposed popular legitimation or mass participation in governance of the state.

==== Political program ====
The political program of the planned government was outlined in a draft for a government policy statement, consisting of twelve points:

# Restoration of the rule of law, independence of the courts, protection of personal and property security, dissolution of concentration camps, prevention of lynch law,
# Combating corruption, restitution of looted works of art, ending the persecution of Jews, punishment of war crimes,
# Dissolution of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda and an end to propaganda reporting on the course of the war,
# Separation of church and state, a Christian mindset as the basis for policies, freedom of the press,
# Restoration of Christian education by parents
# Reduction of bureaucracy, examination and possible punishment, dismissal or transfer of all officials appointed and promoted from 1 January 1933, especially Nazi party members
# Transformation of the provinces of Prussia and states into &quot;Reichsgaue&quot;, local self-government for the &quot;Reichsgaue&quot;, districts and municipalities under the supervision of &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;,
# Restoration of full economic freedom after the war, protection of private property, planned economic measures only under conditions of war-related shortages,
# Responsible and conscientious social policy in the hands of &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; and trade unions
# Ending national debt through tax increases and austerity policies, international agreement on debt repayment
# Continuation of the war for defence purposes only,
# Commencement of peace negotiations with the Western Allies, punishment of those Germans responsible for the Second World War.

== Planning a coup ==
=== Von Stauffenberg joins ===

By mid-1943, the tide of war was turning decisively against Germany. The army plotters and their civilian allies became convinced that Hitler should be assassinated, so that a government acceptable to the western Allies could be formed, and a separate peace negotiated in time to prevent a Soviet invasion of Germany. In August 1943, Tresckow met, for the first time, a young staff officer named Lieutenant Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Severely wounded in North Africa, Claus von Stauffenberg was a political conservative and zealous German nationalist.

From early 1942, he had come to share two basic convictions with many military officers: that Germany was being led to disaster and that Hitler&#x27;s removal from power was necessary. After the Battle of Stalingrad in December 1942, despite his religious scruples, he concluded that the Führer&#x27;s assassination was a lesser moral evil than Hitler&#x27;s remaining in power. Stauffenberg brought a new tone of decisiveness to the ranks of the resistance movement. When Tresckow was assigned to the Eastern Front, Stauffenberg took charge of planning and executing the assassination attempt.

=== New plan ===
Olbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The Replacement Army (&quot;Ersatzheer&quot;) had an operational plan called Operation Valkyrie, which was to be used in the event that the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities would cause a breakdown in law and order, or an uprising by the millions of forced labourers from occupied countries now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilise the Reserve Army for the purpose of the coup.

In August and September 1943, Tresckow drafted the &quot;revised&quot; Valkyrie plan and new supplementary orders. A secret declaration began with these words: &quot;The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead! A treacherous group of party leaders has attempted to exploit the situation by attacking our embattled soldiers from the rear in order to seize power for themselves.&quot; Detailed instructions were written for occupation of government ministries in Berlin, Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s headquarters in East Prussia, radio stations and telephone offices, and other Nazi apparatus through military districts, and concentration camps.

Previously, it was believed that Stauffenberg was mainly responsible for the Valkyrie plan, but documents recovered by the Soviet Union after the war and released in 2007 suggest that the plan was developed by Tresckow by autumn of 1943. All written information was handled by Tresckow&#x27;s wife, Erika, and by Margarethe von Oven, his secretary. Both women wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. On at least two other occasions Tresckow had tried to assassinate the Führer. The first plan was to shoot him during dinner at the army base camp, but this plan was aborted because it was widely believed that Hitler wore a bullet-proof vest. The conspirators also considered poisoning him, but this was not possible because his food was specially prepared and tasted. They concluded that a time bomb was the only option.

Operation Valkyrie could only be put into effect by Hitler himself, or by General Friedrich Fromm, commander of the Reserve Army, so the latter had to be either won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralised if the plan was to succeed.

=== Previous failed attempts ===

During 1943 and early 1944 von Tresckow and von Stauffenberg organised at least five attempts to get one of the military conspirators near enough to Hitler, for long enough to kill him with hand grenades, bombs, or a revolver:
* 13 March 1943 by von Tresckow
* 21 March 1943 by Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff
* late November 1943 by Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst
* February 1944 by Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin
* 11 March 1944 by Eberhard Freiherr von Breitenbuch

As the war situation deteriorated, Hitler no longer appeared in public and rarely visited Berlin. He spent most of his time at his headquarters at the near Rastenburg in East Prussia, with occasional breaks at his Bavarian mountain retreat Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden. In both places, he was heavily guarded and rarely saw people he did not know or trust. Himmler and the Gestapo were increasingly suspicious of plots against Hitler and rightly suspected the officers of the General Staff, which was indeed the source of many conspiracies against him.

=== Preparations ===
By the summer of 1944, the Gestapo was closing in on the conspirators. When Stauffenberg sent Tresckow a message through Lieutenant Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort asking whether there was any reason for trying to assassinate Hitler given that no political purpose would be served, Tresckow&#x27;s response was: &quot;The assassination must be attempted, &quot;coûte que coûte&quot; [whatever the cost]. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin ⁠,⁠ ⁠for the practical purpose no longer matters; what matters now is that the German resistance movement must take the plunge before the eyes of the world and of history. Compared to that, nothing else matters.&quot;

Himmler had at least one conversation with a known oppositionist when, in August 1943, the Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz, who was involved in Goerdeler&#x27;s network, came to see him and offered him the support of the opposition if he would make a move to displace Hitler and secure a negotiated end to the war. Nothing came of this meeting, but Popitz was not immediately arrested (although he was later executed towards the end of the war), and Himmler apparently did nothing to track down the resistance network which he knew was operating within the state bureaucracy. It is possible that Himmler, who by late 1943 knew that the war was unwinnable, allowed the plot to go ahead in the belief that if it succeeded he would be Hitler&#x27;s successor, and could then bring about a peace settlement. Himmler himself would later in April of 1945 try to attempt to form a separate peace with the allies in order to remain in some sort of power, it was rejected as the allies continued to demand unconditional surrender, which would have been a block on any negotiated settlement. 

Popitz was not alone in seeing Himmler as a potential ally. General von Bock advised Tresckow to seek his support, but there is no evidence that he did so. Goerdeler was apparently also in indirect contact with Himmler via a mutual acquaintance, Carl Langbehn. Wilhelm Canaris biographer Heinz Höhne suggests that Canaris and Himmler were working together to bring about a change of regime, but this remains speculation.

Tresckow and the inner circle of plotters had no intention of removing Hitler just to see him replaced by the dreaded and ruthless SS chief, and the plan was to kill them both if possible—to the extent that Stauffenberg&#x27;s first attempt on 11 July was aborted because Himmler was not present.

== Countdown to Stauffenberg&#x27;s attempt ==
=== First week of July ===
On Saturday, 1 July 1944 Stauffenberg was appointed Chief of Staff to General Fromm at the Reserve Army headquarters on Bendlerstraße in central Berlin. This position enabled Stauffenberg to attend Hitler&#x27;s military conferences, either at the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; in East Prussia or at Berchtesgaden, and would thus give him an opportunity, perhaps the last that would present itself, to kill Hitler with a bomb or a pistol. Meanwhile, new key allies had been gained. These included General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, the German military commander in France, who would take control in Paris when Hitler was killed, and it was hoped, negotiate an immediate armistice with the invading Allied armies.

=== Aborted attempts ===
The plot was now fully prepared. On 7 July 1944 General Helmuth Stieff was to kill Hitler at a display of new uniforms at Klessheim castle near Salzburg. However, Stieff felt unable to kill Hitler. Stauffenberg now decided to do both, assassinate Hitler and to manage the plot in Berlin.

On 14 July Stauffenberg attended Hitler&#x27;s conferences carrying a bomb in his briefcase, but because the conspirators had decided that Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring should be killed simultaneously if the planned mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie was to have a chance to succeed, he held back at the last minute because Himmler was not present. In fact, it was unusual for Himmler to attend military conferences.

By 15 July, when Stauffenberg again flew to the , this condition had been dropped. The plan was for Stauffenberg to plant the briefcase with the bomb in Hitler&#x27;s conference room with a timer running, excuse himself from the meeting, wait for the explosion, then fly back to Berlin and join the other plotters at the Bendlerblock. Operation Valkyrie would be mobilised, the Reserve Army would take control of Germany and the other Nazi leaders would be arrested. Beck would be appointed provisional head of state, Goerdeler would be chancellor, and Witzleben would be commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Again on 15 July, the attempt was called off at the last minute. Himmler and Göring were present, but Hitler was called out of the room at the last moment. Stauffenberg was able to intercept the bomb and prevent its discovery.

== 20 July 1944 ==
=== Operation Valkyrie ===

On 18 July rumours reached Stauffenberg that the Gestapo had knowledge of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time—this was apparently not true, but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. On the morning of Thursday, 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; for another Hitler military conference, once again with a bomb in his briefcase.

At around 12:30 pm as the conference began, Stauffenberg asked to use a washroom in Wilhelm Keitel&#x27;s office, saying that he had to change his shirt, which indeed was soaked through with sweat, it being a very hot day. There, assisted by von Haeften, he used pliers to crush the end of a pencil detonator inserted into a block of plastic explosive wrapped in brown paper, that was prepared by Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven. The pencil detonator consisted of a thin copper tube containing cupric chloride that would take about ten minutes to silently eat through wire holding back the firing pin from the percussion cap. It was slow going due to war wounds that had cost Stauffenberg an eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. Interrupted by a guard knocking on the door advising him that the meeting was about to begin, he was not able to prime the second bomb, which he gave to his aide-de-camp, Werner von Haeften.

Stauffenberg placed the single primed bomb inside his briefcase and, with the unwitting assistance of Major Ernst John von Freyend, entered the conference room containing Hitler and 20 officers, positioning the briefcase under the table near Hitler. After a few minutes, Stauffenberg received a planned telephone call and left the room. It is presumed that Colonel Heinz Brandt, who was standing next to Hitler, used his foot to move the briefcase aside by pushing it behind the leg of the conference table, thus unintentionally deflecting the blast from Hitler but causing the loss of one of his legs and his own demise when the bomb detonated.

At 12:42 the bomb detonated, demolishing the conference room and killing a stenographer instantly. More than 20 people in the room were injured with three officers later dying. Hitler survived, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg. His trousers were singed and tattered (see photograph below) and he suffered from a perforated eardrum (as did most of the other 24 people in the room), as well as from conjunctivitis in his right eye. Hitler&#x27;s personal physician, Theodor Morell, administered penicillin which had been taken from captured Allied soldiers for treatment; Morell had previously observed the death of Reinhard Heydrich from sepsis in an assassination 2 years earlier.

=== Escape from the Wolf&#x27;s Lair and flight to Berlin ===
Stauffenberg was seen leaving the conference building by Kurt Salterberg, a soldier on guard duty who did not consider this out of the ordinary as attendees sometimes left to collect documents. He then saw a &quot;massive&quot; cloud of smoke, wood splinters and paper and men being hurled through a window and door. Stauffenberg, upon witnessing the explosion and smoke, erroneously believed that Hitler was &quot;truly&quot; dead. He then climbed into a staff car with his aide Werner von Haeften and managed to bluff his way past three checkpoints to exit the complex. Werner von Haeften then tossed the second unprimed bomb into the forest as they made a dash for Rastenburg airfield, reaching it before it could be realised that Stauffenberg could be responsible for the explosion. At first it was thought that the explosion had been the result of a bombing, but when it was confirmed that no warplanes had flown over and Stauffenberg was absent, the theory of an attack gained strength. By 13:00 he was airborne in a Heinkel He 111 arranged by General Eduard Wagner.
By the time Stauffenberg&#x27;s aircraft reached Berlin about 16:00, General Erich Fellgiebel, an officer at the who was in on the plot, had phoned the Bendlerblock and told the plotters that Hitler had survived the explosion. As a result, the plot to mobilise Operation Valkyrie would have no chance of succeeding once the officers of the Reserve Army knew that Hitler was alive. There was more confusion when Stauffenberg&#x27;s aircraft landed and he phoned from the airport to say that Hitler was in fact dead. The Bendlerblock plotters did not know whom to believe.

Finally, at 16:00 Olbricht issued the orders for Operation Valkyrie to be mobilised. The vacillating General Fromm, however, phoned Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair and was assured that Hitler was alive. Keitel demanded to know Stauffenberg&#x27;s whereabouts. This told Fromm that the plot had been traced to his headquarters and that he was in mortal danger. Fromm replied that he thought Stauffenberg was with Hitler.

Meanwhile, General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, military governor of occupied France, managed to disarm the SD and SS and captured most of their leadership. He travelled to Field Marshal Günther von Kluge&#x27;s headquarters and asked him to contact the Allies, only to be informed that Hitler was alive. At 16:40 Stauffenberg and Haeften arrived at the Bendlerblock. Fromm, presumably to protect himself, changed sides and attempted to have Stauffenberg arrested. Olbricht and Stauffenberg restrained him at gunpoint and Olbricht then appointed General Erich Hoepner to take over his duties.

By this time Himmler had taken charge of the situation and had issued orders countermanding Olbricht&#x27;s mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie. In many places the coup was going ahead, led by officers who believed that Hitler was dead. City Commandant, and conspirator, Lieutenant General Paul von Hase ordered the , under the command of Major Otto Ernst Remer, to secure the Wilhelmstraße and arrest Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In Vienna, Prague, and many other places troops occupied Nazi Party offices and arrested Gauleiters and SS officers.

=== Failure of the coup ===

At around 18:10, the commander of Military District III (Berlin), General Joachim von Kortzfleisch, was summoned to the Bendlerblock; he angrily refused Olbricht&#x27;s orders, kept shouting &quot;the Führer is alive&quot;, was arrested, and held under guard. General Karl Freiherr von Thüngen was appointed in his place but proved to be of almost no help. General Fritz Lindemann, who was supposed to make a proclamation to the German people over the radio, failed to appear and as he held the only copy, Beck had to work on a new one.
At 19:00, Hitler was sufficiently recovered to make phone calls. He called Goebbels at the Propaganda Ministry. Goebbels arranged for Hitler to speak to Major Otto Ernst Remer, commander of the troops surrounding the Ministry. After assuring him that he was still alive, Hitler ordered Remer to regain control of the situation in Berlin and capture the conspirators alive. Major Remer ordered his troops to surround and seal off the Bendlerblock, but not to enter the buildings. At 20:00 a furious Witzleben arrived at the Bendlerblock and had a bitter argument with Stauffenberg, who was still insisting that the coup could go ahead. Witzleben left shortly afterwards. At around this time the planned seizure of power in Paris was aborted when Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief in the West, learned that Hitler was alive.

As Remer regained control of the city and word spread that Hitler was still alive, the less resolute members of the conspiracy in Berlin began to change sides. Fromm was freed from his room and fighting broke out in the Bendlerblock between officers supporting and opposing the coup; Stauffenberg was wounded after a shootout. As the fighting was still ongoing, Remer and his forces arrived at the Bendlerblock and the conspirators were overwhelmed and arrested; by 23:00 Fromm and Remer had regained control of the building.

Perhaps hoping that a show of zealous loyalty would save him, Fromm convened an &quot;impromptu&quot; court martial consisting of himself, and sentenced Olbricht, Stauffenberg, Haeften and another officer, Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, to death, while putting Beck under arrest; Beck, realising the situation was hopeless, asked for a pistol and shot himself—the first of many attempted suicides in the coming days. At first Beck only seriously wounded himself—he was then shot in the neck and killed by soldiers. Despite protests from Remer (who had been ordered by Hitler to arrest the conspirators), at 00:10 on 21 July the four officers were executed in the courtyard outside, possibly to prevent them from revealing Fromm&#x27;s involvement. Others would have been executed as well, but at 00:30 Waffen-SS personnel led by SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Otto Skorzeny arrived and further executions were forbidden.

== Aftermath ==

Over the following weeks, Himmler&#x27;s Gestapo, driven by a furious Hitler, rounded up nearly everyone who had the remotest connection with the plot. The discovery of letters and diaries in the homes and offices of those arrested revealed the plots of 1938, 1939, and 1943, and this led to further rounds of arrests, including that of colonel general Franz Halder, who finished the war in a concentration camp. Under Himmler&#x27;s new (blood guilt) laws, many relatives of the principal plotters were also arrested in the immediate aftermath of the failed plot.

Sippenhaft was proposed and introduced by Heinrich Himmler and remained in effect until the end of the war. Its distribution was aimed at creating fears among Wehrmacht members for their families in the event of an attempted betrayal. At first, the practice was not regulated and was carried out chaotically, which was due to Himmler’s refusal to “establish specific rules regarding clan guardianship”, however, on February 5, 1945, Keitel’s order was issued, according to which the family of a serviceman who committed high treason was subjected to repression up to and including the death penalty. Presumably, the Sippenhaft regulation was introduced to tighten control over the military and keep them in the army during the final period of the war.

Particularly noteworthy in considering this issue is the scientific publication of Robert Loeffel. In his study, Loeffel came to the conclusion that &quot;Sippenhaft&quot;, as part of state terror at the end of the war, was a means of intimidation within Nazi Germany, when in reality this practice was not always applied, and most of the terror was adopted only after July 20. This was due to its duality: terror was implemented only in quantities necessary to maintain a level of fear among the population that would not lead them to go over to the side of resistance.

More than 7,000 people were arrested and 4,980 were executed. Not all of them were connected with the plot, since the Gestapo used the occasion to settle scores with many other people suspected of opposition sympathies. Alfons Heck, former Hitler Youth member and later a historian, describes the reaction many Germans felt to the punishments of the conspirators:

Allied radio stations also speculated on who the possible remaining suspects could be, many of whom were eventually implicated in the plot.

Very few of the plotters tried to escape or to deny their guilt when arrested. Those who survived interrogation were given perfunctory trials before the People&#x27;s Court, a kangaroo court that always decided in favour of the prosecution. The court&#x27;s president, Roland Freisler, was a fanatical Nazi seen shouting furiously and insulting the accused in the trial, which was filmed for propaganda purposes. The plotters were stripped of their uniforms and given old, shabby clothing to humiliate them for the cameras. The officers involved in the plot were &quot;tried&quot; before the Court of Military Honour, a drumhead court-martial that merely considered the evidence furnished to it by the Gestapo before expelling the accused from the Army in disgrace and handing them over to the People&#x27;s Court.

The first trials were held on 7 and 8 August 1944. Hitler had ordered that those found guilty should be &quot;hanged like cattle&quot;. Many people took their own lives prior to either their trial or their execution, including Kluge, who was accused of having knowledge of the plot beforehand and not revealing it to Hitler. Stülpnagel tried to commit suicide, but survived and was hanged.

Tresckow killed himself the day after the failed plot by use of a hand grenade in no man&#x27;s land between Soviet and German lines. 
Adjutant General Fabian von Schlabrendorff remembers Tresckow saying the following before his death:
Fromm&#x27;s attempt to win favour by executing Stauffenberg and others on the night of 20 July had merely exposed his own previous lack of action and apparent failure to report the plot. Having been arrested on 21 July, Fromm was later convicted and sentenced to death by the People&#x27;s Court. Despite his knowledge of the conspiracy, his formal sentence charged him with poor performance in his duties. He was executed in Brandenburg an der Havel. Hitler personally commuted his death sentence from hanging to the &quot;more honourable&quot; firing squad. Erwin Planck, the son of the famous physicist Max Planck, was executed for his involvement.

According to a report of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Ernst Kaltenbrunner to Hitler dated 29 November 1944 on the background of the plot, states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli, Pope Pius XII, as being a party in the attempt. Evidence indicates that 20 July plotters Colonel Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven, Colonel Erwin von Lahousen, and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris were involved in the foiling of Hitler&#x27;s alleged plot to kidnap or murder Pope Pius XII in 1943, when Canaris reported the plot to Italian counterintelligence officer General Cesare Amè, who passed on the information.

A member of the SA convicted of participating in the plot was SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, who was the Police Chief of Berlin and had been in contact with members of the resistance since before the war. Collaborating closely with SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Arthur Nebe, he was supposed to direct all police forces in Berlin to stand down and not interfere in the military actions to seize the government. However, his actions on 20 July had minimal influence on the events. For his involvement in the conspiracy, he was later arrested, convicted of treason and executed.

After 3 February 1945, when Freisler was killed in an American air raid, there were no more formal trials, but as late as April, with the war weeks away from its end, Canaris&#x27; diary was found, and many more people were implicated. Hans Von Dohnanyi was accused of being the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler, and executed 6 April 1945. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, whom Von Dohnanyi had recruited into the Abwehr, was executed 9 April 1945 along with Canaris, Oster, and 4 others. Executions continued and ramped up into the last days of the war, as the Nazis were determined to take down as many of their enemies with them as they possibly could. 

Hitler took his survival to be a &quot;divine moment in history&quot;, and commissioned a special decoration to be made for each person wounded or killed in the blast. The result was the Wound Badge of 20 July 1944. The badges were struck in three values: gold, silver, and black. (The colours denoted the severity of the wounds received by each recipient.) A total of 100 badges were manufactured, and 47 are believed to have actually been awarded. Each badge was accompanied by an ornate award document personally signed by Hitler. The badges themselves bore a facsimile of his signature, making them among the rarest decorations to have been awarded by Nazi Germany.

For his role in stopping the coup Major Remer was promoted to colonel and ended the war as a Major General. After the war he co-founded the Socialist Reich Party and remained a prominent Neo-Nazi and advocate of Holocaust denial until his death in 1997.

Major Philipp von Boeselager, the German officer who provided the plastic explosives used in the bomb, escaped detection and survived the war. He was the second-to-last survivor of those involved in the plot and died on 1 May 2008, aged 90. The last survivor of the 20 July Plot was &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin, the thwarted plotter of just a few months before. He died on 8 March 2013, aged 90.

As a result of the failed coup, every member of the Wehrmacht was required to reswear his loyalty oath, by name, to Hitler and on 24 July 1944 the military salute was replaced throughout the armed forces with the Hitler Salute in which the arm was outstretched and the salutation was given.

== Planned government ==
The conspirators had earlier designated positions in secret to form a government that would take office after the assassination of Hitler were it to prove successful. Because of the plot&#x27;s failure, such a government never rose to power and most of its members were executed.

The following were slated for these roles as of July 1944:

* Ludwig Beck – President
* Carl Friedrich Goerdeler – Chancellor
* Wilhelm Leuschner – Vice-Chancellor
* Paul Löbe – President of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;
* Claus von Stauffenberg – State Secretary
* Julius Leber – Interior Ministry (considered)
* Eugen Bolz – Minister of the Interior (considered)
* Friedrich von der Schulenburg – Foreign Minister (considered)
* Ulrich von Hassell – Foreign Minister (considered)
* Ewald Löser – Minister of Finance
* Friedrich Olbricht – Minister of War
* Erwin von Witzleben – Minister of Defence and Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht
* Hans Oster – President of the &quot;Reichskriegsgericht&quot;
* Hans Koch – President of the &quot;Reichsgericht&quot;
* Karl Blessing – President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot; (or Minister of Economics)
* Paul Lejeune-Jung – Minister of Economics
* Andreas Hermes – Minister of Agriculture
* Josef Wirmer – Minister of Justice
* Bernhard Letterhaus – Reconstruction Minister
* Henning von Tresckow – Chief of Police
* Carl-Hans Graf von Hardenberg – Prime Minister of Berlin and Brandenburg
Albert Speer was listed in several notes of the conspirators as a possible Minister of Armaments; however, most of these notes stated Speer should not be approached until after Hitler was dead and one conjectural government chart had a question mark beside Speer&#x27;s name. This (in addition to Speer being one of Hitler&#x27;s closest and most trusted friends) most likely saved Speer from arrest by the SS.

Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany was also under suspicion as he was touted to be head of state after Hitler. He was placed under the supervision of the Gestapo and his home in the Cecilienhof at Potsdam watched.

== Erwin Rommel&#x27;s involvement ==
The extent of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel&#x27;s involvement in the military&#x27;s resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as most of the leaders who were directly involved did not survive and limited documentation on the conspirators&#x27; plans and preparations exists. Historians&#x27; opinions on this matter vary greatly. According to Peter Hoffmann, he had turned into Hitler&#x27;s resolute opponent and in the end supported the coup (though not the assassination itself). He was even the natural leader of the opposition in France to some extent, considering the fact he had drawn many military and political personnel into his orbit in preparation of a &quot;Western solution&quot;. Ralf Georg Reuth thinks that the conspirators perhaps mistook Rommel&#x27;s ambiguous attitude for approval of the assassination, considering: the conspirators normally did not explicitly mention the assassination; Rommel was very naive and attached to Hitler (who was the personification of National Socialism, which had provided Rommel with a great career) and thus even if Hofacker—personal advisor to Stülpnagel—had mentioned a violent upheaval in Berlin, he would not have interpreted it as an assassination. Thus, Rommel&#x27;s participation remains ambiguous and the perception of it largely has its source in the subsequent events (especially Rommel&#x27;s forced suicide) and the accounts by surviving participants.
According to a post-war account by Karl Strölin, the of Stuttgart at that time, he and two other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler conspiracy in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel&#x27;s new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, but not to the plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only came to the attention of Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel&#x27;s headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty. Witzleben was a field marshal, but had not been on active duty since 1942. The conspirators gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.

Speidel met with former foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel&#x27;s request, although the latter was not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations in the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. Around the same timeframe, however, the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided to take part in the conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support. Three days before the assassination attempt, on 17 July, Rommel&#x27;s staff car was strafed by an Allied aircraft in France; he was hospitalised with major injuries and incapacitated on 20 July.

Rommel opposed assassinating Hitler. After the war, his widow maintained that he believed an assassination attempt would spark a civil war. According to journalist and author William L. Shirer, Rommel knew about the conspiracy and advocated that Hitler be arrested and placed on trial. The historian Ian Becket argues that &quot;there is no credible evidence that Rommel had more than limited and superficial knowledge of the plot&quot; and concludes that he would not have acted to aid the plotters in the aftermath of the attempt on 20 July, while the historian Ralf Georg Reuth contends that &quot;there was no indication of any active participation of Rommel in the conspiracy.&quot; Historian Richard J. Evans concluded that he knew of a plot, but was not involved.

What is not debated are the results of the failed bomb plot of 20 July. Many conspirators were arrested and the dragnet expanded to thousands. Consequently, it did not take long for Rommel to come under suspicion. He was primarily implicated through his connection to Kluge. Rommel&#x27;s name also came up in confessions made under torture by Stülpnagel and Hofacker, and was included in Goerdeler&#x27;s papers on a list of potential supporters. Hofacker confessed that Rommel had agreed to demand for Hitler to step down, and if he refused, Rommel would join the other conspirators in deposing Hitler. Rommel was also planned to become a member of the post-Hitler government in papers drawn up by Goerdeler.

Hitler knew it would cause a major scandal on the home front to have the popular Rommel publicly branded as a traitor. With this in mind, he opted to give Rommel the option of suicide via cyanide or a public trial by Freisler&#x27;s People&#x27;s Court. Rommel was well aware that being hauled before the People&#x27;s Court was tantamount to a death sentence. He also knew that if he chose to stand trial, his family would have been severely punished even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution. With this in mind, he committed suicide on 14 October 1944. He was buried with full military honours and his family was spared from persecution; his cause of death did not come to light until after the war.

=== Involvement in war crimes and atrocities ===

Involvement of the plotters in war crimes and atrocities has been studied by historians such as Christian Gerlach. Gerlach proved that plotters such as Tresckow and Gersdorff were aware of mass murder happening in the East from at least 1941. He writes: &quot;Especially with reference to the murder of the Jews, [it is said that] &#x27;the SS&#x27; had deceived the officers by killing in secret, filing incomplete reports or none at all; if general staff officers protested, the SS threatened them.&quot; Gerlach concludes: &quot;This is, of course, nonsense.&quot;

Tresckow also &quot;signed orders for the deportation of thousands of orphaned children for forced labor in the Reich&quot;—the so-called . Such actions led historians to question the motives of the plotters, which seemed more concerned with the military situation than with Nazi atrocities and German war crimes. However some others assert that, in such actions, Tresckow had to act out of principle to continue with his coup plans.

Gerlach pointed out that the plotters had &quot;selective moral criteria&quot; and while they were concerned about Jews being exterminated in the Holocaust, they were far less disturbed about mass murder of civilians in the East. To Gerlach, the primary motivation of the plotters was to ensure German victory in the war or at least prevent defeat. Gerlach&#x27;s arguments were later supported by historian Hans Mommsen, who stated that the plotters were interested above all in military victory. However, Gerlach&#x27;s arguments were also criticized by some scholars, among them Peter Hoffmann from McGill University and from the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung. While acknowledging that Tresckow and other 20 July conspirators had been involved in war crimes, Arnold writes that Gerlach&#x27;s argument is oversimplified. In 2011, Danny Orbach, a Harvard-based historian, wrote that Gerlach&#x27;s reading of the sources is highly skewed, and, at times, diametrically opposed to what they actually say. In one case, according to Orbach, Gerlach had falsely paraphrased the memoir of the resistance fighter Colonel Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, and in another case, quoted misleadingly from an SS document. Hence, Orbach concludes that Gerlach&#x27;s thesis on the German resistance is highly unreliable.

== Commemoration and collective memory ==
A 1951 survey by the Allensbach Institute revealed that &quot;Only a third of respondents had a positive opinion about the men and women who had tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Nazi regime.&quot;

The &quot;first official memorial service for the resistance fighters of 20 July&quot; was held on the tenth anniversary in 1954. In his speech at the event, Theodor Heuss, the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany, said that &quot;harsh words&quot; were necessary, and that &quot;There have been cases of refusal to carry out orders that have achieved historic greatness.&quot; After this speech, public opinion in Germany began to shift.

Nonetheless, a 1956 proposal to name a school after Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was opposed by a majority of citizens, and, according to Deutsche Welle (in 2014):

The first all-German commemoration of the event did not take place until 1990. In 2013, the last surviving member of the plot, Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin, died in Munich. , the resistance fighters are generally considered heroes in Germany, according to Deutsche Welle.

<doc id="63008" wikidata="Q160935" url="?curid=63008" title="Pope Symmachus">
<text>Pope Symmachus (died 19 July 514) was the bishop of Rome from 22 November 498 to his death. His tenure was marked by a serious schism over who was elected pope by a majority of the Roman clergy.

==Early life==
He was born on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (then under Vandal rule), the son of Fortunatus; Jeffrey Richards notes that he was born a pagan, and &quot;perhaps the rankest outsider&quot; of all the Ostrogothic Popes, most of whom were members of aristocratic families. Symmachus was baptised in Rome, where he became Archdeacon of the Roman Church under Pope Anastasius II (496–498).

==Papacy==
Symmachus was elected pope on 22 November 498 in the Constantinian basilica (Saint John Lateran). The archpriest of Santa Prassede, Laurentius, was elected pope on the same day at the Basilica of Saint Mary (presumably Saint Mary Major) by a dissenting faction with Byzantine sympathies, who were supported by Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius. Both factions agreed to allow the Gothic King Theodoric the Great to arbitrate. He ruled that the one who was elected first and whose supporters were the most numerous should be recognized as pope. This was a purely political decision. An investigation favored Symmachus and his election was recognized as proper. However, an early document known as the &quot;Laurentian Fragment&quot; claims that Symmachus obtained the decision by paying bribes, while deacon Magnus Felix Ennodius of Milan later wrote that 400 &quot;solidi&quot; were distributed amongst influential personages, whom it would be indiscreet to name.

===Roman Synod I===

Symmachus proceeded to call a synod, to be held at Rome on 1 March 499, which was attended by 72 bishops and all of the Roman clergy. Laurentius attended this synod. Afterwards he was assigned the diocesis of Nuceria in Campania. According to the account in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Symmachus bestowed the See on Laurentius &quot;guided by sympathy&quot;, but the &quot;Laurentian Fragment&quot; states that Laurentius &quot;was severely threatened and cajoled, and forcibly despatched&quot; to Nuceria (now Nocera Inferiore, in the Province of Salerno). The synod also ordained that any cleric who sought to gain votes for a successor to the papacy during the lifetime of the pope, or who called conferences and held consultations for that purpose, should be deposed and excommunicated.

===Ariminum Synod II===
In 501, the Senator Rufius Postumius Festus, a supporter of Laurentius, accused Symmachus of various crimes. The initial charge was that Symmachus celebrated Easter on the wrong date. The king Theodoric summoned him to Ariminum to respond to the charge. The pope arrived only to discover a number of other charges, including unchastity and the misuse of church property, would also be brought against him. Symmachus panicked, fleeing from Ariminum in the middle of the night with only one companion. His flight proved to be a miscalculation, as it was regarded as an admission of guilt. Laurentius was brought back to Rome by his supporters, but a sizeable group of the clergy, including most of the most senior clerics, withdrew from communion with him. A visiting bishop, Peter of Altinum, was appointed by Theodoric to celebrate Easter 502 and assume the administration of the See, pending the decision of a synod to be convened following Easter.

Presided over by the other Italian metropolitans, Peter II of Ravenna, Laurentius of Milan, and Marcellianus of Aquileia, the synod opened in the Basilica of Santa Maria (Maggiore). It proved tumultuous. The session quickly deadlocked over the presence of a visiting bishop, Peter of Altina, who had been sent by Theoderic as Apostolic Visitor, at the request of Senators Festus and Probinus, the opponents of Symmachus. Symmachus argued that the presence of a visiting bishop implied the See of Rome was vacant, and the See could only be vacant if he were guilty—which meant the case had already been decided before the evidence could be heard. Although the majority of the assembled bishops agreed with this, the Apostolic Visitor could not be made to withdraw without Theodoric&#x27;s permission; this was not forthcoming. In response to this deadlock, rioting by the citizens of Rome increased, causing a number of bishops to flee Rome and the rest to petition Theodoric to move the synod to Ravenna.

===Roman Synod III===
King Theodoric refused their request to move the synod, ordering them instead to reconvene on 1 September. On 27 August the King wrote to the bishops that he was sending two of the &quot;Majores Domus nostrae&quot;, Gudila and Bedeulphus, to see to it that the synod assembled in safety and without fear. Upon reconvening, matters were no less acrimonious. First the accusers introduced a document which included a clause stating that the king already knew Symmachus was guilty, and thus the synod should assume guilt, hear the evidence, then pass sentence. More momentous was an attack by a mob on Pope Symmachus&#x27; party as he set out to make his appearance at the Synod: many of his supporters were injured and several—including the priests Gordianus and Dignissimus—killed. Symmachus retreated to St. Peter&#x27;s and refused to come out, despite the urgings of deputations from the synod. The &quot;Life of Symmachus&quot;, however, presents these killings as part of the street-fighting between the supporters of Senators Festus and Probinus on the one side, and Senator Faustus on the other. The attacks were directed particularly against clerics, including Dignissimus, a priest of San Pietro in Vincoli, and Gordianus, a priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, though the rhetoric of the passage extends the violence to anyone who was a supporter of Symmachus, man or woman, cleric or layperson. It was unsafe for a cleric to walk about in Rome at night.

===Palmaris Synod IV===
At this point, the synod petitioned king Theodoric once again, asking permission to dissolve the meeting and return home. Theodoric replied, in a letter dated 1 October, that they must see the matter to a conclusion. So the bishops assembled once again on 23 October 502 at a place known as Palma, and after reviewing the events of the previous two sessions decided that since the pope was the successor of Peter the Apostle, they could not pass judgment on him, and left the matter to God to decide. All who had abandoned communion with him were urged to reconcile with him, and that any clergy who celebrated mass in Rome without his consent in the future should be punished as a schismatic. The resolutions were signed by 76 bishops, led by Laurentius of Milan and Peter of Ravenna.

==== End of papacy ====
Despite the outcome of the synod, Laurentius returned to Rome, and for the next four years, according to the &quot;Laurentian Fragment&quot;, he held its churches and ruled as pope with the support of the senator Festus. The struggle between the two factions was carried out on two fronts. One was through mob violence committed by supporters of each religious camp, and it is vividly described in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. The other was through diplomacy, which produced a sheaf of forged documents, the so-called &quot;Symmachian forgeries&quot;, of judgments in ecclesiastical law to support Symmachus&#x27; claim that as pope he could not be called to account. The forgeries are speculated to have emerged during the Roman Synod III and served to provide the conclusion provided at Palmaris. A more productive achievement on the diplomatic front was to convince king Theodoric to intervene, conducted chiefly by two non-Roman supporters, the Milanese deacon Ennodius and the exiled deacon Dioscorus. At last Theodoric withdrew his support of Laurentius in 506, instructing Festus to hand over the Roman churches to Symmachus.

In 513, Caesarius, bishop of Arles, visited Symmachus while being detained in Italy. This meeting led to Caesarius&#x27; receiving a &quot;pallium&quot;. Based on this introduction, Caesarius later wrote to Symmachus for help with establishing his authority, which Symmachus eagerly gave, according to William Klingshirn, &quot;to gather outside support for his primacy.&quot;

Pope Symmachus provided money and clothing to the Catholic bishops of Africa and Sardinia who had been exiled by the rulers of the Arian Vandals. He also ransomed prisoners from upper Italy, and gave them gifts of aid.

Despite Laurentius being classed as an antipope, it is his portrait that continues to hang in the papal gallery in the Church of St. Paul&#x27;s, not that of Symmachus.

==Death==
Symmachus died on 19 July 514, and was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He had ruled for fifteen years, seven months, and twenty-seven days.

<text>Pope Hormisdas (; c. 450 – 6 August 523) was the bishop of Rome from 20 July 514 to his death. His papacy was dominated by the Acacian schism, started in 484 by Acacius of Constantinople&#x27;s efforts to placate the Monophysites. His efforts to resolve this schism were successful, and on 28 March 519, the reunion between Constantinople and Rome was ratified in the cathedral of Constantinople before a large crowd.

== Family and early career==
Hormisdas was born in Frusino in the moribund era of the Western Roman Empire. His Persian name was probably given in honour of an exiled Persian noble, Hormizd, &quot;celebrated in the Roman martyrology (8 August) but not so honoured in the East.&quot; The names of his father and son suggest he had an otherwise &quot;straightforward Italian pedigree.&quot; However, according to &quot;Iranica&quot; he was probably related to Hormizd.

Before becoming a deacon, Hormisdas was married and had a son, Silverius, who later became pope. During the Laurentian schism, Hormisdas was one of the most prominent clerical partisans of Pope Symmachus. He was notary at the synod held at St. Peter&#x27;s in 502. Two letters of Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia, survive addressed to him, written when the latter tried to regain horses and money he had lent the Pope.

==Pontificate==
Unlike that of his predecessor Symmachus, the election of Hormisdas lacked any notable controversies. Upon becoming pope, one of Hormisdas&#x27; first actions was to remove the last vestiges of the schism in Rome, receiving back into the Church those adherents of the Laurentian party who had not already been reconciled. &quot;The schism had lingered on largely out of personal hatred to Symmachus,&quot; writes Jeffrey Richards, &quot;something with which Hormisdas was apparently not tainted.&quot;

The account of his tenure in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, as well as the overwhelming bulk of his surviving correspondence, is dominated by efforts to restore communion between the Sees of Rome and Constantinople caused by the Acacian schism. This schism was the consequence of the &quot;Henoticon&quot; of the Emperor Zeno and supported by his successor Anastasius, who became more and more inclined towards Monophysitism and persecuted those bishops who refused to repudiate the Council of Chalcedon.

The emperor Anastasius took the first steps to resolve this schism pressured by Vitalian, the commander of the imperial cavalry, who, having taken up the cause of orthodoxy, led Thracia, Scythia Minor, and Mysia to revolt, and marched with an army of Huns and Bulgarians to the gates of Constantinople. Richards points out that there would bound to be some tentative efforts from Constantinople, &quot;if only because there was a new man on the throne of St. Peter. Relations between Symmachus and the emperor Anastasius had been virtually non-existent&quot;.

Anastasius wrote to Hormisdas on 28 December 514, inviting him to a synod that would be held 1 July of the following year. A second, less courteous invitation, dated 12 January 515, was also sent by Anastasius to the pope, which reached Rome before the first. On 4 April Hormisdas answered, expressing his delight at the prospect of peace, but at the same time defending the position of his predecessors and welcoming a synod, but believing it unnecessary. The bearers of the emperor&#x27;s first letter at last reached Rome on 14 May. The pope guardedly carried on negotiations, convened a synod at Rome and wrote to the emperor on 8 July to announce the departure of an embassy for Constantinople. Meanwhile, the two hundred bishops who had assembled on 1 July at Heraclea separated without accomplishing anything.

The pope&#x27;s embassy to the imperial court consisted of two bishops, Ennodius of Pavia and Fortunatus of Catina, the priest Venantius, the deacon Vitalis, and the notary Hilarius. According to Rev. J. Barmby, Hormisdas made several demands: (1) The emperor should publicly announce his acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon and the letters of Pope Leo; (2) the Eastern bishops should make a similar public declaration, and in addition anathematize Nestorius, Eutyches, Dioscorus, Aelurus, Peter Mongus, Peter the Fuller, and Acacius, with all their followers; (3) everyone exiled in this dispute should be recalled and their cases reserved for the judgment of the Apostolic See; (4) those exiles who had been in communion with Rome and professed Catholicism should first be recalled; and (5) bishops accused of having persecuted the Orthodox should be sent to Rome to be judged. &quot;Thus the emperor proposed a free discussion in council; the pope required the unqualified acceptance of orthodoxy, and submission to himself as head of Christendom, before he would treat at all.&quot;

An imperial embassy of two high civil officials came to Rome bringing one letter dated 16 July 516 for the pope, and one dated 28 July for the Roman Senate; the aim of the latter was to convince the senators to take a stand against Hormisdas. However both the Senate, as well as King Theodoric, stayed loyal to the pope. Meanwhile, Hormisdas reported to Avitus of Vienne that an additional number of Balkan bishops had entered into relations with Rome, and Bishop John of Nicopolis, who was also the archbishop of Epirus, had broken communion with Constantinople and resumed it with Rome.

A second papal embassy consisting of Ennodius and Bishop Peregrinus of Misenum was as unsuccessful as the first. Anastasius even attempted to bribe the legates, but was unsuccessful. Secure now that Vitalian had been defeated outside Constantinople, forced into hiding, and his supporters executed, Anastasius announced on 11 July 517 that he was breaking off the negotiations. But less than a year later the emperor died; the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; claims he was struck dead by a thunderbolt. His successor, the Catholic Justin I, immediately reversed Anastasius&#x27; policies. All the demands of Pope Hormisdas were granted: the name of the condemned Patriarch Acacius as well as the names of the Emperors Anastasius and Zeno were stricken from the church diptychs, and the Patriarch John II accepted the formula of Hormisdas. Some maintain that he did so with some qualifications. This argument is based on the following quote:&quot;I declare that the see of apostle Peter and the see of this imperial city are one.&quot;

However, the East continued to disregard papal demands by not condemning Acacius. On 28 March 519, in the cathedral of Constantinople in the presence of a great throng of people, the end of the schism was concluded in a solemn ceremony.

Hormisdas died in AD 523 and was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; his tomb was destroyed during the construction of the new basilica.

<doc id="63011" wikidata="Q309179" url="?curid=63011" title="Nocturnality">
<text>Nocturnality is a behavior in some non-human animals characterized by being active during the night and sleeping during the day. The common adjective is &quot;nocturnal&quot;, versus diurnal meaning the opposite.

Nocturnal creatures generally have highly developed senses of hearing, smell, and specially adapted eyesight. Some animals, such as cats and ferrets, have eyes that can adapt to both low-level and bright day levels of illumination (see metaturnal). Others, such as bushbabies and (some) bats, can function only at night. Many nocturnal creatures including tarsiers and some owls have large eyes in comparison with their body size to compensate for the lower light levels at night. More specifically, they have been found to have a larger cornea relative to their eye size than diurnal creatures to increase their : in the low-light conditions. Nocturnality helps wasps, such as &quot;Apoica flavissima&quot;, avoid hunting in intense sunlight.

Diurnal animals, including humans (except for night owls), squirrels and songbirds, are active during the daytime. Crepuscular species, such as rabbits, skunks, tigers and hyenas, are often erroneously referred to as nocturnal. Cathemeral species, such as fossas and lions, are active both in the day and at night.

==Origins==

While it is difficult to say which came first, nocturnality or diurnality, a hypothesis in evolutionary biology, the nocturnal bottleneck theory, postulates that in the Mesozoic, many ancestors of modern-day mammals evolved nocturnal characteristics in order to avoid contact with the numerous diurnal predators. A recent study attempts to answer the question as to why so many modern day mammals retain these nocturnal characteristics even though they are not active at night. The leading answer is that the high visual acuity that comes with diurnal characteristics is not needed anymore due to the evolution of compensatory sensory systems, such as a heightened sense of smell and more astute auditory systems. In a recent study, recently extinct elephant birds and modern day nocturnal kiwi bird skulls were examined to recreate their likely brain and skull formation. They indicated that olfactory bulbs were much larger in comparison to their optic lobes, indicating they both have a common ancestor who evolved to function as a nocturnal species, decreasing their eyesight in favor of a better sense of smell. The anomaly to this theory were anthropoids, who appeared to have the most divergence from nocturnality of all organisms examined. While most mammals did not exhibit the morphological characteristics expected of a nocturnal creature, reptiles and birds fit in perfectly. A larger cornea and pupil correlated well with whether these two classes of organisms were nocturnal or not.

==Advantages==

===Resource competition===

Being active at night is a form of niche differentiation, where a species&#x27; niche is partitioned not by the amount of resources but by the amount of time (i.e. temporal division of the ecological niche). Hawks and owls can hunt the same field or meadow for the same rodents without conflict because hawks are diurnal and owls are nocturnal. This means they are not in competition for each other&#x27;s prey. Another niche that being nocturnal lessens competition within is pollination - nocturnal pollinators such as moths, beetles, thrips, and bats have a lower risk of being seen by predators, and the plants evolved temporal scent production and ambient heat to attract nocturnal pollination. Like with predators hunting the same prey, some plants such as apples can be pollinated both during the day and at night. 
===Predation===

Nocturnality is a form of crypsis, an adaptation to avoid or enhance predation. Although lions are cathemeral, and may be active at any time of day or night, they prefer to hunt at night because many of their prey species (zebra, antelope, impala, wildebeest, etc.) have poor night vision. Many species of small rodents, such as the Large Japanese Field Mouse, are active at night because most of the dozen or so birds of prey that hunt them are diurnal. There are many diurnal species that exhibit some nocturnal behaviors. For example, many seabirds and sea turtles only gather at breeding sites or colonies at night to reduce the risk of predation to themselves and/or their offspring. Nocturnal species take advantage of the night time to prey on species that are used to avoiding diurnal predators. Some nocturnal fish species will use the moonlight to prey on zooplankton species that come to the surface at night. Some species have developed unique adaptations that allow them to hunt in the dark. Bats are famous for using echolocation to hunt down their prey, using sonar sounds to capture them in the dark.

===Water conservation===

Another reason for nocturnality is avoiding the heat of the day. This is especially true in arid biomes like deserts, where nocturnal behavior prevents creatures from losing precious water during the hot, dry daytime. This is an adaptation that enhances osmoregulation. One of the reasons that (cathemeral) lions prefer to hunt at night is to conserve water. Hamiltons Frog, found on Stephens and Maud islands, stays hidden for the majority of the day when temperatures are warmer and are mainly active at night. They will only come out during the day if there are humid and cool conditions. 

Many plant species native to arid biomes have adapted so that their flowers only open at night when the sun&#x27;s intense heat cannot wither and destroy their moist, delicate blossoms. These flowers are pollinated by bats, another creature of the night.

Climate-change and the change in global temperatures has led to an increasing amount of diurnal species to push their activity patterns closer towards crepuscular or fully nocturnal behavior. This adaptive measure allows species to avoid the heat of the day, without having to leave that particular habitat.

== Human disturbances ==
The exponential increase in human expansion and technological advances in the last few centuries has had a major effect on nocturnal animals, as well as diurnal species. The causes of these can be traced to distinct, sometimes overlapping areas: light pollution and spatial disturbance.

=== Light pollution ===

Light pollution is a major issue for nocturnal species, and the impact continues to increase as electricity reaches parts of the world that previously had no access. Species in the tropics are generally more affected by this due to the change in their relatively constant light patterns, but temperate species relying on day-night triggers for behavioral patterns are also affected as well. Many diurnal species see the benefit of a &quot;longer day&quot;, allowing for a longer hunting period which is detrimental to their nocturnal prey trying to avoid them.

==== Orientation ====
Light pollution can disorient species that are used to darkness, as their adaptive eyes are not as used to the artificial lighting. Insects are the most obvious example, who are attracted by the lighting and are usually killed by either the heat or electrical current. Some species of frogs are blinded by the quick changes in light, while nocturnal migratory birds may be disoriented, causing them to lose direction, tire out, or be captured by predators. Sea turtles are particularly affected by this, adding to a number of threats to the different endangered species. Adults are likely to stay away from artificially lit beaches that they might prefer to lay eggs on, as there is less cover against predators. Additionally, baby sea turtles that hatch from eggs on artificially lit beaches often get lost, heading towards the light sources as opposed to the ocean.

==== Rhythmic behaviors ====
Rhythmic behaviors are affected by light pollution both seasonally and daily patterns. Migrating birds or mammals might have issues with the timing of their movement for example. On a day-to-day basis, species can see significant changes in their internal temperatures, their general movement, feeding and body mass. These small scale changes can eventually lead to a population decline, as well as hurting local trophic levels and interconnecting species. Some typically diurnal species have even become crepuscular or nocturnal as a result of light pollution and general human disturbance.

==== Reproduction ====
There have been documented effects of light pollution on reproductive cycles and factors in different species. It can affect mate choice, migration to breeding grounds, and nest site selection. In male green frogs, artificial light causes a decrease in mate calls and continued to move around instead of waiting for a potential mate to arrive. This hurts the overall fitness of the species, which is concerning considering the overall decrease in amphibian populations.

Predation

Some nocturnal predator-prey relationships are interrupted by artificial lighting. Bats that are fast-moving are often at an advantage with insects being drawn to light; they are fast enough to escape any predators also attracted to the light, leaving slow-moving bats at a disadvantage. Another example is harbor seals eating juvenile salmon that moved down a river lit by nearby artificial lighting. Once the lights were turned off, predation levels decreased. Many diurnal prey species forced into being nocturnal are susceptible to nocturnal predators and those species with poor nocturnal eyesight often bear the brunt of the cost.

=== Spatial disturbance ===
The increasing amount of habitat destruction worldwide as a result of human expansion has given both advantages and disadvantages to different nocturnal animals. As a result of peak human activity in the daytime, more species are likely to be active at night in order to avoid the new disturbance in their habitat. Carnivorous predators however are less timid of the disturbance, feeding on human waste and keeping a relatively similar spatial habitat as they did before. In comparison, herbivorous prey tend to stay in areas where human disturbance is low, limiting both resources and their spatial habitat. This leads to an imbalance in favor of predators, who increase in population and come out more often at night.

==In captivity==

===Zoos===
In zoos, nocturnal animals are usually kept in special night-illumination enclosures to invert their normal sleep-wake cycle and to keep them active during the hours when visitors will be there to see them.

===Pets===

Hedgehogs and sugar gliders are just two of the many nocturnal species kept as (exotic) pets. Cats have adapted to domestication so that each individual, whether stray alley cat or pampered housecat, can change their activity level at will, becoming nocturnal or diurnal in response to their environment or the routine of their owners. Cats normally demonstrate crepuscular behavior, bordering nocturnal, being most active in hunting and exploration at dusk and dawn.

<text>Pope John I (; died 18 May 526) was the bishop of Rome from 13 August 523 to his death. He was a native of Siena (or the &quot;Castello di Serena&quot;, near Chiusdino), in Italy. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople by the Ostrogoth King Theoderic to negotiate better treatment for Arians. Although John was relatively successful, upon his return to Ravenna, Theoderic had him imprisoned for allegedly conspiring with Constantinople. The frail pope died of neglect and ill-treatment.

==Early life==
While a deacon in Rome, John is known to have been a partisan of the Antipope Laurentius, for in a &quot;libellus&quot; written to Pope Symmachus in 506, John confessed his error in opposing him, condemned Peter of Altinum and Laurentius, and begged pardon of Symmachus. He would then be the &quot;Deacon John&quot; who signed the &quot;acta&quot; (ecclesiastic publication) of the Roman synod of 499 and 502; the fact the Roman church only had seven deacons at the time makes identifying him with this person very likely. He may also be the &quot;Deacon John&quot; to whom Boethius, the 6th-Century philosopher, dedicated three of his five religious tractates, or treatises, written between 512 and 520.

==Pontificate==
John was very frail when he was elected to the papacy. Despite his protests, Pope John was sent by Theodoric the Great, the Arian king of the Ostrogoths in Italy, to Constantinople to secure the moderation of a decree, issued in 523, of Justin I, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, against the Arians. King Theoderic threatened that if John should fail in his mission, there would be reprisals against the non-Arian Christians in the West. John proceeded to Constantinople with a considerable entourage: including his fellow bishops Ecclesius of Ravenna, Eusebius of Fanum Fortunae, and Sabinus of Campania. His secular companions were the senators Flavius Theodorus, Inportunus, and the Patrician Agapitus.

Emperor Justin is recorded as receiving John honorably and promised to do everything the embassy asked of him, with the exception that those converting from Arianism to Catholicism would not be &quot;restored&quot; (i.e., allowed to retain their place in the Catholic hierarchy as deacons, priests, or bishops). Although John was successful in his mission, when he returned to Ravenna, Theoderic&#x27;s capital in Italy, Theoderic had John arrested on the suspicion of having conspired with Emperor Justin. John was imprisoned at Ravenna, where he died of neglect and ill treatment. His body was transported to Rome and buried in the Basilica of St. Peter.

The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; credits John with making repairs to the cemetery of the martyrs Nereus and Achilleus on the Via Ardeatina, that of Felix and Adauctus, and the cemetery of Priscilla.

==Veneration==

Pope John I is depicted in art as looking through the bars of a prison or imprisoned with a deacon and a subdeacon. He is venerated at Ravenna and in Tuscany. His feast day is 18 May, the anniversary of the day of his death (whereas it had formerly been 27 May).

<text>Pope Felix IV (489/490 – 22 September 530) was the bishop of Rome from 12 July 526 to his death. He was the chosen candidate of Ostrogoth King Theodoric the Great, who had imprisoned Felix&#x27;s predecessor, John I.

==Rise==
Felix came from Samnium, the son of Castorius. He was elected after a gap of nearly two months after the death of John I, who had died in prison in Ravenna, having completed a diplomatic mission to Constantinople on behalf of the Ostrogoth King Theodoric the Great. The papal electors acceded to the king&#x27;s demands and chose Felix as pope. Felix&#x27;s favor in the eyes of the king allowed him to press for greater benefits for the church. However, Theodoric died later that year, allowing Felix to pursue his own policies in peace.

== Pontificate ==

Felix built the Santi Cosma e Damiano in the Imperial forums on land donated by Queen Amalasuntha,
and consecrated no fewer than thirty-nine bishops, during his short tenure of four years. During Felix&#x27;s pontificate, an imperial edict was passed granting that cases against clergy should be dealt with by the pope or a designated ecclesiastical court. Violation of this ruling would result in a fine, the proceeds of which were designated for the poor. Felix also defined church teaching on grace and free will in response to a request of Faustus of Riez, in Gaul, on opposing Semi-Pelagianism. As such, Felix approved the teachings of the Council of Orange in 529, which also explained original sin.

Felix attempted to designate his own successor: Pope Boniface II. The reaction of the Senate was to forbid the discussion of a pope&#x27;s successor during his lifetime or to accept such a nomination. The majority of the clergy reacted to Felix&#x27;s activity by nominating Dioscorus as Pope. Only a minority supported Boniface. His feast day is celebrated on 30 January.

<text>Pope Vigilius (died 7 June 555) was the bishop of Rome from 29 March 537 to his death. He is considered the first pope of the Byzantine papacy. Born into Roman aristocracy, Vigilius served as a deacon and papal &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; in Constantinople. He allied with Empress Theodora, who sought his help to establish Monophysitism, and was made pope after the deposition of Silverius. After he refused to sign Emperor Justinian I&#x27;s edict condemning the Three Chapters, Vigilius was arrested in 545 and taken to Constantinople. He died in Sicily while returning to Rome.

==Early life==
Vigilius belonged to an aristocratic family from Rome; his father, John, is identified as a consul in the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;, having received that title from the emperor in Constantinople. According to Procopius, his brother Reparatus was one of the senators taken hostage by Witigis, but managed to escape before the Ostrogothic king ordered their slaughter in 537.

Vigilius entered the service of the Church and was ordained a deacon in 531. That year, the Roman clergy agreed to a decree empowering the pope to determine the succession to the Holy See, now considered invalid. Vigilius was chosen by Pope Boniface II as his successor and presented to the clergy assembled in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The opposition to such a procedure led Boniface in the following year to withdraw his designation of a successor and to burn the decree respecting it.

The successor of Boniface, Agapetus I (535–536), appointed Vigilius &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; at Constantinople. Empress Theodora sought to win him as a confederate to revenge the deposition of the Monophysite Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople by Agapetus and also to gain aid for her efforts in behalf of the Monophysites. Vigilius is said to have agreed to the plans of the intriguing empress who promised him the Holy See and 700 pounds of gold.

==Rise to papacy==
While Vigilius was in Constantinople, Pope Agapetus died on 22 April 536, and Silverius was made pope through the influence of the king of the Goths. Soon after Silverius was ordained, the Byzantine general Belisarius occupied Rome, which was then besieged by the Goths. Although the Goths were unable to encircle the city completely, both the Byzantine soldiers and the inhabitants feared they would be destroyed. Soon after the siege began, for example, Belisarius ordered the women, children, and unnecessary servants of Rome to leave for Naples, as well as his own army&#x27;s camp followers. Around the same time, Silverius was accused of offering to betray Rome to the Goths. Belisarius had him deposed, put in a monk&#x27;s habit and exiled to Greece. Several other senators were also banished from Rome on the same charges.

What part Vigilius played in the deposition of Silverius is unclear in the primary sources. The authors of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, who are hostile to Vigilius, state he delivered to Belisarius the imperial orders to depose Silverius, yet are circumspect about how Silverius was elected and ordained. Procopius, on the other hand, states that Belisarius appointed Vigilius shortly after Silverius was deposed. Vigilius was consecrated and enthroned as pope on 29 March 537. After the death of Silverius, Vigilius was recognized as pope by all the Roman clergy, even though the manner of his elevation was not regular.

==Pontificate==
Empress Theodora soon learned that she had been deceived. After Vigilius had attained the object of his ambition and been made pope, he maintained the same position as his predecessor against the Monophysites and the deposed Anthimus. A letter purported to be from the pope to the deposed Monophysite patriarchs Anthimus, Severus, and Theodosius seems to indicate that Pope Vigilius accepted the Monophysitism. This letter, however, is not regarded as genuine by most investigators and bears all the marks of forgery. The pope did not restore Anthimus to his office.

In the year 540 Vigilius took a stand in regard to Monophysitism, in two letters sent to Constantinople. One of the letters is addressed to Emperor Justinian I, the other to the Patriarch Menas. In both letters the pope supports positively the Synods of Ephesus and Chalcedon, the decisions of his predecessor Pope Leo I, and the deposition of the Patriarch Anthimus. Several other letters written by the pope in the first years of his pontificate give information respecting his interposition in the ecclesiastical affairs of various countries. On 6 March 538, he wrote to Bishop Caesarius of Arles concerning the penance of the Austrasian King Theudebert I on account of his marriage to his brother&#x27;s widow. On 29 June 538, a decretal was sent to Bishop Profuturus of Braga containing decisions on various questions of church discipline. Bishop Auxanius and his successor, Aurelian of Arles, entered into communication with the pope respecting the granting of the pallium as a mark of the dignity and powers of a papal legate for Gaul; the pope sent suitable letters to the two bishops. In the meantime new dogmatic difficulties had been developing at Constantinople that were to give the pope many hours of bitterness. In 543 Emperor Justinian issued a decree which condemned the various heresies of the Origenists; this decree was sent for signature both to the Eastern patriarchs and to Vigilius.

===Three Chapters controversy===
In order to draw Justinian&#x27;s thoughts from Origenism, Theodore Askidas, bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, called his attention to the fact that the condemnation of various representatives of the Antiochene school, who were said to have inspired Nestorianism, would make union with the Monophysites much easier. The emperor, who laid much stress upon winning over the Monophysites, agreed to this, and in 543 or 544 he issued a new edict condemning the Three Chapters. The &quot;Three Chapters&quot; concerned writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrus, and a letter of Ibas of Edessa. While all three were, indeed, in error, this was due in some part to a misunderstanding of language used by Cyril of Alexandria against the Nestorians. Both Ibas and Theodoret had been deprived of their bishoprics by heretics, and had been restored by the Holy See and the Council of Chalcedon on anathematizing Nestorius. There were no good precedents for thus dealing harshly with the memory of men who had died in the peace of the Church. Such a condemnation at this point was seen by many of the bishops as potentially undermining the Council of Chalcedon itself.

The Eastern patriarchs and bishops signed the condemnation of these Three Chapters, although many signed under duress. In Western Europe, however, the procedure was considered unjustifiable and dangerous, because it was feared that it would detract from the importance of the Council of Chalcedon. Vigilius refused to acknowledge the imperial edict and was called to Constantinople by Justinian, in order to settle the matter there with a synod. According to the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; on 20 November 545, while the pope was celebrating the Feast of St. Cecilia in the Church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere, and before the service was fully ended, he was ordered by the imperial official Anthimus to start at once on the journey to Constantinople. The pope was taken immediately to a ship that waited in the Tiber in order to be carried to the eastern capital while a part of the populace cursed the pope and threw stones at the ship. Rome was now besieged by the Goths under Totila and the inhabitants fell into the greatest misery. Vigilius sent ships with grain to Rome, but these were captured by the enemy. If the story related by the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; is essentially correct, the pope probably left Rome on 22 November 545. He remained for a long time in Sicily and reached Constantinople about the end of 546 or in January 547.

After his transfer to Constantinople, Vigilius wrote to his captors: &quot;Do with me what you wish. This is the just punishment for what I have done.&quot; and &quot;You may keep me in captivity, but the blessed Apostle Peter will never be your captive.&quot;

While in captivity, Vigilius sought to persuade the emperor to send aid to the inhabitants of Rome and Italy who were so hard pressed by the Goths. Justinian&#x27;s chief interest, however, was in the matter of the Three Chapters, and as Vigilius was not ready to make concessions of this point and wavered frequently in his measures, he had much to suffer. The matter was further complicated by the fact that the Latins, Vigilius among them, were for the most part ignorant of Greek and therefore unable to judge the incriminated writings for themselves. The change in his position is to be explained by the fact that the condemnation of the writings mentioned was essentially justifiable, yet appeared inopportune and would lead to disastrous controversies with Western Europe. Finally, Vigilius acknowledged in a letter of 8 December 553 to the Patriarch Eutychius the decisions of the Second Council of Constantinople and declared his judgment in detail in a &quot;Constitution&quot; of 26 February 554. The Pope agreed to condemn the Three Chapters, and thus after a residence of eight years at Constantinople the pope was able, after coming to an understanding with the emperor, to start on his return to Rome in the spring of 555.

==Death==
While on the journey he died at Syracuse. His body was brought to Rome and buried in the San Martino ai Monti over the Catacomb of Priscilla on the Via Salaria.

<doc id="63022" wikidata="Q170303" url="?curid=63022" title="Pope Pelagius I">
<text>Pope Pelagius I (died 3 March 561) was the bishop of Rome from 556 to his death. A former &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; to Constantinople, Pelagius I was elected pope as the candidate of Emperor Justinian I, a designation not well received in the Western Church. Before his papacy, he opposed Justinian&#x27;s efforts to condemn the &quot;Three Chapters&quot; in order to reconcile theological factions within the Church, but later adopted Justinian&#x27;s position.

==Family and early career==
Pelagius was born into a noble family from Rome. His father, John, seems to have been vicar of one of the two civil districts into which Italy was then divided.

Pelagius accompanied Pope Agapetus I to Constantinople and was appointed &quot;apocrisiarius&quot;. As such, Pelagius acquired great influence with Emperor Justinian I. He returned to Rome in 543. In 545, when Pope Vigilius went to Constantinople on Justinian&#x27;s orders, Pelagius stayed in Rome as the pope&#x27;s representative. Totila, king of the Goths, had begun to blockade the city. Pelagius poured out his own fortune for the benefit of the famine-stricken people, and tried to induce the king to grant a truce. Though he failed, he afterwards induced Totila to spare the lives of the people when he captured Rome in December 546. Totila sent Pelagius to Constantinople in order to arrange a peace with Justinian I, but the emperor sent him back to say that his general Belisarius was in command in Italy.

==Papacy==
Vigilius died on 7 June 555, and Pelagius was elected to succeed him as pope. Pelagius was the emperor&#x27;s candidate, a designation not well received by the Western clergy and laity. While before his ordination he opposed Justinian&#x27;s efforts to condemn the &quot;Three Chapters&quot; in order to reconcile theological factions in the Church, afterwards Pelagius adopted Justinian&#x27;s position.

Pelagius I&#x27;s pontificate was undermined by rumors that he might have somehow been complicit in the death of Vigilius, and suspicion that his conceding to Justinian indicating a support for monophysitism. To overcome this he worked to maintain public order in Rome, and correct abuses among the clergy. He also labored on behalf of the poor and the victims of famine and war. In response to a request from the garrison commander at Civitavecchia, Pelagius directed Bishop Lawrence of that town, to provide chaplains for the army. He is credited with the construction of the Santi Apostoli, Rome, built to celebrate the complete victory of Narses over the Ostrogoths.

Pelagius I served five years, and upon his death on 3 March 561 was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<doc id="63023" wikidata="Q3232795" url="?curid=63023" title="Precision Club">
<text>Precision Club is a bidding system in the game of contract bridge. It is a strong club system developed in 1969 for C. C. Wei by Alan Truscott, and used by Taiwan teams in 1969. Their success in placing second at the 1969 Bermuda Bowl (and Wei&#x27;s multimillion-dollar publicity campaign) launched the system&#x27;s popularity.

The central feature of the Precision system is that an opening bid of one club is used for any hand with 16 or more high card points (HCP), regardless of distribution. An opening bid of one of a major suit signifies a five-card suit and 11–15 HCP. A one notrump opening bid signifies a balanced hand (no five-card major suit) and 13–15 HCP.

== Popularity ==
After the success of Taiwan teams in 1969 and 1970 Bermuda Bowls with the system, the entire Italian Blue team switched to Precision Club and won yet another World Team Olympiad in 1972. The modifications to the system were made chiefly by Benito Garozzo and he titled it Super Precision. Today, multiple world champions Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell play their own variant known as RM Precision. In North America, Precision is less commonly played than Standard American or 2/1 game forcing, especially at the club level.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Advocates of Precision say that it is generally more efficient (and precise, as the name would suggest) than systems such as Standard American. Because all opening bids except 1 are limited, the responder almost immediately knows the hand potential and the chances for a part score, game or slam.

Critics of Precision question the wisdom of combining a strong club with 5-card majors. This causes certain hand shapes to bid awkwardly, and a high percentage of hands are opened with one diamond, including in some cases hands with only a doubleton diamond.

The main disadvantage of the strong-club system is its vulnerability to preemptive bids. Knowing that they rarely can make game against a strong-club opening, experienced opponents will compete in the bidding with distributional hands, regardless of strength, and rob bidding space from the opening side.

== Main opening sequences ==
*1: Conventional, 16+
**Responses:
**1: negative, 0–7. If playing the &quot;impossible negative&quot;, any 4–4–4–1; this will be followed by a strong rebid.
**1, 1, 2 2: 8+, 5-card suit
**1NT: 8–10, balanced
**2, 2: 4–7, 6-card suit
**2NT: 11–13 or 16+, balanced
**3, 3, 3, 3: 4–7, 7-card suit
**3NT: 14–15, balanced
*1: 11–15, no 5 card major or 6 card club suit. Originally 4+ suit and unbalanced hand. A notrump range is included in some versions, 2+ suit in this case. In some versions, where classic precision 2 opening is not played diamonds can be even shorter.
*1, 1: 11–15, 5-card suit
*1NT: (12)13–15, balanced
*2: 11–15, 6-card suit or a 5-card suit with a 4-card major (always 6+ suit in some versions of the system)
*2: Conventional, 11–15, 4=3=1=5, 3=4=1=5, 4=4=1=4 or 4=4=0=5 distribution (singleton or void in diamond, no 5-card majors, no 6-card club suit).
*2, 2: Weak two bid, 6–10, good 6-card suit
*2NT: 22–24, balanced
*3, 3, 3, 3: normal preempts
*3NT: Conventional (Gambling), solid 7-card minor suit leading with AKQ, no outside strength

== Precision today ==
Precision has seen several variations since 1969. 3NT is played as &quot;gambling&quot; (where it used to show 24–27 HCP), 1 – 1 is no longer a 4–4–4–1 (&quot;impossible negative&quot;), and the &quot;unusual positive&quot; is used instead.

When 1 – 1 is no longer a 4–4–4–1,
* 1 – 2 = 8+ HCP, 4–4–4–1 singleton ;
* 1 – 2 = 8+ HCP, 4–4–4–1 singleton ;
* 1 – 3 = 8+ HCP, 4–4–4–1 singleton ;
* 1 – 3 = 8+ HCP, 4–4–4–1 singleton 

Also, modern Precision often uses relay bids or transfer responses to 1 to both try to make the strong hand declarer and saving space in the auction. Other popular Precision variations on opening bids are using a strong 1NT (14–16 is most common), using 2 to show only a 6+ club suit and expanding the possible hand patterns for the 2 bid to include the usual 4–4–1–4 and 4–4–0–5 as well as 4–3–1–5 and 3–4–1–5,1 bid promises at least 2 diamonds.

=== RM (Meckwell) Precision ===

RM Precision is a bidding system played by Eric Rodwell and Jeff Meckstroth (which we will call Meckwell) – one of the most successful bridge partnerships of all time. Meckwell bidding is highly sophisticated variation of Precision system. Most of RM Precision was developed subsequently in the early &#x27;80s with adaptations following more slowly thereafter. Meckwell notes are a guarded secret. Though many conventions has been openly described and used: support double, conventional transfers in many situations, the pass-double inversion, Meckwell Defense...
They trade long and verbose Alpha, Beta and Gamma Asking Bids for the shorter and concise descriptive sequences. The convention card is available on the internet.
Eric Kokish nicely outlines the Meckwell system:

==== Meckwell Lite ====
Meckwell Lite is a simplified version of RM Precision popular among students and widely played in many bridge clubs. There are many versions of Meckwell Lite (some are listed in external links). The common goal is to keep the active features of RM Precision and simplify the auction variations.

<text>The Strong Club System is a set of bidding conventions and agreements used in the game of contract bridge and is based upon an opening bid of 1 as being an artificial forcing bid promising a strong hand. The strong 1 opening is assigned a minimum strength promising 16 or more high card points. All other bids would therefore be limited to a maximum of 15 high card points. There are several variants of the strong club system and all are classified as artificial because the bids are highly codified.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems: 
# accuracy in uncontested slam-strength auctions, because the bidding starts at such a low level when opener has a fairly strong hand.
# the fact that all other opening bids have their strength capped by the strong club means more accurate judgment and scope for tactical operation both in constructive and competitive bidding.

The generally acknowledged weakness of such systems is the fact that the opponents can aggressively overcall the 1 bid to deprive the stronger opponents of their bidding room, and that the loss of the 1 opening bid often causes strain on other opening bids, most often 1 and 2.

==Variants==
There are several types of strong club systems
*Precision Club - It uses five-card majors (opening 1 or 1 promises five) which makes them very powerful at the cost of opening 40% of hands with 1.
* Moscito - invented by the Australian expert Paul Marston in the mid-1980s.
* Blue Club - invented by Benito Garozzo.
* Hybrid Club - invented by Ron Vickery and Billy Handy in the early 1980s

==History==
The original strong club system was the Vanderbilt Club, invented in the 1920s by Harold Vanderbilt. For many years, the most popular strong club systems were the Schenken Club in the US and the Neapolitan and Blue Team Club systems in Europe. Both are four-card major systems. The former is patterned closely after the Standard American bidding of the time and the latter is characterized by canapé (bidding the second-longer suit) in many situations.

<doc id="63025" wikidata="Q6243" url="?curid=63025" title="Variable star">
<text>A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth (its apparent magnitude) changes systematically with time. This variation may be caused by a change in emitted light or by something partly blocking the light, so variable stars are classified as either:
* &quot;Intrinsic variables&quot;, whose luminosity actually changes periodically; for example, because the star swells and shrinks.
* &quot;Extrinsic variables&quot;, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it.

Many, possibly most, stars exhibit at least some oscillation in luminosity: the energy output of the Sun, for example, varies by about 0.1% over an 11-year solar cycle.

==Discovery==
An ancient Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some 3,200 years ago may be the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star,
the eclipsing binary Algol. Aboriginal Australians are also known to have observed the variability of Betelgeuse and Antares, incorporating these brightness changes into narratives that are passed down through oral tradition.

Of the modern astronomers, the first variable star was identified in 1638 when Johannes Holwarda noticed that Omicron Ceti (later named Mira) pulsated in a cycle taking 11 months; the star had previously been described as a nova by David Fabricius in 1596. This discovery, combined with supernovae observed in 1572 and 1604, proved that the starry sky was not eternally invariable as Aristotle and other ancient philosophers had taught. In this way, the discovery of variable stars contributed to the astronomical revolution of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

The second variable star to be described was the eclipsing variable Algol, by Geminiano Montanari in 1669; John Goodricke gave the correct explanation of its variability in 1784. Chi Cygni was identified in 1686 by G. Kirch, then R Hydrae in 1704 by G. D. Maraldi. By 1786, ten variable stars were known. John Goodricke himself discovered Delta Cephei and Beta Lyrae. Since 1850, the number of known variable stars has increased rapidly, especially after 1890 when it became possible to identify variable stars by means of photography.

In 1930, astrophysicist Cecilia Payne published the book The Stars of High Luminosity, in which she made numerous observations of variable stars, paying particular attention to Cepheid variables. Her analyses and observations of variable stars, carried out with her husband, Sergei Gaposchkin, laid the basis for all subsequent work on the subject.

The latest edition of the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (2008) lists more than 46,000 variable stars in the Milky Way, as well as 10,000 in other galaxies, and over 10,000 &#x27;suspected&#x27; variables.

==Detecting variability==

The most common kinds of variability involve changes in brightness, but other types of variability also occur, in particular changes in the spectrum. By combining light curve data with observed spectral changes, astronomers are often able to explain why a particular star is variable.

===Variable star observations===

Variable stars are generally analysed using photometry, spectrophotometry and spectroscopy. Measurements of their changes in brightness can be plotted to produce light curves. For regular variables, the period of variation and its amplitude can be very well established; for many variable stars, though, these quantities may vary slowly over time, or even from one period to the next. Peak brightnesses in the light curve are known as maxima, while troughs are known as minima.

Amateur astronomers can do useful scientific study of variable stars by visually comparing the star with other stars within the same telescopic field of view of which the magnitudes are known and constant. By estimating the variable&#x27;s magnitude and noting the time of observation a visual lightcurve can be constructed. The American Association of Variable Star Observers collects such observations from participants around the world and shares the data with the scientific community.

From the light curve the following data are derived:
* are the brightness variations periodical, semiperiodical, irregular, or unique?
* what is the period of the brightness fluctuations?
* what is the shape of the light curve (symmetrical or not, angular or smoothly varying, does each cycle have only one or more than one minima, etcetera)?

From the spectrum the following data are derived:
* what kind of star is it: what is its temperature, its luminosity class (dwarf star, giant star, supergiant, etc.)?
* is it a single star, or a binary? (the combined spectrum of a binary star may show elements from the spectra of each of the member stars)
* does the spectrum change with time? (for example, the star may turn hotter and cooler periodically)
* changes in brightness may depend strongly on the part of the spectrum that is observed (for example, large variations in visible light but hardly any changes in the infrared)
* if the wavelengths of spectral lines are shifted this points to movements (for example, a periodical swelling and shrinking of the star, or its rotation, or an expanding gas shell) (Doppler effect)
* strong magnetic fields on the star betray themselves in the spectrum
* abnormal emission or absorption lines may be indication of a hot stellar atmosphere, or gas clouds surrounding the star.

In very few cases it is possible to make pictures of a stellar disk. These may show darker spots on its surface.

===Interpretation of observations===
Combining light curves with spectral data often gives a clue as to the changes that occur in a variable star. For example, evidence for a pulsating star is found in its shifting spectrum because its surface periodically moves toward and away from us, with the same frequency as its changing brightness.

About two-thirds of all variable stars appear to be pulsating. In the 1930s astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington showed that the mathematical equations that describe the interior of a star may lead to instabilities that cause a star to pulsate. The most common type of instability is related to oscillations in the degree of ionization in outer, convective layers of the star.

When the star is in the swelling phase, its outer layers expand, causing them to cool. Because of the decreasing temperature the degree of ionization also decreases. This makes the gas more transparent, and thus makes it easier for the star to radiate its energy. This in turn makes the star start to contract. As the gas is thereby compressed, it is heated and the degree of ionization again increases. This makes the gas more opaque, and radiation temporarily becomes captured in the gas. This heats the gas further, leading it to expand once again. Thus a cycle of expansion and compression (swelling and shrinking) is maintained.

The pulsation of cepheids is known to be driven by oscillations in the ionization of helium (from He++ to He+ and back to He++).

==Nomenclature==
In a given constellation, the first variable stars discovered were designated with letters R through Z, e.g. R Andromedae. This system of nomenclature was developed by Friedrich W. Argelander, who gave the first previously unnamed variable in a constellation the letter R, the first letter not used by Bayer. Letters RR through RZ, SS through SZ, up to ZZ are used for the next discoveries, e.g. RR Lyrae. Later discoveries used letters AA through AZ, BB through BZ, and up to QQ through QZ (with J omitted). Once those 334 combinations are exhausted, variables are numbered in order of discovery, starting with the prefixed V335 onwards.

==Classification==

Variable stars may be either &quot;intrinsic&quot; or &quot;extrinsic&quot;.
* Intrinsic variable stars: stars where the variability is being caused by changes in the physical properties of the stars themselves. This category can be divided into three subgroups.
** Pulsating variables, stars whose radius alternately expands and contracts as part of their natural evolutionary ageing processes.
** Eruptive variables, stars who experience eruptions on their surfaces like flares or mass ejections.
** Cataclysmic or explosive variables, stars that undergo a cataclysmic change in their properties like novae and supernovae.
* Extrinsic variable stars: stars where the variability is caused by external properties like rotation or eclipses. There are two main subgroups.
** Eclipsing binaries, double stars or planetary systems where, as seen from Earth&#x27;s vantage point the stars occasionally eclipse one another as they orbit, or the planet eclipses its star.
** Rotating variables, stars whose variability is caused by phenomena related to their rotation. Examples are stars with extreme &quot;sunspots&quot; which affect the apparent brightness or stars that have fast rotation speeds causing them to become ellipsoidal in shape.

These subgroups themselves are further divided into specific types of variable stars that are usually named after their prototype. For example, dwarf novae are designated &quot;U Geminorum&quot; stars after the first recognized star in the class, &quot;U Geminorum&quot;.

==Intrinsic variable stars==
Examples of types within these divisions are given below.

===Pulsating variable stars===

Pulsating stars swell and shrink, affecting their brightness and spectrum. Pulsations are generally split into: radial, where the entire star expands and shrinks as a whole; and non-radial, where one part of the star expands while another part shrinks.

Depending on the type of pulsation and its location within the star, there is a natural or fundamental frequency which determines the period of the star. Stars may also pulsate in a harmonic or overtone which is a higher frequency, corresponding to a shorter period. Pulsating variable stars sometimes have a single well-defined period, but often they pulsate simultaneously with multiple frequencies and complex analysis is required to determine the separate interfering periods. In some cases, the pulsations do not have a defined frequency, causing a random variation, referred to as stochastic. The study of stellar interiors using their pulsations is known as asteroseismology.

The expansion phase of a pulsation is caused by the blocking of the internal energy flow by material with a high opacity, but this must occur at a particular depth of the star to create visible pulsations. If the expansion occurs below a convective zone then no variation will be visible at the surface. If the expansion occurs too close to the surface the restoring force will be too weak to create a pulsation. The restoring force to create the contraction phase of a pulsation can be pressure if the pulsation occurs in a non-degenerate layer deep inside a star, and this is called an acoustic or pressure mode of pulsation, abbreviated to p-mode. In other cases, the restoring force is gravity and this is called a g-mode. Pulsating variable stars typically pulsate in only one of these modes.

==== Cepheids and cepheid-like variables ====

This group consists of several kinds of pulsating stars, all found on the instability strip, that swell and shrink very regularly caused by the star&#x27;s own mass resonance, generally by the fundamental frequency. Generally the Eddington valve mechanism for pulsating variables is believed to account for cepheid-like pulsations. Each of the subgroups on the instability strip has a fixed relationship between period and absolute magnitude, as well as a relation between period and mean density of the star. The period-luminosity relationship was first established for Delta Cepheids by Henrietta Leavitt, and makes these high luminosity Cepheids very useful for determining distances to galaxies within the Local Group and beyond. Edwin Hubble used this method to prove that the so-called spiral nebulae are in fact distant galaxies.

The Cepheids are named only for Delta Cephei, while a completely separate class of variables is named after Beta Cephei.

=====Classical Cepheid variables=====
Classical Cepheids (or Delta Cephei variables) are population I (young, massive, and luminous) yellow supergiants which undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months. On September 10, 1784, Edward Pigott detected the variability of Eta Aquilae, the first known representative of the class of Cepheid variables. However, the namesake for classical Cepheids is the star Delta Cephei, discovered to be variable by John Goodricke a few months later.

=====Type II Cepheids=====
Type II Cepheids (historically termed W Virginis stars) have extremely regular light pulsations and a luminosity relation much like the δ Cephei variables, so initially they were confused with the latter category. Type II Cepheids stars belong to older Population II stars, than do the type I Cepheids. The Type II have somewhat lower metallicity, much lower mass, somewhat lower luminosity, and a slightly offset period versus luminosity relationship, so it is always important to know which type of star is being observed.

=====RR Lyrae variables=====
These stars are somewhat similar to Cepheids, but are not as luminous and have shorter periods. They are older than type I Cepheids, belonging to Population II, but of lower mass than type II Cepheids. Due to their common occurrence in globular clusters, they are occasionally referred to as &quot;cluster Cepheids&quot;. They also have a well established period-luminosity relationship, and so are also useful as distance indicators. These A-type stars vary by about 0.2–2 magnitudes (20% to over 500% change in luminosity) over a period of several hours to a day or more.

=====Delta Scuti variables=====
Delta Scuti (δ Sct) variables are similar to Cepheids but much fainter and with much shorter periods. They were once known as &quot;Dwarf Cepheids&quot;. They often show many superimposed periods, which combine to form an extremely complex light curve. The typical δ Scuti star has an amplitude of 0.003–0.9 magnitudes (0.3% to about 130% change in luminosity) and a period of 0.01–0.2 days. Their spectral type is usually between A0 and F5.

=====SX Phoenicis variables=====

These stars of spectral type A2 to F5, similar to δ Scuti variables, are found mainly in globular clusters. They exhibit fluctuations in their brightness in the order of 0.7 magnitude (about 100% change in luminosity) or so every 1 to 2 hours.

=====Rapidly oscillating Ap variables=====

These stars of spectral type A or occasionally F0, a sub-class of δ Scuti variables found on the main sequence. They have extremely rapid variations with periods of a few minutes and amplitudes of a few thousandths of a magnitude.

====Long period variables====
The long period variables are cool evolved stars that pulsate with periods in the range of weeks to several years.

=====Mira variables=====

Mira variables are Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) red giants. Over periods of many months they fade and brighten by between 2.5 and 11 magnitudes, a 6 fold to 30,000 fold change in luminosity. Mira itself, also known as Omicron Ceti (ο Cet), varies in brightness from almost 2nd magnitude to as faint as 10th magnitude with a period of roughly 332 days. The very large visual amplitudes are mainly due to the shifting of energy output between visual and infra-red as the temperature of the star changes. In a few cases, Mira variables show dramatic period changes over a period of decades, thought to be related to the thermal pulsing cycle of the most advanced AGB stars.

=====Semiregular variables=====
These are red giants or supergiants. Semiregular variables may show a definite period on occasion, but more often show less well-defined variations that can sometimes be resolved into multiple periods. A well-known example of a semiregular variable is Betelgeuse, which varies from about magnitudes +0.2 to +1.2 (a factor 2.5 change in luminosity). At least some of the semi-regular variables are very closely related to Mira variables, possibly the only difference being pulsating in a different harmonic.

=====Slow irregular variables=====
These are red giants or supergiants with little or no detectable periodicity. Some are poorly studied semiregular variables, often with multiple periods, but others may simply be chaotic.

=====Long secondary period variables=====

Many variable red giants and supergiants show variations over several hundred to several thousand days. The brightness may change by several magnitudes although it is often much smaller, with the more rapid primary variations are superimposed. The reasons for this type of variation are not clearly understood, being variously ascribed to pulsations, binarity, and stellar rotation.

====Beta Cephei variables====

Beta Cephei (β Cep) variables (sometimes called Beta Canis Majoris variables, especially in Europe) undergo short period pulsations in the order of 0.1–0.6 days with an amplitude of 0.01–0.3 magnitudes (1% to 30% change in luminosity). They are at their brightest during minimum contraction. Many stars of this kind exhibits multiple pulsation periods.

====Slowly pulsating B-type stars====

Slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are hot main-sequence stars slightly less luminous than the Beta Cephei stars, with longer periods and larger amplitudes.

====Very rapidly pulsating hot (subdwarf B) stars====

The prototype of this rare class is V361 Hydrae, a 15th magnitude subdwarf B star. They pulsate with periods of a few minutes and may simultaneous pulsate with multiple periods. They have amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude and are given the GCVS acronym RPHS. They are p-mode pulsators.

====PV Telescopii variables====

Stars in this class are type Bp supergiants with a period of 0.1–1 day and an amplitude of 0.1 magnitude on average. Their spectra are peculiar by having weak hydrogen while on the other hand carbon and helium lines are extra strong, a type of extreme helium star.

====RV Tauri variables====
These are yellow supergiant stars (actually low mass post-AGB stars at the most luminous stage of their lives) which have alternating deep and shallow minima. This double-peaked variation typically has periods of 30–100 days and amplitudes of 3–4 magnitudes. Superimposed on this variation, there may be long-term variations over periods of several years. Their spectra are of type F or G at maximum light and type K or M at minimum brightness. They lie near the instability strip, cooler than type I Cepheids more luminous than type II Cepheids. Their pulsations are caused by the same basic mechanisms related to helium opacity, but they are at a very different stage of their lives.

====Alpha Cygni variables====
Alpha Cygni (α Cyg) variables are nonradially pulsating supergiants of spectral classes Bep to AepIa. Their periods range from several days to several weeks, and their amplitudes of variation are typically of the order of 0.1 magnitudes. The light changes, which often seem irregular, are caused by the superposition of many oscillations with close periods. Deneb, in the constellation of Cygnus is the prototype of this class.

====Gamma Doradus variables====

Gamma Doradus (γ Dor) variables are non-radially pulsating main-sequence stars of spectral classes F to late A. Their periods are around one day and their amplitudes typically of the order of 0.1 magnitudes.

====Pulsating white dwarfs====

These non-radially pulsating stars have short periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds with tiny fluctuations of 0.001 to 0.2 magnitudes. Known types of pulsating white dwarf (or pre-white dwarf) include the &quot;DAV&quot;, or &quot;ZZ Ceti&quot;, stars, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA; &quot;DBV&quot;, or &quot;V777 Her&quot;, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB; and &quot;GW Vir&quot; stars, with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars may be subdivided into &quot;DOV&quot; and &quot;PNNV&quot; stars.

==== Solar-like oscillations ====
The Sun oscillates with very low amplitude in a large number of modes having periods around 5 minutes. The study of these oscillations is known as helioseismology. Oscillations in the Sun are driven stochastically by convection in its outer layers. The term solar-like oscillations is used to describe oscillations in other stars that are excited in the same way and the study of these oscillations is one of the main areas of active research in the field of asteroseismology.

==== BLAP variables ====

A Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator (BLAP) is a pulsating star characterized by changes of 0.2 to 0.4 magnitudes with typical periods of 20 to 40 minutes.

==== Fast yellow pulsating supergiants ====
A fast yellow pulsating supergiant (FYPS) is a luminous yellow supergiant with pulsations shorter than a day. They are thought to have evolved beyond a red supergiant phase, but the mechanism for the pulsations is unknown. The class was named in 2020 through analysis of TESS observations.

===Eruptive variable stars===

Eruptive variable stars show irregular or semi-regular brightness variations caused by material being lost from the star, or in some cases being accreted to it. Despite the name, these are not explosive events.

====Protostars====
Protostars are young objects that have not yet completed the process of contraction from a gas nebula to a veritable star. Most protostars exhibit irregular brightness variations.

=====Herbig Ae/Be stars=====
Variability of more massive (2–8 solar mass) Herbig Ae/Be stars is thought to be due to gas-dust clumps, orbiting in the circumstellar disks.

=====Orion variables=====
Orion variables are young, hot pre–main-sequence stars usually embedded in nebulosity. They have irregular periods with amplitudes of several magnitudes. A well-known subtype of Orion variables are the T Tauri variables. Variability of T Tauri stars is due to spots on the stellar surface and gas-dust clumps, orbiting in the circumstellar disks.

=====FU Orionis variables=====
These stars reside in reflection nebulae and show gradual increases in their luminosity in the order of 6 magnitudes followed by a lengthy phase of constant brightness. They then dim by 2 magnitudes (six times dimmer) or so over a period of many years. &quot;V1057 Cygni&quot; for example dimmed by 2.5 magnitude (ten times dimmer) during an eleven-year period. FU Orionis variables are of spectral type A through G and are possibly an evolutionary phase in the life of &quot;T Tauri&quot; stars.

====Giants and supergiants====

Large stars lose their matter relatively easily. For this reason variability due to eruptions and mass loss is fairly common among giants and supergiants.

=====Luminous blue variables=====
Also known as the S Doradus variables, the most luminous stars known belong to this class. Examples include the hypergiants η Carinae and P Cygni. They have permanent high mass loss, but at intervals of years internal pulsations cause the star to exceed its Eddington limit and the mass loss increases hugely. Visual brightness increases although the overall luminosity is largely unchanged. Giant eruptions observed in a few LBVs do increase the luminosity, so much so that they have been tagged supernova impostors, and may be a different type of event.

=====Yellow hypergiants=====
These massive evolved stars are unstable due to their high luminosity and position above the instability strip, and they exhibit slow but sometimes large photometric and spectroscopic changes due to high mass loss and occasional larger eruptions, combined with secular variation on an observable timescale. The best known example is Rho Cassiopeiae.

=====R Coronae Borealis variables=====
While classed as eruptive variables, these stars do not undergo periodic increases in brightness. Instead they spend most of their time at maximum brightness, but at irregular intervals they suddenly fade by 1–9 magnitudes (2.5 to 4000 times dimmer) before recovering to their initial brightness over months to years. Most are classified as yellow supergiants by luminosity, although they are actually post-AGB stars, but there are both red and blue giant R CrB stars. R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) is the prototype star. DY Persei variables are a subclass of R CrB variables that have a periodic variability in addition to their eruptions.

====Wolf–Rayet variables====
Classic population I Wolf–Rayet stars are massive hot stars that sometimes show variability, probably due to several different causes including binary interactions and rotating gas clumps around the star. They exhibit broad emission line spectra with helium, nitrogen, carbon and oxygen lines. Variations in some stars appear to be stochastic while others show multiple periods.

====Gamma Cassiopeiae variables====
Gamma Cassiopeiae (γ Cas) variables are non-supergiant fast-rotating B class emission line-type stars that fluctuate irregularly by up to 1.5 magnitudes (4 fold change in luminosity) due to the ejection of matter at their equatorial regions caused by the rapid rotational velocity.

====Flare stars====
In main-sequence stars major eruptive variability is exceptional. It is common only among the flare stars, also known as the UV Ceti variables, very faint main-sequence stars which undergo regular flares. They increase in brightness by up to two magnitudes (six times brighter) in just a few seconds, and then fade back to normal brightness in half an hour or less. Several nearby red dwarfs are flare stars, including Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359.

====RS Canum Venaticorum variables====
These are close binary systems with highly active chromospheres, including huge sunspots and flares, believed to be enhanced by the close companion. Variability scales ranges from days, close to the orbital period and sometimes also with eclipses, to years as sunspot activity varies.

===Cataclysmic or explosive variable stars===
====Supernovae====

Supernovae are the most dramatic type of cataclysmic variable, being some of the most energetic events in the universe. A supernova can briefly emit as much energy as an entire galaxy, brightening by more than 20 magnitudes (over one hundred million times brighter). The supernova explosion is caused by a white dwarf or a star core reaching a certain mass/density limit, the Chandrasekhar limit, causing the object to collapse in a fraction of a second. This collapse &quot;bounces&quot; and causes the star to explode and emit this enormous energy quantity. The outer layers of these stars are blown away at speeds of many thousands of kilometers per second. The expelled matter may form nebulae called &quot;supernova remnants&quot;. A well-known example of such a nebula is the Crab Nebula, left over from a supernova that was observed in China and elsewhere in 1054. The progenitor object may either disintegrate completely in the explosion, or, in the case of a massive star, the core can become a neutron star (generally a pulsar) or a black hole.

Supernovae can result from the death of an extremely massive star, many times heavier than the Sun. At the end of the life of this massive star, a non-fusible iron core is formed from fusion ashes. This iron core is pushed towards the Chandrasekhar limit till it surpasses it and therefore collapses. One of the most studied supernovae of this type is SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

A supernova may also result from mass transfer onto a white dwarf from a star companion in a double star system. The Chandrasekhar limit is surpassed from the infalling matter. The absolute luminosity of this latter type is related to properties of its light curve, so that these supernovae can be used to establish the distance to other galaxies.

====Luminous red nova====
Luminous red novae are stellar explosions caused by the merger of two stars. They are not related to classical novae. They have a characteristic red appearance and very slow decline following the initial outburst.

====Novae====

Novae are also the result of dramatic explosions, but unlike supernovae do not result in the destruction of the progenitor star. Also unlike supernovae, novae ignite from the sudden onset of thermonuclear fusion, which under certain high pressure conditions (degenerate matter) accelerates explosively. They form in close binary systems, one component being a white dwarf accreting matter from the other ordinary star component, and may recur over periods of decades to centuries or millennia. Novae are categorised as &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;very slow&quot;, depending on the behaviour of their light curve. Several naked eye novae have been recorded, Nova Cygni 1975 being the brightest in the recent history, reaching 2nd magnitude.

====Dwarf novae====

Dwarf novae are double stars involving a white dwarf in which matter transfer between the component gives rise to regular outbursts. There are three types of dwarf nova:
* U Geminorum stars, which have outbursts lasting roughly 5–20 days followed by quiet periods of typically a few hundred days. During an outburst they brighten typically by 2–6 magnitudes. These stars are also known as SS Cygni variables after the variable in Cygnus which produces among the brightest and most frequent displays of this variable type.
* Z Camelopardalis stars, in which occasional plateaux of brightness called &quot;standstills&quot; are seen, part way between maximum and minimum brightness.
* SU Ursae Majoris stars, which undergo both frequent small outbursts, and rarer but larger &quot;superoutbursts&quot;. These binary systems usually have orbital periods of under 2.5 hours.

====DQ Herculis variables====

DQ Herculis systems are interacting binaries in which a low-mass star transfers mass to a highly magnetic white dwarf. The white dwarf spin period is significantly shorter than the binary orbital period and can sometimes be detected as a photometric periodicity. An accretion disk usually forms around the white dwarf, but its innermost regions are magnetically truncated by the white dwarf. Once captured by the white dwarf&#x27;s magnetic field, the material from the inner disk travels along the magnetic field lines until it accretes. In extreme cases, the white dwarf&#x27;s magnetism prevents the formation of an accretion disk.

====AM Herculis variables====

In these cataclysmic variables, the white dwarf&#x27;s magnetic field is so strong that it synchronizes the white dwarf&#x27;s spin period with the binary orbital period. Instead of forming an accretion disk, the accretion flow is channeled along the white dwarf&#x27;s magnetic field lines until it impacts the white dwarf near a magnetic pole. Cyclotron radiation beamed from the accretion region can cause orbital variations of several magnitudes.

====Z Andromedae variables====

These symbiotic binary systems are composed of a red giant and a hot blue star enveloped in a cloud of gas and dust. They undergo nova-like outbursts with amplitudes of up to 4 magnitudes. The prototype for this class is Z Andromedae.

====AM CVn variables====

AM CVn variables are symbiotic binaries where a white dwarf is accreting helium-rich material from either another white dwarf, a helium star, or an evolved main-sequence star. They undergo complex variations, or at times no variations, with ultrashort periods.

==Extrinsic variable stars==

There are two main groups of extrinsic variables: rotating stars and eclipsing stars.

===Rotating variable stars===

Stars with sizeable sunspots may show significant variations in brightness as they rotate, and brighter areas of the surface are brought into view. Bright spots also occur at the magnetic poles of magnetic stars. Stars with ellipsoidal shapes may also show changes in brightness as they present varying areas of their surfaces to the observer.

==== Non-spherical stars ====

=====Ellipsoidal variables=====

These are very close binaries, the components of which are non-spherical due to their tidal interaction. As the stars rotate the area of their surface presented towards the observer changes and this in turn affects their brightness as seen from Earth.

====Stellar spots====

The surface of the star is not uniformly bright, but has darker and brighter areas (like the sun&#x27;s solar spots). The star&#x27;s chromosphere too may vary in brightness. As the star rotates we observe brightness variations of a few tenths of magnitudes.

=====FK Comae Berenices variables=====

These stars rotate extremely rapidly (~100 km/s at the equator); hence they are ellipsoidal in shape. They are (apparently) single giant stars with spectral types G and K and show strong chromospheric emission lines. Examples are FK Com, V1794 Cygni and UZ Librae. A possible explanation for the rapid rotation of FK Comae stars is that they are the result of the merger of a (contact) binary.

===== BY Draconis variable stars =====

BY Draconis stars are of spectral class K or M and vary by less than 0.5 magnitudes (70% change in luminosity).

====Magnetic fields====

===== Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variables =====
Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (α2 CVn) variables are main-sequence stars of spectral class B8–A7 that show fluctuations of 0.01 to 0.1 magnitudes (1% to 10%) due to changes in their magnetic fields.

=====SX Arietis variables=====

Stars in this class exhibit brightness fluctuations of some 0.1 magnitude caused by changes in their magnetic fields due to high rotation speeds.

=====Optically variable pulsars=====
Few pulsars have been detected in visible light. These neutron stars change in brightness as they rotate. Because of the rapid rotation, brightness variations are extremely fast, from milliseconds to a few seconds. The first and the best known example is the Crab Pulsar.

===Eclipsing binaries===

Extrinsic variables have variations in their brightness, as seen by terrestrial observers, due to some external source. One of the most common reasons for this is the presence of a binary companion star, so that the two together form a binary star. When seen from certain angles, one star may eclipse the other, causing a reduction in brightness. One of the most famous eclipsing binaries is Algol, or Beta Persei (β Per).

====Algol variables====
Algol variables undergo eclipses with one or two minima separated by periods of nearly constant light. The prototype of this class is Algol in the constellation Perseus.

====Double Periodic variables====

Double periodic variables exhibit cyclical mass exchange which causes the orbital period to vary predictably over a very long period. The best known example is V393 Scorpii.

====Beta Lyrae variables====
Beta Lyrae (β Lyr) variables are extremely close binaries, named after the star Sheliak. The light curves of this class of eclipsing variables are constantly changing, making it almost impossible to determine the exact onset and end of each eclipse.

====W Serpentis variables====
W Serpentis is the prototype of a class of semi-detached binaries including a giant or supergiant transferring material to a massive more compact star. They are characterised, and distinguished from the similar β Lyr systems, by strong UV emission from accretions hotspots on a disc of material.

====W Ursae Majoris variables====
The stars in this group show periods of less than a day. The stars are so closely situated to each other that their surfaces are almost in contact with each other.

===Planetary transits===

Stars with planets may also show brightness variations if their planets pass between Earth and the star. These variations are much smaller than those seen with stellar companions and are only detectable with extremely accurate observations. Examples include HD 209458 and GSC 02652-01324, and all of the planets and planet candidates detected by the Kepler Mission.

<text>Pope John III (; died 13 July 574), born Catelinus, was the bishop of Rome from 17 July 561 to his death.

==Family==
Catelinus was born in Rome to a distinguished family. His father, Anastasius, was a &quot;vir illustris&quot;, a high-ranking member of the Roman Senate. He may be identical with the subdeacon John who made a collection of extracts from the Greek Fathers and completed the translation of the &quot;Vitae patrum&quot; into Latin which Pope Pelagius I had begun.

==Papacy==
Catelinus was elected to succeed Pelagius I and was consecrated as pope on 17 July 561. He took the name John on his accession to the papacy.

John&#x27;s pontificate is characterized by two major events over which he had no control. The first was the death of Emperor Justinian I in 565, after which the Eastern Roman Empire turned its attention from Rome and the rest of Italy to pressing problems in the Balkans, from the Avars, Persians and the Arabs. The other major event was the Lombard invasion of Italy, which began in 568. Much of northern Italy was overrun, as well as the central spine of the peninsula, making a shambles of the imperial administration. The Lombards threatened the survival of Rome itself, besieging it repeatedly. Their entrance reintroduced the Arian belief, which threatened the predominance of Trinitarian Christianity.

As the Lombards poured south into Italy, the newly appointed governor Longinus sat powerless in Ravenna, unable to stop them. Pope John took it upon himself to go to Naples, where the former governor Narses was preparing to return to the imperial capital, Constantinople, and beg him to take charge. He had been recalled by the new emperor, Justin II, in response to Italian petitions over his oppressive taxation. Narses agreed to this, and returned to Rome. However, popular hatred of Narses was then extended to John for inviting him back. This unrest reached such a pitch that the pope was forced to retire from Rome and take up residence at the catacombs along the Via Appia two miles outside the city. There he carried out his duties, including the consecration of bishops.

One recorded act of Pope John involved two bishops, Salonius of Embrun and Sagittarius of Gap, who had been condemned in a synod at Lyons (c. 567). This pair succeeded in persuading King Guntram of Burgundy that they had been condemned unjustly, and appealed to the pope. Influenced by Guntram&#x27;s letters, John decided that they should be restored to their sees.

John III died on 13 July 574 and was succeeded by Benedict I.

<text>Mauthausen is a small market town in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. It is located at about 20 kilometres east of the city of Linz. The town lies on the banks of the Danube river, opposite the town of Enns, where the major Danube tributary of Enns joins it. During World War II, the town was the site of the Mauthausen concentration camp.

==History==
The area of Mauthausen has been settled for many millennia, as shown by archaeological discoveries dating back to the Neolithic age. During the time of the Roman Empire, it was at the crossroads of two trade routes.

At the end of the 10th century it became a toll (&quot;Maut&quot; in German) station for ships, and the name &quot;Muthusen&quot; for the settlement is first mentioned in 1007.

A village that had developed by the Third Crusade was ordered burned on 16 May 1189 by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa when it levied a tax on his army as it marched towards Vienna.

During the First World War, a prisoner of war camp existed to the east of Mauthausen. Italian, Serbian and Russian (at times 40,000 men) soldiers were imprisoned there, around 10,000 of whom died in the camp, mostly Serbs and Italians. A war cemetery exists in their memory. The prison had guards especially from Hungary who were known for their barbaric tortures of the soldiers.

During the Second World War, from 1938 to 1945, one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in Nazi Germany was set up to the west of the town. Inmates were subjected to barbaric conditions, the most infamous of which was being forced to carry heavy stone blocks up 186 steps from the camp quarry. The steps became known as the &quot;Stairway to Death&quot;. A new museum was opened at the camp in 2003.

Mauthausen experienced flooding from the River Danube in 1954 and 2002.

==Tourism==
Places of interest in and around Mauthausen include:
* 15th century church
* 16th century Pragstein Schloss (Castle)
* Mauthausen concentration camp (now a museum)

<text>Pope Pelagius II (died 7 February 590) was the bishop of Rome from 26 November 579 to his death.

==Life==
Pelagius was a native of Rome, but probably of Ostrogothic descent, as his father&#x27;s name was Winigild. Pelagius became Pope Benedict I&#x27;s successor on November 26, 579, without imperial confirmation.

Pelagius appealed for help from Emperor Maurice against the Lombards, but to no avail, forcing Pelagius to &quot;buy&quot; a truce and turn to the Franks, who invaded Italy, but left after being bribed by the Lombards.

Pelagius labored to promote clerical celibacy, and he issued stringent regulations on this matter. During his pontificate, the bishop of Milan, who had broken communion with Rome in the Schism of the Three Chapters, returned to full communion around 581, while other bishops in Northern Italy remained in schism.

Pelagius ordered the construction of the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, a church shrine over the place where Saint Lawrence was martyred. During his reign, the Visigoths of Spain converted, but he also faced conflict with the See of Constantinople over the adoption of the title of &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch,&quot; which Pelagius believed to undermine the authority of the papacy.

Pelagius fell victim to the plague that devastated Rome at the end of 590. His successor, Gregory I, thought his regulations of clerical celibacy too strict, and modified them to some extent.

<doc id="63030" wikidata="Q199486" url="?curid=63030" title="Pope Severinus">
<text>Pope Severinus (died 2 August 640) was the bishop of Rome elected in October 638. He was caught up in a power struggle with Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, who pressured him to accept Monothelitism. Severinus refused, which for over eighteen months hindered his efforts to obtain imperial recognition of his election. His pontificate was finally sanctioned on 28 May 640, but he died two months later.

==Early career==
Severinus was a Roman. His father was named Avienus, according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. The name of the father suggests descent from members of the Roman Senate. A previous Avienus was Roman consul in 501. Already an old man, Severinus was elected to succeed Honorius I as pope in mid-October 638.

==Monothelite controversy==
Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople had drawn up the &quot;Ecthesis&quot; in response to the orthodox synodical letter of Patriarch Sophronius of Jerusalem. On learning of the death of Honorius, Sergius convinced Emperor Heraclius to issue this document as an imperial edict in December 638, thus valid across the entire empire. Eustachius, the &quot;magister militum&quot;, carried it to Isaac the Armenian, the exarch of Ravenna, with instructions that he was to ensure the new pope&#x27;s acceptance of the Monothelite teaching. With its declaration of Jesus Christ only possessing one will, Severinus refused to sign it. The exarch therefore refused to confirm the papal election in the emperor&#x27;s name, a situation that endured for over eighteen months.

Isaac was determined to achieve his aim, so he commissioned Maurice, the &quot;chartoularios&quot;, to plunder the Lateran Palace and force Severinus to agree to the &quot;Ecthesis&quot;. Maurice gathered together a party of local discontented nobles and approached the local soldiers, the &quot;exercitus Romanus&quot;, and convinced them that the pope had withheld their pay and was keeping the arrears in the Lateran. A mob soon formed and they rushed en masse to the palace. Severinus managed to keep the hostile forces out of the palace. Maurice tried another tactic and three days later he was admitted into the palace with the city judges whom he won over to his side. They sealed up the treasures, and Maurice sent word to the exarch that he was free to come to the palace and help himself to the accumulated riches. Isaac soon appeared, and after exiling the leading clergy within the Lateran, spent the next eight days looting the palace, prudently sending a share to the emperor at Constantinople to prevent his displeasure.

Meanwhile, at Constantinople, the papal legates had continued to seek the confirmation of Severinus. Emperor Heraclius still refused to grant his confirmation unless Severinus signed the &quot;Ecthesis&quot;. At first they were clearly told that unless they would go back and persuade the pope to accept the &quot;Ecthesis&quot;, they were wasting their time. The legates sought to persuade an unwell and slowly dying Heraclius that they were not there to make professions of faith, but to transact business. The envoys were unwilling to agree to this demand, but they were also unwilling to allow the Roman See to remain vacant indefinitely, so they offered to show Severinus the document and ask him to sign it if he thought it was correct. They made it clear that if the emperor was going to force Severinus to sign it, that all the clergy of the See of Rome would stand together, and such a route would only end in a lengthy and destructive stalemate. This offer was apparently satisfactory, and imperial recognition of the papal election was granted on 28 May 640.

==Death and legacy==
Severinus died on 2 August 640, two months after his pontificate had finally started. In the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Severinus was described as a kind, generous and mild holy man, a benefactor to the clergy, and a friend to the poor.

<text>A hound is a type of hunting dog used by hunters to track or chase prey.

==Description==
Hounds can be contrasted with gun dogs that assist hunters by identifying prey and/or recovering shot quarry. The hound breeds were the first hunting dogs. They have either a powerful sense of smell, great speed, or both. There are three types of hound, with several breeds type:
* Sighthounds (also called &quot;gazehounds&quot;) follow prey predominantly by speed, keeping it in sight. These dogs are fast and assist hunters in catching game: fox, hare, deer, and elk.
* Scenthounds follow prey or others (like missing people) by tracking its scent. These dogs have endurance, but are not fast runners.
* The remaining breeds of hound follow their prey using both sight and scent. They are difficult to classify, as they are neither strictly sighthounds nor strictly scenthounds.

<doc id="63032" wikidata="Q503308" url="?curid=63032" title="Southwest Airlines">
<text>Southwest Airlines Co. is a major airline in the United States that operates on a low-cost carrier model. It is headquartered in Love Field, Dallas neighborhood, in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, and has scheduled service to 121 destinations in the United States and ten other countries. As of 2018, Southwest carried more domestic passengers than any other United States airline. It is currently the fourth largest airline in the world based on passengers flown.

The airline was established on March 9, 1967, by Herb Kelleher and Rollin King as Air Southwest Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. It began regional interstate service in 1979, expanding nationwide in the following decades. Southwest currently serves airports in 42 states and multiple Central American destinations.

Southwest&#x27;s business model is distinct from that of other US airlines. It uses a rolling hub and point-to-point network and allows free checked baggage. Its fleet exclusively consists of Boeing 737 jets.

The airline has nearly 66,100 employees and operates about 4,000 daily departures during peak travel season.

== History ==

Southwest Airlines was founded in 1966 by Herbert Kelleher and Rollin King, and incorporated as Air Southwest Co. in 1967. Three other airlines (Braniff, Trans-Texas Airways, and Continental Airlines) took legal action to try to prevent the company from its planned strategy of undercutting their prices by flying only within Texas and thus being exempt from regulation by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board. The lawsuits were resolved in 1970, and in 1971 the airline changed its name to Southwest Airlines and began operating regularly scheduled flights between the Texas Triangle cities of Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. In 1975, Southwest began flying to other cities in Texas, and in 1979, after passage of the Airline Deregulation Act, it began flying to adjacent states. It started service to the East and the Southeast in the 1990s, and Denver in 2006, which is now its most popular destination. Southwest Airlines was profitable for 47 consecutive fiscal years, from 1973 through 2019.

Southwest experienced a holiday meltdown in 2022 resulting in the cancellation of thousands of flights representing over 70% of its schedule following the late December 2022 North American winter storm. As a result of the crisis, the airline reached a settlement with the United States Department of Transportation including a record-setting $140 million fine , the largest fine ever imposed by the agency by a factor of roughly 30, and reported losses exceeding $1.1 billion stemming from the crisis.

In May 2024, Southwest fares started showing on Google for the first time after long being excluded from the search engine&#x27;s search results.

Southwest lost $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $231M in the first quarter of 2024; that April, it announced it would limit hiring and cease serving four airports. In June 2024, Elliott Investment Management, an activist investment fund, announced that it had bought $1.9 billion in Southwest stock and would seek to oust leadership at the carrier, arguing it had &quot;failed to evolve&quot; citing &quot;leadership’s stubborn unwillingness to evolve the Company’s strategy.&quot; That September, in response to pressure from Elliott, Southwest announced that Gary C. Kelly would retire in 2025 rather than seeking reelection as executive chairman, and that several members of the corporate board would be replaced. Bob Jordan remained as chief executive officer (CEO) despite Elliot&#x27;s efforts to oust him.

In September 2024, Southwest Airlines announced its first airline partnership with Icelandair.

In November 2024, five of Elliot&#x27;s nominees were seated on Southwest’s board—the largest number of board seats ever gained by Elliott in a settlement with a U.S. company—and Kelly retired early. Southwest simultaneously promoted industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal, had been appointed to the board in July 2024, to chair of the board. Gangwal is co-founder of India&#x27;s largest airline IndiGo and a former senior executive at United Airlines and US Airways.

In January 2025, the US government sued Southwest for operating multiple chronically delayed flights and disrupting passengers’ travel.

== Destinations ==

, Southwest Airlines flies to over 100 destinations in 42 states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Southwest uses a point-to-point system combined with a rolling-hub model in its base cities, in contrast to the hub-and-spoke system of other major airlines.

== Fleet ==

==Passenger experience==
Southwest Airlines solely offers economy class seating and does not have business class or first class cabins on its aircraft.

The company permits two free-of-charge checked bags per passenger, and passengers are permitted to change their flight up to 10 minutes prior to their flights without extra charge. In the event of a cancellation, passengers are refunded a travel credit in the amount spent on their ticket, and the credit may be used toward other Southwest Airlines or Southwest Vacations purchase. The credit does not expire.

Southwest offers free inflight non-alcoholic beverages and offers alcoholic beverages for sale for $7-9 per beverage. Free alcoholic drinks are offered to passengers who are at least 21 on some holidays such as Valentine&#x27;s Day and Halloween. Complimentary snacks are also offered on all flights. Southwest has become known for colorful boarding announcements and crews who sometimes burst out in song.
Prior to 2007, Southwest boarded passengers by grouping the passengers into three groups, labeled A, B and C. Passengers would line up at their specified letter and board.

In 2007, Southwest modified its boarding procedure by introducing a number. Each passenger receives a letter (A, B, or C) and a number 1 through 60. Passengers lineup in numerical order within each letter group and choose any open seat on the aircraft. A 2012 study on the television series &quot;MythBusters&quot;, found this to be the fastest method currently in use for passengers to board a plane; on average, it is 10 minutes faster than the standard method. The airline was also number-one on the 2020 Airline Quality Rating list.

Southwest has a &quot;customer of size&quot; policy in which the cost of a second seat is refunded for any plus-sized travelers who take up more room than one seat.

On July 25, 2024, Southwest announced that it would soon be ending its long-standing open seating policy. The airline will start assigning seats, introduce premium seating options with more legroom, and launch overnight flights beginning in 2026.

===In-flight entertainment===
As of December 2024, Wi-Fi includes free streaming of live television, movies, music, in-app messaging (iMessage and WhatsApp), and real-time flight tracking. Full Internet access is available for an $8 fee for most passengers but is free for Business Select and A-List Preferred passengers. As of March 9, 2023, Southwest began upgrading Wi-Fi hardware on its existing aircraft equipped with Anuvu Wi-Fi and began rolling out Viasat Wi-Fi on all new deliveries.

===Rapid Rewards===
Southwest first began to offer a frequent-flyer program on June 18, 1987, calling it The Company Club. The program credited for trips flown regardless of distance. Southwest Airlines renamed its frequent-flyer program Rapid Rewards on April 25, 1996.

The original Rapid Rewards program offered one credit per one-way flight from an origin to a destination, including any stops or connections on Southwest Airlines. When 16 credits were accumulated in a 24-month period, Southwest awarded one free round-trip ticket that was valid for 12 months.

On March 1, 2011, Rapid Rewards changed to a points system based on ticket cost. Members earn and redeem points based on a four-tier fare scale multiplier and the cost of the ticket. Changes also included no blackout dates, seat restrictions, or expiring credits. Since October 18, 2019, Rapid Rewards points do not expire as long as the member is alive. It also adds more options to use points.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Southwest Airlines are (as of the financial year ending December 31):
=== Headquarters ===

The Southwest Airlines headquarters are located on the grounds of Dallas Love Field in Dallas. Chris Sloan of &quot;Airways&quot; magazine stated they are &quot;as much a living, breathing museum and showcase for the &#x27;culture that LUV built&#x27; as they are corporate offices.&quot;

On September 17, 2012, Southwest broke ground on a new Training and Operational Support building, across the street from its current headquarters building. The property includes a two-story, 100,000-square-foot Network Operations Control building that can withstand an EF3 tornado. It also includes a four-story, 392,000-square-foot office, and training facility with two levels devoted to each function. The new facilities house 24-hour coordination and maintenance operations, customer support and services, and training. The project was completed in late 2013, with occupancy beginning in 2014.

On June 2, 2016, Southwest broke ground on its new office and training facility known as Wings. The newest addition to the corporate campus is composed of a 420,000-square-foot, six-story office building, and a 380,000-square-foot adjoining structure called the Leadership Education and Aircrew Development (LEAD) Center that serves as the new pilot training facility. The LEAD Center has the capacity to house and support 18 flight simulators. It is designed to be expanded to accommodate up to 26 simulator bays. The building opened on April 3, 2018.

On August 16, 2019, Southwest announced an expansion of the LEAD Center to accommodate eight additional simulators for future operational and training demands. On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Southwest would be purchasing an additional of land adjacent to its Wings and LEAD facilities. No additional details were disclosed.

=== Employment ===
, Southwest Airlines had 62,333 active full-time equivalent employees. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, it uses the hiring motto of seeking people that have a &quot;Servant&#x27;s Heart, Warrior Spirit, Fun-LUVing Attitude&quot;. It also uses the internal practice of ranking &quot;employees first, customers second&quot;. Collective bargaining Southwest Airlines employees is represented by the Southwest Airlines Pilot Association union.

Bob Jordan, formerly executive vice president of corporate services, became Southwest&#x27;s sixth CEO on February 1, 2022, replacing Gary C. Kelly. Kelly continues as chairman of Southwest Airlines. Kelly replaced former CEO Jim Parker on July 15, 2004, and assumed the title of president on July 15, 2008, replacing former president Colleen Barrett. In July 2008, Herb Kelleher resigned from his position as chairman. Barrett left her post on the board of directors and as a corporate secretary in May 2008 and as president in July 2008. Kelleher was president and CEO of Southwest from September 1981 to June 2001. On June 23, 2021, Southwest announced that chairman and CEO Gary Kelly would transition roles in early 2022, becoming the carrier&#x27;s executive chairman with the desire to serve in that role through at least 2026 at the discretion of the board of directors. Jordan also joined the board then.

On January 10, 2017, Southwest announced changes to the company&#x27;s executive leadership ranks, with Thomas M. Nealon named as president and Michael G. Van de Ven as the airline&#x27;s chief operating officer. On September 14, 2021, Southwest announced Nealon had decided to retire from his duties as president effective immediately, but would continue to serve the company as a strategic advisor. Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven was named as the company&#x27;s president the same day, and remains COO.

In September 2024, in response to pressure from Elliott Investment Management, Kelly announced that he would not seek reelection as executive chairman in 2025. Jordan is expected to remain as CEO.

About 83% of Southwest employees are members of a union. The Southwest Airline Pilots&#x27; Association, a union not affiliated with the Air Line Pilots Association, represents the airline&#x27;s pilots. The aircraft maintenance technicians are represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Customer service agents and reservation agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union. Flight dispatchers, flight attendants, ramp agents, and operations agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union.

The company has appeared on various &quot;best places to work&quot; list, with its employee culture mentioned by &quot;Travel and Leisure&quot;, CNBC, and &quot;Forbes&quot;. The company has also been named to &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most Admired Companies&quot; list, reaching number 14 in 2021.

Southwest has never furloughed an employee. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company launched voluntary separation and extended time-off programs in 2020, and around 16,900 employees volunteered to take an early retirement or long-term leave. Roughly 24% were pilots and 33% were flight attendants. In late 2020, the airline issued some WARN Act notices and announced incipient pay cuts for many employees in response to pandemic impacts, but these measures were rescinded after the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was enacted on December 27, 2020, providing additional financial aid to US airlines.

The latest five year labor contract for Southwest Airlines pilots was approved in January 2024.

Following a board takeover in February 2025 Southwest laid off 1750 of its non-contract staff, approximately 15% of its corporate workforce.

=== Impact on carriers ===
Southwest and its business model have had an influence on other low-cost carriers (LCC&#x27;s). The competitive strategy combines a high level of employee and aircraft productivity with low unit costs by reducing aircraft turnaround time, particularly at the gate. Europe&#x27;s EasyJet and Ryanair are two of the best-known airlines to follow Southwest&#x27;s business strategy in that continent. Other airlines with a business model based on Southwest&#x27;s system include Canada&#x27;s WestJet, Malaysia&#x27;s AirAsia (the first and biggest LCC in Asia), India&#x27;s IndiGo, Australia&#x27;s Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas (although Jetstar now operates three aircraft types), Philippines&#x27; Cebu Pacific, Thailand&#x27;s Nok Air, Mexico&#x27;s Volaris, Indonesia&#x27;s Lion Air and Turkey&#x27;s Pegasus Airlines.

=== Lobbying against high-speed rail ===
Southwest Airlines has a history of lobbying against high-speed rail in the United States, which it sees as a competitor for short-distance commuter flights. In the early 1990s, Southwest lobbied US Congress and the Texas Legislature to oppose a high-speed rail system between Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston, and filed three lawsuits against the initiative. In 1991, Southwest told Texas authorities, &quot;Rail has a romantic appeal, but this case cannot be decided on the basis of nostalgia or even a desire to emulate the rail service of France and Germany. The American reality is that high-speed rail will be viable in Texas only by destroying the convenient and inexpensive transportation service the airlines now provide, and only by absorbing huge public subsidies.&quot; In 1994, the high-speed rail initiative was cancelled. While several reasons led to the initiative&#x27;s demise, most commentators attribute a key role to Southwest Airlines&#x27; aggressive campaign against it.

=== Advertising ===
The company has always employed humor in its advertising. Former slogans include &quot;Love Is Still Our Field&quot;, &quot;Just Plane Smart&quot;, &quot;The Somebody Else Up There Who Loves You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Now Free to Move About the Country&quot;, &quot;THE Low Fare Airline&quot;, &quot;Grab your bag, It&#x27;s On!&quot;, and &quot;Welcome Aboard&quot;. The airline&#x27;s slogan (as of 2022) is &quot;Low fares. Nothing to hide. That&#x27;s TransFarency!&quot;

In March 1992, shortly after Southwest started using the &quot;Just Plane Smart&quot; motto, &quot;Stevens Aviation&quot;, which had been using &quot;Plane Smart&quot; for its motto, advised Southwest that it was infringing on its trademark. Instead of a lawsuit, the CEOs for both companies staged an arm-wrestling match. Held at the now-demolished Dallas Sportatorium and set for two out of three rounds, the loser of each round was to pay $5,000 to the charity of his choice, with the winner gaining the use of the trademarked phrase. A promotional video was created showing the CEOs &quot;training&quot; for the bout (with CEO Herb Kelleher being helped up during a sit-up where a cigarette and glass of Wild Turkey 101 whiskey was waiting) and distributed among the employees and also as a video press release along with the video of the match itself. Herb Kelleher lost the match for Southwest, with Stevens Aviation winning the rights to the phrase. Kurt Herwald, CEO of Stevens Aviation, immediately granted the use of &quot;Just Plane Smart&quot; to Southwest Airlines. The net result was both companies having use of the trademark.

==Accidents and incidents==

Southwest has had 11 accidents, including three aircraft hull losses and four deaths: one accidental passenger death in flight, two non-passenger deaths on the ground, and one passenger death from injuries he sustained when subdued by other passengers while attempting to break into the cockpit of an aircraft. The airline is considered among the safest in the world. No passenger has died as a result of a crash.

==Controversies and passenger incidents==
On June 22, 2011, a March 25 recording was released to the press of an apparently inadvertent in-flight radio transmission of Southwest captain James Taylor conversing with his first officer. The conversation was peppered with obscenities directed at gay, overweight, and older flight attendants. According to Southwest, the pilot was reprimanded and temporarily suspended without pay and received diversity education before being reinstated.

On September 26, 2017, a woman was removed from a Southwest flight after claiming to have a life-threatening allergy to dogs, two of which were present on the aircraft, including a service animal. Southwest employees requested that she provide documentation of her condition and staff asked her to exit the aircraft multiple times. Police ultimately had to escort her away.

On December 29, 2017, a family was removed from a flight from Chicago Midway Airport because of an unconfirmed head lice accusation. The family did not have lice and was re-accommodated on a flight two days later.

In October 2019, a Southwest flight attendant filed a lawsuit against the airline, claiming that two pilots had livestreamed footage from a camera hidden in the plane&#x27;s toilet to an iPad, and that one of the pilots said that such cameras were a &quot;top-secret security measure&quot; installed in all of the airline&#x27;s 737-800 aircraft. Southwest and the pilot union stated that the film was a hoax and a &quot;poor attempt at humor&quot; by one of the pilots, who had previously recorded himself on a different aircraft, fully clothed.

In February 2020, a report conducted by the DOT inspector general found that Southwest was flying airplanes with safety concerns and that the Federal Aviation Administration was failing to properly oversee the airline.

In 2020, a captain of a Southwest flight watched pornography on a laptop computer with his clothes removed while his female first officer continued her duties. The captain retired before the incident was reported, but he was subsequently prosecuted for intentionally committing a lewd, indecent or obscene act in a public place, and the airline terminated his retirement benefits.

On May 23, 2021, a female passenger aboard a Southwest flight repeatedly punched a female flight attendant in the face after landing at San Diego International Airport, causing the attendant to lose two teeth. The passenger was subsequently charged with causing serious bodily injury.

Citing four whistleblowers, federal investigators with the US Office of Special Counsel released a report on July 27, 2022, that follows up on the 2020 DOT inspector general&#x27;s report. The 2022 report claims that Southwest stonewalled Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigations into maintenance and piloting safety lapses, and criticized the FAA for failing to adequately oversee the airline, stating that senior FAA staff &quot;mismanaged and interfered&quot; with investigations &quot;in the face of SWA&#x27;s intimidation tactics&quot;. The report accuses Southwest of misusing the FAA&#x27;s Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) to hide pilot errors, while accusing the FAA of failing to adequately oversee Southwest&#x27;s mechanics, and of failing to adequately vet maintenance records provided by the airline for forty-nine 737 aircraft purchased from foreign carriers whose documentation practices did not meet FAA standards.

===December 2022 holiday meltdown===
The airline experienced severe delays and thousands of flight cancellations starting on December 21, 2022, and continuing through the Christmas holiday. While many cancellations were due to bad weather from the severe late December winter storm across much of the United States, industry experts and SWAPA also blamed inadequate staffing and the airline&#x27;s &quot;outdated&quot; employee scheduling system, citing reports of pilots waiting on hold on the telephone for up to eight hours awaiting work assignments. On December 26, the airline initiated a massive system &quot;reset&quot;, preemptively canceling thousands of flights and halting ticket sales over concerns that travelers might buy tickets for flights that were subsequently canceled. Federal officials criticized the airline and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced a formal investigation. Some experts attributed the crisis to the lack of scheduling flexibility inherent in the airline&#x27;s point-to-point operations model. Paul Krugman in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested the turmoil was not as much about corporate greed as some might expect and noted that despite an increasingly digitalized world, &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of physical action, and real-world labor, going on behind the scenes.&quot; Another writer on the paper&#x27;s opinion pages, Elizabeth Spiers, said this was an example of the airlines knowing they are offering passengers a poor deal but that many people have little choice given the alternatives. In December 2023, the airline reached a settlement and received a record-setting $140 million fine from the USDOT, the largest fine ever imposed by the agency by a factor of roughly 30, and has reported losses exceeding $1.1 billion stemming from the crisis.

<text>The true owls or typical owls (family Strigidae) are one of the two generally accepted families of owls, the other being the barn owls and bay owls (Tytonidae). This large family comprises 230 living or recently extinct species in 24 genera. The Strigidae owls have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found on every continent except Antarctica.

==Morphology==
While typical owls (hereafter referred to simply as owls) vary greatly in size, with the smallest species, the elf owl, being a hundredth the size of the largest, the Eurasian eagle-owl and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl, owls generally share an extremely similar body plan. They tend to have large heads, short tails, cryptic plumage, and round facial discs around the eyes. The family is generally arboreal (with a few exceptions like the burrowing owl) and obtain their food on the wing. The wings are large, broad, rounded, and long. As is the case with most birds of prey, in many owl species females are larger than males.

Because of their nocturnal habits, they tend not to exhibit sexual dimorphism in their plumage. Specialized feathers and wing shape suppress the noise produced by flying, both taking off, flapping and gliding. This silent flight allows owls to hunt without being heard by their prey. Owls possess three physical attributes that are thought to contribute to their silent flight capability. First, on the leading edge of the wing, there is a comb of stiff feathers. Second, the trailing edge of the wing contains a flexible fringe. Finally, owls have downy material distributed on the tops of their wings that creates a compliant but rough surface (similar to that of a soft carpet). All these factors result in significant aerodynamic noise reductions. The toes and tarsi are feathered in some species, and more so in species at higher latitudes. Numerous species of owls in the genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot; and the northern hawk-owl have eye patches on the backs of their heads, apparently to convince other birds they are being watched at all times. Numerous nocturnal species have ear-tufts, feathers on the sides of the head that are thought to have a camouflage function, breaking up the outline of a roosting bird. The feathers of the facial disc are arranged in order to increase sound delivered to the ears. Hearing in owls is highly sensitive and the ears are asymmetrical allowing the owl to localise a sound in multiple directions. Owls can pinpoint the position of prey, such as a squeaking mouse, by computing when the sound from the object reaches the owl&#x27;s ears. If the sound reaches the left ear first, the mouse must be to the left of the owl. The owl&#x27;s brain will then direct the head to directly face the mouse. In addition to hearing, owls have massive eyes relative to their body size. Contrary to popular belief, however, owls cannot see well in extreme dark and are able to see well in the day.

Owls are also able to rotate their heads by as much as 270 degrees in either direction without damaging the blood vessels in their necks and heads, and without disrupting blood flow to their brains. Researchers have found four major biological adaptations that allow for this unique capability. First, in the neck there is a major artery, called the vertebral artery, that feeds the brain. This artery passes through bony holes in the vertebra. These bony holes are ten times larger in diameter than the artery that passes through them (extra space in the transverse foramina) which creates air pockets that allow for more movement of the artery when twisted. 12 of the 14 cervical vertebrae in the owl&#x27;s neck have this adaptation. This vertebral artery also enters the neck higher up than it does in other birds. Instead of going in at the 14th cervical vertebrae, it enters in at the 12th cervical vertebrae. Finally, the small vessel connection between the carotid and the vertebral arteries allow the exchanging of blood between two blood vessels. These cross connections allow for uninterrupted blood flow to the brain. This means that even if one route is blocked during extreme head rotations, another route can continue blood circulation to the brain.

Several owl species also have fluorescent pigments called porphyrins under their wings. A large group of pigments defined by nitrogen-containing pyrole rings, including chlorophyll and heme (in animal blood), make up the porphyrins. Other bird species will use porphyrins to pigment eggshells in the oviduct. Owl species, however, use porphyrins as a pigment in their plumage. Porphyrins are most prevalent in new feathers and are easily destroyed by sunlight. Porphyrin pigments in feathers fluoresce under UV light, allowing biologists to more accurately classify the age of owls. The relative ages of the feathers are differentiated by the intensity of fluorescence that they emit when the primaries and secondaries are exposed to black light. This method helps to detect the subtle differences between third and fourth generation feathers, whereas looking at wear and color makes age determination difficult.

==Niche competition==

It has been noted that there is some competition for niche space between the spotted owl and the barred owl (both of which are true owls) . This competition is related to deforestation, and therefore a reduction in niche quantity and quality. This deforestation is more specifically the result of overlogging and forest fires. These two species of owl are known to traditionally live in mature forests of old and tall trees, which at this point in time are mostly limited to public lands. As niche overlap is occurring in these two families, there is a concern with the barred owls encroaching on the spotted owl&#x27;s North American habitats, causing a decline of the spotted owl. As noted above, these species prefer mature forests which, due to deforestation, are at limited supply and take a long time to reestablish after deforestation has occurred. Because the northern spotted owl shares its territories and competes with other species, it is declining at a more rapid pace. This invasion by barred owls occurred about 50 years ago in the Pacific Northwest, and despite their low numbers, they are considered an invasive species because of the harm done to native spotted owls. In this competition for resources, hunting locations and general niches, the barred owl is pushing the spotted owl to local extinction. It is thought that the rapid decrease in population size of spotted owls will cause a trophic cascade, since the spotted owls help provide a healthy ecosystem.

==Behaviour==
Owls are generally nocturnal and/or crepuscular and spend much of the day roosting. They are often misperceived as ‘tame’ since they allow humans to approach quite closely before taking flight, but in reality they are attempting to avoid detection through stillness. Their cryptic plumage and the inconspicuous locations they adopt are an effort to avoid predators and mobbing by small birds.

==Communication==
Owls, such as the eagle-owl, will use visual signaling in intraspecific communication (communication within the species), both in territorial habits and parent-offspring interactions. Some researchers believe owls can employ various visual signals in other situations involving intraspecific interaction. Experimental evidence suggests that owl feces and the remains of prey can act as visual signals. This new type of signaling behavior could potentially indicate the owls&#x27; current reproductive state to intruders, including other territorial owls or non-breeding floaters. Feces are an ideal material for marking due to its minimal energetic costs, and can also continue to indicate territorial boundaries even when occupied in activities other than territorial defense. Preliminary evidence also suggests that owls will use feces and the feathers of their prey to signal their breeding status to members within the same species.

==Migration==

Some species of owl are migratory. One such species, the northern saw-whet owl, migrates south even when food and resources are ample in the north.

==Habitat, climate and seasonal changes==

Some owls have a higher survival rate and are more likely to reproduce in a habitat that contains a mixture of old growth forests and other vegetation types. Old growth forests provide ample dark areas for owls to hide from predators Like many organisms, spotted owls rely on forest fires to create their habitat and provide areas for foraging. Unfortunately, climate change and intentional fire suppression have altered natural fire habits. Owls avoid badly burned areas but they benefit from the mosaics of heterogeneous habitats created by fires. This is not to say that all fires are good for owls. Owls only thrive when fires are not of high severity and not large stand-replacing (high-severity fires that burn most of the vegetation) which create large canopy gaps that are not adequate for owls.

==Parasites==

Avian malaria or &quot;Plasmodium relictum&quot; affects owls and specifically, 44% of northern and Californian spotted owls harbor 17 strains of the parasite. As mentioned in the niche competition section above, spotted owls and barred owls are in competition so their niche overlap may be resulting in the plasmodium parasite having more hosts in a concentrated area but this is not certain.

==Predators==
The main predators of owls are other species of owls. An example of this occurs with the northern saw-whet owl that lives in the northern U.S. and lives low to the ground in brushy areas typically of cedar forests. These owls eat mice, and perch in trees at eye level. Their main predators are barred owls and great horned owls.

==Systematics==

The family Strigidae was introduced by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the owls by Jessie Salter and collaborators published in 2020 found that the family Strigidae was divided into two sister clades and some of the traditional genera were paraphyletic. The placement of three monotypic genera remained uncertain due to the degraded nature of the available DNA. Based on these results Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker updated the online list of world birds that they maintain on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

The cladogram below is based on the results of the study by Salter and collaborators published in 2020. The subfamilies are those defined by Edward Dickinson and James Van Remsen Jr. in 2013. A genetic study published in 2021 suggested that the genus &quot;Scotopelia&quot; may be embedded within &quot;Ketupa&quot;.

The 235 extant or recently extinct species are assigned to 23 genera:
* Genus &quot;Uroglaux&quot; – Papuan hawk-owl
* Genus &quot;Ninox&quot; – Australasian hawk-owls, 37 species of which one is recently extinct
* Genus &quot;Margarobyas&quot; – bare-legged owl or Cuban screech-owl
* Genus &quot;Taenioptynx&quot; – two species previous placed in &quot;Glaucidium&quot;
* Genus &quot;Micrathene&quot; – elf owl
* Genus &quot;Xenoglaux&quot; – long-whiskered owlet
* Genus &quot;Aegolius&quot; – saw-whet owls, five species of which one is recently extinct
* Genus &quot;Athene&quot; – nine species
* Genus &quot;Surnia&quot; – northern hawk-owl
* Genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot; – pygmy owls, 29 species
* Genus &quot;Otus&quot; – scops owls, 58 species including three extinct species formerly placed in &quot;Mascarenotus&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Ptilopsis&quot; – white-faced owls, two species
* Genus &quot;Asio&quot; – eared owls, nine species
* Genus &quot;Jubula&quot; – maned owl
* Genus &quot;Bubo&quot; – eagle-owls, horned-owls and snowy owl, 10 species
* Genus &quot;Scotopelia&quot; – fishing owls, three species
* Genus &quot;Ketupa&quot; – fish owls and eagle-owls, 12 species (including 9 species previously placed in &quot;Bubo&quot;)
* Genus &quot;Psiloscops&quot; – flammulated owl

**Kaua‘i stilt-owl, &quot;Grallistrix auceps&quot;
**Maui stilt-owl, &quot;Grallistrix erdmani&quot;
**Moloka‘i stilt-owl, &quot;Grallistrix geleches&quot;
**O‘ahu stilt-owl, &quot;Grallistrix orion&quot;
* Genus &quot;Ornimegalonyx&quot; – Caribbean giant owls, one or two species
**Cuban giant owl, &quot;Ornimegalonyx oteroi&quot;
**&quot;Ornimegalonyx&quot; sp. – probably subspecies of &quot;O. oteroi&quot;
* Genus &quot;Asphaltoglaux&quot;
** Asphalt miniature owl, &quot;Asphaltoglaux cecileae&quot;
*Genus &quot;Oraristrix&quot;
**La Brea owl, &quot;Oraristrix brea&quot;
===Fossil record===
* &quot;Mioglaux&quot; (Late Oligocene? – Early Miocene of WC Europe) – includes &quot;&quot;Bubo&quot; poirreiri&quot;
* &quot;Intulula&quot; (Early/Middle Miocene of WC Europe) – includes &quot;&quot;Strix/Ninox&quot; brevis&quot;
* &quot;Yarquen&quot; (Middle Miocene of Argentina)
* &quot;Alasio&quot; (Middle Miocene of Vieux-Collonges, France) – includes &quot;&quot;Strix&quot; collongensis&quot;

The fossil database for Strigiformes is highly diverse and shows an origin from ~60MYA into the Pleistocene. The maximum age range for the Strigiformes clade extends to 68.6MYA.

Placement unresolved:
*&quot;&quot;Otus/Strix&quot; wintershofensis&quot; – fossil (Early/Middle Miocene of Wintershof West, Germany) – may be close to extant genus &quot;Ninox&quot;
* &quot;&quot;Strix&quot; edwardsi&quot; – fossil (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France)
* &quot;&quot;Asio&quot; pygmaeus&quot; – fossil (Early Pliocene of Odesa, Ukraine)
* Strigidae gen. et sp. indet. UMMP V31030 (Rexroad Late Pliocene of Kansas, USA) – &quot;Strix&quot;/&quot;Bubo&quot;?
*Ibiza owl, Strigidae gen. et sp. indet. – prehistoric (Late Pleistocene/Holocene of Es Pouàs, Ibiza)

The supposed fossil heron &quot;&quot;Ardea&quot; lignitum&quot; (Late Pliocene of Germany) was apparently a strigid owl, possibly close to &quot;Bubo&quot;. The Early–Middle Eocene genus &quot;Palaeoglaux&quot; from west-central Europe is sometimes placed here, but given its age, it is probably better considered its own family for the time being.

<text>A gas van or gas wagon (, &quot;dushegubka&quot;, literally &quot;soul killer&quot;; ) was a truck re-equipped as a mobile gas chamber. During World War II and the Holocaust, Nazi Germany developed and used gas vans on a large scale to kill inmates of asylums, Poles, Romani people, Jews, and prisoners in occupied Poland, Belarus, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other regions of German-occupied Europe. There are several documented cases of gas vans used by Soviet NKVD during the Great Purge.

==Nazi Germany==
Historians of the Holocaust like Henry Friedlander argue that the mobile gas chambers were invented in Germany in 1940, and they were first used to murder patients of Wartheland hospitals. Katrin Reichelt names Albert Widmann and Arthur Nebe as having developed the method. The vans themselves were modified by Walter Rauff, and Harry Wentritt. Matthias Beer calls gas vans &quot;a special product of the Third Reich&quot;. 

The use of gas vans by Germans to kill Jews, Poles, Romani people, the mentally ill people, and prisoners in occupied territories during World War II originated with &quot;Aktion T4&quot; in 1939. Ordered to find a suitable method to kill, the &quot;Technical Institute for the Detection of Crime&quot; (&quot;Kriminaltechnisches Institut der Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (de), abbreviated KTI) of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) decided to gas victims with carbon monoxide.

In October 1939, the Nazis started gassing prisoners at Fort VII near Posen. The first victims were Polish and Jewish inmates of asylums for the mentally ill. Witnesses report that from December 1939, mobile gas chambers were used to murder the inmates of asylums in Pomerania, Eastern Prussia and Poland. The vans were built for the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; Lange and their use was supposed to speed up the killings. Instead of transporting the victims to the gas chambers, the gas chambers were transported to the victims. They were most likely devised by specialists from the Referat II D of the RSHA. These mobile gas chambers worked on the same principles as the stationary gas chambers: through a rubber hose the driver released pure CO from steel cylinders into the air tight special construction that was shaped like a box and placed on the carrier. The vans resembled moving vans or delivery lorries and were labelled &quot;Kaiser&#x27;s Kaffee Geschäft&quot; (de) (&quot;Kaiser&#x27;s Coffee Shop&quot;) for camouflage. They were not called &quot;gas vans&quot; at the time, but &quot;Sonder-Wagen&quot;, &quot;Spezialwagen&quot; (special vans) and &quot;Entlausungswagen&quot; (delousing vans). The Lange commando killed patients in numerous hospitals in the Wartheland in 1940. They drove to the hospitals, collected patients, loaded them into the vans and gassed them while they were driving them away. From 21 May to 8 June 1940 the Sonderkommando Lange murdered 1558 sick people from Soldau concentration camp.

In August 1941, SS chief Heinrich Himmler attended a demonstration of a mass-shooting of Jews in Minsk that was arranged by Arthur Nebe, after which he vomited. Regaining his composure, Himmler decided that alternative murder techniques should be found. He ordered Nebe to explore more &quot;convenient&quot; ways of killing, less stressful for the killers. Nebe decided to conduct his experiments by murdering Soviet mental patients, first with explosives near Minsk, and then with automobile exhaust at Mogilev. Nebe&#x27;s experiments led to the development of the gas van.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning/essays&quot;&gt;The path to genocide: essays on launching the final solution By Christopher R. Browning&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle had already been used in 1940 for the gassing of East Prussian and Pomeranian mental patients in the Soldau concentration camp.

Gas vans were used, particularly at the Chełmno extermination camp, until gas chambers were developed as a more efficient method for murdering large numbers of people. Two types of gas vans were used by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the East. The &quot;Opel-Blitz&quot;, which weighed 3.5 tons, and the larger &quot;Saurerwagen&quot;, which weighed 7 tons. In Belgrade, the gas van was known as &quot;Dušegupka&quot; and in the occupied parts of the USSR similarly as &quot;душегубка&quot; (&quot;dushegubka&quot;, literally &quot;soul killer&quot; or &quot;exterminator&quot;). The SS used the euphemisms &quot;Sonderwagen&quot;, &quot;Spezialwagen&quot; or &quot;S-Wagen&quot; (&quot;special vehicle&quot;) for the vans. The gas vans were specifically designed to direct deadly exhaust fumes via metal pipes into the airtight cargo compartments, where the intended victims had been forcibly stuffed to capacity. When the gas was released, victims screamed and knocked on the walls, begging for the Germans to release them. After their deaths, their bodies were &quot;thrown out blue, wet with sweat and urine, the legs covered with excrement and menstrual blood&quot;. These gruesome symptoms were one of the reasons why Rudolf Höss chose Zyklon B as the primary killing method for Jews. Ironically, Zyklon B inflicted similar symptoms. 

By June 1942 the main producer of gas vans, GmbH, had delivered 20 gas vans in two models (for 30–50 and 70–100 individuals) to Einsatzgruppen, out of 30 that were ordered from that company. Not one gas van was extant at the end of the war. The existence of gas vans first came to light in 1943 during the trial of Nazi collaborators who had been involved in the murder of civilians in Krasnodar. A group of 30 to 60 civilians were gassed on August 21 and 22, 1942 by members of Sonderkommando (special unit) 10a of Einsatzgruppe D, who were supported by local collaborators. Subsequently, gas vans were used for murder of Roma people and ill persons. The total number of gas van killings is unknown.

The gas vans are extensively discussed in some of the interviews in Claude Lanzmann&#x27;s film &quot;Shoah&quot;.

==Soviet Union==
According to historian Robert Gellately, &quot;the Soviets sometimes used a gas van (&quot;dushegubka&quot;), as in Moscow during the 1930s, but how extensive that was needs further investigation.&quot; while Nazi killers have &quot;invented the first gas van, which began operations in the Warthegau on January 15, 1940, under Herbert Lange&quot;.

During the Great Purge in the Soviet Union, NKVD officer Isaj D. Berg used a specially adapted airtight van for gassing prisoners to death on an experimental basis. The prisoners were gassed on the way to Butovo, a phony firing range, where the NKVD executed its prisoners and buried them. According to testimony given by NKVD officer Nikolai Kharitonov in 1956, Isaj Berg had been instrumental in the production of gas vans. Berg had become chief of the administrative economic department in Moscow&#x27;s NKVD in the summer of 1937. In October 1937 he was charged with the supervision of the Butovo firing range. Berg had to prepare Butovo for the mass execution of people from greater Moscow and to ensure that these executions would take place smoothly. According to testimony given by Fjodor Tschesnokov, a member of Berg&#x27;s execution team, in 1956, trucks were used, which were equipped with valves through which the gas could be directed inside the vehicles. The interrogations revealed that the prisoners were stripped naked, tied up, gagged and thrown into the trucks. Their property was stolen. Berg was arrested on 3 August 1938 and sentenced to death for participating in a &quot;counter-revolutionary conspiracy within the NKVD&quot; and executed on 3 March 1939.

The scale at which these trucks were used is unknown. Author Tomas Kizny assumes that they were in use while Berg oversaw the executions (October 1937 to 4 August 1938). He points to archaeological excavations conducted in 1997. Then 59 corpses were exhumed who most likely had been murdered during Berg&#x27;s tenure. Only four of these victims had been shot in the head, which leads Kizny to conclude that at least some of them had been gassed. FSB officers Alexander Mikhailov and Mikhail Kirillin, and historian Lydia Golovkova, recounted the testimony of one witness at a mass execution site outside Moscow. As many as 50 prisoners were loaded into trucks whose exhaust pipes were turned into the trucks, which Muscovites called &quot;soul killers&quot; and which were said to have been invented by Berg. Prisoners were &quot;half dead&quot; when they arrived at the site, where most were subsequently executed.

Babi Yar massacre survivor and witness Dina Pronicheva, according to a published interview with her nephew named Mikhail Frenkel, narrowly escaped being turned over to a Soviet police &quot;soul destroyer&quot; (gas van) while visiting her mother-in-law in 1943. 

Marek Hałaburda has written that the gas vans were introduced to increase the rate of executions. In the book &quot;KGB: The State Within a State&quot; Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick wrote that: &quot;Owing to the shortage of executioners, Chekists used trucks that were camouflaged as bread vans as mobile death chambers. Yes, the very same machinery made notorious by the Nazis - yes, these trucks were originally a Soviet invention, in use years before the ovens of the Auschwitz were built&quot; Gas vans were also reportedly used in the cities of Omsk and Ivanovo in the Soviet Union.

<doc id="63050" wikidata="Q3508806" url="?curid=63050" title="Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome">
<text>Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome is a rare, sometimes fatal neurological condition linked to the ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain).

==Signs and symptoms==

The initial, acute phase of EMS, which last for three to six months, presents as trouble with breathing and muscle problems, including soreness and spasm, but which may also be intense. Muscle weakness is not a feature of this phase, but some people experience muscle stiffness. Additional features can include cough, fever, fatigue, joint pain, edema, and numbness or tingling, usually in the limbs, hands and feet.

The chronic phase follows the acute phase. Eosinophilic fasciitis may develop, primarily in the limbs. CNS signs may appear, including numbness, increased sensation, muscle weakness, and sometimes cardiac or digestive dysfunction. Fatigue is present to some degree, while the muscle pain (which may be extremely intense) and dyspnea continue in this phase.

== Causes ==

Subsequent epidemiological studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko&#x27;s L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. The L-tryptophan was produced by a bacterium grown in open vats in a Showa Denko fertilizer factory. While a total of 63 trace contaminants were eventually identified, only six of them could be associated with EMS. The compound EBT (1,1&#x27;-ethylidene-bis-L-tryptophan, also known as &quot;Peak E&quot;) was the only contaminant identifiable by initial analysis, but further analysis revealed PAA (3-(phenylamino)-L-alanine, also known as &quot;UV-5&quot;), and peak 200 (2[3-indolyl-methyl]-L-tryptophan). Two of the remaining uncharacterized peaks associated with EMS were later determined to be 3a-hydroxy-1,2,3,3a,8,8a-hexahydropyrrolo-[2,3-b]-indole-2-carboxylic acid (peak C) and 2-(2-hydroxy indoline)-tryptophan (peak FF). These were characterized using accurate mass LC–MS, LC–MS/MS and multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The last of the six contaminants (peak AAA/&quot;UV-28&quot;, being &quot;the contaminant most significantly associated with EMS&quot; has been characterized as two related chain-isomers; peak AAA1 ((S)-2-amino-3-(2-((S,E)-7-methylnon-1-en-1-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, a condensation product between L-tryptophan and 7-methylnonanoic acid) and peak AAA2 ((S)-2-amino-3-(2-((E)-dec-1-en-1-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, a condensate between L-tryptophan and decanoic acid). No consistent relationship has ever been firmly established between any specific trace impurity or impurities identified in these batches and the effects of EMS. While EBT in particular has been frequently implicated as the culprit, there is no statistically significant association between EBT levels and EMS. Of the 63 trace contaminants, only the two AAA compounds displayed a statistically significant association with cases of EMS (with a p-value of 0.0014).

As most research has focused on attempts to associate individual contaminants with EMS, there is a comparative lack of detailed research on other possible causal or contributing factors. Tryptophan itself has been implicated as a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. While critics of this theory have argued that this hypothesis fails to explain the near-absent reports of EMS prior to and following the EMS outbreak, this fails to take into account the sudden rapid increase in tryptophan&#x27;s usage immediately prior to the 1989 outbreak, and ignores the strong influence of the EMS outbreak&#x27;s legacy and the extended FDA ban on later usage of tryptophan. Crucially, this also ignores the existence of a number of cases of EMS that developed both prior to and after the primary epidemic, including at least one case where the tryptophan was tested and found to lack the contaminants found in the contaminated lots of Showa Denko&#x27;s tryptophan, as well as cases with other supplements inducing EMS, and even a case of EMS induced by excessive dietary L-tryptophan intake via overconsumption of cashew nuts. A major Canadian analysis located a number of patients that met the CDC criteria for EMS but had never been exposed to tryptophan, which &quot;brings causal interpretations of earlier studies into question&quot;. Other studies have highlighted numerous major flaws in many of the epidemiological studies on the association of tryptophan with EMS, which cast serious doubt on the validity of their results. As the FDA concluded, &quot;other brands of L-tryptophan, or L-tryptophan itself, regardless of the levels or presence of impurities, could not be eliminated as causal or contributing to the development of EMS&quot;. Even animal studies have suggested that tryptophan itself &quot;when ingested by susceptible individuals either alone or in combination with some other component in the product, results in the pathological features in EMS&quot;.

At the time of the outbreak, Showa Denko had recently made alterations to its manufacturing procedures that were thought to be linked to the possible origin of the contaminants detected in the affected lots of tryptophan. A key change was the reduction of the amount of activated charcoal used to purify each batch from &gt;20 kg to 10 kg. A portion of the contaminated batches had also bypassed another filtration step that used reverse-osmosis to remove certain impurities. Additionally, the bacterial culture used to synthesize tryptophan was a strain of &quot;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&quot; that had been genetically engineered to increase tryptophan production. Although the prior four generations of the genetically engineered strain had been used without incident, the fifth generation used for the contaminated batches was thought to be a possible source of the impurities that were detected. This has been used to argue that the genetic engineering itself was the primary cause of the contamination, a stance that was heavily criticized for overlooking the other known non-GMO causes of contamination, as well as for its use by anti-GMO activists as a way to threaten the development of biotechnology with false information. The reduction in the amount of activated carbon used and the introduction of the fifth generation &quot;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&quot; strain were both associated with the development of EMS, but due to the high overlap of these changes, the precise independent contribution of each change could not be determined (although the bypass of the reverse-osmosis filtration for certain lots was determined to be not significantly associated with the contaminated lots of tryptophan). While Showa Denko claimed a purity of 99.6%, it was noted that &quot;the quantities of the known EMS associated contaminants, EBT and PAA, were remarkably small, of the order of 0.01%, and could easily escape detection&quot;.

=== Regulatory response ===
The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005.

==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==
Treatment is withdrawal of products containing L-tryptophan and the administration of glucocorticoids. Most patients recover fully, remain stable, or show slow recovery, but the disease is fatal in up to 5% of patients.

== History ==

The first case of eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome was reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in November 1989, although some cases had occurred as early as 2–3 years before this. In total, more than 1,500 cases of EMS were reported to the CDC, as well as at least 37 EMS-associated deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. This FDA restriction was loosened in 2001, and fully lifted in 2005. Since the initial ban on L-tryptophan, a normal metabolite of the compound in mammals, 5-hydroxtryptophan (5-HTP) has become a popular replacement dietary supplement.

<text>In baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter. It is calculated as total bases divided by at-bats, through the following formula, where &quot;AB&quot; is the number of at-bats for a given player, and &quot;1B&quot;, &quot;2B&quot;, &quot;3B&quot;, and &quot;HR&quot; are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively:

: formula_1

Unlike batting average, slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles. Such batters are usually referred to as sluggers. Plate appearances resulting in walks, hit-by-pitches, catcher&#x27;s interference, and sacrifice bunts or flies are specifically excluded from this calculation, as such an appearance is not counted as an at-bat (these are not factored into batting average either).

The name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but an average of how many bases a player achieves per at bat. It is a scale of measure whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4. This might not be readily apparent: a Major League Baseball player&#x27;s slugging percentage is almost always less than 1 because a majority of at bats result in either 0 or 1 base. The stat awards a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a home run four times. The slugging percentage would have to be divided by 4 to actually be a percentage (of bases achieved per at bat out of total bases possible). As a result, it is occasionally called slugging average, or simply slugging, instead.

A slugging percentage is usually expressed as a decimal to three decimal places and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000. For example, a slugging percentage of .589 would be spoken as &quot;five eighty-nine.&quot; The slugging percentage can also be applied as an evaluative tool for pitchers. This is not as common but is referred to as &quot;slugging-percentage against&quot;.

==In Major League Baseball==
As an example: with the New York Yankees in 1920, Babe Ruth had 458 at bats during which he recorded 172 hits: 73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, and 54 home runs. This was + + + = 388 total bases. His total number of bases (388) divided by his total at-bats (458) is .847, which constitutes his slugging percentage for the season.

Ruth&#x27;s 1920 figure set a record in Major League Baseball (MLB), which stood until 2001 when Barry Bonds achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats for a slugging percentage of .863. Josh Gibson, who played in Negro league baseball, had a slugging percentage of .974 in 1937.

Until the 2024 incorporation of Negro league statistics into major league records, the MLB career leader in slugging percentage was Ruth (.6897), followed by Ted Williams (.6338) and Lou Gehrig (.6324). Ruth was displaced by Josh Gibson, who has a career slugging percentage of .718.
The maximum possible slugging percentage is 4.000. A number of MLB players have had a 4.000 career slugging percentage for a short amount of time by hitting a home run in their first major league at bat. However, no player in MLB history has ever retired with a 4.000 slugging percentage. Four players have tripled in their only MLB plate appearance and therefore share the record—without consideration of a minimum number of games played or plate appearances—of a career slugging percentage of 3.000. They are Eric Cammack (2000 Mets); Scott Munninghoff (1980 Phillies); Eduardo Rodríguez (1973 Brewers); and Chuck Lindstrom (1958 White Sox).

For the 2023 season, the average slugging percentage for all players in MLB was .414. The highest single-season league average was .437 in 2000, and the lowest was .305 in 1908.

==Significance==
Long after it was invented, slugging percentage gained new significance when baseball analysts realized that it combined with on-base percentage (OBP) to form a very good measure of a player&#x27;s overall offensive production (OBP + SLG was originally referred to as &quot;production&quot; by baseball writer and statistician Bill James). A predecessor metric was developed by Branch Rickey in 1954. Rickey, in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, suggested that combining OBP with what he called &quot;extra base power&quot; (EBP) would give a better indicator of player performance than typical Triple Crown stats. EBP was a predecessor to slugging percentage.

Allen Barra and George Ignatin were early adopters in combining the two modern-day statistics, multiplying them together to form what is now known as &quot;SLOB&quot; (Slugging × On-Base). Bill James applied this principle to his runs created formula several years later (and perhaps independently), essentially multiplying SLOB × at bats to create the formula:

: formula_2

In 1984, Pete Palmer and John Thorn developed perhaps the most widespread means of combining slugging and on-base percentage: on-base plus slugging (OPS), which is a simple addition of the two values. Because it is easy to calculate, OPS has been used with increased frequency in recent years as a shorthand form to evaluate contributions as a batter.

In a 2015 article, Bryan Grosnick made the point that &quot;on base&quot; and &quot;slugging&quot; may not be comparable enough to be simply added together. &quot;On base&quot; has a theoretical maximum of 1.000 whereas &quot;slugging&quot; has a theoretical maximum of 4.000. The actual numbers do not show as big a difference, with Grosnick listing .350 as a good &quot;on base&quot; and .430 as a good &quot;slugging.&quot; He goes on to say that OPS has the advantages of simplicity and availability and further states, &quot;you&#x27;ll probably get it 75% right, at least.&quot;

<doc id="63060" wikidata="Q1146230" url="?curid=63060" title="Irish National Liberation Army">
<text>The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA, ) is an Irish republican socialist paramilitary group formed on 8 December 1974, during the 30-year period of conflict known as &quot;the Troubles&quot;. The group seeks to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a socialist republic encompassing all of Ireland. With membership estimated at 80–100 at their peak, it is the paramilitary wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP).

The INLA was founded by former members of the Official Irish Republican Army who opposed that group&#x27;s ceasefire. It was initially known as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The INLA waged a paramilitary campaign against the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland. It was also active to a lesser extent in the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe. High-profile attacks carried out by the INLA include the Droppin Well bombing, the 1994 Shankill Road killings and the assassinations of Airey Neave in 1979 and Billy Wright in 1997. However, it was smaller and less active than the main republican paramilitary group, the Provisional IRA. It was also weakened by feuds and internal tensions. Members of the group used the cover names People&#x27;s Liberation Army, People&#x27;s Republican Army, and Catholic Reaction Force for attacks its volunteers carried out but the INLA did not want to claim responsibility for. The INLA became a proscribed group in the United Kingdom on 3 July 1979 under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.

After a 24-year armed campaign, the INLA declared a ceasefire on 22 August 1998. In August 1999, it stated that &quot;There is no political or moral argument to justify a resumption of the campaign&quot;. In October 2009, the INLA formally vowed to pursue its aims through peaceful political means and began decommissioning its weapons.

The IRSP supports a &quot;No First Strike&quot; policy, that is allowing people to see the perceived failure of the peace process for themselves without military actions.

The INLA is a proscribed organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000 and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.

== History ==

===Origins===
During the 1960s, the Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin under the leadership of Cathal Goulding, radically re-assessed their ideology and tactics after the dismal failure of the IRA&#x27;s Border Campaign in the years 1956–62. They were heavily influenced by popular front ideology and drew close to communist thinking. A key intermediary body was the Communist Party of Great Britain&#x27;s organisation for Irish exiles, the Connolly Association. The Marxist analysis was that the conflict in Northern Ireland was a &quot;bourgeois nationalist&quot; one between the Ulster Protestant and Irish Catholic working classes, fomented and continued by the ruling class. Its effect was to depress wages, since worker could be set against worker. They concluded that the first step on the road to a 32-county socialist republic in Ireland was the &quot;democratisation&quot; of Northern Ireland (i.e., the removal of discrimination against Catholics) and radicalisation of the southern working class. This would allow &quot;class politics&quot; to develop, eventually resulting in a challenge to the hegemony of both what they termed &quot;British imperialism&quot; and the respective unionist and Irish nationalist establishments north and south of the Irish border.

In August 1969 there was a major outbreak of intercommunal violence in Northern Ireland, with eight deaths, six of them Catholics. On 14–15 August loyalists burned out several Catholic streets in Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969. IRA units offered resistance, however very few weapons were available for the defence of Catholic areas. These events and the dissatisfaction of more traditional and militant republicans with the political direction taken by the leadership, particularly their moves to end Abstentionism, led to a split and the formation of the Provisional IRA.

The &quot;Official&quot; IRA units who remained loyal to the Goulding leadership occasionally fought the British Army and the RUC throughout 1970 (as well as the Provisional IRA during a 1970 feud). In August 1971, after the introduction of internment without trial, OIRA units fought numerous gun battles with British troops who were deployed to arrest suspected republicans. However, the OIRA declared a ceasefire in 1972. The ceasefire, on 30 May, followed a number of armed actions which had been politically damaging. The organisation bombed the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment (the main perpetrators of Bloody Sunday) in Aldershot, but killed only five female cleaners, a gardener and an army chaplain. After the killing of William Best, a Catholic British soldier home on leave in Derry, the OIRA declared a ceasefire. In addition, the death of several militant OIRA figures such as Joe McCann in confrontations with British soldiers, enabled the Goulding leadership to call off their armed campaign, which it had never supported wholeheartedly.

As time passed discontent with the ceasefire in the movement grew and Seamus Costello, IRA veteran, operations officer for &quot;general headquarters staff&quot; (GHQ) and an elected representative on both Bray Urban District Council and Wicklow County Council, became the figurehead of those within the Official movement opposed to it. In 1972 an Official IRA army convention voted to endorse Costello&#x27;s position of continued support for armed struggle in Northern Ireland. However, supporters of Costello did not have the numbers on the Army Council to enable what was voted for at the convention. At Official Sinn Féin Ardfheis in 1972 and 1973 Costello&#x27;s policy was accepted by the rank and file but blocked by the party executive. A smear campaign was initiated against Costello and he was marginalised within the movement and some of his prominent associates were expelled. Costello himself was dismissed from Sinn Féin after ignoring an order not to stand in local elections or attend meetings of the two local authorities of which he was a member. In Spring 1974 Costello was also court-martialled by the Official IRA. Meanwhile, Costello&#x27;s emerging anti-ceasefire faction, amongst them several Belfast men (including Ronnie Bunting, a Protestant nationalist), carried out a series of robberies in the Republic to pay for arms. At the Sinn Féin Ardfheis in Dublin on 1 December 1974, a Costello sympathiser proposed a motion overturning his dismissal. However, many of Costello&#x27;s supporters had been blocked from entering, including the most articulate who would have been able to sway the members gathered. The motion was defeated by 197 votes to 15 and a split was now inevitable. Local branches of Official Sinn Féin throughout the island of Ireland announced they were resigning from the party and on 8 December the dissidents met in the Spa Hotel in Lucan, Dublin.

===Foundation===
The Irish Republican Socialist Party was founded on 8 December 1974 in the Spa Hotel in Lucan, Dublin and the movement&#x27;s military wing, the Irish National Liberation Army, was founded later the same day. The IRSP&#x27;s foundation was made public but the INLA&#x27;s was kept a secret until the group could operate effectively. One delegate suggested the armed wing be named the Irish Citizen Army after the paramilitary group founded by James Connolly that participated in the 1916 Easter Rising but this was rejected by Costello because of sectarian attacks carried out in Northern Ireland by another group using the same name. Costello advocated the name &quot;National Liberation Army&quot; and this appeared in some subsequent claims of responsibility for attacks, although delegates settled on &quot;Irish National Liberation Army&quot;. Unlike the Provisional IRA, and the Official IRA who also saw themselves as inheritors of the tradition, by no longer claiming to be the &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; the INLA abandoned a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the Second Dáil.

At a press conference five days later Costello read a statement outlining how the IRSP would seek to build a &quot;broad front&quot; on the basis of demanding a British declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland, the release of all internees and sentenced &quot;political prisoners&quot;, abolish all repressive legislation, outlaw discrimination of all kinds, and &quot;agree to compensate the Irish People for the exploitation which has already occurred.&quot; In the statement, Costello summarised the &quot;broad front&quot; strategy:

It shall be the policy of the Irish Republican Socialist Party to seek an active working alliance of all radical forces within the context of the Broad Front in order to ensure the ultimate success of the Irish Working Class in their struggle for Socialism.

The IRSP also called for an end to sectarian murders &quot;on the basis of united action by Catholic and Protestant working class against British Imperialism in Ireland&quot;, opposition to Ireland joining the European Economic Community, nationalisation of natural resources, and the &quot;formation of people&#x27;s organisations to combat rising prices an unemployment&quot;. Costello explained that the IRSP did not practice abstentionism and would consider contesting an election depending on a &quot;thorough analysis of the conditions prevailing at the time&quot;. Prominent republican activist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey attended the press conference as County Tyrone&#x27;s representative on the party&#x27;s executive, giving the new organisation republican credibility.

Shortly after it was founded, the INLA/IRSP came under attack from their former comrades in the Official IRA, who wanted to destroy the new grouping before it could get off the ground. On 20 February 1975, Hugh Ferguson, an INLA member and an Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) branch chairperson, was the first person to be killed in the feud. One of the first military operations of the INLA was the shooting of OIRA leader Sean Garland in Dublin on 1 March. Although shot six times, he survived. After several more shootings (according to the RUC the feud had claimed two lives and wounded nineteen others up to this point) a truce was arranged, but fighting started again. The most prominent victim of the restarted feud was Billy McMillen, the commander of the OIRA in Belfast, shot by INLA member Gerard Steenson. His murder was unauthorised and was condemned by Costello. This was followed by several more assassinations on both sides, the most prominent victim being Seamus Costello, who was shot dead on the North Strand Road in Dublin on 5 October 1977. Costello&#x27;s death was a severe blow to the INLA, as he was their most able political and military leader. The Official and Provisional IRAs both denied responsibility and Sinn Féin/The Workers&#x27; Party issued a statement condemning the killing. Members of an opposing INLA faction in Belfast also denied the killing. However, the INLA eventually deemed Official IRA member Jim Flynn the person responsible, and he was shot dead in June 1982 in the North Strand, Dublin, very close to the spot where Costello died.

It has been claimed by some in the Republican Socialist Movement that one of their members killed in 1975, Brendan McNamee (who was involved in the killing of Billy McMillen), was actually killed by Provisional IRA members. The Officials had denied involvement at the time of the killing and had instead blamed it on the Provisionals, who also denied involvement.

The inter-republican violence had a negative effect on the growth of the fledgling IRSP; its first Ardfheis, scheduled for the end of March, had to be cancelled. Bernadette McAliskey and others left the IRSP in late 1975 after a dispute over a number of issues, most urgent being the question of whether the armed wing should be subordinate to the IRSP&#x27;s political leadership. It was later reported McAliskey had attempted to initiate a discussion to clarify the status of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), what would later become the INLA, but the motion was defeated by majority vote and Costello insisted the PLA was a separate organisation from the IRSP and discussing its affairs was improper. After her resignation McAliskey accused the IRSP of &quot;being objectively indistinguishable from either wing of the republican movement and possibly combining the worst elements of both&quot;. At the end of its first year in existence the IRSP had not progressed as Costello had hoped; ten members of the Ard-Chomhairle had resigned, the organisation in Derry had lost many members, Belfast was at odds with the leadership, and recruitment overall had been hurt by the bloody feud with the Official IRA.

===Armed campaign===
The National Liberation Army (NLA) announced its existence and claimed responsibility for several attacks on British security forces in a press release published in November 1975, sent to newspapers and diplomatic missions in London, although the statement was issued too late to be included in the December issue of &quot;The Starry Plough&quot;.

In February 1976 a statement was issued declaring that the &quot;National Liberation Army&quot; and &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; (the nom de guerre employed by the INLA during its feud with the Official IRA) had merged to form a single organisation. Reportedly the People&#x27;s Liberation Army name was chosen without the oversight of the group&#x27;s Dublin-based leadership, although apparently throughout 1976 the INLA in Derry was still known to its own members and outsiders as the PLA. In July 1976 the PLA in Derry issued a lengthy statement concurring with a recent IRSP statement on recovering from the November split, and stressed the necessity of the PLA as a socialist alternative to the Provisional IRA in the fight against British imperialism. Journalists had already deduced the Irish National Liberation Army was the military wing of the IRSP following their November 1975 release, although the IRSP would only admit that they had accepted &quot;protection&quot; from &quot;armed groups&quot; in their feud with the Official IRA.

The INLA from its inception adopted a republican-paramilitary structure similar to the IRA. Under a chief of staff was an eight-man army council, the ultimate decision-making body of the organisation. All major operations were supposed to be sanctioned by the army council. Under the army council was &quot;general headquarters staff&quot; (GHQ). They acted as couriers, supplying INLA units with what they dubbed &quot;gear&quot; or &quot;logistics&quot; - weapons and explosives. In return, GHQ received information on potential targets and proceeds from robberies. Next came the &quot;brigades&quot;, which were generally much smaller than those of the Provisional IRA. The INLA did not re-organise its brigades into smaller cells as the Provisional IRA did in the late-Seventies, which proved extremely damaging during the supergrass trials of the mid-Eighties. The INLA leadership later admitted that their failure to do this was a serious weakness, but argued to maintain recruitment and pursue its political ambitions it had to stay in touch with the &quot;civilian&quot; population. In January 1983 the INLA leadership said they hoped to implement a more cellular system throughout the year but it&#x27;s unlikely this plan to come to fruition in the wake of damaging police penetration. However, interviewed in late 1983, then INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey asserted the cell system had been introduced throughout the organisation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the INLA developed into a modest organisation in Northern Ireland, operating primarily from the Divis Flats in west Belfast, which, as a result, became colloquially known as &quot;the planet of the Irps&quot; (a reference to the IRSP and the film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;). They also had a large presence in Derry and the surrounding area, and all three of the INLA prisoners who died in the 1981 Irish hunger strike were from County Londonderry. Northern County Armagh reportedly had a significant INLA/IRSP presence also. In the Republic of Ireland the INLA/IRSP was primarily based in Dublin and Munster. From 1982 onwards the INLA also established units in Newry, Downpatrick and several rural border areas. The first member of the security forces to be killed by the INLA was an RUC officer, Noel Davis, killed on 24 May 1975 by a booby trap bomb left in a car in Ballinahone, near Maghera, County Londonderry. During this period, the INLA competed with the Provisional IRA for members, with both groups in conflict with the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The INLA leader in Belfast, Ronnie Bunting, called in claims of responsibility to the media by the code name &quot;Captain Green&quot;.

The first action to bring the INLA to international notice was its assassination on 30 March 1979 of Airey Neave, the British Conservative Party&#x27;s spokesman on Northern Ireland and one of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s closest political supporters. Through the 1970s Neave, an influential Tory Member of the House of Commons, had been advocating within British political circles for an abandonment of the British Government&#x27;s strategy of a containment of Irish paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland against the British State, and for the adoption of a strategy of waging a military offensive against it seeking its martial defeat. This brought him to the attention of both the Provisional IRA and the INLA as a potential threat to their organisations and activities. The INLA issued a statement regarding the attack in the August 1979 edition of its publication &quot;The Starry Plough&quot;:

The attention the INLA received following the death of Airey Neave led to it being declared an illegal organisation in Britain and Northern Ireland. However, despite the &quot;success&quot; of the 30 March action, the INLA was facing internal turmoil. IRSP chairperson Miriam Daly threatened to resign over policy disagreements and perceived failings of the IRSP to raise funds, run in elections, and enact policy. Senior IRSP member Michael Plunkett was arrested after gardaí found bomb-making equipment in his flat in Dublin and later jumped bail and fled to Paris. A series of botched Middle East arms importation attempts precipitated tensions between Belfast and Dublin representatives to the INLA GHQ and Dessie Grew considered assassinating the leader of the Belfast faction opposed to the INLA chief of staff. Before the conflict broke out there were attempts to recruit veteran Provisional IRA leader Seán Mac Stíofáin as INLA chief of staff in the hope he would help stabilise the organisation. He was interested and met with INLA Army Council representatives on several occasions between 1978 and 1979 but nothing materialised. The unauthorised kidnapping of a Dublin bank manager from his home in January 1980 led to further internal anger and an operation in England was planned to demonstrate that the INLA was still capable of carrying on its war. An INLA Active service unit planted two 10 lb bombs at Netheravon British Army camp in the Salisbury Plain Training Area. Although only one bomb detonated &amp; caused damage starting a fire, and injuring two soldiers, this action helped bind the organisation together.
The INLA lost another of its founding leadership in 1980, when Ronnie Bunting was assassinated at his home. Noel Lyttle, another Protestant member of the IRSP, was killed in the same incident. The Ulster Defence Association, an Ulster loyalist paramilitary, claimed responsibility for both killings. Miriam Daly, who had resigned from the IRSP four months earlier, was killed by loyalist assassins in the same year. Although no group claimed responsibility, the INLA claimed that the Special Air Service (SAS) was involved in the killings of Bunting and Little. All three were strongly identified with the campaign against criminalisation of republican paramilitary prisoners.

===Hunger strike===
IRA and INLA prisoners convicted after March 1976 did not have Special Category Status applied in prison. Defending paramilitary prisoners&#x27; right to special category status, i.e. political status was an issue the IRSP and INLA advocated for from the outset, both within the prisons and on outside, when others, including the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin, seemed reluctant to do so. This could be partly attributed to IRSP/INLA prisoners being immediately forced into confrontation with prison staff as soon as the movement was formed. Because IRSP prisoners were not members of the Official IRA or Provisional IRA they were denied political status while it was still granted and in summer 1975 twenty IRSP prisoners went on hunger strike for the right to wear their own clothes, to associate freely, refuse to do prison work, and to elect their own spokesmen. These would later become the core of the five demands of the H-Block protest and the 1981 hunger strike was fought. As the 1 March 1976 deadline for the removal of special category status approached the Northern Ireland Office met with a council of representing all paramilitary organisations, loyalist and republican, inside Long Kesh prison. The British offered concessions in return for the removal of special category status. Only the IRSP would go on to flatly refuse the offer.

On 14 November the first IRSP/INLA prisoner, James Connolly Brady of Derry, joined the blanket protest. Both the INLA and IRA attacked prison staff outside the prison. However, unlike Sinn Féin, the IRSP engaged in popular agitation on the streets in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and elsewhere. Behind the public rhetoric, there was deep concern within the IRSP about the commitment of the IRA/Sinn Féin to the H-Block protest; Sinn Féin had voted at its Ard Chomhairle to prohibit cooperation with the IRSP in protest activities in the South and in June 1978 Sinn Féin protests stopped as it emerged the IRA were in secret negotiations with mediators. According to Holland and McDonald, &quot;as conditions inside the H-Blocks deteriorated, so did relations between the IRSP and the Provisionals.&quot; The Sinn Féin Ard-Chomhairle put out a directive in September 1978 banning any IRSP speaker from sharing a Provisional speaker, and at a meeting held in Liberty Hall to discuss the prison crisis all the Provisionals walked out when Mick Plunkett stood up to speak. The IRA regarded the prisons campaign as a distraction from the armed struggle and were reluctant to get too involved in any protest movement they could not control. However, hunger strike publicity events in continental Europe received an enthusiastic reception.

On 27 October 1980, republican prisoners in HM Prison Maze began a hunger strike. One hundred and forty-eight prisoners volunteered to be part of the strike, but a total of seven were selected to match the number of men who signed the Easter 1916 Proclamation of the Republic. The group consisted of IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon. This hunger strike ended a week before Christmas. In January 1981, it became clear that the prisoners&#x27; demands had not been conceded. Prison authorities began to supply the prisoners with officially issued civilian clothing, whereas the prisoners demanded the right to wear their own clothing. In addition, the militancy of INLA blanket men, who were refusing to withdraw from the protest, was causing problems. On 27 January INLA prisoners rioted because the INLA Officer Commanding Patsy O&#x27;Hara was not permitted by the authorities to see his own men. The stage was set for another confrontation and in March the 1981 Irish hunger strike began. Three INLA members died during the latter hunger strike – Patsy O&#x27;Hara, Kevin Lynch, and Michael Devine, along with seven Provisional IRA members. The hunger strike leader Bobby Sands and Anti H-Block activist Owen Carron were elected to the British Parliament, and two other protesting prisoners were elected to the Dáil. In addition, there were work stoppages and large demonstrations all over Ireland in sympathy with the hunger strikers. It was reported the turnout for Patsy O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s funeral was equal to that of Bloody Sunday.


There was a bitter clash over the IRSP&#x27;s share of money raised in an American fund-raising tour undertaken by three of the hunger-strikers&#x27; relatives, Liz O&#x27;Hara, Malachy McCreesh, and Seán Sands. The tour had been organised by Noraid, the Provisional IRA&#x27;s support group in the United States. Noraid had objected to O&#x27;Hara being on the tour because her brother Patsy was a &quot;communist&quot; and would sully the image republicans had in the United States. However, the other relatives refused to go unless she accompanied them. There were disputes over the exact amount of money raised but the only certainty is INLA prisoners received none of it. IRSP member Seán Flynn travelled to New York where he met Martin Galvin a leading Noraid spokesman. The meeting devolved into a shouting match with Galvin denouncing Flynn as a communist and having him thrown out of the house. Flynn toured the United States as a representative of the H-Block committee but Noraid was told to stay away from any meeting he was speaking at. A wealthy Noraid supporter who did attend a meeting was so disgusted by Flynn&#x27;s sympathy for Native Americans and African-Americans that he tore up a previously promised cheque for $10,000. He allegedly told Flynn &quot;I don&#x27;t like niggers&quot;.

The INLA unit which operated in the Lower Falls area of Belfast, led by Gerard Steenson, were particularly active at this time. However, the Belfast INLA was increasingly at odds with the Dublin leadership for personal and political reasons. By the beginning of 1982, this faction had shot and wounded the INLA&#x27;s northern organiser Jackie Goodman, IRSP Belfast city councillor Sean Flynn and Flynn&#x27;s brother Harry Flynn, hiding out in Dublin after escaping from the Maze prison in 1976. Steenson&#x27;s faction claimed they were the true INLA. In response, the old Dublin INLA leadership declared they be shot on sight.

===Dominic McGlinchey===
In summer 1982 in a &quot;rare moment of tactical expediency&quot; what was left of the INLA&#x27;s Belfast leadership, a group with close contacts with the Lower Falls gang, patched up their differences with the old INLA leadership and agreed on the composition of a new army council, chief of staff and Belfast commander. In early 1982 IRA veteran Dominic McGlinchey was released from Portlaoise Prison having served five years. McGlinchey had defected to the INLA in prison and after he was freed quickly rose up the ranks to become director of operations. He made an immediate impact, ruthlessly putting an end to dissent within the organisation and recruiting new members. Based in the Dundalk area, McGlinchey began to organise the INLA in Armagh, Newry, Tyrone, South Londonderry, and South West Antrim. His release coincided with the theft of of Frangex commercial explosives from the Tara mines in County Tipperary, enabling the organisation to carry out an &quot;intensive&quot; bombing campaign. Throughout 1982 the INLA stepped up its attacks on Unionist leaders with a swathe of bomb attacks on their homes and offices. Attacks against British security forces continued also, but a number of operations killed Catholic children, with three dying in Belfast as a result of INLA explosions in a five-month period. These were propaganda disasters for the INLA, and, say authors Holland and McDonald, &quot;gave the INLA a reputation for recklessness&quot;. Other offensive INLA actions at this time included the bombing of the Mount Gabriel radar station in County Cork, which the INLA believed was providing assistance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in violation of Irish neutrality, although this was disputed by the Irish government. Their deadliest attack came on 6 December 1982 – the Ballykelly disco bombing of the Droppin&#x27; Well Bar in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, which catered to British military personnel, in which 11 soldiers on leave and 6 civilians were killed. Shortly afterwards, the INLA issued a statement of responsibility:
We believe that it is only attacks of such a nature that bring it home to people in Britain and the British establishment. The shooting of an individual soldier, for the people of Britain, has very little effect in terms of the media or in terms of the British administration.
On 20 November 1983, three members of the congregation in the Mountain Lodge Pentecostal Church, Darkley, (near Keady, County Armagh) were shot dead during a Sunday service. The attack was claimed by the Catholic Reaction Force, a cover name for a small group of people, including one member of the INLA. The weapon used came from an INLA arms dump, but Tim Pat Coogan claims in his book &quot;The IRA&quot; that the weapon had been given to the INLA member to assassinate a known loyalist and the attack on the church was not sanctioned. The INLA&#x27;s then-chief of staff, Dominic McGlinchey, came out of hiding to condemn the attack.

On 17 March 1984, Dominic McGlinchey and three other INLA members were surrounded by armed Garda detectives at a safe house in Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare. Over one hundred bullets were exchanged in a shootout before Gardai of the Special Branch task force made their way into the farmhouse, subsequently causing McGlinchey to call for a priest in surrender. On going into jail McGlinchey handed over his position as Chief of Staff to a Newry ally; the INLA Army Council was not consulted on this decision.

===Supergrass===
In the mid-1980s, the INLA was greatly weakened by splits and criminality within its own ranks, as well as the conviction of many of its members under the supergrass scheme. Harry Kirkpatrick, an INLA volunteer, was arrested in February 1983 on charges of five murders and subsequently agreed to give evidence against other INLA members.

The INLA kidnapped Kirkpatrick&#x27;s wife Elizabeth, and later kidnapped his sister and his stepfather too. All were released physically unharmed. INLA Chief of Staff Dominic McGlinchey is alleged to have killed Kirkpatrick&#x27;s lifelong friend Gerard &#x27;Sparky&#x27; Barkley because he may have revealed the whereabouts of the Kirkpatrick family members to the police.

In May 1983, 10 men were charged with various offences on the basis of evidence from Kirkpatrick. Those charged included IRSP vice-chairman Kevin McQuillan and former councillor Sean Flynn. IRSP chairman and INLA member James Brown was charged with the murder of a police officer. Others escaped; Jim Barr, an IRSP member named by Kirkpatrick as part of the INLA, fled to the US where, having spent 17 months in jail, he won political asylum in 1993.) 

In December 1985, 27 people were convicted on the basis of Kirkpatrick&#x27;s statements. By December 1986, 24 of those convictions had been overturned. Gerard Steenson was given five life sentences for the deaths of the same five people that Kirkpatrick himself had been convicted of, these included Ulster Defence Regiment soldier Colin Quinn, shot in Belfast in December 1980.

Holland and McDonald summarise the impact the supergrass trials had on the INLA:

===Feuds and splits===
Holland and McDonald argue the &quot;frenzy of activity generated under the rule of Dominic McGlinchey&quot; had &quot;masked the seriousness of the situation facing the IRSP and INLA. By 1984 the movement had &quot;degenerated into a loosely knit group of often mutually suspicious fiefdoms.&quot; The IRSP took a more rigidly Marxist/Leninist line than that ever previously adopted by the movement in an attempt to delineate the IRSP/INLA more clearly from the Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA. The adoption of this rigid line meant the effective abandonment of the broad front strategy as initially conceived by Seamus Costello. Widespread criminality and ruthless racketeering by the INLA in Belfast after the imprisonment of key activists following the supergrass trials brought the movement into further disrepute and the INLA leadership moved against the new Officer Commanding (OC) of the Belfast INLA. The INLA carried out a number of bomb attacks in 1985 but the INLA was more concerned with the internal battle for control of the disintegrating organisation. John O&#x27;Reilly, former OC of the Markets area of Belfast, emerged as the winner and usurped the Dundalk man McGlinchey had appointed to become chief of staff. John O&#x27;Reilly was regarded with suspicion by some within the INLA, he was dismissed from the organisation by Ronnie Bunting in the late 1970s after an internal inquiry into allegations of O&#x27;Reilly being a police informant.

In jail, the INLA began to break up into warring factions. By late 1984 they could be divided into three broad groupings; one centred around Gerard Steenson, a second that opposed him, and a third that associated with Tom McAllister. Steenson&#x27;s men, who included Jimmy Brown, were angry and disillusioned at the way the INLA had developed since their arrest. Incidents such as the Darkley killings and the police penetration and corruption in Belfast convinced them that the INLA was beyond reform. Those opposed to Steenson were the de facto INLA leadership including Ta Power and John O&#x27;Reilly. Their priority was to preserve the INLA as an organisation. McAllister at first leaned towards O&#x27;Reilly but later veered towards those opposed to him.

O&#x27;Reilly saw the remnants of the original INLA organisation based in Dublin and Munster as a threat to his legitimacy as chief of staff. Harry Flynn and Gerry Roche were released from Portlaoise Prison in 1984 and set about trying to reconstruct the organisation founded by Costello. Gerry Roche won an agreement by a very narrow majority, on the Ard Comhairle of the lRSP to publish a newspaper. He wanted to call the paper &quot;The Broad Front&quot; and although permission was not granted he went ahead anyway, calling the paper &quot;Freedom Struggle&quot;. In the editorial in the first and only issue, Flynn made reference to the tradition of Connolly, Mellowes and Costello but no mention was made of Marx, Engels or Lenin; this was viewed as a reflection of his disagreement with the new Marxist/Leninist line. In response, the O&#x27;Reilly faction tried to assassinate both Flynn and Roche. The old arms links were re-activated by the Dublin-Munster grouping as part of an effort to either create a new republican socialist movement or reform the existing INLA; between 1984 and late 1986 they held meetings with Al-Fatah and other Arab sympathisers in Prague, East Berlin, Warsaw, and Tunisia. In 1984 guns started coming into Ireland in modest amounts; Škorpion machine pistols, VZOR pistols, and grenades were smuggled, as well as some &quot;remotes&quot; for bomb detonators. Seamus Ruddy from Newry joined the INLA in Dublin in the 1970s. He was arrested in 1978 for smuggling arms but was acquitted. After dissension among local members, Ruddy drifted away from the main organisation and in 1983 went to Paris where he taught English. He disappeared in late May 1985, after a meeting with three leading members of the INLA, one of them being John O&#x27;Reilly. The three were searching for arms and believed that Ruddy knew where they could be found. At the time, the INLA denied that it was involved with his disappearance and resisted pressure from the Ruddy family to help it locate his whereabouts. In late 1993, a former high-ranking member of the INLA, Peter Stewart, finally admitted that the INLA had killed Ruddy in Paris. Ruddy&#x27;s remains were found there in 2017.

In 1987, the INLA and its political wing, the IRSP came under attack from the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation (IPLO), an organisation founded by disaffected INLA members centred around Tom McAllister, Gerard Steenson, Jimmy Brown and Martin &quot;Rook&quot; O&#x27;Prey who had resigned or been expelled from the INLA. The IPLO&#x27;s initial aim was to destroy the INLA and replace it with their organisation. Five members of the INLA were killed by the IPLO, including leaders Ta Power and John O&#x27;Reilly. The INLA retaliated with several killings of their own. After the INLA killed the IPLO&#x27;s leader, Gerard Steenson in 1987, a truce was reached. Although severely damaged by the IPLO&#x27;s attacks, the INLA continued to exist. The IPLO, which was heavily involved in drug dealing, was forcibly disbanded by the Provisional IRA in a large-scale operation in 1992.

Directly after the feud in October 1987, the INLA received more damaging publicity when Dessie O&#x27;Hare, an erstwhile INLA volunteer, set up his own group called the &quot;Irish Revolutionary Brigade&quot; and kidnapped a Dublin dentist named John O&#x27;Grady. O&#x27;Hare cut off two of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s fingers and sent them to his family in order to secure a ransom. O&#x27;Grady was eventually rescued and O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s group arrested after several shootouts with armed Gardaí. The INLA disassociated itself from the action, issuing a statement saying O&#x27;Hare &quot;is not a member of the INLA&quot;. O&#x27;Hare later rejoined the INLA while in prison.

Following the feud the IRSP embraced a more explicitly left-wing ideological stance; declaring in the December 1987 issue of the &quot;Starry Plough&quot; the necessity to &quot;break away from Left Republicanism and embrace the scientific socialism of Marx and Engels in order to analyse and thus formulate a political programme for the Irish revolution&quot; and move beyond &quot;republicanism/militarism.&quot; The politically minded faction within the movement hoped to build a left-republican alternative to Sinn Féin. However, militarist elements within the INLA were intent on a renewed armed campaign against British security forces and loyalists. A protracted internal power struggle ensued and in 1992 the main political spokespersons for the IRSP departed. In the early 1990s the INLA, particularly in Belfast, effectively became a proxy force for the Provisional IRA, carrying out attacks on loyalist paramilitaries using IRA intelligence. Many shootings were perceived as openly sectarian attacks on Protestants.

On 14 April 1992, the INLA carried out its first killing in England after the death of Airey Neave, when they shot dead a recruiting army sergeant in Derby while he was leaving a British Army recruiting office. In June 2010, Declan Duffy was charged with the killing, although he was released in March 2013, under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

Dominic McGlinchey was killed in 1994 by unknown assailants after being released from prison the previous year.

On 16 June 1994 the INLA&#x27;s Belfast Brigade shot dead three members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF); high-ranking UVF Belfast Brigade figure Trevor King and two other UVF members, on the Shankill Road in west Belfast, close to the Belfast headquarters of the UVF.

In 1995, four members of the INLA, including chief of staff Hugh Torney, were arrested by Gardaí in Balbriggan while trying to smuggle weapons from Dublin to Belfast. Torney, with the support of two of his co-accused, called a ceasefire in exchange for favourable treatment by the Irish Government. Since Torney, who was chief of staff, under the INLA&#x27;s rules lacked the authority to call a ceasefire (because he was incarcerated), he and the two men who supported him were expelled from the INLA.

Torney and one of those men, Dessie McCleery, as well as founder-member John Fennell, did not wish to surrender the leadership of the organisation. Their faction, known as the INLA/GHQ, assassinated the new INLA chief of staff, Gino Gallagher. After the INLA killed both McCleery and Torney in 1996, the rest of Torney&#x27;s faction quietly disbanded.

INLA gunmen opened fire on British soldiers in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast on 7 July 1997, when the Drumcree conflict triggered six days of fierce riots and widespread violence in several nationalist areas of Northern Ireland.

===Killing of Billy Wright===
Billy Wright was the founder and leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). Since July 1996, the group had launched a string of attacks on Catholic civilians, killing at least five. In April 1997, Wright was sentenced to eight years in the Maze Prison. On the morning of 27 December 1997, he was assassinated by three INLA prisoners – Christopher &quot;Crip&quot; McWilliams, John &quot;Sonny&quot; Glennon and John Kennaway – who were armed with two pistols. He was shot as he travelled in a prison van (alongside another LVF prisoner, Norman Green and one prison officer) from one part of the prison to another. Kennaway held the driver hostage and Glennon gave cover with a .22 Derringer pistol while McWilliams opened the side door and fired seven shots at Wright with his PA63 semi-automatic. After killing Wright, the three volunteers handed themselves over to prison guards. They also handed over a statement, which read: 

That night, LVF gunmen opened fire on a disco in a mainly nationalist area of Dungannon. Four civilians were wounded and a former Provisional IRA volunteer was killed in the attack.

The nature of Wright&#x27;s killing led to speculation that prison authorities colluded with the INLA to have him killed, as he was a danger to the peace process. The INLA strongly denied these rumours, and published a detailed account of the assassination in the March/April 1999 issue of &quot;The Starry Plough&quot; newspaper.

===Ceasefire===
The INLA opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and continued to carry out attacks during the talks process that preceded the agreement and the confirmatory referendum that followed. The INLA claimed responsibility for a car bomb which exploded on 24 June in the Armagh border village of Newtownhamilton. The bombing was interpreted as a &quot;protest attack&quot; as it happened the day before the election for the new Northern Ireland Assembly that took place on 25 June 1998. The RUC believed the Real IRA supplied the INLA with semtex commercial explosive which was thought to have been used as a component in making the bomb. INLA members assisted the bombing campaign being carried out by the dissident republican groups the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) and Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) by providing stolen cars that could be transformed into car bombs. On 15 August 1998 the RIRA exploded a car bomb in the centre of Omagh, County Tyrone killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the deadliest attack of the Troubles inside Northern Ireland.

The INLA declared a ceasefire on 22 August 1998. When calling its ceasefire, the INLA acknowledged the &quot;faults and grievous errors in our prosecution of the war&quot;. The INLA admitted that innocent people had been killed and injured &quot;and at times our actions as a liberation army fell far short of what they should have been&quot;. The INLA went on to accept the large vote in favour of the Good Friday Agreement – which it had opposed during the 1998 referendums – by the people of both parts of Ireland. It said &quot;The will of the Irish people is clear. It is now time to silence the guns and allow the working classes the time and the opportunity to advance their demands and their needs.&quot;

Although the INLA does not support the Good Friday Agreement, it does not call for a return to armed struggle on behalf of republicans either. An INLA statement released in 1999 declared, &quot;we do not see a return to armed struggle as a viable option at the present time&quot;.

===Post-ceasefire activities===

The INLA maintains a presence in parts of Northern Ireland and has carried out punishment beatings on alleged petty criminals.

The Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC), which monitored paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, stated in a November 2004 report that the INLA was heavily involved in criminality. In 1997, an INLA man named John Morris was shot dead by Garda Síochána (the Republic&#x27;s police force) in Dublin during the attempted robbery of a newspaper distributor&#x27;s depot in Inchicore. Three other INLA members were arrested in the incident. In 1999, the INLA in Dublin became involved in a feud with a criminal gang in the city. After a young INLA man named Patrick Campbell was killed by drug dealers, the INLA carried out several shootings in reprisal, including at least one killing. Journalist Paul Williams has also stated the INLA, especially in Dublin, is now primarily a front for organised crime. The IRSP and INLA deny these allegations, arguing that no one has been simultaneously convicted of membership in the INLA and of drug offences. The IRSP and the INLA have both strongly denied any involvement with drug dealing, stating that the INLA has threatened criminals who it stated have falsely used its name.

The October 2006 IMC report stated that the INLA &quot;was not capable of undertaking a sustained campaign [against the United Kingdom], nor does it aspire to&quot;.

In December 2007, disturbances broke out at an INLA parade in the Bogside in Derry between spectators and Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers attempting to arrest four of the marchers.

In the Seventeenth and Eighteenth IMC reports the INLA was said to remain a threat, with a desire to mount attacks that could well be more dangerous in the future, but was characterized as being largely a criminal enterprise at that time. The INLA killed Brian McGlynn on 3 June 2007 during the span of the first of these reports. This killing was said to have occurred because the victim used the INLA name in the drug trade. On 24 June 2008, the INLA was said to have murdered Emmett Shiels, although the IMC report did indicate the investigation was continuing.
It was also said to be partaking in &quot;serious crimes&quot; such as drug dealing, extortion, robbery, fuel laundering and smuggling. Furthermore, the INLA and Continuity IRA were stated to have co-operated.

On 15 February 2009 the INLA claimed responsibility for the shooting death of Derry drug dealer Jim McConnell.

In March 2009 it was reported that the INLA had stood down its Dublin Brigade in order to allow its army council to carry out an internal investigation into allegations of drug dealing and criminality. The INLA denied it as an organisation was involved in drug dealing and went on to say that &quot;As a result of evidence presented to us, we are investigating the activities of people associated with us in [Dublin]. Pending that outcome, we have stood down several people.&quot; A short time later the INLA&#x27;s Dublin Commander, Declan &quot;Whacker&quot; Duffy, publicly disassociated himself from the organisation. Duffy criticized the INLA leadership stating that &quot;You would imagine if there was a thorough investigation being carried out by the INLA they would have at least came and spoke to me.&quot; He went on to state that: &quot;I can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;m disappointed with the way the INLA has handled things but at the same time I&#x27;m not going to get into a sniping match with them.&quot;

On 19 August 2009, the INLA shot and wounded a man in Derry. The INLA claimed that the man was involved in drug dealing although the injured man and his family denied the allegation. However, in a newspaper article on 28 August the victim retracted his previous statement and admitted that he had been involved in small scale drug dealing but has since ceased these activities.

In October 2015 the Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, commissioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the structure, role and purpose of paramilitary organisations reported the structures of the INLA remain in existence but there is little indication of centralised control from the leadership. Some members are active in politics through the IRSP however INLA members are &quot;heavily involved&quot; in criminal activity including extortion, drug dealing, distribution of stolen goods, and fraud. The INLA also continues to carry out punishment attacks. Although the INLA&#x27;s leadership recognises the futility of a return to armed struggle, there is cooperation between INLA members and dissident republicans, including the provision of weaponry and &quot;paramilitary-style assaults.&quot;

In July 2024, A Belfast Councillor for the TUV accused the INLA of attacking the Welcome Organisation, a homeless charity in West Belfast, following graffiti painted nearby stating any workmen repairing the centre would be shot. It is unknown how true this claim is, as local residents have been vocal about their demands for the centre to be relocated due to anti-social behaviour (primarily street fights, drug abuse and sexual acts in public). Following the attack, the IRSP reiterated calls for its relocation to a more suitable location.

===End of armed campaign===
On 11 October 2009, speaking at the graveside of its founder Seamus Costello in Bray, the INLA formally announced an end to its armed campaign, stating the current political framework allowed for the pursuit of its goals through peaceful, democratic means. Martin McMonagle from Derry said: &quot;The Republican Socialist Movement has been informed by the INLA that following a process of serious debate ... it has concluded that the armed struggle is over. The objective of a 32-county socialist republic will be best achieved through exclusively peaceful political struggle&quot;.

The governments of Britain and Ireland were informed before the announcement. Sinn Féin&#x27;s Gerry Adams was doubtful but added: &quot;However, if it is followed by the actions that are necessary, this is a welcome development&quot;. On 6 February 2010, days before the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was due to disband, the INLA revealed that it had decommissioned its weapons over the preceding few weeks. Had the INLA retained its weapons beyond 9 February, the date on which the legislation under which the IICD operated ended, then they would have been treated as belonging to common criminals rather than remnants from the Troubles.

The decommissioning was confirmed by General John de Chastelain of the IICD on 8 February 2010. On the same day INLA spokesman Martin McMonagle said that the INLA made &quot;no apology for [its] part in the conflict&quot; but they believed in the &quot;primacy of politics&quot; to &quot;advance the working class struggle in Ireland&quot;.

==Chiefs of staff==
== Finance ==

In 2002, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee estimated the INLA&#x27;s annual running costs at £25-30,000 against an annual fundraising capability of £500,000.

== Arms importation ==


Obtaining arms was one of the greatest difficulties faced by the INLA in its early years. Their avowed Marxism made them beyond help from Catholic Irish-America, who had traditionally been a lifeline for funds and weapons for Irish republicans engaged in armed struggle against British rule in Ireland. Lack of weapons in the mid-Seventies led to numerous internal rows, and Costello himself was even threatened by INLA members for his failure to provide guns. At a time when the IRA seemed replete with Armalites, the INLA was mainly armed with shotguns, which the rank and file wryly took to calling &quot;Costello-ites&quot; after their leader. The INLA&#x27;s main source of arms early on was from sympathizers in the Middle East, from where they imported a contingent of AK-pattern rifles in 1978. An arms smuggling network was later established where guns would be channelled from a Palestinian source based in Lebanon via West Germany (and later Switzerland) to a left-wing sympathiser in France and then to Ireland. The first shipment arrived in July 1979 consisting of six FN pistols, 35 automatic pistols, and 4 Uzi submachine guns. In later years Palestinian sources would provide the INLA with hundreds of Czechoslovak VZOR pistols as well as Chinese-made SKS rifles, Rhodesian submachine-guns and Browning pistols. The INLA also acquired Škorpion machine pistols from Fatah free of charge. The INLA also acquired Soviet-made plastic explosives, which were used in the assassination of Airey Neave. Later smaller-scale arms smuggling was carried out through a new conduit linked to the French far-left terrorist group Action Directe. This new network was established by the INLA faction loyal to Gerard Steenson, the original Middle East arms route remained in the hands of the older Dublin-based leadership. In July 1983 INLA member Colm Murphy was arrested in the US after attempting to buy a consignment of M60 machine guns to be shipped to Ireland. Testifying in court, informer Harry Kirkpatrick later recounted how the INLA faction in Belfast under the leadership of Gerard Steenson had during the 1981 Hunger Strike independently purchased arms in the United States, using money acquired from an armed robbery.

By the mid-1980s, separate INLA factions were trying to acquire arms. The old arms links were re-activated by remnants of the original INLA organisation based in Dublin and Munster as part of an effort to either create a new republican socialist movement or reform the existing INLA. Between 1984 and late 1986 they held meetings with Fatah and other Arab sympathisers in Prague, East Berlin, Warsaw, and Tunisia. In 1984, a modest amount of arms started flowing into Ireland again, including Škorpion machine pistols and VZOR pistols; grenades were smuggled as well, as were remotes for bomb detonators. The 1986 United States bombing of Libya generated an anti-Western mood in the Arab world that led to a breakthrough for INLA arms procurement efforts. A large arms haul was secured through a Palestine Liberation Organization contact in Prague which included a hundred man-portable anti-tank weapons, forty AK-47 rifles, three 12.7mm heavy machine guns, and two 80mm mortars. However, four INLA members (amongst them Harry Flynn) were arrested in France as they prepared to receive the shipment. The judge at their trial was sympathetic and recognised they were acting on political motives. By 1988 though the weapons were still available for import neither the INLA nor the IPLO splinter group had the means to do so.

Between 1977 and 1983 the INLA received weaponry from a sympathiser in Australia. The network had been activated by Seamus Costello and consisted of shipments of rifles of several types; Ruger Mini-14s, a Springfield Armory M1A, M1 Garands, Egyptian Mauser rifles and SKS rifles. In late 1983, however, the Australian network was exposed after Gardaí found Seamus Ruddy in possession of a document that led to the discovery of the fourth (and last) Australian guns shipment which contained five M14-type rifles, one M1 Garand, three Mini-14&#x27;s, an SKS, and over 1,700 rounds of ammunition. An Irish immigrant who had lived in Australia since 1968 and had become an Australian citizen in 1973 was arrested and convicted of arms running in 1984.

In the summer of 1994 the INLA smuggled a quantity of explosives from New Zealand, hidden in tea chests.

==Timeline of Irish National Liberation Army actions==
==Deaths as a result of activity==
According to Malcolm Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland&quot;, part of the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), the INLA was responsible for at least 120 killings during the Troubles, between 1975 and 2001. This includes those claimed by the &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; and &quot;People&#x27;s Republican Army&quot;. According to the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot; (2006 edition), the INLA was responsible for 127 killings.

Of those killed by the INLA:
*48 (~38%) were members or former members of the British security forces, including:
**26 British military personnel and 2 former soldiers
**14 Royal Ulster Constabulary officers and 4 former officers
**2 Northern Ireland Prison Service officers
*44 (~36%) were civilians – including politicians, alleged informers and alleged criminals
*20 (~16%) were members or former members of republican paramilitary groups
*8 (~6%) were members or former members of loyalist paramilitary groups
*2 were members of the Irish security forces

The CAIN database says there were 39 INLA members killed during the conflict, while &quot;Lost Lives&quot; says there were 44 killed.

<doc id="63064" wikidata="Q42583" url="?curid=63064" title="Bengal cat">
<text>The Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing of an Asian leopard cat (&quot;Prionailurus bengalensis&quot;) with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. The breed&#x27;s name derives from the leopard cat&#x27;s taxonomic name.

Bengals have varying appearances. Their coats range from spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, to marbling.

The earliest mention of an Asian leopard cat × domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in &quot;Our Cats and All About Them&quot;.

=== Bengals as a breed ===
Jean Mill of California is given credit for the modern Bengal breed. She made the first known deliberate cross of an Asian leopard cat with a domestic cat (a black California tomcat). Bengals as a breed did not really begin in earnest until much later.

==== Cat registries ====
In 1986, the breed was accepted as a &quot;new breed&quot; by The International Cat Association; Bengals gained TICA championship status in 1991. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) accepted Bengal cats in 1997. Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) in 1999 accepted the breed into their registry. Also in 1999, Bengals were accepted into the Australian Cat Federation (ACF). The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association accepted the Bengal in CFA&#x27;s &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; in 2016, under the restrictions that &quot;it must be F6 or later (6 generations removed from the Asian leopard cat or non-Bengal domestic cat ancestors)&quot;.

==== Early generations ====
Bengal cats from the first three generations of breeding (F1, G2, and G3) are considered &quot;foundation&quot; or &quot;early-generation&quot; Bengals. The early-generation males are frequently infertile. Therefore, female early-generation Bengals are bred to fertile domestic Bengal males of later generations. Nevertheless, as the term was used incorrectly for many years, many people and breeders still refer to the cats as F2, F3, and F4, even though the term is considered incorrect.
== Popularity ==
The Bengal breed was more fully developed by the 1980s. &quot;In 1992 The International Cat Association had 125 registered Bengal Breeders.&quot; By the 2000s, Bengals had become a very popular breed. In 2019, there were nearly 2,500 Bengal breeders registered in TICA worldwide.

* The 2019 number only represents the breeders who use the word &quot;Bengal&quot; in their cattery name.

== Appearance ==

=== Markings ===
==== Colors ====
Bengals come in a variety of coat colors. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes several Bengal colors: brown spotted, seal lynx point (snow), sepia, silver, and mink spotted tabby.

==== Spotted rosetted ====
The Bengal cat is the only domestic breed of cat that has rosette markings.
==== Marble ====

Domestic cats have four distinct and heritable coat patterns – ticked, mackerel, blotched, and spotted – these are collectively referred to as tabby markings.

Christopher Kaelin, a Stanford University geneticist, has conducted research that has been used to identify the spotted gene and the marble gene in domestic Bengal cats. Kaelin studied the color and pattern variations of feral cats in Northern California, and was able to identify the gene responsible for the marble pattern in Bengal cats.


== Legal restrictions ==
In Australia, G5 (fifth-generation) Bengals are not restricted, but their import is complex.

Bengals were regulated in the United Kingdom. In 2007, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs removed the previous licensing requirements.

In the United States, legal restrictions and even bans sometimes exist at the state and municipal level. In Hawaii, Bengal cats are prohibited by law (as are all wild cat species, and all other hybrids of domestic and wild animals). In Connecticut, it is also illegal to own any generation of Bengal cat. In Alaska, Bengal cats must be four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat. A permit and registered pedigree that indicates the previous four generations are required. In California, the code of regulations Title 14, section K, Asian leopards are not specifically listed as a restricted species. In Delaware, a permit is required to own Bengal cats. Bengals of the F1–G4 generations are also regulated in New York state, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Indiana. Various cities have imposed restrictions; in New York City, Bengals are prohibited, and there are limits on Bengal ownership in Seattle, Washington, and in Denver, Colorado. Except where noted above, Bengal cats with a generation of G5 and beyond are considered domestic, and are generally legal in the US.

In New Zealand&#x27;s Southland District, the Bengal cat requires a permit to own and is completely banned on any off-shore islands including Stewart Island.

== Health ==
=== Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) ===

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a major concern in the Bengal cat breed. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). A thick heart muscle makes it difficult for the cat&#x27;s heart to pump blood. 

HCM is a common genetic disease in Bengal cats and there is no genetic testing available as of 2018. In the United States, the current practice of screening for HCM involves bringing Bengal cats to a board certified veterinary cardiologist where an echocardiogram is completed. Bengal cats that are used for breeding should be screened annually to ensure that no hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is present. As of January 2019, the North Carolina State University is attempting to identify genetic markers for HCM in the Bengal Cat.

One study published in the &quot;Journal of Internal Veterinary Medicine&quot; has claimed the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Bengal cats is 16.7% (95% CI = 13.2–46.5%).

=== Bengal progressive retinal atrophy (PRA-b) ===
Bengal cats are known to be affected by several genetic diseases, one of which is Bengal progressive retinal atrophy, also known as Bengal PRA or PRA-b. Anyone breeding Bengal cats should carry out this test, since it is inexpensive, noninvasive, and easy to perform. A breeder stating their cats are &quot;veterinarian tested&quot; should not be taken to mean that this test has been performed by a vet: it is carried out by the breeder, outside of a vet office (rarely, if ever, by a vet). The test is then sent directly to the laboratory.

=== Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK-deficiency or PK-def) ===
PK deficiency is a common genetic diseases found in Bengal cats. PK deficiency is another test that is administered by the breeder. Breeding Bengal Cats should be tested before breeding to ensure two PK deficiency carriers are not mated. This is a test that a breeder must do on their own. A breeder uses a cotton swab to rub the inside of the cat&#x27;s mouth and then mails the swab to the laboratory.

=== Ulcerative nasal dermatitis ===
A unique form of ulcerative dermatitis affecting the nasal planum (rhinarium or nose leather) of Bengal cats was first reported in 2004. The condition first presents between the ages of 4-12 months, beginning as a dry scale and progressing to crusts and fissures typical of hyperkeratosis. The exact cause remains unclear; it is considered hereditary and incurable, but can respond favorably to topical steroid treatments such as prednisolone and tacrolimus ointment.
=== Life expectancy ===
A UK study looking at veterinary records found the Bengal to have a life expectancy of 8.51 years compared to 11.74 years overall.

== Bengal blood-type ==
The UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory has studied domestic cat blood-types. They conclude that most domestic cats fall within the AB system. The common blood-types are A and B and some cats have the rare AB blood-type. There is a lack of sufficient samples from Bengals, so the genetics of the AB blood-group in Bengal cats is not well understood.

One Bengal blood-type study that took place in the U.K. tested 100 Bengal cats. They concluded that all 100 of the Bengal cats tested had type A blood.
== Shedding and grooming ==
Bengals are often claimed by breeders and pet adoption agencies to be a hypoallergenic breed – one less likely to cause an allergic reaction. The Bengal cat is said to produce lower than average levels of allergens, though this has not been scientifically proven as of 2020.

Cat geneticist Leslie Lyons, who runs the University of Missouri&#x27;s Feline and Comparative Genetics Laboratory, discounts such claims, observing that there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic cat. Alleged hypoallergenic breeds thus may still produce a reaction among those who have severe allergies.

== Bengal Longhair (Cashmere Bengal) ==

Some long-haired Bengals (more properly, semi-long-haired) have always occurred in Bengal breeding. Many different domestic cats were used to create the Bengal breed, and it is theorized that the gene for long hair came from one of these backcrossings. UC Davis has developed a genetic test for long hair so that Bengal breeders could select Bengal cats with a recessive long-hair gene for their breeding programs.

Some Bengal cats used in breeding can carry a recessive gene for long-haired. When a male and female Bengal each carry a copy of the recessive long hair gene, and those two Bengals are mated with each other, they can produce long-haired Bengals. &quot;(See Cat coat genetics#Genes involved in fur length and texture.)&quot; In the past, long-haired offspring of Bengal matings were spayed or neutered until some breeders chose to develop the long-haired Bengal (which are sometimes called a Cashmere Bengal).

Long-haired Bengals are starting to gain more recognition in some cat breed registries but are not widely accepted. Since 2013, they have &quot;preliminary&quot; breed status in the New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) registry, under the breed name Cashmere Bengal. Since 2017 The International Cat Association (TICA) has accepted the Bengal Longhair in competitions.

<doc id="63065" wikidata="Q883" url="?curid=63065" title="Novosibirsk">
<text>Novosibirsk is the largest city and administrative centre of Novosibirsk Oblast and the Siberian Federal District in Russia. As of the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,633,595, making it the most populous city in Siberia and the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Additionally, it is the largest city in the Asian part of Russia and the most populous city in the country that does not have the status of a federal subject. Novosibirsk is located in southwestern Siberia, on the banks of the Ob River.

Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway, where the Novosibirsk Rail Bridge was constructed. Originally named Novonikolayevsk (&quot;New Nicholas&quot;) in honor of Emperor Nicholas II, the city rapidly grew into a major transport, commercial, and industrial hub. Novosibirsk was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period and gained its present name, &quot;Novosibirsk&quot; (&quot;New Siberia&quot;), in 1926. Under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II, the city hosted many factories relocated from the Russian core.

Novosibirsk is home to many notable places such as the neo-Byzantine Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre, as well as the Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.

==History==

Novosibirsk was founded on the right side of the Ob, near an area traditionally inhabited by Chat Tatars (). The Russian town originated on 30 April 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river, and in 1895 became known as Novonikolayevsk (), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the new reigning Tsar, Nicholas II. It superseded Bolshoye Krivoshchyokovo village, located on the opposite side of the Ob, which was founded in 1696 and was resettled in 1893 due to the construction of the Novosibirsk Rail Bridge. The bridge, completed in the spring of 1897, made the new settlement a regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk directly with Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.

At the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural-processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, the city had seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.

The Russian Civil War of 1917–1923 took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city&#x27;s history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk (26 May 1918). The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.

Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy period (1921–1928). The city formed part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from 23 December 1919 to 14 March 1920. Between 13 June 1921 and 25 May 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city received its present name on 12 September 1926, -&quot;Novosibirsk&quot;, which, in the Russian language, translates roughly as &quot;New Siberian [town]&quot;.

After the Soviet Union abolished governorates in 1929, the city served as the administrative center of the Siberian Krai until 23 July 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until 28 September 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.

The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution, erected in the center of the city in 1922, became one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field-trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.

During Stalin&#x27;s industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities developed, including the &#x27;Sibkombain&#x27; plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally, a metal-processing plant, a food-processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932–33 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums. Reflecting international recognition of its rapid growth and industrialization, in the US media Novosibirsk was referred to as the &quot;Chicago of Siberia&quot;.

Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original road bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.

Between 1941 and 1942, the Soviets crated up and relocated more than 50 substantial factories from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.

The rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station&#x27;s construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded, as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir&#x27;s surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.

In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed the building of a center for scientific research in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in natural sciences and mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.

On 2 September 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with the population exceeding one million. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone. On 8 June 1965, the city was the scene of a dramatic aerial stunt when Lieutenant Valentin Privalov flew his MiG-17 under the October Bridge; an image which purportedly showed the event was later found to be a photocollage. In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.

On 1 August 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Novosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.

The layout of the modern city is based on the planning of the post-revolution period. Before 1917, there was no traditional city center in Novo-nikolayevsk. The main buildings of the railway management and the nearby railway station as well as the most important cathedral and the complex of the city&#x27;s government were spread throughout the city. This changed following the revolution, with Lenin House built in 1925 in what was traditionally the main avenue, Krasny Prospekt while the first Lenin monument was built in Barnaulskaya Street, closer to the railway station. And thus, until the late 1920s, Novosibirsk did not have a clearly defined city center. The 1930s brought many changes to the development of the city: Its former Bazarnaya Ploschad (Market Square) was chosen as the site for the construction of the Opera House which started in 1931. The Stalin Park of Culture and Rest was established some distance from the main avenue and the city&#x27;s administrative buildings and park created a radial around the Bazarnaya Ploschad.

There are 3 road (Kommunalny, Dimitrovsky, Bugrinsky), 2 railway (First, Komsomolsky), and 1 metro bridges within the city limits. The dam of the Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station located on the territory of the city is also used for road traffic.

===Location===
The city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. The southern boundary of the city runs through the Novosibirsk reservoir, which is formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station and cuts through the Ob Plateau.

The nearest major cities are Omsk, Barnaul, Kemerovo, Tomsk. Novosibirsk is located about 2,811 kilometres from Moscow.

===Climate===
The climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. Among the reasons for these temperatures are the absence of a nearby ocean and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being Ürümqi in China.

The climate is humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from to and in winter from to . However, winter temperatures can go as low as to , and summer temperatures can go as high as to . The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is .

Travellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk&#x27;s winter extremely cold, but it is a lot less severe than further east in Siberia and the Russian Far East, especially considering its latitude of 55°N. For example, Novosibirsk is less cold during winter nights than Spassk-Dalny at eleven degrees lower latitude. It also is less cold in winter than the largest far eastern city of Khabarovsk and during nights even the Pacific coastal town of Sovetskaya Gavan, both at less than 49°N, and slightly milder than the Chinese city of Harbin, the capital of Manchuria and Heilongjiang province in China, at only 45°N. Sometimes bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of and lower do not occur every year. Its overall temperatures are very similar to that of Winnipeg, Canada, at about 50 degrees north.


==Broadcasting==

Novosibirsk is home to Russia&#x27;s most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, West Asia, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.

<text>Akademgorodok (, &quot;Academic Town&quot;) is a part of the Sovetsky District of the city of Novosibirsk, Russia, located south of the city center and about west of Koltsovo. It is the educational and scientific centre of Siberia.

It is surrounded by a birch and pine forest on the shore of the Ob Sea, an artificial reservoir on the river Ob. Formally it is a part of Novosibirsk city, and has never been a closed city.

Located within Akademgorodok is Novosibirsk State University, 35 research institutes, a medical academy, apartment buildings and houses, and a variety of community amenities including stores, hotels, hospitals, restaurants and cafes, cinemas, clubs and libraries. The House of Scientists (), a social center of Akademgorodok, hosts a library containing 100 thousand volumesRussian classics, modern literature and also many American, British, French, German, Polish books and magazines. The House of Scientists also includes a picture gallery, lecture halls and a concert hall.

==History==

The town was founded in 1957 under the auspices of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Academician Mikhail Alexeyevich Lavrentyev, a mechanician and mathematician, the first Chairman of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, played a prominent role in establishing Akademgorodok. At its peak, Akademgorodok was home to 65,000 scientists and their families, and was a privileged area to live in.

During the Soviet period (1961–1991), due to the peculiarity of the Soviet economic system, monetary rewards did not always translate into a higher standard of living. To offset this, a special compensation system was devised in Akademgorodok for its residents and leading scientists. For example, residents of Akademgorodok had access to special food ration distribution outlets (&#x27;) that provided, most of the time, an access to some basic subsidized foodstuffs, which were not always easily obtainable elsewhere. Scientists who had obtained a doctorate (a post-Ph.D. degree under the Russian system) were rewarded by the authorities with the special food delivery service (&#x27;), which provided access to a wider selection of groceries than available to the general population; some of the scientists, despite being eligible, refused it on moral grounds.

Full and corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences had access to still higher level of service (&quot;&quot;) and were eligible to live in single-family residences (called &quot;cottages&quot;), considered luxurious by Soviet standards, as most of the population lived in apartments in nine- and four-story multi-apartment buildings.

During the early years residents enjoyed great freedom from the rules and restraints of the Soviet Union, with a modernist cultural centre exhibiting works by banned Soviet artists, risqué poetry evenings, and other activities allowed nowhere else. Scientific research in areas dismissed as dangerous pseudoscience in Moscow, such as cybernetics and genetics, flourished. However, freedoms were severely curtailed in the 1970s during the Brezhnev era.

==Akademgorodok in the post-Soviet era==
The collapse of the Soviet Union saw many scientists, including whole cadres of Russia&#x27;s top minds in the physical and theoretical sciences, reduced to penury. Beginning in the mid-1990s, as economic reforms allowed private investment in Russia, Akademgorodok saw the beginnings of venture funding. In 1992, a software company called Novosoft was founded here, and its chief client was IBM. Around this time CFT started, which specializes in banking and financial software. By 1997, private investment reached US$10 million; by 2006, it was $150 million, reaching about $1 billion by 2015.

Intel and Schlumberger have brought work to Akademgorodok, and other companies are following them into the area. Many scientists, including Lavrentyev&#x27;s son, also named Mikhail and also an accomplished mathematician in his own right, were deeply involved in this renaissance. Currently its population stands at over 100,000 and there are over 40 research institutes located within Akademgorodok. While still minuscule by the standards of other countries, the private venture effort in Akademgorodok has breathed new life into what was once one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s premier scientific centers.

, 300 companies had been set up since 2011, employing about 9,000 people and generating 17bn roubles (£175M) annually.

The area is sometimes called &quot;Silicon Forest&quot; or &quot;Silicon Taiga&quot;. A much larger technology center in the former Soviet Union is the Skolkovo Innovation Center, conveniently located on the outskirts of Moscow, a $4bn state project with annual revenues of $1bn.

<doc id="63072" wikidata="Q2308363" url="?curid=63072" title="Creative accounting">
<text>Creative accounting is a euphemism referring to accounting practices that may follow the letter of the rules of standard accounting practices, but deviate from the spirit of those rules with questionable accounting ethics—specifically distorting results in favor of the &quot;preparers&quot;, or the firm that hired the accountant. They are characterized by excessive complication and the use of novel ways of characterizing income, assets, or liabilities, and the intent to influence readers towards the interpretations desired by the authors. The terms &quot;innovative&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; are also sometimes used. Another common synonym is &quot;cooking the books&quot;. Creative accounting is oftentimes used in tandem with outright financial fraud (including securities fraud), and lines between the two are blurred. Creative accounting practices have been known since ancient times and appear world-wide in various forms. The term as generally understood refers to systematic misrepresentation of the true income and assets of corporations or other organizations. &quot;Creative accounting&quot; has been at the root of a number of accounting scandals, and many proposals for accounting reform—usually centering on an updated analysis of capital and factors of production that would correctly reflect how value is added.

Newspaper and television journalists have hypothesized that the stock market downturn of 2002 was precipitated by reports of &quot;accounting irregularities&quot; at Enron, Worldcom, and other firms in the United States. According to critic David Ehrenstein, the term &quot;creative accounting&quot; was first used in 1968 in the film &quot;The Producers&quot; by Mel Brooks, where it is also known as Hollywood accounting.

==Motivations behind creative accounting==
The underlining purpose for creative accounting is to &quot;present [a] business in the best possible light&quot; typically by manipulating recorded profits or costs. Company managers who participate in creative accounting can have a variety of situational motivations for doing so, including: 

*Market and stockholder expectations of profits
*Personal incentives
*Bonus-related pay
*Benefits from shares and share options
*Job security
*Personal satisfaction
*Cover-up fraud
*Tax management
*Management buyouts
*Debt covenant
*Manager&#x27;s self-interest
*Mergers and acquisitions

== Types/examples of creative accounting schemes ==

===Earnings management===

Creative accounting can be used to manage earnings. Earnings management occurs when managers use judgment in financial reporting and in structuring transactions to alter financial reports to either mislead some stakeholders about the underlying economic performance of a company or influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers.

=== Hollywood accounting ===

Practiced by some Hollywood film studios, creative accounting can be used to conceal earnings of a film to distort the profit participation promised to certain participants of the film&#x27;s earnings. Essentially, participants in the gross revenue of the film stay unaffected but profit participants are presented with a deflated or negative number on profitability, leading to less or no payments to them following a film&#x27;s success. Famous examples of deceiving good faith profit participants involve Darth Vader actor David Prowse (with $729M adjusted gross earnings on &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;) and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; novel writer Winston Groom (with $661M gross theatrical revenue)—both of whom have been paid $0 on their profit participation due to the films &quot;being in the red&quot;.

=== Tobashi schemes ===

This form of creative accounting—now considered a criminal offense in Japan, where it originated—involves the sale, swap or other form of temporary trade of a liability of one company with another company within the holding&#x27;s portfolio, often solely created to conceal losses of the first firm. These schemes were popular in the 1980s in Japan before the government instituted harsher civil laws and eventually criminalized the practice. The Enron scandal revealed that Enron had extensively made use of sub-corporations to offload debts and hide its true losses in a Tobashi fashion.

=== Lehman Brothers&#x27; Repo 105 scheme ===

Lehman Brothers utilized repurchase agreements to bolster profitability reports with their Repo 105 scheme under the watch of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. The scheme consisted of mis-reporting a Repo (a promise to re-buy a liability or asset after selling it) as a sale, and timing it exactly in a way that half of the transaction was completed before a profitability reporting deadline, half after—hence bolstering profitability numbers on paper. Public prosecutors in New York filed suit against EY for allowing the &quot;accounting fraud involving the surreptitious removal of tens of billions of dollars of fixed income securities from Lehman&#x27;s balance sheet in order to deceive the public about Lehman&#x27;s true liquidity condition&quot;.

Enron had done exactly the same about 10 years earlier; in their case, Merrill Lynch aided Enron in bolstering profitability close to earnings periods by willfully entering repurchase agreements to buy Nigerian barges from Enron, only for Enron to buy them back a few months later. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges and convicted multiple Merrill Lynch executives of aiding the fraud.

=== Currency swap concealment of Greek debt by Goldman Sachs ===

In 2001–2002, Goldman Sachs aided the government of Greece after its admission to the Eurozone to better its deficit numbers by conducting large currency swaps. These transactions, totaling more than 2.3 billion Euros, were technically loans but concealed as currency swaps in order to circumvent Maastricht Treaty rules on member nations deficit limits and allowed Greece to &quot;hide&quot; an effective 1 billion euro loan. After Goldman Sachs had engineered the financial instrument and sold it to the Greeks—simply shifting the liabilities in the future and defrauding investors and the European Union, the investment bank&#x27;s president Gary Cohn pitched Athens another deal. After Greece refused the second deal, the firm sold its Greek swaps to the Greek national bank and made sure its Short and Long positions towards Greece were in balance—so that a potential Greek default would not affect Goldman Sachs.

=== Parmalat&#x27;s mis-accounted credit-linked notes ===

Italian dairy giant Parmalat employed a number of creative accounting and wire fraud schemes before 2003 that lead to the largest bankruptcy in European history. It sold itself Credit-linked notes with the help of Merrill Lynch through a Cayman Islands special-purpose entity and over-accounted for their value on the balance sheet. It also forged a $3.9Bn check from Bank of America. The publicly listed company stated to investors that it had about $2Bn in liabilities (this figure was accepted by its auditors Deloitte and Grant Thornton International), but once audited more vigorously during the bankruptcy proceedings, it was discovered that the company&#x27;s debt turned out to actually be $14.5Bn. This massive debt was largely caused by failed operations in Latin America and increasingly complex financial instruments used to mask debt—such as Parmalat &quot;billing itself&quot; through a subsidiary called Epicurum. It was also discovered that its CEO Calisto Tanzi had ordered the creation of shell accounts and diverted 900M Euros worth into his private travel company.

=== Offshoring and tax avoidance ===

In order to avoid taxes on profits, multinational corporations often make use of offshore subsidiaries in order to employ a creative accounting technique known as &quot;Minimum-Profit Accounting&quot;. The subsidiary is created in a tax haven—often just as a shell company—then charges large fees to the primary corporation, effectively minimizing or wholly wiping out the profit of the main corporation. Within most parts of the European Union and the United States, this practice is perfectly legal and often executed in plain sight or with explicit approval of tax regulators. 

Nike, Inc. famously employed offshoring by selling its Swoosh logo to a Bermuda-based special-purpose entity subsidiary for a nominal amount, and then went on to &quot;charge itself&quot; licensing fees that Nike Inc. had to pay to the subsidiary in order to use its own brand in Europe. The Dutch tax authorities were aware of and approved of this siphoning structure, but did not publish the private agreement they had with Nike. The licensing fees totaled $3.86Bn over the course of 3 years and were discovered due to an unrelated U.S.-based lawsuit as well as the Paradise Papers. In 2014, the Bermuda deal with Dutch authorities expired, and Nike shifted the profits to another offshore subsidiary, a Netherlands-based Limited Liability Partnership (CV, short for Commanditaire Vennootschap, generally known as a Kommanditgesellschaft). Through a Dutch tax loophole, CV&#x27;s owned by individuals that are residing in the Netherlands are tax-free. Exploiting this structure saved Nike more than $1Bn in taxes annually and reduced its global tax rate to 13.1%; the company is currently being pursued for billions of dollars worth of back taxes in litigation by multiple governments for this multinational tax avoidance.

Upon his retirement from motor racing in 2007, he moved into driver management and became a brand ambassador for Mercedes-AMG. Since 2022, Häkkinen has been a commentator and pundit for Viaplay.

==Early life and career==

Häkkinen was born in Helsingin maalaiskunta, Finland, on 28 September 1968 to Harri, a shortwave radio operator and a part-time taxi driver, and Aila Häkkinen, who worked as a secretary. He has one sister, Nina, who ran a fan site for him until its closure in 1998. Häkkinen lived in the same street as Mika Salo with the two later becoming friends. As a child, Häkkinen played ice hockey and football.

When Häkkinen was five years old, his parents rented a go-kart for him to take to a track near their home. Despite an early crash, Häkkinen wished to continue racing, and his father bought him his first go-kart, one that Henri Toivonen had previously competed with. He later won his first karting race in 1975 at the Keimola Motor Stadium where he raced in the regional karting championships in 1978 and 1979, winning the Keimola Club Championship in both years. Häkkinen found further success in 1980 when he won the Swedish Lapland Cup and finished fourth in the 85cc class of the Lapland Karting Championship. Around this time, Häkkinen also drove a Volkswagen Beetle on the frozen lakes of Finland with friend Mika Sohlberg.

In 1981, Häkkinen won his first major karting title, the 85cc class of the Finnish Karting Championship. The following year, he finished runner-up in the 85cc class of the Formula Mini series and later won the Ronnie Peterson Memorial event and the Salpauselka Cup in Lahti. Häkkinen moved to the Formula Nordic 100cc class for 1983, where he became the champion on his first attempt and also participated in the A Junior Team Races for Finland alongside Taru Rinne, Jaana Nyman and Marko Mankonen, with the line-up taking the championship.

In 1984, Häkkinen won the 100cc Formula Nordic title and later participated in the World Kart Championship race held in Liedolsheim. He took his second consecutive 100cc Formula Nordic Championship in 1985 ahead of Jukka Savolainen. He took part in the Nordic Championship A-Class in the same year, finishing runner-up to Tom Kristensen. Häkkinen went to Parma to participate in the World Kart Championship where he retired before the event&#x27;s final heat due to a mechanical problem. In 1986, he reached his third consecutive Formula Nordic 100cc title and also took part in karting events across Europe. To further fund his career, Häkkinen got a job with a friend repairing bicycles.

In 1987, Häkkinen made the transition from karting to car racing when he purchased a 1986 Reynard Formula Ford 1600 from fellow Finn JJ Lehto. In that year, he entered the Finnish, Swedish and Nordic Formula Ford Championships, winning each title on his first attempt and won nine races combined. Häkkinen also entered two races of the EDFA 1600 Championship and raced in the Formula Ford Festival held at Brands Hatch, where he finished in seventh position. In 1988, Häkkinen entered the GM Vauxhall-Lotus Challenge with the Dragon team, where he secured three victories and finished the runner-up in the championship, behind Allan McNish. He later entered the Opel-Lotus EDFA Euroseries in the same year, taking four victories and became Champion with 126 points, ahead of nearest rival Henrik Larsen.

Going into 1989, Häkkinen moved from the Euroseries into the British Formula 3 Championship driving a Reynard 893 chassis for Dragon. He finished seventh position in the championship, scoring 18 points. He was later invited to participate in the Cellnet Formula Three SuperPrix for West Surrey Racing as a guest driver where he secured pole position and the victory. He also raced in the tenth round of the French Formula 3 championship at Le Mans-Bugatti on 24 September and finished third behind Éric Hélary and Laurent Daumet.

In 1990, Häkkinen applied to become a member of the &quot;Marlboro World Championship Team&quot; through what was akin to a fully sponsored racing driver academy. Its members were short-listed for testing by a judging panel including Marlboro McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion James Hunt, and Formula 3000 team bosses, Mike Earle and Hugues de Chaunac. Häkkinen was also a protégé of World Drivers&#x27; Champion Keke Rosberg. In an April 2015 interview, Earle recounted that Häkkinen&#x27;s application was the last one that he reviewed at the end of a long day, despite protests by Hunt who had already made plans to head to a pub for a beer. Häkkinen performed strongly in his test and went on to secure Marlboro&#x27;s sponsorship. That same year, therefore, Häkkinen left Dragon and moved to the West Surrey Racing team and won the British Formula 3 series, by taking nine victories en route to the Championship, with 121 points, ahead of fellow Finn Salo. In November, Häkkinen entered the Macau Grand Prix where he drove to pole position and won the first heat of the event. He retired from the second heat due to a last-lap collision with German Formula Three driver and future Formula One rival Michael Schumacher, who was classified as the overall winner.

==Formula One career==

===Team Lotus (1991–1992)===
====1991====

Häkkinen made his first test in a Formula One car with the Benetton team driving 90 laps around the Silverstone Circuit and set quicker lap times than regular driver Alessandro Nannini. He found it difficult to fit into the Benetton but liked the steering and throttle response. Häkkinen expected not to be offered a seat at Benetton and he decided to sign with the Lotus team for the 1991 season. Making his debut in the United States Grand Prix alongside teammate Julian Bailey, Häkkinen qualified thirteenth on the grid and suffered an engine failure on the sixtieth lap and was classified thirteenth. The next race in Brazil saw him finish ninth, and scored his first Formula One points by reaching fifth place in San Marino. Häkkinen suffered from a dip in race form as he encountered consecutive retirements in the next two races—his car suffered from an oil leak in Monaco and spun out in Canada. Before Canada, Bailey lost his seat at Lotus due to a lack of funding, so Häkkinen was partnered by Johnny Herbert and Michael Bartels throughout the remainder of the season.

Although Häkkinen secured a ninth-place finish in Mexico, he did not qualify for the French Grand Prix. Over the remainder of the season, he did not finish four of the nine races he entered. Häkkinen finished his debut season sixteenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring two points.

====1992====

Häkkinen remained at Lotus for 1992 and was partnered by Herbert. At the opening round of the season in South Africa, Häkkinen finished in ninth position, which he followed up with his first points of the season in Mexico. He took a further finish in Brazil, although he did not qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix and suffered consecutive retirements in the following two races. At Monaco, Lotus introduced their new car, the Lotus 107. Häkkinen later gathered further consecutive points in the following two races, before he was forced into retirement at the German Grand Prix due to an engine failure. A similar pattern followed in the next three races, which was broken when he finished fifth in Portugal and suffered a retirement at the penultimate round of the year in Japan. Häkkinen concluded the season with a seventh-place finish in Australia.

During the season, Häkkinen became embroiled in a contract dispute. Häkkinen, who was under contract to Lotus, opted to join Williams. However, Williams had not submitted their entry for the 1993 season, and Häkkinen was unable to join the team when he learnt that Lotus team principal Peter Collins would veto the Williams team entry if they had signed Häkkinen. Häkkinen later approached Ligier although his contract contained a clause of which his manager Keke Rosberg disagreed. He later approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis for a contract with the team, which was drafted at Courchevel Airport. The dispute eventually went to the Formula One Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of McLaren after two days of deliberation.

===McLaren (1993–2001)===
====1993====

For 1993, Häkkinen joined McLaren, originally as a race driver, although he became the team&#x27;s official test driver when CART driver Michael Andretti was hired by the team. Apart from regular testing duties, Häkkinen entered two Porsche Supercup races, held as a support race for the Monaco Grand Prix, where he started at pole position and took victory in both races. He was promoted to a Formula One race seat after the Italian Grand Prix, when Andretti left Formula One. Häkkinen entered the Portuguese Grand Prix where he out-qualified regular driver Ayrton Senna. During the race, he retired due to collision with a concrete wall. At the next race held in Japan, Häkkinen claimed the first podium of his career with a third-place finish, and ended the season when his McLaren car suffered a brake pipe failure in Australia. Häkkinen concluded the season with 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 4 points. In December, McLaren confirmed that Häkkinen would remain with the team on a three-year contract from the 1994 season onwards.

During 1993, Häkkinen, along with Senna, tested the Lamborghini V12 engine in a modified version of the McLaren MP4/8 race car dubbed the &quot;MP4/8B&quot; at both Estoril and Silverstone. Both drivers were impressed with the engine, with Häkkinen reportedly lapping Silverstone some 1.4 seconds faster in the MP4/8B with its V12 engine than he had with the team&#x27;s race car fitted with the Ford V8.

====1994====

Häkkinen stayed at McLaren for 1994 and was partnered by experienced driver Martin Brundle. He endured a torrid start: at the first two races of the season, Häkkinen retired as his car developed engine problems in the Brazilian Grand Prix and gearbox issues in the Pacific Grand Prix which included a collision with Senna on the first lap. He later reached his first podium finish of the season at the San Marino Grand Prix, although he suffered a dip in form as he was forced into consecutive retirements in the next four races.

Häkkinen raced to a further podium finish at the British Grand Prix, despite a last-lap collision with Jordan driver Rubens Barrichello for which he received a one-race ban, suspended for three races. The ban was enforced after the German Grand Prix, where Häkkinen collided with Williams driver David Coulthard with the Finn&#x27;s car sliding into another group of cars. He was replaced by Philippe Alliot for the next race in Hungary.

Häkkinen returned for the Belgian Grand Prix, initially coming third but was later promoted to second after the disqualification of Benetton driver Michael Schumacher. He got consecutive 3rd-place podium finishes in the next three races, before rounding off the season by finishing the final two races in Japan and Australia, albeit outside of the points scoring positions. Häkkinen managed a fourth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 26 points.

====1995====

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for 1995, and was partnered by Nigel Mansell. During pre-season testing, Häkkinen and teammate Mansell complained the car, the McLaren MP4/10, was not wide enough to fit in, resulting in their hands and elbows striking the sides of the cockpit. Mansell was forced to miss the opening two rounds, so Häkkinen was partnered with Mark Blundell.

Häkkinen started off the season by finishing fourth in Brazil, and later retired in Argentina due to a collision which punctured his left rear tyre that followed a spin. He took a further points finish with a 5th place at San Marino, before suffering from consecutive retirements in the next three races. For the French Grand Prix, McLaren introduced a revised version of their car, the McLaren MP4/10B. This did not revive Häkkinen&#x27;s fortunes as he did not finish in the points scoring positions, and later suffered consecutive retirements in the next four races, but got second place at the Italian Grand Prix. He was forced to miss the Pacific Grand Prix due to an operation for appendicitis and was replaced by Jan Magnussen. He returned for the Japanese Grand Prix, with a second-place finish.

At the season finale held in Australia, Häkkinen&#x27;s car suffered a tyre failure during the event&#x27;s first qualifying session on Friday, which resulted in his car becoming airborne and crashing sideways into the crash barrier on the outside of Brewery corner, the fastest corner of the Adelaide Street Circuit, at an estimated speed of 120 mph. The session was suspended with Häkkinen being critically injured due to sustaining a skull fracture, internal bleeding and a blockage of his airway. His life was saved by the efforts of the trackside medical team, including the President of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, Sid Watkins, and volunteer doctors Jerome Cockings and Steve Lewis, from the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Cockings performed an emergency tracheotomy on the track, delivering oxygen to enable Häkkinen to breathe. Watkins later arrived in the medical car, allowing the doctors to continue, restarting Häkkinen&#x27;s heart twice. Häkkinen was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital which was located about half a kilometre from the circuit. There he remained in a critical condition under care of the Trauma Service, the Neurosurgical Unit, and the Intensive Care Unit and remained in the hospital for approximately two months. He eventually made a remarkable recovery. As an expression of thanks for the elite class medical attention he received, Häkkinen donated a substantial undisclosed sum of money to help build a much-needed helipad for The Royal Adelaide Hospital, and made a special trip to Australia for the official opening ceremony in March 1997.

Häkkinen finished the 1995 season seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 17 points.

====1996====

The 1996 season was the first in which Häkkinen was the more experienced driver in his team and was partnered by David Coulthard. Häkkinen was confident going into the season and set himself a target of winning races. To ensure his fitness, Häkkinen spent time training in Bali and in February, McLaren conducted a secret test at the Paul Ricard Circuit. In the event that Häkkinen was not prepared, McLaren had Magnussen to replace him should the need arise. The season started well for Häkkinen: He earned consecutive points-scoring positions in the opening two rounds, before he suffered his first retirement of the season in Argentina as his car developed a throttle problem. He later finished the next two races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions, before returning consecutive finishes inside of the points in the following four races.

In the following race held in Britain where McLaren brought a revised version of the car, their McLaren MP4/11B, Häkkinen reached his first podium finish of the season with third place. However, he retired from the next race held in Germany due to a gearbox failure. This marked a turning point in Häkkinen&#x27;s season as he finished the next three races, including consecutive third-place finishes in Belgium and Italy. In September, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 1997, having previously been linked to Williams and Benetton. He retired from the penultimate round in Portugal resulting a collision with teammate Coulthard, damaging Häkkinen&#x27;s front wing and eventually led to his retirement on the 52nd lap of the race. He rounded off the season with a third-place finish in season finale held in Japan. Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 31 points.

====1997====

Häkkinen again remained at McLaren for 1997 and Coulthard remained his teammate. Häkkinen&#x27;s season got off to a good start: In the season-opening race in Australia, he drove up to the third position and later scored further consecutive finishes inside of the points scoring positions in the next three races. He suffered his first retirement of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix when he was involved in a collision with Benetton driver Jean Alesi. Häkkinen later took ninth position at the Spanish Grand Prix, but later suffered three consecutive retirements in the next three races—a collision with Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine in Canada and engine failures in France and Britain. At the latter race, he had seemed set for his first win, but his engine blew while he was holding off eventual winner Jacques Villeneuve.

Häkkinen secured another podium finish with third place in Germany and later retired from an hydraulic problem in Hungary. He later secured third place in the Belgian Grand Prix but was later disqualified when it was discovered that his car used an illegal type of fuel during the event. He secured a ninth-place finish in Italy and later suffered from consecutive retirements in the next two races—engine failures in the Austrian Grand Prix and the Luxembourg Grand Prix while leading both races. Häkkinen ended the season with a fourth position in the penultimate round in Japan and raced to his first Formula One victory at the season closing European Grand Prix. Häkkinen ended the season sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 27 points.

====1998====

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for 1998, partnered by Coulthard. Häkkinen was confident going about the challenge for the World Championship into the season, citing the involvement of technical director Adrian Newey. The season started off with controversy in Australia when teammate Coulthard let Häkkinen past to win the race. Häkkinen had earlier been called into the pit lane by an engineer by mistake. Coulthard later revealed a pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap would be allowed to win the race. Despite this, Häkkinen took back-to-back victories by winning the next race in Brazil. He maintained his good form at the Argentine Grand Prix where he finished second, although he retired from the San Marino Grand Prix when his car&#x27;s gearbox failed. However, Häkkinen managed consecutive victories in the next two rounds, which was followed by a retirement from the race in Canada as his car suffered another gearbox failure.

Häkkinen followed this up by taking consecutive podiums in the next two rounds—third in France and second in Britain. He managed further consecutive victories in the next two rounds, and followed this up with a sixth-place finish in Hungary. In August, it was announced that Häkkinen and Coulthard would be retained for 1999. Häkkinen retired from the following race held in Belgium when Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher collided with the Finn and was also hit by Sauber driver Johnny Herbert. He later managed a fourth position in Italy despite suffering from brake problems resulting from a spin. Häkkinen finished the season by taking victory in the final two rounds at the Luxembourg Grand Prix and the Japanese Grand Prix, which ensured he took enough points to clinch the 1998 World Championship, with 100 points, ahead of nearest rival Schumacher. Häkkinen was awarded the Autosport International Racing Driver Award for 1998. He was also named the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year by journalists. The Finnish Post Office issued stamps to commemorate Häkkinen&#x27;s World Championship in January 1999.

====1999====

Häkkinen remained at McLaren for 1999, with Coulthard partnering him for the upcoming season. The team suffered problems with their car, the McLaren MP4/14, during pre-season testing, resulting in a lack of preparation. Despite these setbacks, Häkkinen was confident going into the season, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve gained confidence and experience and am more relaxed. With this title I no longer have to tell myself every morning I can win, to put pressure on myself.&quot;

At the opening round in Australia, Häkkinen was forced into retiring as his car developed a throttle issue. However, he managed his first victory of the season in Brazil, despite his car developing a gearbox problem early in the race. Häkkinen retired from the race in San Marino when he collided with a barrier while leading. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Häkkinen finished in third place, having slid on oil left on the track surface in the race. He followed up the results by having consecutive victories in the races held in Spain and Canada. Häkkinen took a second-place finish in France, and was forced into another retirement in Britain, as a result of a wheel failure. During the Austrian Grand Prix, Häkkinen who started from pole position, was hit by Coulthard from behind and rejoined at the back of the field. Häkkinen eventually finished in 3rd place.

During the German Grand Prix, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2000. Häkkinen encountered further bad fortunes in the race when his car&#x27;s right rear tyre exploded at high speed, forcing his car into a 360° spin before resting on a tyre wall. He managed his fourth victory of the year at Hungary, and followed up the result with a second place in Belgium. Häkkinen retired from the following race held in Italy, due to a spin while leading the race. He finished further with fifth place at the European Grand Prix, and achieved a podium finish with third place in Malaysia. At the season finale held in Japan, Häkkinen took victory, which ensured he took enough points to win the 1999 World Championship, with 76 points, ahead of nearest rival Eddie Irvine. In November, Häkkinen was ranked seventh in the Reuters Sports Personality of the Year Poll scoring 46 out of a possible 260 points. He was also awarded his second consecutive Autosport International Racing Driver Award for 1999. In November, Häkkinen was announced as one of the seven men shortlisted for the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year. At the awards ceremony on 28 December, Häkkinen was awarded second place behind skier Mika Myllylä.

====2000====

For 2000, Häkkinen set himself new limits along with physical and psychological preparations for the upcoming season. He also believed that he along with Schumacher and Coulthard would be the key drivers of 2000. He endured a bad start: at the opening round in Australia, both McLaren cars retired with engine failure after completing less than half of the race distance; and in the following race in Brazil, Häkkinen was forced into retirement when his car&#x27;s oil pressure became problematic. However, this marked a turning point as Häkkinen took consecutive second-place finishes in the next two rounds, and later reached his first victory of the season in Spain.

Häkkinen finished in second position at the European Grand Prix, having traded the lead position with Schumacher throughout the race. He followed up the result by taking sixth place at Monaco, fourth in Canada and a podium finish with second position in France. The day after the French Grand Prix, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain at McLaren for 2001. Häkkinen won the following race held in Austria, although his team were stripped of constructors&#x27; points due to a missing seal on the electronic control unit in Häkkinen&#x27;s car. He took another podium finish with a second place in Germany, and later had another victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix where he took the lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from Schumacher. Häkkinen raced to his second consecutive victory in Belgium, which included a simultaneous pass on Schumacher and Ricardo Zonta in the &quot;Kemmel straight&quot;. Häkkinen later took second place in Italy, and retired with an engine failure in the United States. He rounded off the year with a second place in Japan where he conceded the World Championship to Schumacher, and held fourth position in the season closing race held in Malaysia.

====2001====

For 2001, Häkkinen pledged to make a challenge for the World Championship, citing inspiration from the birth of his son Hugo. He also added that he was under less pressure to compete, saying that results over the previous year increased his desire to win. The season started badly for Häkkinen, as he was forced into retirement in the opening round held in Australia due to a failure with his car&#x27;s suspension resulting in his car spinning violently into a tyre barrier. The McLaren cars were off the pace in Malaysia, with Häkkinen managing to end at the 6th place. He retired from the following race in Brazil when his car stalled on the starting grid, Further points came at the San Marino Grand Prix. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Häkkinen looked on course to win his first victory of the season, until the final lap of the race, when his car was hampered with a clutch failure and was classified ninth.

He suffered further consecutive retirements in Austria where he stalled his car on the starting grid, and Monaco where his car&#x27;s steering failed after fifteen laps of the race. At the following race held in Canada, Häkkinen took his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. He finished sixth at the European Grand Prix, and was unable to start the French Grand Prix as his car developed a gearbox problem. However, this marked a brief turning point for Häkkinen as he gained a victory in the British Grand Prix. He was forced into another retirement in Germany when his engine failed, later managing fifth position in Hungary and fourth place in Belgium.

Before the Italian Grand Prix, Häkkinen announced that he would be on a sabbatical for the 2002 season, citing the reason to spend more time with his family. His seat was taken by fellow countryman Kimi Räikkönen in 2002. Häkkinen later stated that fear after crashes during practice for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and the 2001 Australian Grand Prix as well as a loss of a desire to compete for race victories were factors. He was forced into another retirement during the race due to a gearbox issue. He raced to his final victory of his career in the United States despite incurring a grid penalty, and ended the season with a fourth-place finish in Japan. Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 37 points.

==Post-Formula One (2002–2004)==
In July 2002, nine months into his sabbatical, Häkkinen announced that he would be retiring from Formula One. It was later revealed that Häkkinen approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis during the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix and agreed a sabbatical, then returned to Monaco the following year to discuss and agree full-time retirement with Dennis. In October, Häkkinen made his first appearance as a commentator for pay-for-view channel Canal Digital at the United States Grand Prix.

In December 2002, it was announced that Häkkinen would be participating in the Finnish Rally Championship driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution WRC2 with his co-driver Arto Kapanen. He also stated that he would not move full-time into rallying and learn about driver control, although he later stated he would enter more rally events if he finished within the top two. Making his debut in the Arctic Rally, Häkkinen was delayed by four minutes as his team changed a tyre and eventually finished 30th. He once again entered the event in 2004 driving a Toyota Corolla with co-driver and finished seventh.

During 2004, rumors circulated that Häkkinen was making a possible return to Formula One to fill in the vacant Williams seat left by Juan Pablo Montoya. In May, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis dismissed the rumors, stating that Häkkinen was not prepared for a comeback. Häkkinen held talks with BAR and Williams and later decided against returning to Formula One saying in 2005: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to think that I would race a Formula One car again because as time passes my reactions become slower and my eyesight gets worse – that&#x27;s life&quot;.

==Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters==

===2005===
On 6 November 2004, it was announced that Häkkinen would make his debut in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series for the HWA Team in the 2005 season. He was partnered by Gary Paffett, Jean Alesi and Bernd Schneider. Häkkinen had previous experience of driving touring cars in July 2001 at the Brno Circuit alongside Schneider. In January, Häkkinen once again participated in the Arctic Rally driving a Toyota Corolla with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen. Häkkinen retired when he slid off the road on the eleventh stage.

His debut season started well: He secured eighth position in his first race at the Hockenheimring; and in the following race at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz, held his first podium in his DTM career. Two weeks later at Spa-Francorchamps, Häkkinen qualified on pole position and later took his first DTM win after only three starts. Despite the early success, he did not score points in the next three races which included consecutive retirements at Oschersleben and the Norisring. He later scored a further points position at the race held at the Nürburgring, before further consecutive 12th-place finishes in the next two races. Häkkinen ended the 2005 season by taking a second-place finish at Istanbul Park and finished outside of the points scoring positions with 15th place at Hockenheim. Häkkinen finished the season fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 30 points.

===2006===

On 15 November 2005, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain with HWA for the 2006 season, and was partnered by Alesi, Spengler and Jamie Green. For the upcoming season, Häkkinen set his target of winning the championship, although he believed the competition from Audi would make the title challenge difficult. Outside of DTM, Häkkinen participated in his fourth Arctic Rally, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen. He finished 36th overall.

His season got off well: At the opening race held at Hockenheim, he finished in fourth position; and in the following race held at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz, he drove to his first podium of the season with third place. Häkkinen did not score points in the next two consecutive races, although he later held another podium position with third place at the Norisring. In the next three races, he was unable to score more points, although he had another podium position at the Bugatti Circuit. Häkkinen concluded his season with a retirement at the Hockenheimring when his car&#x27;s diffuser became damaged. Häkkinen ended the year sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 25 points.

In November, Häkkinen tested a McLaren MP4-21 for one day at the Circuit de Catalunya where he completed 79 laps. To prepare himself, Häkkinen spent time at the McLaren Technology Centre to acquaint himself with Formula One&#x27;s revised regulations. In a 2017 retrospective interview Häkkinen revealed that he had been in advanced talks with McLaren for a return in the 2007 season. He had however been frustrated by problems with McLaren&#x27;s car in the test, which had reminded him of the reasons why he had taken the sabbatical in the first place, so the plans had collapsed.

===2007===

On 28 January 2007, it was announced that Häkkinen would remain in DTM for the 2007 season for HWA, and was partnered by Spengler, Green and Schneidler. Häkkinen stated that during 2006, his team&#x27;s potential was not realised and aimed during 2007 to improve on his results. He started the season by earning consecutive finishes in the first two races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions. At the third race of the season held at EuroSpeedway Lausitz, Häkkinen won his first race of the season although only half points were awarded due to errors made by race organisers, resulting in the official race result remaining provisional. He held pole for the following race at Brands Hatch where he finished in fourth position, and followed the result with a ninth-place finish at the Norisring.

Häkkinen had his second victory of the season at Mugello, after starting from 15th position. He later managed 7th place at Zandvoort and later finished with a 10th-place finish at the Nürburgring. At the race held at the Circuit de Catalunya, Häkkinen was involved in a collision with Audi driver Martin Tomczyk. Häkkinen was penalised with a €20,000 fine, received a ten-place grid penalty for the next round and was disqualified from the race. He finished the season with a 17th-place finish at the Hockenheimring. Häkkinen finished the season 7th place in the Championship, with 22 points.

==Retirement (2008–present)==

Häkkinen announced his retirement from competitive motorsport in November 2007. He was quoted as saying that the decision &quot;was not an easy one&quot;, but added that &quot;racing is still in my blood and this decision does not mean that this will prevent me from racing for pleasure&quot;.

In November 2008, it was announced that Häkkinen would start a new career in driver management and would work alongside in his firm Aces Associate Group. Häkkinen contested his fifth Arctic Rally event in January 2009 driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX alongside co-driver Ilkka Kivimaki and finished 19th overall. Häkkinen made his debut in sports cars when Team AMG China entered a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG in November 2011 to participate in the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup at the 6 Hours of Zhuhai race alongside Lance David Arnold and Cheng Congfu. During the event, the team retired after completing two hours. In October 2013, Häkkinen participated in the GT Asia series for the two races held at the Zhuhai International Circuit, driving a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG 300 alongside co-driver Matthew Solomon. Häkkinen drove to victory in the first race after starting from sixth position. The victory resulted in a 15-second handicap during his mandatory pitstop for his second race and finished in fourth position.

On 16 March 2017, McLaren announced that Häkkinen has rejoined the team as partner ambassador. In November 2021, Häkkinen helped McLaren IndyCar driver Pato O&#x27;Ward prepare for his test of the McLaren MCL35M by familiarizing O&#x27;Ward on his championship winning MP4/13 around Laguna Seca.

In August 2019, Häkkinen raced in the 2019 Suzuka 10 Hours, the fourth round of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge driving a McLaren 720S GT3 alongside two-time Super Formula champion Hiroaki Ishiura and Japanese Formula 3 racer Katsuaki Kubota, with Planex Smacam Racing.

Häkkinen and Emma Kimiläinen competed together for Team Finland at the Race of Champions on 5–6 February 2022. He is set to again compete in the race in 2023 alongside Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas, who was originally going to be his partner at the 2022 edition before backing out.

In December 2021, Häkkinen was announced as a Formula One analyst for the sports broadcaster Viaplay. From 2022 onwards, Häkkinen became part of a permanent team of analysts on-site at the Grands Prix. In the team of analysts, Häkkinen is accompanied by David Coulthard and Jos Verstappen.

==Driving style and personality==
Journalist Peter Windsor analysed Häkkinen&#x27;s driving style for an article in &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine, writing that Häkkinen was an &quot;oversteering&quot; driver, which made him faster on slippery surfaces and meant that &quot;tail-happy&quot; cars suited him. This allowed him to perform better at circuits that have medium-speed corners. During his karting career, Häkkinen developed the habit of using the brake pedal with his left foot. He reverted to using his right foot when he participated in DTM, but became uncomfortable with this style and switched again to left-foot braking in mid-2006. He became known as a &quot;late season driver&quot;; the second half of a season suited Häkkinen due to experience on these tracks and allowed time for his car to be altered towards his preference.

Häkkinen was criticized for being a poor car developer, though this may have been exaggerated due to his initial struggles with the English language early in his career. Adrian Newey, the designer of Häkkinen&#x27;s championship-winning McLarens, described an instance of Häkkinen&#x27;s approach to input on car development when Häkkinen kept telling him during the initial testing of the McLaren MP4/13 that the car was understeering. Newey subsequently adjusted the car to correct for understeer, but this only made it slower. After digging deeper into the test data and listening closely to what Häkkinen was describing Newey realized the car was not understeering but had rear end biased instability on corner entry that Häkkinen was compensating for with understeer. This experience proved crucial for Newey&#x27;s relationship with Häkkinen during their run together at McLaren, as after that Newey no longer had issues understanding Häkkinen&#x27;s inputs on car development. Newey said that Häkkinen&#x27;s countryman, protege, and future McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen had a similar approach to input on car development.

During his Formula One career, Häkkinen was regarded as taciturn, taking lengthy pauses before giving terse responses to questions. Since his retirement, he has often been voted among the greatest Formula One drivers. Michael Schumacher has stated that Häkkinen was the driver whom he gained the most satisfaction of racing against.

==Personal life==
Häkkinen has lived in Monaco since 1991. He also owns properties in France and Finland. On 18 May 2008, his newly completed mansion in France was burned down after a light in one of his trophy cabinets short circuited. No injuries were reported, although Häkkinen&#x27;s collection of Formula One trophies was destroyed.

Häkkinen married Erja Honkanen, a former TV journalist, in 1998. The couple have one son and one daughter. They divorced in 2008. Häkkinen also has two daughters and a son with his Czech second wife Markéta Remešová.

Häkkinen joined Johnnie Walker as Global Responsible Drinking Ambassador for Diageo in September 2006, campaigning for the message of responsible drinking. He also led the organisation&#x27;s Join the Pact campaign to spread consumer commitments for the prevention of drunk driving. He is also brand ambassador for Mercedes-Benz and UBS. In 2016, he became an official brand ambassador for Nokian Tyres.

<text>A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a major cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic selling and underlying economic factors. They often follow speculation and economic bubbles.

A stock market crash is a social phenomenon where external economic events combine with crowd psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: a prolonged period of rising stock prices (a bull market) and excessive economic optimism, a market where price–earnings ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of margin debt and leverage by market participants. Other aspects such as wars, large corporate hacks, changes in federal laws and regulations, and natural disasters within economically productive areas may also influence a significant decline in the stock market value of a wide range of stocks. Stock prices for corporations competing against the affected corporations may rise despite the crash.

There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to declines of over 10% in a stock market index over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets (periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years) as crashes include panic selling and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Crashes are often associated with bear markets; however, they do not necessarily occur simultaneously. Black Monday (1987), for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble occurred over several years without any notable crashes. Stock market crashes are not common.

Crashes are generally unexpected. As Niall Ferguson stated, &quot;Before the crash, our world seems almost stationary, deceptively so, balanced, at a set point. So that when the crash finally hits – as inevitably it will – everyone seems surprised. And our brains keep telling us it’s not time for a crash.&quot;

==Examples==
===Tulip Mania===
Tulip Mania (1634–1637), in which some single tulip bulbs allegedly sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled artisan, is often considered to be the first recorded economic bubble.

===Panic of 1907=== 

In 1907 and in 1908, stock prices fell by nearly 50% due to a variety of factors, led by the manipulation of copper stocks by the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Shares of United Copper rose gradually up to October, and thereafter crashed, leading to panic. Several investment trusts and banks that had invested their money in the stock market fell and started to close down. Further bank runs were prevented due to the intervention of J. P. Morgan. The panic continued to 1908 and led to the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.

===Wall Street Crash of 1929===
The economy grew for most of the Roaring Twenties. It was a technological golden age, as innovations such as the radio, automobile, aviation, telephone, and the electric power transmission grid were deployed and adopted. Companies that had pioneered these advances, including Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and General Motors, saw their stocks soar. Financial corporations also did well, as Wall Street bankers floated mutual fund companies (then known as investment trusts) like the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation. Investors were infatuated with the returns available in the stock market, especially by the use of leverage through margin debt (i.e., borrowing money from your stockbroker to finance part of your purchase of stocks, using the bought securities as collateral).

On August 24, 1921, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was at 63.9. By September 3, 1929, it had risen more than sixfold to 381.2. It did not regain this level for another 25 years. By the summer of 1929, it was clear that the economy was contracting, and the stock market went through a series of unsettling price declines. These declines fed investor anxiety, and events came to a head on October 24, 28, and 29 (known respectively as Black Thursday, Black Monday, and Black Tuesday).

On Black Monday, the DJIA fell 38.33 points to 260, a drop of 12.8%. The deluge of selling overwhelmed the ticker tape system that normally gave investors the current prices of their shares. Telephone lines and telegraphs were clogged and were unable to cope. This information vacuum only led to more fear and panic. The technology of the New Era, previously much celebrated by investors, now served to deepen their suffering.

The following day, Black Tuesday, was a day of chaos. Forced to liquidate their stocks because of margin calls, overextended investors flooded the exchange with sell orders. The Dow fell 30.57 points to close at 230.07 on that day. The glamour stocks of the age saw their values plummet. Across the two days, the DJIA fell 23%.

By the end of the weekend of November 11, 1929, the index stood at 228, a cumulative drop of 40% from the September high. The markets rallied in succeeding months, but it was a temporary recovery that led unsuspecting investors into further losses. The DJIA lost 89% of its value before finally bottoming out in July 1932. The crash was followed by the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis of modern times, which plagued the stock market and Wall Street throughout the 1930s.

===October 19, 1987===

The mid-1980s were a time of strong economic optimism. From August 1982 to its peak in August 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose from 776 to 2722. The rise in market indices for the 19 largest markets in the world averaged 296% during this period. The average number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange rose from 65 million shares to 181 million shares.

The crash on October 19, 1987, Black Monday, was the climactic culmination of a market decline that had begun five days before on October 14. The DJIA fell 3.81% on October 14, followed by another 4.60% drop on Friday, October 16. On Black Monday, the DJIA plummeted 508 points, losing 22.6% of its value in one day. The S&amp;P 500 Index dropped 20.4%, falling from 282.7 to 225.06. The NASDAQ Composite lost only 11.3%, not because of restraint on the part of sellers, but because the NASDAQ market system failed. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts during the day. The NASDAQ market fared much worse. Because of its reliance on a &quot;market making&quot; system that allowed market makers to withdraw from trading, liquidity in NASDAQ stocks dried up. Trading in many stocks encountered a pathological condition where the bid price for a stock exceeded the ask price. These &quot;locked&quot; conditions severely curtailed trading. On October 19, trading in Microsoft shares on the NASDAQ lasted a total of 54 minutes.

The crash was the greatest single-day loss that Wall Street had ever suffered in continuous trading up to that point. Between the start of trading on October 14 to the close on October 19, the DJIA lost 760 points, a decline of over 31%.

In October 1987, all major world markets crashed or declined substantially. The FTSE 100 Index lost 10.8% on that Monday and a further 12.2% the following day. The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of 23 major industrial countries, 19 had a decline greater than 20%.

Despite fears of a repeat of the Great Depression, the market rallied immediately after the crash, posting a record one-day gain of 102.27 the very next day and 186.64 points on Thursday, October 22. It took only two years for the Dow to recover completely; by September 1989, the market had regained all of the value it had lost in the 1987 crash. The DJIA gained 0.6% during calendar year 1987.

No definitive conclusions have been reached on the reasons behind the 1987 Crash. Stocks had been in a multi-year bull run and market price–earnings ratios in the U.S. were above the post-war average. The S&amp;P 500 was trading at 23 times earnings, a postwar high and well above the average of 14.5 times earnings. Herd behavior and psychological feedback loops play a critical part in all stock market crashes but analysts have also tried to look for external triggering events. Aside from the general worries of stock market overvaluation, blame for the collapse has been apportioned to such factors as program trading, portfolio insurance and derivatives, and prior news of worsening economic indicators (i.e. a large U.S. merchandise trade deficit and a falling U.S. dollar, which seemed to imply future interest rate hikes).

One of the consequences of the 1987 Crash was the introduction of the circuit breaker or trading curb on the NYSE. Based upon the idea that a cooling-off period would help dissipate panic selling, these mandatory market shutdowns are triggered whenever a large pre-defined market decline occurs during the trading day.

===2007–2008 financial crisis===
 
On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of Merrill Lynch along with a liquidity crisis of American International Group, all primarily due to exposure to packaged subprime loans and credit default swaps issued to insure these loans and their issuers, rapidly devolved into a global crisis. This resulted in several bank failures in Europe and sharp reductions in the value of stocks and commodities worldwide. The failure of banks in Iceland resulted in a devaluation of the Icelandic króna and threatened the government with bankruptcy. Iceland obtained an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in November. In the United States, 15 banks failed in 2008, while several others were rescued through government intervention or acquisitions by other banks. On October 11, 2008, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the world financial system was teetering on the &quot;brink of systemic meltdown&quot;.

The economic crisis caused countries to close their markets temporarily.

On October 8, the Indonesian stock market halted trading, after a 10% drop in one day.

&quot;The Times&quot; of London reported that the meltdown was being called the &quot;Crash of 2008&quot;, and older traders were comparing it with Black Monday in 1987. The fall that week of 21% compared to a 28.3% fall 21 years earlier, but some traders were saying it was worse. &quot;At least then it was a short, sharp, shock on one day. This has been relentless all week.&quot; Other media also referred to the events as the &quot;Crash of 2008&quot;.

From October 6–10, 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed lower in all five sessions. Volume levels were record-breaking. The DJIA fell over 1,874 points, or 18%, in its worst weekly decline ever on both a points and percentage basis. The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 20%. The week also set 3 top ten NYSE Group Volume Records with October 8 at #5, October 9 at #10, and October 10 at #1.

Having been suspended for three successive trading days (October 9, 10, and 13), the Icelandic stock market reopened on 14 October, with the main index, the OMX Iceland 15, closing at 678.4, which was about 77% lower than the 3,004.6 at the close on October 8. This reflected that the value of the three big banks, which had formed 73.2% of the value of the OMX Iceland 15, had been set to zero.

On October 24, 2008, many of the world&#x27;s stock exchanges experienced the worst declines in their history, with drops of around 10% in most indices. In the U.S., the DJIA fell 3.6%, although not as much as other markets. The United States dollar and Japanese yen soared against other major currencies, particularly the British pound and Canadian dollar, as world investors sought safe havens. Later that day, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charlie Bean, suggested that &quot;This is a once in a lifetime crisis, and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history.&quot;

By March 6, 2009, the DJIA had dropped 54% to 6,469 from its peak of 14,164 on October 9, 2007, over a span of 17 months, before beginning to recover.

===COVID-19 pandemic (2020)===

During the week of February 24–28, 2020, stock markets dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally. The FTSE 100 dropped 13%, while the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Index dropped 11–12% in the biggest downward weekly drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

On Monday, March 9, 2020, after the launch of the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the FTSE and other major European stock market indices fell by nearly 8%. Asian markets fell sharply and the S&amp;P 500 Index dropped 7.60%. The Italian FTSE MIB fell 2,323.98 points, or 11.17%.

On March 12, 2020, a day after US President Donald Trump announced a travel ban from Europe, stock prices again fell sharply. The DJIA declined 9.99% – the largest daily decline since Black Monday (1987) – despite the Federal Reserve announcing it would inject $1.5 trillion into money markets. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq each dropped by approximately 9.5%. The major European stock market indexes all fell over 10%.

On March 16, 2020, after it became clear that a recession was inevitable, the DJIA dropped 12.93%, or 2,997 points, the largest point drop since Black Monday (1987), surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.32%, and the S&amp;P 500 Index dropped 11.98%.

By the end of May 2020, the stock market indices briefly recovered to their levels at the end of February 2020.

In June 2020 the Nasdaq surpassed its pre-crash high followed by the S&amp;P 500 in August and the Dow in November.

==Mathematical theory==
===Random walk theory===
The conventional assumption is that stock markets behave according to a random log-normal distribution. This implies that the expected volatility is the same all the time. Among others, mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot suggested as early as 1963 that the statistics prove this assumption incorrect. Mandelbrot observed that large movements in prices (i.e. crashes) are much more common than would be predicted from a log-normal distribution. Mandelbrot and others suggested that the nature of market moves is generally much better explained using non-linear analysis and concepts of chaos theory. This has been expressed in non-mathematical terms by George Soros in his discussions of what he calls reflexivity of markets and their non-linear movement. George Soros said in late October 1987, &#x27;Mr. Robert Prechter&#x27;s reversal proved to be the crack that started the avalanche&#x27;.

===Self-organized criticality===
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that there is evidence that the frequency of stock market crashes follows an inverse cubic power law. This and other studies such as Didier Sornette&#x27;s work suggest that stock market crashes are a sign of self-organized criticality in financial markets.

===Lévy flight===
In 1963, Mandelbrot proposed that instead of following a strict random walk, stock price variations executed a Lévy flight. A Lévy flight is a random walk that is occasionally disrupted by large movements. In 1995, Rosario Mantegna and Gene Stanley analyzed a million records of the S&amp;P 500 Index, calculating the returns over a five-year period. Researchers continue to study this theory, particularly using computer simulation of crowd behavior, and the applicability of models to reproduce crash-like phenomena.

===Result of investor imitation===
In 2011, using statistical analysis tools of complex systems, research at the New England Complex Systems Institute found that the panics that lead to crashes come from a dramatic increase in imitation among investors, which always occurred during the year before each market crash. When investors closely follow each other&#x27;s cues, it is easier for panic to take hold and affect the market. This work is a mathematical demonstration of a significant advance warning sign of impending market crashes.

==Trading curbs and trading halts==
One mitigation strategy has been the introduction of trading curbs, also known as &quot;circuit breakers&quot;, which are a trading halt in the cash market and the corresponding trading halt in the derivative markets triggered by the halt in the cash market, all of which are affected based on substantial movements in a broad market indicator. Since their inception after Black Monday (1987), trading curbs have been modified to prevent both speculative gains and dramatic losses within a small time frame.

===United States===
There are three thresholds, which represent different levels of decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index: 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3).
* If Threshold Level 1 (a 7% drop) is breached before 3:25pm, trading halts for a minimum of 15 minutes. At or after 3:25 pm, trading continues unless there is a Level 3 halt.
* If Threshold Level 2 (a 13% drop) is breached before 1 pm, the market closes for two hours. If such a decline occurs between 1 pm and 2 pm, there is a one-hour pause. The market would close for the day if stocks sank to that level after 2 pm
* If Threshold Level 3 (a 20% drop) is breached, the market would close for the day, regardless of the time.

===France===
For the CAC 40 stock market index in France, daily price limits are implemented in cash and derivative markets. Securities traded on the markets are divided into three categories according to the number and volume of daily transactions. Price limits for each security vary by category. For instance, for the most liquid category, when the price movement of a security from the previous day&#x27;s closing price exceeds 10%, trading is suspended for 15 minutes. If the price then goes up or down by more than 5%, transactions are again suspended for 15 minutes. The 5% threshold may apply once more before transactions are halted for the rest of the day. When such a suspension occurs, transactions on options based on the underlying security are also suspended. Further, when stocks representing more than 35% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index are halted, the calculation of the CAC40 Index is suspended and the index is replaced by a trend indicator. When stocks representing less than 25% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index are halted, trading on the derivative markets are suspended for half an hour or one hour, and additional margin deposits are requested.

<text>Chaïm Soutine (; ; ; 13 January 1893 – 9 August 1943) was a French painter of Belarusian-Jewish origin of the School of Paris, who made a major contribution to the Expressionist movement while living and working in Paris.

Inspired by classic painting in the European tradition, exemplified by the works of Rembrandt, Chardin and Courbet, Soutine developed an individual style more concerned with shape, color, and texture than representation, which served as a bridge between more traditional approaches and the developing form of Abstract Expressionism.

==Early life==

Soutine was born Chaim-Iche Solomonovich Sutin, in Smilavichy (Yiddish: סמילאָוויץ, romanized: Smilovitz) in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). He was Jewish and the 10th of 11 children born to parents Zalman (also reported as Solomon and Salomon) Moiseevich Sutin (1858–1932) and Sarah Sutina (née Khlamovna) (died in 1938). From 1910 to 1913 he studied in Vilnius at a small art Academy. In 1913, with his friends Pinchus Kremegne and Michel Kikoine, he emigrated to Paris, where he studied at the under Fernand Cormon. He soon developed a highly personal vision and painting technique.

==Early life and arrival in Paris==

=== La Ruche and Montparnasse ===
For a time, he and his friends lived at La Ruche, a residence for struggling artists in Montparnasse in Paris. Since 1900, the Montparnasse district, popularized by Apollinaire, had supplanted Montmartre as the epicenter of an intellectual and artistic life in Paris. It was the meeting place of writers, painters, sculptors, and actors, often struggling financially, who exchanged and created art and literature whilst sitting and chatting in cafes.

La Ruche — whose rotunda stands on Dantzig Passage in the 15th arrondissement, not far from Montparnasse, a cosmopolitan commune where painters and sculptors from all over, many from Eastern Europe — rented small studios at a low cost. There, Soutine encountered, among others, Archipenko, Zadkine, Brancusi, Chapiro, Kisling, Epstein, Chagall, Nina Niss-Goldman, Chana Orloff, as well as Lipchitz who introduced Amadeo Modigliani to Soutine.

The two became friends. Modigliani painted Soutine&#x27;s portrait several times, most famously in 1917, on a door of an apartment belonging to Léopold Zborowski, who was their art dealer. Until he acquired his own studio, he slept and worked at various places, specifically at Krémègne and Kikoïne&#x27;s, fellow Jewish painters of the School of Pairs. His poverty was such he even slept in stairways and on benches.

Upon his arrival in Paris, Soutine eagerly immersed himself in his exploration of the French capital. &quot;In a filthy hole like Smilovitchi,&quot; he claimed, where, he also said, they are unaware of the existence of a piano, &quot;one cannot imagine that there are cities like Paris, or music like that of Bach.&quot; As soon as he has a few pennies in his pocket, he would spend them in order to &quot;immerse himself&quot; in music at Colonne or Lamoureux concerts, with a preference for Baroque music. He haunted the galleries of the Louvre, either hugging the walls or jumping at the slightest approach, and contemplated for hours his favorite painters: &quot;If he loves Fouquet, Raphael, Chardin, and Ingres, it is especially in the works of Goya and Courbet, and more than any other, in those of Rembrandt, that Soutine recognizes himself.&quot; Chana Orloff recounted that, seized by a &quot;respectful fear&quot; in front of a Rembrandt, he could also go into ecstasy and exclaim, &quot;It&#x27;s so beautiful that it drives me mad!&quot;.

Soutine took French lessons, often in the back of La Rotonde, managed at the time by Victor Libion. Libion, who acted as a sort of artists&#x27; patron, allowed artists to warm up from the cold in La Rotonde and discuss for hours without requiring them to make additional purchases. After learning French, Soutine — an avid reader of Russian novels — also began to enthusiastically read and immerse himself in French literature, reading Balzac, Baudelaire, and Rimbaud, and later, Montaigne.

Zborowski supported Soutine through World War I, taking the struggling artist with him to Nice to escape the possible German invasion of Paris.

== The Interwar period ==
After the war Paul Guillaume, a highly influential art dealer, began to champion Soutine&#x27;s work. In 1923, in a showing arranged by Guillaume, the prominent American collector Albert C. Barnes, bought 60 of Soutine&#x27;s paintings on the spot. Soutine, who had been virtually penniless in his years in Paris, immediately took the money, ran into the street, hailed a Paris taxi, and ordered the driver to take him to Nice, on the French Riviera, more than 400 miles away.

=== Céret ===
Soutine lived for several years in Le Midi, initially between Vence and Cagnes-sur-Mer; he then abandoned the French Riviera for the Pyrénées-Orientales in 1919, specifically for Céret. Regardless of his frequent trips to Paris—particularly in October 1919 to obtain his identity card, mandatory for foreigners—he changed residences and studios several times. One of his places of residence was the Maison Laverny, 5 rue de l&#x27;hôpital (rue Pierre Rameil). There Soutine was nicknamed by the locals as &quot;el pintre brut&quot; (&quot;the dirty painter&quot;), due to his miserable living conditions on allowances from Zborowski.

During a visit to Le Midi, Zborowski wrote to a friend regarding Soutine: &quot;He gets up at three in the morning, walks twenty kilometers loaded with canvases and colors to find a site he likes, and goes back to bed forgetting to eat. But he unfastens his canvas and, having spread it on the one from the day before, he falls asleep next to it&quot; Soutine indeed only owned one canvas. The locals took pity at times and at times sympathized with the painter. Soutine painted portraits of the locals, in his works alluding to certain famous series such as those of men in prayer or pastry chefs and café boys, whom he represented facing forward, their working hands often disproportionately depicted. Between 1920 and 1922, he painted around 200 canvases there.

Although Soutine eventually grew to dislike the place and the works he created there, this period is generally considered a key stage in the evolution of his art. Soutine&#x27;s art at the period is no longer hesitant; here, he &quot;inject[ed] his own emotions into the subjects and figures of his paintings.&quot; Especially, he imparted extreme deformations to the landscapes, carrying them away in a &quot;rotary movement&quot; already perceived by Waldemar-George in still lifes: under the pressure of internal forces that seem to compress them, the forms spring forth twisting, and the masses rise &quot;as if caught in a maelstrom&quot; as described by Jover.

==== Carcass paintings ====
Soutine once horrified his neighbors by keeping an animal carcass in his studio so that he could paint it (&quot;Carcass of Beef&quot;). The stench drove them to send for the police, whom Soutine promptly lectured on the relative importance of art over hygiene. There is a story that Marc Chagall saw the blood from the carcass leak out onto the corridor outside Soutine&#x27;s room, and rushed out screaming, &quot;Someone has killed Soutine.&quot; Soutine painted 10 works in this series, which have since become his most well-known. His carcass paintings such as &quot;The Flayed Ox&quot; were inspired by Rembrandt&#x27;s still life of the same subject, &quot;Slaughtered Ox&quot;, which he discovered while studying the Old Masters in the Louvre.

Soutine produced the majority of his works from 1920 to 1929. From 1930 to 1935, the interior designer Madeleine Castaing and her husband welcomed him to their summer home, the mansion of Lèves, becoming his patrons, so that Soutine could hold his first exhibition in Chicago in 1935. He seldom showed his works, but he did take part in the important exhibition &quot;The Origins and Development of International Independent Art&quot; held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in 1937 in Paris, where he was at last hailed as a great painter.

==== Between Paris and Le Midi ====
By 1926, five of Soutine&#x27;s paintings were sold at Drouot for amounts ranging from 10,000 to 22,000 francs. However, this did not prevent him from boycotting the opening in June 1927 of the first exhibition of his works by Henri Bing in Bing&#x27;s gallery on Rue La Boétie. On the other hand, he reportedly eagerly accepted the opportunity to create set designs for a ballet by Diaghilev—a project that never materialized due to the sudden death of the impresario in 1929.

==German invasion==
Soon afterwards France was invaded by German troops. As a Jew, Soutine had to escape from the French capital and hide to avoid arrest by the Gestapo. From the beginning of 1941, he moved from one place to another and was sometimes forced to seek shelter in forests, sleeping outdoors. Leaving his companion Marie-Berthe Aurenche&#x27;s home on Littré Street, he sought refuge on Rue des Plants, where she had friends, the painter Marcel Laloë and his wife. Fearing denunciation by their caretaker, they later assisted in the couple&#x27;s escape, with fake documents, to a village in Indre-et-Loire, Champigny-sur-Veude. Expelled from several inns where their untidiness or Marie-Berthe&#x27;s outbursts were criticized, the couple eventually found a house for rent on the way to Chinon, where friends discreetly visited them.

There, despite intense stomach pains that soon forced him to subsist solely on porridge, the painter resumed his work, supplied with canvases and colors by the painter Marcel Laloë. The landscapes from the years 1941-1942 seem to have abandoned warm tones, such as the &quot;Landscape of Champigny&quot;. &quot;The Big Tree&quot; painted in Richelieu strained Soutine&#x27;s relationship with the Castaings as he reduced the canvas size before delivering it to them. However, he also tackled new and lighter subjects like &quot;The Pigs&quot; or &quot;The Return from School after the Storm&quot;. He also created portraits of children and more serene maternity scenes.

==Illness and death==
Suffering from a stomach ulcer and bleeding badly, Soutine left a safe hiding place for Paris for emergency surgery, which failed to save his life. On 9 August 1943, he died of a perforated ulcer. He was interred in Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris.

==Legacy==

In February 2006, an oil painting of his controversial and iconic series &quot;Le Bœuf Écorché&quot; (1924) sold for a record £7.8 million ($13.8 million) to an anonymous buyer at a Christie&#x27;s auction held in London—after it was estimated to fetch £4.8 million. In February 2007, a 1921 portrait of an unidentified man with a red scarf (&quot;L&#x27;Homme au Foulard Rouge&quot;) sold for $17.2 million—a new record—at Sotheby&#x27;s London auction house.

One of the beef paintings, known as &quot;Le bœuf&quot;, circa 1923, was sold for $1 million in 2004 and resold six months later for twice that price to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Heirs of the first seller sued to have the painting returned, claiming the price was unfairly low, and a complex settlement in 2009 required the painting to be transferred to them. In May 2015, &quot;Le Bœuf&quot; achieved a record price for the artist of $28,165,000 at the Christie&#x27;s curated auction &quot;Looking forward to the past&quot;.

Roald Dahl placed him as a character in his 1952 short story &quot;Skin&quot;.

The Jewish Museum in New York has presented major exhibitions of Soutine&#x27;s work in &quot;An Expressionist in Paris: The Paintings of Chaim Soutine&quot; (1998) and &quot;Chaim Soutine: Flesh&quot; (2018).

In 2020, Soutine&#x27;s painting &quot;Eva&quot; became a symbol of pro-democracy protests in Belarus.

== Artistic style ==
&quot;Expression is in the touch&quot; declared Soutine, meaning expression is found in the movement in the rhythm and the passion applied by the pencil against the surface of the canvas. It is said Soutine rapidly moved from linear and rigid drawing of his still life in order to discover &quot;his true element, the touch of color and its sinuous bending&quot;.

<text>Max Jacob (; 12 July 1876 – 5 March 1944) was a French poet, painter, writer, and critic.
==Life and career==

After spending his childhood in Quimper, Brittany, he enrolled in the Paris Colonial School, which he left in 1897 for an artistic career. He was one of the first friends Pablo Picasso made in Paris. They met in the summer of 1901, and it was Jacob who helped the young artist learn French. Later, on the Boulevard Voltaire, he shared a room with Picasso, who remained a lifelong friend (and was represented as the monk in his painting &quot;Three Musicians&quot;, which Picasso painted in 1921). Jacob introduced him to Guillaume Apollinaire, who in turn introduced Picasso to Georges Braque. He would become close friends with Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Christopher Wood and Amedeo Modigliani, who painted his portrait in 1916. He also befriended and encouraged the artist Romanin, otherwise known as French politician, and future Resistance leader Jean Moulin. Moulin&#x27;s famous &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Max is presumed to be selected in honor of Jacob.

Jacob, who was Jewish, claimed to have had a vision of Christ in 1909, and converted to Catholicism. He was hopeful that this conversion would alleviate his homosexual tendencies.

Max Jacob is regarded as an important link between the symbolists and the surrealists, as can be seen in his prose poems &quot;Le cornet à dés&quot; (&quot;The Dice Box&quot;, 1917 – the 1948 Gallimard edition was illustrated by Jean Hugo) and in his paintings, exhibitions of which were held in New York City in 1930 and 1938.

His writings include the novel &quot;Saint Matorel&quot; (1911), the free verses &quot;Le laboratoire central&quot; (1921), and &quot;La défense de Tartuffe&quot; (1919), which expounds his philosophical and religious attitudes.

The famous psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan attributed the quote &quot;The truth is always new&quot; to Jacob.

==Death==
Having moved outside Paris in May 1936, to settle in Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire, Loiret, Max Jacob was arrested on 24 February 1944 by the Gestapo, and interned at Orléans prison (prisoner #15872). Jewish by birth, Jacob&#x27;s brother Gaston had been previously arrested in January 1944, and deported to the concentration camp Auschwitz along with their sister Myrthe-Lea; her husband was also deported by the Nazis at this time. A cousin, Andrée Jacob, survived by living under an assumed name and worked in the Resistance movement Noyautage des administrations publiques. Following his incarceration at Orléans, Max was then transferred to Drancy internment camp from where he was to be transported in the next convoy to Auschwitz. However, said to be suffering from bronchial pneumonia, Max Jacob died on 5 March in the infirmary of La Cité de la Muette, a former housing block which served as the internment camp known as Drancy.

First interred in Ivry after the war ended, his remains were transferred in 1949 by his artist friends Jean Cassou and René Iché (who sculpted the tomb of the poet) to the cemetery at Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire in the Loiret département.

==Pseudonyms==
As well as his &quot;nom d&#x27;état civil&quot;, or regular name, Jacob worked under at least two pseudonyms, Léon David and Morven le Gaëlique.

==In popular culture==
German actor Udo Kier plays Jacob in the 2004 film &quot;Modigliani&quot;. In the 2006 film &quot;Monsieur Max&quot;, which deals with the life of Jacob from the First World War until his death, he was played by Jean-Claude Brialy; this was Brialy&#x27;s last film. In the 2013 Spanish film , Jacob is played by Lionel Abelanski.
T. R. Knight portrays Jacob in the 2018 season of the television series &quot;Genius&quot;, which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.

<doc id="63077" wikidata="Q13405082" url="?curid=63077" title="Stock market bubble">
<text>A stock market bubble is a type of economic bubble taking place in stock markets when market participants drive stock prices above their value in relation to some system of stock valuation.

Behavioral finance theory attributes stock market bubbles to cognitive biases that lead to groupthink and herd behavior. Bubbles occur not only in real-world markets, with their inherent uncertainty and noise, but also in highly predictable experimental markets. Other theoretical explanations of stock market bubbles have suggested that they are rational, intrinsic, and contagious.

== History ==

Historically, early stock market bubbles and crashes have their roots in financial activities of the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the birthplace of the first formal (official) stock exchange and market in history. The Dutch tulip mania, of the 1630s, is generally considered the world&#x27;s first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble).

== Examples ==
Two famous early stock market bubbles were the Mississippi Scheme in France and the South Sea bubble in England. Both bubbles came to an abrupt end in 1720, bankrupting thousands of unfortunate investors. Those stories, and many others, are recounted in Charles Mackay&#x27;s 1841 popular account, &quot;&quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;.&quot;

The two most famous bubbles of the twentieth century, the bubble in American stocks in the 1920s just before the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression, and the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, were based on speculative activity surrounding the development of new technologies. The 1920s saw the widespread introduction of a range of technological innovations including radio, automobiles, aviation and the deployment of electrical power grids. The 1990s was the decade when Internet and e-commerce technologies emerged—many of which had minimal sales and earnings profiles. 

Other stock market bubbles of note include the Encilhamento occurred in Brazil during the late 1880s and early 1890s, the Nifty Fifty stocks in the early 1970s, Taiwanese stocks in 1987–89 and Japanese stocks in the late 1980s.

Stock market bubbles frequently produce hot markets in initial public offerings, since investment bankers and their clients see opportunities to float new stock issues at inflated prices. These hot IPO markets misallocate investment funds to areas dictated by speculative trends, rather than to enterprises generating longstanding economic value. Typically when there is an over abundance of IPOs in a bubble market, a large portion of the IPO companies fail completely, never achieve what is promised to the investors, or can even be vehicles for fraud.

== Whether rational or irrational ==
Emotional and cognitive biases (see behavioral finance) seem to be the causes of bubbles, but often, when the phenomenon appears, pundits try to find a rationale, so as not to be against the crowd. Thus, sometimes, people will dismiss concerns about overpriced markets by citing a new economy where the old stock valuation rules may no longer apply. This type of thinking helps to further propagate the bubble whereby everyone is investing with the intent of finding a greater fool. Still, some analysts cite the wisdom of crowds and say that price movements really do reflect rational expectations of fundamental returns. Large traders become powerful enough to rock the boat, generating stock market bubbles.

To sort out the competing claims between behavioral finance and efficient markets theorists, observers need to find bubbles that occur when a readily available measure of fundamental value is also observable. The bubble in closed-end country funds in the late 1980s is instructive here, as are the bubbles that occur in experimental asset markets. According to the efficient-market hypothesis, this doesn&#x27;t happen, and so any data is wrong. For closed-end country funds, observers can compare the stock prices to the net asset value per share (the net value of the fund&#x27;s total holdings divided by the number of shares outstanding). For experimental asset markets, observers can compare the stock prices to the expected returns from holding the stock (which the experimenter determines and communicates to the traders).

In both instances, closed-end country funds and experimental markets, stock prices clearly diverge from fundamental values. Nobel laureate Dr. Vernon Smith has illustrated the closed-end country fund phenomenon with a chart showing prices and net asset values of the in 1989 and 1990 in his work on price bubbles. At its peak, the Spain Fund traded near $35, nearly triple its Net Asset Value of about $12 per share. At the same time the Spain Fund and other closed-end country funds were trading at very substantial premiums, the number of closed-end country funds available exploded thanks to many issuers creating new country funds and selling the IPOs at high premiums.

It only took a few months for the premiums in closed-end country funds to fade back to the more typical discounts at which closed-end funds trade. Those who had bought them at premiums had run out of &quot;greater fools&quot;. For a while, though, the supply of &quot;greater fools&quot; had been outstanding.

== Positive feedback ==
A rising price on any share will attract the attention of investors. Not all of those investors are willing or interested in studying the intrinsics of the share and for such people the rising price itself is reason enough to invest. In turn, the additional investment will provide buoyancy to the price, thus completing a positive feedback loop.

Like all dynamic systems, financial markets operate in an ever-changing equilibrium, which translates into price volatility. However, a self-adjustment (negative feedback) takes place normally: when prices rise more people are encouraged to sell, while fewer are encouraged to buy. This puts a limit on volatility. However, once positive feedback takes over, the market, like all systems with positive feedback, enters a state of increasing disequilibrium. This can be seen in financial bubbles where asset prices rapidly spike upwards far beyond what could be considered the rational &quot;economic value&quot;, only to fall rapidly afterwards.

==Effect of incentives==
Investment managers, such as stock mutual fund managers, are compensated and retained in part due to their performance relative to peers. Taking a conservative or contrarian position as a bubble builds results in performance unfavorable to peers. This may cause customers to go elsewhere and can affect the investment manager&#x27;s own employment or compensation. The typical short-term focus of U.S. equity markets exacerbates the risk for investment managers that do not participate during the building phase of a bubble, particularly one that builds over a longer period of time. In attempting to maximize returns for clients and maintain their employment, they may rationally participate in a bubble they believe to be forming, as the benefits outweigh the risks of not doing so.

<doc id="63078" wikidata="Q261846" url="?curid=63078" title="Tsuguharu Foujita">
<text>was a Japanese–French painter. After having studied Western-style painting in Japan, Foujita traveled to Paris, where he encountered the international modern art scene of the Montparnasse neighborhood and developed an eclectic style that borrowed from both Japanese and European artistic traditions.

With his unusual fashion and distinctive figurative style, Foujita reached the height of his fame in 1920s Paris. His watercolor and oil works of nudes, still lifes, and self-portraits were a commercial success and he became a notable figure in the Parisian art scene.

Foujita spent three years voyaging through South and North America before returning to Japan in 1933, documenting his observations in sketches and paintings. Upon his return home, Foujita became an official war artist during World War II, illustrating battle scenes to raise the morale of the Japanese troops and citizens. His oil paintings won him acclaim during the war, but the public&#x27;s view of him turned negative in the wake of the Japanese defeat.

Without significant prospects in the post-WWII Japanese art scene, Foujita returned to France in 1950, where he would spend the rest of his life. He received French nationality in 1955 and converted to Catholicism in 1959. His latter years were spent working on the frescoes for a small, Romanesque chapel in Reims that he had constructed. He died in 1968, not long after the chapel officially opened.

In France, Foujita is remembered as part of the années folles of the 1920s, but public opinion of him in Japan remains mixed due to his monumental depictions of the war. Recent retrospective exhibitions organized since 2006 in Japan have sought to establish Foujita&#x27;s place in Japanese twentieth-century art history.

== Biography ==

=== Early life in Japan and career beginnings: 1886-1913 ===
Foujita was born in 1886 in Ushigome, a former ward of Tokyo that is now part of the Shinjuku Ward. He was the son of Fujita Tsuguakira Fujita, an Army Medical Director. Two years after his birth, the family moved to Kumamoto, on the island of Kyushu. Following the premature death of his mother and his father&#x27;s subsequent remarriage, the family moved back to Tokyo in 1892.

Foujita developed an interest in painting in primary school and as an adolescent decided to become a painter. When he was fourteen, one of Foujita&#x27;s watercolors was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris as one of the representative artworks by Japanese middle schoolers.

Foujita began studying French as a high schooler and hoped to study in France after finishing school. However, his father, after consulting with his friend Ōgai Mori, a surgeon and novelist who had previously lived in Germany, encouraged him to continue his studies in fine art in Japan. He enrolled in 1905 at what is now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and studied under Seiki Kuroda, who taught &quot;yōga,&quot; western-style painting. He also took courses on &quot;nihonga&quot;, Japanese-style painting, led by Seihō Takeuchi and Gyokushō Kawabata.

Foujita met his first wife, Tomiko Tokita, a school teacher, during a voyage to Chiba Prefecture during which he realized a number of paintings for his diploma, including the artist&#x27;s first-known first self-portrait. The two married in 1911.

Foujita graduated in 1910. He exhibited in 1910 as part of the Salon Hakuba-Kai (White Horse Association), organized by Seiki Kuroda, which sought to popularize &quot;yōga&quot;  with the Japanese public, and later at the first two exhibitions organized by Tokyo Kangyo, a structure that promoted art and industry. However, his paintings were refused for three consecutive years at the salon Bunten, an annual exhibition organized by the Ministry of Education. Foujita&#x27;s paintings at this time—before he moved to France—were often signed &quot;Fujita&quot;, rather than the francized &quot;Foujita&quot; which he later adopted.

Unsure of his personal style and never having lost sight of his dream to travel to Paris, Foujita decided to leave in 1913, when he was 27 years old. It was decided that he would receive an annuity from his father for three years, so that the artist would return to his home and his wife in Japan at the age of 30.

=== Arrival in Paris: 1913-1917 ===

Foujita moved to Paris in 1913, at a time when foreign artists flourished, hoping to develop their artistic sensibilities and gain recognition in the European art capital. He settled in Montparnasse, and quickly became part of the eclectic art scene there that, lacking a clear style or discipline, later became known as the &quot;École de Paris&quot; (School of Paris). He moved into the artists&#x27; residences at Bateau-Lavoir. He quickly made friends with the Japanese painter , who had many connections in the Paris art scene, as they shared a studio. Foujita also developed a friendship with photographer Shinzo Fukuhara, who piqued Foujita&#x27;s interest in photography.

While many Japanese artists who came to Paris tended to live amongst themselves and struggled to adjust to the Parisian lifestyle, Foujita made great efforts to adapt to his new surroundings. He began signing his paintings with the French-looking spelling of his name, Foujita, rather than Fujita, and improved his French language skills. He also distinguished himself from many of his Japanese confrères, who sought to affirm their mastery of oil paint, as Foujita worked primarily in watercolor.
His network soon included artists of many nationalities. After moving his studio to the Cité Falguière, he met painters Amedeo Modigliani and Chaim Soutine, he took dance classes with Raymond Duncan, and he visited the studios of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera. This fruitful encounter, during which Foujita discovered cubism, led to his acquaintance with Guillaume Apollinaire, Georges Braques, Fernand Léger, Erik Satie, Kees van Dongen, Jean Metzinger, André Derain and Pierre Bonnard. His visit to Picasso&#x27;s studio introduced him to the &quot;naïve&quot; style of Henri Rousseau, as Picasso owned one of Rousseau&#x27;s works and had it hanging on his wall.

1914 marked the outbreak of World War I and the beginning of a complicated period for Foujita. Many foreign artists left Paris to fight in the war. Most Japanese artists also chose to return home. However, after having purchased a plot of land on the outskirts of Paris where they built a modest home, Foujita and Kawashima decided to stay. In the coming months, the two artists would work as volunteers, alongside sculptor Ossip Zadkine, for the Red Cross. In September, they returned to their home to find it destroyed. Additionally, Foujita had a financially difficult time because his father was no longer able to send him his annuity due to the war.

Following the departure of Kawashima for Tokyo in 1915, Foujita moved to London in January 1916. During this period, Foujita ended his relationship with his wife Tomiko. He also informed his father that he no longer needed financial support and would be staying indefinitely in Europe. Foujita returned to Paris in early 1917. In March, he met Fernande Barrey, who had been a model for Modigliani, in the Café de la Rotonde. Thirteen days later, Foujita and Fernande were married.

=== Artistic development and success: 1917-1930 ===

Fernande was instrumental in the artist&#x27;s first professional success in Paris. A few weeks after marrying Foujita, she showed the art dealer Georges Chéron some of Foujita&#x27;s drawings. Chéron went to Foujita&#x27;s studio and bought all the works he was shown. She also secured an arrangement between Foujita and the Galerie Chéron, where he had his first solo exhibitions. His first solo show, in which he presented 110 of his water colors, was a great success. The artist began exhibiting more frequently in Paris and in 1920 became a member of the Salon d&#x27;Automne. 

This success coincided with the arrival of the Roaring Twenties in Paris, a time of relative economic prosperity that fueled a strong art market and thriving nightlife. Foujita was a regular at popular clubs and events, immediately recognizable thanks to his signature bowl-cut and round glasses.

Foujita&#x27;s production in the early 1920s began to concentrate into three distinct genres: self portraits, interior scenes (including many still lives), and nudes. There was great interest in Foujita&#x27;s style, which was often perceived as marrying &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; elements in an original manner.

Japanese artists in Paris who practiced Western-style painting were generally described by contemporary critics as simple copyists, or, in the words of André Warnod, &quot;wanting to be European at all costs&quot;. Yet, Foujita was deemed the exception to this rule. Warnod states that Foujita &quot;knew how to look with his own eyes and paint according to his temperament, without worrying too much about others&quot;: compared to other Japanese painters, Foujita was seen as having &quot;personality&quot;. Art historian Asato Ikeda has argued that &quot;in contrast to other Japanese artists in the city, Fujita [targeted] his paintings to French audiences by successfully negotiating the artistic heritage of his country and making something original from the perspective of European art history&quot;.

Foujita&#x27;s works in the late 1910s incorporated a blend of styles. From the beginning of his stay in Paris, Foujita took advantage of his proximity to the Louvre to study artists such as Raphael, Rembrandt, and Leonardo da Vinci. In 1917, Foujita began drawing figures in a highly stylized manner, often in profile, which appear to draw on both medieval primitive painting, as well as Amadeo Modigliani&#x27;s simplified portraits. The artist, heavily inspired by Italian painting, also depicted Christian themes like the Virgin and Child and the Crucifixion of Christ. These themes would soon disappear from Foujita&#x27;s oeuvre, but they later dominated his artistic production from 1951 onwards.

His works were appreciated as the harmonious meeting of Japanese and European aesthetics. One such painting, &quot;Reclining Nude with Toile de Jouy&quot;, for which French model Kiki de Montparnasse posed, was met with great success at the 1922 Salon d&#x27;Automne. This work referenced the classical genre of the nude, as well as more recent French examples like Edouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot;. He drew inspiration from &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; artists such as Suzuki Harunobu and Kitagawa Utamaro, who left their female figures&#x27; skin uncolored, though he painted the Black artists&#x27; model and performer Aïcha Goblet in a more Cubist style. Foujita wrote that the objective of his nudes was to &quot;represent the quality of the most beautiful material there is: that of human skin&quot;.

Foujita received an important Parisian commission in the late 1920s that showcased his capacity to create in the Japanese artistic tradition. Painted at the Cercle de l&#x27;Union Interalliée, an exclusive social and dining club, it features two &quot;kachō-ga&quot;, or bird and flower painting panels created in a &quot;yamato-e&quot; style.

In 1922, Foujita met Lucie Badoul, who he called &quot;Youki&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;snow&quot;, and she became one of his models. In 1924, he divorced Fernande, and in 1929, he married Youki. Around the time of his marriage to Youki, Foujita was having serious financial woes. He had been living a luxurious life of celebrity in Paris but he had not been paying taxes since 1925. Now, the tax authorities caught up with him and demanded full payment. Foujita left for Japan with Youki, hoping he might be able to recoup his losses by exhibiting there. Foujita&#x27;s reception in Japan was mixed. The general public packed his first one-man show there, and his works sold well, but the critics panned him as a mediocre artist imitating Western style. Foujita returned to France via the United States, travelling to Hawai&#x27;i, San Francisco, and New York. While in New York, he learned about the Wall Street Crash. He once again briefly returned to New York to organize a one-man exhibition at the Paul Reinhardt Gallery, but the show was not successful.

=== Travels, 1930-1933 ===

When Foujita returned to Paris in 1930, he was still short on funds, and shared a place with Robert Desnos who he had met in 1928. During this time, Foujita experimented with painting in a more surrealist style. By 1931, Youki and Desnos had become a couple, and Foujita, who continued to have problems with his back taxes and suffered bankruptcy left for South America with Madeleine Lequeux, a former dancer known as Mady Dormans who worked at the Casino de Paris.

Foujita and Madeleine traveled together to Brazil, staying in Rio de Janeiro for four months. During this time, they met Ismael Nery, who painted Foujita&#x27;s portrait. After Brazil, they then went to Argentina. His exhibition in Buenos Aires was very successful and he stayed for five months. Afterwards, they traveled to Bolivia, Peru, and Cuba.

Foujita then went to Mexico, arriving in November 1932, where he would stay for seven months. Foujita found himself inspired by the Mexican Mural Movement, led by Diego Rivera, whom he had befriended in Paris. Impressed by the collaborative effort undertaken by the government and local artists, Foujita, as art historian Asato Ikeda describes, &quot;claimed that art should not be produced just for wealthy individuals but also for the masses and the general public. In other words, his trip to South America made him aware of the social and political roles that large public art could play.&quot;  

He also visited the artist Tamiji Kitagawa at his home in Taxco. Foujita had learned about Kitagawa through an exhibit of his student&#x27;s plein-air works that had traveled through Europe. Foujita was so impressed by Kitagawa&#x27;s students&#x27; works that he had sixty of the canvases brought back to Japan for an exhibition that was held in 1936. After his visit to Mexico, Foujita traveled through the Southwest of the United States, and then went on to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where he continued to exhibit and be treated as a celebrity.

=== Return to Japan and war painting: 1933-1949 ===

Foujita returned to Japan with Madeleine at the end of 1933. Madeleine found the transition to Japanese culture difficult. In February 1935, she went back to Paris, but returned a year later. In June 1936, she unexpectedly died. Soon afterwards, Foujita married his fifth wife, Kimiyo Horiuchi.
During this time, Foujita&#x27;s paintings began to be dominated by classical Japanese subjects, such as geisha, sumo wrestlers, and fishermen. His watercolors and oils received negative press when they were exhibited at the 21st Salon Nika in 1934. Critics felt as if his vision of Japan was old-fashioned and resembled that of a foreigner, with one critic noting that &quot;the people and the scenes represented by this painter are not from the living and current Japan, but worn-out remnants from the past&quot;. Foujita&#x27;s taste for bygone Japan was further confirmed in 1937 when he constructed a traditional Japanese home.

1937 marked the beginning of the second Sino-Japanese war. Foujita sought to contribute to the war effort by the war on the front, and these civilian volunteers formed the Association of War Artists of Imperial Japan. In 1938, Foujita began working with the Imperial Navy Information Office establishment as a war artist and created his first war painting (&quot;sensō ga&quot;), &quot;Nanchang Airport Fire.&quot;

In April 1939, the army reorganized the Association of War Artists of Imperial Japan as the Army Art Association, which commissioned monumental war paintings under the supervision of a new chairman, Matsui Iwane, who was an active military officer. Foujita and his fellow artist, Saburō Miyamoto were prominent members, and in 1943 Foujita became vice-chairman. In spite of his strong connections with the Army Art Association, Foujita decided to return to Paris in April 1939. He and Kimiyo stayed there for slightly more than a year, leaving France and returning to Japan in May 1940 after the German invasion of Belgium.

Upon return to Tokyo, Foujita dedicated himself as an artist supporting the war effort.
He became the nation&#x27;s leading war artists during World War II, creating a prolific number of war paintings and overseeing special exhibits for the military.
He received important commissions, like the &quot;Battle of Nomonhan,&quot; painted in 1941, a monumental painting measuring nearly 1.5 x 4.5 meters. Despite the painting&#x27;s depiction of one of the largest military defeats the Japanese had experienced up to that time, it focuses on glorifying the bravery of the Japanese soldiers.

Masaaki Ozaki divides Foujita&#x27;s wartime production into two periods: the paintings of the first period, like &quot;Battle of Nomonhan,&quot; were supposed to document the war and boost the morale of troops. The second period, however, was a time in which the Japanese were experiencing more defeat than victory. The Japanese people began to lose confidence and the war effort became more desperate. The sources for Foujita&#x27;s paintings were not the battlefields themselves, but his imagination, resulting in shocking dramatic compositions that Ozaki compares to representations of hell found in classical Japanese painting. Art historian Aya Louise McDonald also points out that his compositions were further enriched by Foujita&#x27;s knowledge of 19th-century French painting in the Louvre.

His most famous painting from this period is &quot;Last Stand at Attu,&quot; completed in August 1943, which depicts a battle against American troops on the Aleutian Islands. Rather than surrendering to the Americans, the Japanese soldiers remaining in battle killed themselves. The work received visceral responses from viewers, who wept or prayed in front of it, as if it were an altar. Foujita made paintings in a similar vein to &quot;Last Stand at Attu&quot; until the war&#x27;s end in 1945.

Following Japan&#x27;s defeat, the Allied Powers in Japan made an effort to collect all war paintings to be sent to the United States, with Foujita&#x27;s help. The paintings have never been officially &quot;returned&quot; to Japan, but they were placed on &quot;indefinite loan&quot; to the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, which received the paintings from 1970 to 1977.

Foujita received much public criticism after the war in Japan. He defended himself by asserting that artists were pacifists in nature, but the Japan Art Association (&quot;Nihon Bijutsu-kai&quot;) listed him as an artist responsible for the war in 1946. Although Foujita&#x27;s name did not appear on the list of war criminals published by the General Headquarters in 1947, his reputation suffered, partly due to using his art to serve as propaganda for the Imperial Japanese military and his refusal to confront accusations about his role as a war artist. The American poet Harry Roskolenko tried to support Foujita by putting on an exhibit of his paintings at the Kennedy and Company Galleries in New York, but none of the paintings were sold. Foujita and Roskolenko blamed Yasuo Kuniyoshi, who described Foujita as a fascist, imperialist, and expansionist. Ultimately, Foujita decided to leave Japan definitively.

=== Time in America and final years in France: 1949-1968 ===
Foujita was able to get a visa to the United States with the help of Henry Sugimoto and took up a teaching position at the Brooklyn Museum Art School in March 1949. Foujita put on another show, but was once more labelled a fascist by artists, including Ben Shahn, who organized a demonstration against him. His paintings of the time reflect a nostalgia for Paris. Unhappy and unwelcome in New York, Foujita sought to return to Paris and once his visa was granted, Foujita and Kimiyo moved back to France in January 1950. Foujita declared that he would never leave again.

The couple moved to Montparnasse where Foujita began painting street scenes that he called &quot;Paris Landscapes&quot;. He briefly became involved with costume design, creating the &quot;Japanese&quot; outfits for the May 1951 performance of Madame Butterfly at La Scala, and did illustrations for a book by In 1954, Foujita married Kimiyo. They gained French nationality in 1955, renouncing their Japanese nationality, and Foujita was made an officer of the Legion of Honor by the French state in 1957. The couple converted to Catholicism and were baptised in Reims Cathedral on 14 October 1959, with René Lalou, the head of the Mumm Champagne House, and Françoise Taittinger as his godfather and godmother. Foujita took the Christian name of Léonard.

After his conversion in 1959, Foujita dedicated most of his production to the creation of religious subjects. In 1962, Foujita created a plan to construct and decorate his own chapel, as Matisse had done before him. Foujita hoped that the structure, named the Chapel of Our Lady of Peace and built with the help of Lalou&#x27;s funding, would symbolize the completion of his career. As it turned out, the chapel would also be the artist&#x27;s final project. From 1963 until its opening to the public in 1966, he designed almost every aspect of the structure, decorating the interior with frescoes of biblical scenes, many of which illustrated the life of Christ.

Only a few months after the opening of the chapel, Foujita was diagnosed with cancer. He died on January 29, 1968, in Zürich, Switzerland. He was first interred in the chapel, but Kimiyo had his body transferred to the Cimetière de Villiers-le-Bâcle, near her. In 2003, his coffin was reinterred at the Foujita Chapel under the flagstones in the position he originally intended when constructing the chapel.

== Legacy and collections ==

After the war, Foujita had a reputation in Japan as a war criminal. Writing in 1972, the artist Kikuhata Mokuma published an essay in the art magazine &quot;Bijutsu techō&quot; that skewered the artist as a truly mad and deeply narcissistic artist, who took great pleasure in depicting death, concluding, however, that Foujita was only one of many responsible for the horrors of the war. Foujita&#x27;s reputation, and his place in Japanese twentieth-century art history, remains a contested subject in Japan today. A successful retrospective of his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, in 2006, entitled &quot;Léonard Foujita: Non-Japanese Who Fascinated Paris,&quot; and others have followed, indicating the will of Japanese museums to engage with Foujita&#x27;s oeuvre. The 2006 retrospective, organized at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, featured five war paintings in an effort to address his war responsibility.

In France, Foujita remains associated primarily with the &quot;École de Paris&quot; and the années folles of the roaring twenties. He is known for his lighthearted and dainty subjects: Parisian streetscapes, cats, voluptuous women, everyday objects. An important exhibition of his work at the Musée Maillol in 2018, &quot;Foujita: peindre dans les années folles&quot; [Foujita: Painting in the Roaring Twenties], focused on his production before his return to Japan.

An exhibition presenting the ensemble of Foujita&#x27;s work, including his wartime production, was organized by the Centre Pompidou and the Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo in 1980, but was canceled at the last minute. In 2019, the exhibition &quot;Foujita 1886-1968. Oeuvres d&#x27;une vie&quot; [&quot;Foujita 1886-1968. A life&#x27;s work&quot;] organized at the Musée de la culture du Japon in Paris and based on the exhibition &quot;Foujita: A Retrospective&quot;, shown at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum in 2018, presented for the first time in France an overview of Foujita&#x27;s sixty years of artistic production. It included two of the artists&#x27; war paintings, shown for the first time outside of Japan, permitting the French public to understand Foujita&#x27;s career beyond his years in Montparnasse.

In 1990, Kimiyo Foujita donated the home she shared with the artist to the Conseil départemental de l&#x27;Essonne, so that Foujita&#x27;s atelier could become a museum, the Maison-Atelier Foujita. In Japan, Foujita&#x27;s works can be found in the Artizon Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, with more than 100 in the Hirano Masakichi Art Museum in Akita. His works are also part of major French collections, such as those of the Centre Pompidou, the Musée d&#x27;art moderne de la Ville de Paris, and Paris&#x27; Fonds d&#x27;art contemporain. Further works can also be found at the Musée d&#x27;art moderne et contemporain of Strasbourg, the Musée de Grenoble, and the Musée de la Piscine in Roubaix. Foujita&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s donated some of his works and writings to the Musée des beaux-arts of Reims in 2012.

<text>Léon-Paul Fargue (, 4 March 187624 November 1947) was a French poet and essayist.

He was born in Paris, France, on rue Coquilliére. As a poet he was noted for his poetry of atmosphere and detail. His work spanned numerous literary movements. Before he reached 19 years of age, Fargue had already published in &quot;L&#x27;Art littéraire&quot; in 1894 and his important poem &quot;Tancrède&quot; appeared in the magazine &quot;Pan&quot; in 1895.

As an opponent of the surrealists, he became a member of the Symbolist poetry circle connected with &quot;Le Mercure de France.&quot; Rilke, Joyce and others declared that Fargue was at the very forefront of modern poetry.

He was also a poet of Paris, and later in his career he published two books about the city, &quot;D&#x27;après Paris&quot; (1931) and &quot;Le piéton de Paris&quot; (1939). His earliest work is divided between Paris prowlings and intimate scenes of childhood and nature.

He was a great social lion in the literary scene of Paris in the 1920s and 30s. Walter Benjamin (who called Fargue &quot;the greatest living poet in France&quot;) met him on a visit to the city in January 1930, and recounted an evening enlivened by charisma, wit, and incomparable storytelling. Fargue related to Benjamin the story of a dinner he held for Proust, his old friend, and James Joyce – the only time the two met.

&quot;Fargue&quot;, wrote Leon-Pierre Quint in November 1929, &quot;is one of those people who write as they speak; he constantly utters works that remain unwritten-perhaps from indolence, perhaps from contempt for writing. An endless sequence of unforced flashes of wit and puns-this was the only way he was capable of speaking. He has a childlike love of Paris, with its godforsaken little cafes, its bars, its streets, and its nightlife that never ends. He must be in robust health and have a highly resilient character. During the day he works as an industrialist, and at night he is always on the move. He is constantly seen with elegant women, Americans. He is close to fifty years of age, yet leads the life of a gigolo by night, hypnotizing everyone he meets with the charm of his speech.&quot;

Fargue published a book of recollections about his friend, the composer Ravel. He was a member of the Apaches and remained a lifelong friend of Ravel. One of his poems, &quot;Rêves&quot;, was set to music by Ravel in 1927.

He died in Paris in 1947 and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse. Federico Mompou dedicated No. 12 of his &quot;Cançons i Danses&quot; to Fargue&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="63082" wikidata="Q1004322" url="?curid=63082" title="Market trend">
<text>A market trend is a perceived tendency of the financial markets to move in a particular direction over time. Analysts classify these trends as &quot;secular&quot; for long time-frames, &quot;primary&quot; for medium time-frames, and &quot;secondary&quot; for short time-frames. Traders attempt to identify market trends using technical analysis, a framework which characterizes market trends as predictable price tendencies within the market when price reaches support and resistance levels, varying over time.

A future market trend can only be determined in hindsight, since at any time prices in the future are not known. Past trends are identified by drawing lines, known as trendlines, that connect price action making higher highs and higher lows for an uptrend, or lower lows and lower highs for a downtrend.


==Market terminology==
The terms &quot;bull market&quot; and &quot;bear market&quot; describe upward and downward market trends, respectively, and can be used to describe either the market as a whole or specific sectors and securities. The terms come from London&#x27;s Exchange Alley in the early 18th century, where traders who engaged in naked short selling were called &quot;bear-skin jobbers&quot; because they sold a bear&#x27;s skin (the shares) before catching the bear. This was simplified to &quot;bears,&quot; while traders who bought shares on credit were called &quot;bulls.&quot; The latter term might have originated by analogy to bear-baiting and bull-baiting, two animal fighting sports of the time. Thomas Mortimer recorded both terms in his 1761 book &quot;Every Man His Own Broker&quot;. He remarked that bulls who bought in excess of present demand might be seen wandering among brokers&#x27; offices moaning for a buyer, while bears rushed about devouring any shares they could find to close their short positions. An unrelated folk etymology supposes that the terms refer to a bear clawing downward to attack and a bull bucking upward with its horns.

==Secular trends==
A secular market trend is a lasting long-term trend that lasts 5 to 25 years and consists of a series of primary trends. A secular bear market consists of smaller bull markets and larger bear markets; a secular bull market consists of larger bull markets and smaller bear markets.

In a secular bull market, the prevailing trend is &quot;bullish&quot; or upward-moving. The United States stock market was described as being in a secular bull market from about 1983 to 2000 (or 2007), with brief upsets including Black Monday and the Stock market downturn of 2002, triggered by the crash of the dot-com bubble. Another example is the 2000s commodities boom.

In a secular bear market, the prevailing trend is &quot;bearish&quot; or downward-moving. An example of a secular bear market occurred in gold from January 1980 to June 1999, culminating with the Brown Bottom. During this period, the market price of gold fell from a high of $850/oz ($30/g) to a low of $253/oz ($9/g). The stock market was also described as being in a secular bear market from 1929 to 1949.

==Primary trends==

A primary trend has broad support throughout the entire market, across most sectors, and lasts for a year or more.

===Bull market===
A bull market is a period of generally rising prices. The start of a bull market is marked by widespread pessimism. This point is when the &quot;crowd&quot; is the most &quot;bearish&quot;. The feeling of despondency changes to hope, &quot;optimism&quot;, and eventually euphoria as the bull runs its course. This often leads the economic cycle, for example, in a full recession, or earlier.

Generally, bull markets begin when stocks rise 20% from their low and end when stocks experience a 20% drawdown. However, some analysts suggest a bull market cannot happen within a bear market.

An analysis of Morningstar, Inc. stock market data from 1926 to 2014 revealed that, on average, a typical bull market lasted 8.5 years with a cumulative total return averaging 458%. Additionally, annualized gains for bull markets ranged from 14.9% to 34.1%.

====Examples====
:India&#x27;s Bombay Stock Exchange Index, BSE SENSEX, experienced a major bull market trend from April 2003 to January 2008. It increased from 2,900 points to 21,000 points, representing a more than 600% return in 5 years.
:Notable bull markets characterized the 1925–1929, 1953–1957, and 1993–1997 periods when the U.S. and many other stock markets experienced significant growth. While the first period ended abruptly with the start of the Great Depression, the end of the later time periods were mostly periods of soft landing, which became large bear markets. (see: Recession of 1960–61 and the dot-com bubble in 2000–2001)

===Bear market===

A bear market is a general decline in the stock market over a period of time. It involves a transition from high investor optimism to widespread investor fear and pessimism. One generally accepted measure of a bear market is a price decline of 20% or more over at least a two-month period.

A decline of 10% to 20% is classified as a correction.

Bear markets conclude when stocks recover, reaching new highs. The bear market is then assessed retrospectively from the recent highs to the lowest closing price, and its recovery period spans from the lowest closing price to the attainment of new highs. Another commonly accepted indicator of the end of a bear market is indices gaining 20% or more from their low.

From 1926 to 2014, the average duration of a bear market was 13 months, accompanied by an average cumulative loss of 30%. Annualized declines for bear markets ranged from −19.7% to −47%.

====Examples====
Some examples of a bear market include:
* The Wall Street Crash of 1929, which erased 89% (from 386 to 40) of the Dow Jones Industrial Average&#x27;s market capitalization by July 1932, marking the start of the Great Depression. After regaining nearly 50% of its losses, a longer bear market from 1937 to 1942 occurred in which the market was again cut in half. 
* A long-term bear market occurred from about 1973 to 1982, encompassing the 1970s energy crisis and the high unemployment of the early 1980s. 
* A bear market occurred in India following the 1992 Indian stock market scam committed by Harshad Mehta.
* The Stock market downturn of 2002.
* As a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, a bear market occurred between October 2007 and March 2009. 
* The 2015 Chinese stock market crash. 
* In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused multiple stock market crashes, leading to bear markets across the world.
* In 2022, concerns over an inflation surge and potential rises of the federal funds rate caused a bear market.

===Market top===
A market top (or market high) is usually not a dramatic event. The market has simply reached the highest point that it will, for some time. This identification is retrospective, as market participants are generally unaware of it when it occurs. Thus prices subsequently fall, either slowly or more rapidly.

According to William O&#x27;Neil, since the 1950s, a market top is characterized by three to five distribution days in a major stock market index occurring within a relatively short period of time. Distribution is identified as a decline in price with higher volume than the preceding session.

====Examples====
The peak of the dot-com bubble, as measured by the NASDAQ-100, occurred on March 24, 2000, when the index closed at 4,704.73. The Nasdaq peaked at 5,132.50 and the S&amp;P 500 Index at 1525.20.

The peak of the U.S. stock market before the financial crisis of 2007–2008 occurred on October 9, 2007. The S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 1,565 and the NASDAQ at 2,861.50.

===Market bottom===
A market bottom marks a trend reversal, signifying the end of a market downturn and the commencement of an upward-moving trend (bull market).

Identifying a market bottom, often referred to as &#x27;bottom picking,&#x27; is a challenging task, as it&#x27;s difficult to recognize before it passes. The upturn following a decline may be short-lived, and prices might resume their descent, resulting in a loss for the investor who purchased stocks during a misperceived or &#x27;false&#x27; market bottom.

Baron Rothschild is often quoted as advising that the best time to buy is when there is &#x27;blood in the streets&#x27;—that is, when the markets have fallen drastically and investor sentiment is extremely negative.

====Examples====

Some more examples of market bottoms, in terms of the closing values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) include:
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a bottom at 1,738.74 on October 19, 1987, following a decline from 2,722.41 on August 25, 1987. This day is commonly referred to as Black Monday (chart).
* A bottom of 7,286.27 was reached on the DJIA on October 9, 2002, following a decline from 11,722.98 on January 14, 2000. This decline included an intermediate bottom of 8,235.81 on September 21, 2001 (a 14% change from September 10), leading to an intermediate top of 10,635.25 on March 19, 2002 (chart). Meanwhile, the &quot;tech-heavy&quot; Nasdaq experienced a more precipitous fall, declining 79% from its peak of 5,132 on March 10, 2000, to its bottom of 1,108 on October 10, 2002.
*A bottom of 6,440.08 (DJIA) on 9 March 2009 was reached after a decline associated with the subprime mortgage crisis starting at 14164.41 on 9 October 2007 (chart).

==Secondary trends==
Secondary trends are short-term changes in price direction within a primary trend, typically lasting for a few weeks or a few months.

===Bear market rally===
Similarly, a bear market rally, sometimes referred to as a &#x27;sucker&#x27;s rally&#x27; or &#x27;dead cat bounce&#x27;, is characterized by a price increase of 5% or more before prices fall again. Bear market rallies were observed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, leading down to the market bottom in 1932, and throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Japanese Nikkei 225 has had several bear-market rallies between the 1980s and 2011, while undergoing an overall long-term downward trend.

==Causes of market trends==
The price of assets, such as stocks, is determined by supply and demand. By definition, the market balances buyers and sellers, making it impossible to have &#x27;more buyers than sellers&#x27; or vice versa, despite the common use of that expression. During a surge in demand, buyers are willing to pay higher prices, while sellers seek higher prices in return. Conversely, in a surge in supply, the dynamics are reversed.

Supply and demand dynamics vary as investors attempt to reallocate their investments between asset types. For instance, investors may seek to move funds from government bonds to &#x27;tech&#x27; stocks, but the success of this shift depends on finding buyers for the government bonds they are selling. Conversely, they might aim to move funds from &#x27;tech&#x27; stocks to government bonds at another time. In each case, these actions influence the prices of both asset types.

Ideally, investors aim to use market timing to buy low and sell high, but in practice, they may end up buying high and selling low. Contrarian investors and traders employ a strategy of &#x27;fading&#x27; investors&#x27; actions—buying when others are selling and selling when others are buying. A period when most investors are selling stocks is known as distribution, while a period when most investors are buying stocks is known as accumulation.

&quot;According to standard theory, a decrease in price typically leads to less supply and more demand, while an increase in price has the opposite effect. While this principle holds true for many assets, it often operates in reverse for stocks due to the common mistake made by investors—buying high in a state of euphoria and selling low in a state of fear or panic, driven by the herding instinct. In cases where an increase in price leads to an increase in demand, or a decrease in price leads to an increase in supply, the expected negative feedback loop is disrupted, resulting in price instability. This phenomenon is evident in bubbles or market crashes.

==Market sentiment==
Market sentiment is a contrarian stock market indicator.

When an extremely high proportion of investors express a bearish (negative) sentiment, some analysts consider it to be a strong signal that a market bottom may be near. David Hirshleifer observes a trend phenomenon that follows a path starting with under-reaction and culminating in overreaction by investors and traders.

Indicators that measure investor sentiment may include:

* The Investor Intelligence Sentiment Index evaluates market sentiment through the Bull-Bear spread (% of Bulls − % of Bears). A close-to-historic-low spread may signal a bottom, indicating a potential market turnaround. Conversely, an extreme high in bullish sentiment and an extreme low in bearish sentiment may suggest a market top or an imminent occurrence. This contrarian measure is more reliable for coincidental timing at market lows than at market tops.
* The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) sentiment indicator is often interpreted to suggest that the majority of the decline has already occurred when it gives a reading of minus 15% or below.
* Other sentiment indicators include the Nova-Ursa ratio, the Short Interest/Total Market Float, and the put/call ratio.

<doc id="63083" wikidata="Q187765" url="?curid=63083" title="Henry Miller">
<text>Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American novelist, short story writer and essayist. He broke with existing literary forms and developed a new type of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, stream of consciousness, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism. His most characteristic works of this kind are &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, &quot;Black Spring&quot;, &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;, and the trilogy &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot;, which are based on his experiences in New York City and Paris (all of which were banned in the United States until 1961). He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.

==Early life==
Miller was born at his family&#x27;s home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller. As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg. As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his &quot;quondam idol&quot; was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison). He attended the City College of New York for one semester.

==Career==

===Brooklyn, 1917–1930===
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917; their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923. Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919. They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920 to 1924, as personnel manager in the messenger department. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, &quot;Clipped Wings&quot;. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;. A study of twelve Western Union messengers, &quot;Clipped Wings&quot; was characterized by Miller as &quot;a long book and probably a very bad one.&quot;

In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance-hall ingénue who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage-name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time. They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924. In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing. He later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, his failures, his friends, his philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s second novel, &quot;&quot;, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by his wife Juliet (June). A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller&#x27;s work each week, pretending it was hers. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller&#x27;s death. &quot;Moloch&quot; is based on Miller&#x27;s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. A third novel written around this time, &quot;Crazy Cock&quot;, also went unpublished until after Miller&#x27;s death. Initially titled &quot;Lovely Lesbians&quot;, &quot;Crazy Cock&quot; (along with his later novel &quot;Nexus&quot;) told the story of June&#x27;s close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later. Kronski committed suicide around 1930.

===Paris, 1930–1939===
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman. One day on a Paris street, Miller met another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: &quot;Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine.&quot; In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied. Soon after, he began work on &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, writing to a friend, &quot;I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless – fuck everything!&quot; Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change after meeting Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; in 1934 with money from Otto Rank. She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931–34, was published in 1966. Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.

In 1931, Miller was employed by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Paris edition as a proofreader, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès, who worked there. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès&#x27; name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat. At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller&#x27;s correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books. During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.

His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity. The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: &quot;Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain.&quot; He continued to write novels that were banned; along with &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, his &quot;Black Spring&quot; (1936) and &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published &quot;The Cosmological Eye&quot;, Miller&#x27;s first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in &quot;Black Spring&quot; and &quot;Max and the White Phagocytes&quot; (1938).

Miller became fluent in French during his ten-year stay in Paris and lived in France until June 1939. During the late 1930s he also learned about German-born sailor George Dibbern, helped to promote his memoire &quot;Quest&quot; and organized charity to help him.

===Greece, 1939–1940===
In 1939 Lawrence Durrell, British novelist who was living in Corfu, Greece, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in &quot;The Colossus of Maroussi&quot; (1941), which he considered his best book. One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;, where he wrote:

===California, 1942–1980===

In 1940, Miller returned to New York. After a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&quot;, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944. While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the &quot;Tropic&quot; books, then still banned in the US, were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for. By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.

In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing &quot;Sexus&quot;, the first novel in &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot; trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.
Miller lived in a small house on Partington Ridge from 1944 to 1947, along with other bohemian writers like Harry Partch, Emil White, and Jean Varda. While living there, he wrote &quot;Into the Nightlife&quot;. He writes about his fellow artists who lived at Anderson Creek as the Anderson Creek Gang in &quot;Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch&quot;. Miller paid $5 per month rent for his shack on the property.

In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in &quot;Sunday After the War&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&quot; (1945). His &quot;Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch&quot;, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior. They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine. They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960, and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism. In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot; trilogy, June. They had not seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June&#x27;s &quot;terrible&quot; appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.

In 1948, Miller wrote a novella which he called his &quot;most singular story,&quot; a work of fiction entitled &quot;The Smile at the Foot of the Ladder&quot;.

In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life. In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Japanese born singer Hoki Tokuda (:ja:ホキ徳田). In 1968, Miller signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist&#x27;s model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats. Thiebaud&#x27;s memories of Miller&#x27;s table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.

Only 200 copies of Miller&#x27;s 1972 chapbook &quot;On Turning Eighty&quot; were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the &quot;Yes! Capra&quot; chapbook series and is 34 pages in length. The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

In 1973, Miller was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by professor of the University of Copenhagen Allan Philip (1927–2004).

Miller and Tokuda divorced in 1977. Then in his late 80s, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of &quot;witnesses&quot;. The film was released eighteen months after Miller&#x27;s death. During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young &quot;Playboy&quot; model and columnist, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published by William Morrow, NY, in 1986.

==Death==
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88. His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his own ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.

==US publication of previously banned works==
The publication of Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein&quot;, citing &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature. This was one of the signature events of the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel&#x27;s publication in Illinois, became Miller&#x27;s lifelong friend; a volume of their correspondence has been published. Following the trial, in 1964–65, Miller&#x27;s other books, which had also been banned in the US, were published by Grove Press: &quot;Black Spring&quot;, &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;, &quot;Quiet Days in Clichy&quot;, &quot;Sexus&quot;, &quot;Plexus&quot; and &quot;Nexus&quot;. Excerpts from some of these banned books, including &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, &quot;Black Spring&quot; and &quot;Sexus&quot;, were first published in the US by New Directions in &quot;The Henry Miller Reader&quot; in 1959.

==Watercolors==
In addition to his literary accomplishments, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller&#x27;s paintings exist. The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller&#x27;s watercolors, as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001. Miller&#x27;s daughter Valentine placed some of her father&#x27;s art for sale in 2005. He was also an amateur pianist.

Miller&#x27;s friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981. This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.

==Literary references==

Miller is considered a &quot;literary innovator&quot; in whose works &quot;actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other.&quot; His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Lojze Kovačič, Richard Brautigan, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Vitomil Zupan, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.

Throughout his novels he makes references to other works of literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.

&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; is referenced in Junot Díaz&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot; as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller&#x27;s legal difficulties, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; are mentioned in Denis Johnson&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Tree of Smoke&quot;, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel. Miller&#x27;s relationship with June Mansfield is the subject of Ida Therén&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Att omfamna ett vattenfall&quot;.

<text>The history of Victoria refers to the history of the Australian state of Victoria and the area&#x27;s preceding Indigenous and British colonial societies.

Before British colonisation of Australia, many Aboriginal peoples lived in the area now known as Victoria. After the first Europeans settled there in October 1803, in September 1836 the area became part of the colony of New South Wales, known as the District of Port Phillip. In July 1851, the District of Port Phillip was established as its own colony, becoming the Colony of Victoria, with its own government within the British Empire. During the 1850s, gold was discovered in Clunes and Buninyong in Ballarat in 1851, which was the start of the Victorian Gold Rush. In 1901 it became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia.

==Aboriginal history==


The state of Victoria was originally home to many Aboriginal nations that had occupied the land for tens of thousands of years. According to Gary Presland, Aboriginal people have lived in Victoria for about 40,000 years, living a semi-nomadic existence of fishing, hunting and gathering, and farming eels, as is evident in the Budj Bim heritage areas.

At the Keilor Archaeological Site a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years BP, making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia. A cranium found at the site has been dated at between 12,000 and 14,700 years BP.

Archaeological sites in Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands have been dated to between 20,000 – 35,000 years ago, when sea levels were 130 metres below present level allowing Aboriginal people to move across the region of southern Victoria and on to the land bridge of the Bassian plain to Tasmania by at least 35,000 years ago.

During the Ice Age about 20,000 years BP, the area now the bay of Port Phillip would have been dry land, and the Yarra and Werribee river would have joined to flow through the heads then south and south west through the Bassian plain before meeting the ocean to the west. Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands became separated from mainland Australia around 12,000 BP, when the sea level was approximately below present levels. Port Phillip was flooded by post-glacial rising sea levels between 8000 and 6000 years ago.

Oral history and creation stories from the Wathaurong, Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung languages describe the flooding of the bay, which they call Narm-Narm; it was previously covered in scrubby tea-tree and was a kangaroo hunting ground. Aboriginal creation stories describe how Bunjil was responsible for the formation of the bay, or the bay was flooded when the Yarra River was created. Another story says that Balayang the bat created the oceans, rivers, and creeks.

==Early European exploration==
Coming from New Zealand in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook in HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; sighted land at Point Hicks, about 70 km west of Gabo Island, before turning east and north to follow the coast of Australia.

Ships sailing from Great Britain to Sydney crossed the Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean, sailing around Van Diemen&#x27;s Land before turning north to their destination. Several captains viewed the expanse of water between Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and the east coast of New South Wales and wondered whether it was a large bay or a strait. Survivors of &quot;Sydney Cove&quot;, wrecked in the Furneaux Group of islands, also thought it might be a strait.

To clear up the question, Governor John Hunter sent George Bass to explore thoroughly the coast in a whaleboat. After reaching Wilsons Promontory and Western Port in January 1798 bad weather and lack of provisions forced him to return to Sydney. Bass returned with Matthew Flinders in December 1798 in &quot;Norfolk&quot; and sailed through the strait, proving its existence.

In December 1800, Lieutenant James Grant in , on way from Cape Town to Sydney, sailed through Bass Strait from west to east. Governor King, disappointed at the vagueness of Grant&#x27;s chart, sent him back to survey the strait more thoroughly. Bad weather prevented him from proceeding beyond Western Port, where he stayed for five weeks, planting wheat, Indian corn, peas, rice, coffee and potatoes on Churchill Island off Phillip Island.

In 1801 &quot;Harbinger&quot;, under John Black, was the second vessel to sail through Bass Strait en route to Port Jackson. She reached the coast near Cape Otway on 1 January 1801, then veered sharply south-west to the north-western tip of Governor King&#x27;s Island (now King Island), which Black named after the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King. She then sailed easterly towards Wilsons Promontory. Proceeding around the tip of the promontory, Black discovered the Hogan Group, which he named after the ship&#x27;s owner Michael Hogan. &quot;Harbinger&quot; arrived in Port Jackson on 12 January 1801.

In January 1802 Lieutenant John Murray in &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; visited Western Port and entered Port Phillip on 14 February. He named Arthur&#x27;s Seat, explored Corio Bay and formally took possession of the bay (which he named Port King) for Britain. The bay was then known as Narm-Narm by the people of the Kulin Nation, and Murray called the bay Port King after the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King. On 4 September 1805, King formally renamed it Port Phillip, in honour of his predecessor Arthur Phillip. Murray chose to base the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; off what is now known as Sorrento Beach.

During this voyage, Murray records in his journal his first encounter with local Aboriginal peoples in the eastern Melbourne region. This initially friendly encounter started with trading, eating, and gifting, and was suddenly interrupted by a violent ambush by another group of Aboriginal people. The crew in response shot at the Aboriginal people, and continued to shoot at them as they fled, inflicting likely mortal wounds on two of them. Murray then ordered the ship carronades to be fired at the fleeing Aboriginal people.
&quot;They were all clothed in opossum skins and in each basket a certain quantity of gum was found. ... if we may judge from the number of their fires and other marks this part of the country is not thin of inhabitants. Their spears are of various kinds and all of them more dangerous than any I have yet seen.&quot;Three weeks later the French explorer Nicolas Baudin sailed through the strait from east to west and was the first to properly survey the coast to the west. In April 1802, a French expedition ship &quot;Le Naturaliste&quot; under Jacques Hamelin explored the area around French Island, as part of the Baudin expedition to Australia. It named the island &quot;Ile des Français&quot;, since Anglicised as French Island.

On 26 April 1802, Flinders, unaware of Murray&#x27;s visit, entered Port Phillip in , climbed Arthur&#x27;s Seat, rowed to Mornington and across to the Bellarine Peninsula and climbed the You Yangs.

In January 1803 Acting-Lieutenant Charles Robbins in the schooner sailed right around Port Phillip. With him were acting surveyor-general Charles Grimes, Mr James Meehan and gardener James Fleming. At the head of the bay they found a river and followed it upstream where it soon divided. They followed the western branch and named it the Saltwater River (the present Maribyrnong) to what is now Braybrook, and then the eastern fresh-water branch (the Yarra) to Dights Falls. They had a friendly meeting with local Aboriginal people and returned to their ship via Corio Bay. They concluded that the best site for a settlement would be on the freshwater at the northern head of the bay, but were unenthusiastic about the soil and its agricultural potential.

==1803 British settlement==
With Britain involved in the French revolutionary wars, Governor King was concerned that Bass Strait could harbour enemy raiders, and that in peace time it could provide an important trade route and trading base. The appearance of Baudin&#x27;s ships served to reinforce the concern that France was interested in the area. King was also looking for an alternative settlement for the increasing number of convicts in Sydney and to reduce the pressure on food resources. Port Phillip, with a favourable climate and rich fishing and sealing resources, seemed an ideal location for another settlement.

A full description of Murray&#x27;s and Flinders&#x27; discoveries, together with King&#x27;s thoughts on settlement, but not Grimes&#x27; report, reached England just as was being prepared to send a shipload of convicts to Sydney. In February 1803, Lord Hobart the Secretary of State changed the destination to Port Phillip. On 24 April 1803 HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot;, commanded by Captain Daniel Woodriff, with Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins as commander of the expedition, left England accompanied by the store-ship &quot;Ocean&quot;. The expedition consisted of 402 people: 5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers&#x27; wives, and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts&#x27; wives, and 7 children. One of the children was the eleven-year-old John Pascoe Fawkner, later a founder of Melbourne, who accompanied his convicted father and mother.

The party entered Port Phillip on 9 October 1803 and chose a site at Sullivan Bay near present-day Sorrento.

Collins was soon disappointed with the area. Reports from exploring parties led by Lieutenant James Tuckey and surveyor George Harris described strong currents, sandy soil, poor timber, swampy land and scarce fresh water. They also clashed with the Wathaurung people near Corio Bay, killing their leader – the first Aborigines known to have been killed by settlers in Victoria.

Collins reported his criticisms to Governor King, who supported him and recommended moving the settlement. On 18 December &quot;Calcutta&quot; departed for Port Jackson, and the party was prepared for evacuation. This was achieved in two voyages of &quot;Ocean&quot; in January and May 1804, assisted by which had been surveying Port Dalrymple on the north coast of Van Diemens Land. The party was transferred to the fledgling settlement of Hobart, founded by Lieutenant John Bowen as a penal colony at Risdon Cove in September 1803.

The brief settlement at Sorrento achieved little and left only a few relics for modern tourists to observe. Collins has been criticised for not investigating the bay thoroughly, in particular, the northern head with its fresh-water river, and for being too hasty in his condemnation of the bay. The site of the settlement is now a reserve incorporating four graves from the period.

When Collins departed, several convicts – who had escaped when they heard the colony was leaving for Van Diemen&#x27;s Land – were left behind. They were presumed killed by Aboriginal people. However, William Buckley survived, meeting Wathaurong people on the Bellarine Peninsula and living with them for the next 32 years. (In 1835 he became aware of John Batman&#x27;s Port Phillip Association camp and reintroduced himself to Europeans.)

For the next thirty years a few sealers and whalers rested on the southern coast of New South Wales.

==Interest grows in the north coast of Bass Strait==

Following a number of exploratory expeditions south from the settled areas of New South Wales, the pastoralist Hamilton Hume and former sea-captain William Hovell set off to explore the country to the south in October 1824. They crossed the Murray River (which they named the Hume River) near the site of Albury and continued south. They crossed the Goulburn River (which they called the Hovell) above the site of Yea, and were forced to detour around mountains. They arrived on the shores of Corio Bay, mistakenly believing it to be Western Port, and returned to Sydney in January 1825, lavishly praising the quality of the country they had passed through.

In April 1826 the French explorer d&#x27;Urville visited one of the sealers&#x27; camps on Phillip Island. Worried by this renewed French interest in the area and encouraged by Hume and Hovell&#x27;s reports, Governor Darling ordered a settlement to be established at Western Port. A small convict party arrived in November 1826 at Corinella under the command of Samuel Wright, to protect the approaches to the bay. Hovell, accompanying the party, soon realised that this was not where he had arrived two years before, and reported unfavourably on the swampy land around Western Port, although he referred to better land to the north. In spite of clearing the land for crops, and the construction of a fort and houses, the settlement was abandoned in April 1828.

The shortage of good pasture in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land led to settlers there showing interest in the country across Bass Strait, following Hume and Hovell&#x27;s reports and stories of visiting sealers. Pastoralist John Batman and surveyor John Wedge planned an expedition from Launceston in 1825 but permission was not granted. A number of settlers sought land over the next few years, but Governor Darling turned down all requests.

A sealer and whaler William Dutton built a hut on the shore of Portland Bay in 1829 where he resided for a time prior to the arrival of the Hentys.

The expedition down the Murray River by Charles Sturt in 1830 again aroused interest in settlement in the south. In April 1833 Edward Henty, returning to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from Spencer Gulf called in to Portland for a cargo of oil, and was much impressed. In November 1834 John Hart, another sailor, reported favourably in Launceston on Western Port. It was now inevitable that settlement would occur.

In June 1834 banker Charles Swanston advised his client George Mercer that land was scarce in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and he should invest across Bass Strait. Pastoralists John Aitken and George Russell suggested forming a partnership, and in August 1834 a group of eight Launceston capitalists formed what became the Port Phillip Association. On 19 November 1834 Edward Henty landed in Portland Bay and began the first permanent European settlement on the north coast of Bass Strait.

==Permanent European settlement==
Victoria&#x27;s first successful British settlement was at Portland, on the west coast of what is now Victoria. Portland was settled on 19 November 1834 by the Henty family, who were originally farmers from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). When Major Thomas Mitchell led an expedition to the region from Sydney in 1835, arriving at Portland in August 1836, he was surprised to find a small but prosperous community living off the fertile farmland.

In 1835, John Pascoe Fawkner and the Port Phillip Association (led by John Batman) started the Port Phillip settlement that later become known as Melbourne.

===Borders===
The District of Port Phillip was formally established as an administrative division within the Colony of New South Wales in September 1836, though with ill-defined borders. In 1839, the District was defined as consisting of all the lands within New South Wales south of 36°S latitude, and between 141°E (that is, the border with the future Colony of South Australia) and 146°E longitude. Coinciding with the introduction of a fixed-price land sale scheme in January 1840, the District was expanded north to follow the course of the Murrumbidgee River from its source to the Pacific coast at Moruya. However, the border was retracted south to the Murray River after extensive opposition in Sydney, including from the Legislative Council, all of whom were appointed by the Sovereign or the Governor of the Colony. When the Legislative Council was expanded and restructured to include 12 appointed members and 24 members elected by eligible landowners, taking effect from the 1843 colonial elections, the newly created electoral districts included Port Phillip (to be represented by 5 members) and the Town of Melbourne. On 1 July 1843, a proclamation formalised the border as running from Cape Howe, to the nearest source of the Murray River, and then along the course of the Murray to the border with South Australia.

Elected representatives for Port Phillip and Melbourne needed to be in Sydney to serve in the Legislative Council, placing them at a great distance from the areas they represented, and they were consequently considered ineffective and out-of-touch by locals. In protest and in support of a campaign for independence, the 1848 election scheduled for 27 July was disrupted by not nominating candidates for Port Phillip and putting forward for the Town of Melbourne the incumbent Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the British Cabinet, Earl Grey. Grey received nearly 75% of the vote despite Grey having never visited the Colony and being ineligible as a current member of the British Parliament. A second writ was issued to elect five representatives for Port Phillip in October 1848. Following the strategy involving Earl Grey, the nominees included the Duke of Wellington, Lord Palmerston, Lord Brougham, Lord John Russell, and Sir Robert Peel but local representatives were elected. Grey never attempted to take up his seat and it was declared vacant in 1850 and a replacement elected. The independence campaign continued and led Grey to introduce the &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act 1850&quot; into the British Parliament, separating the District of Port Phillip from New South Wales to become the Colony of Victoria from 2 July 1851. The separation occurred along the 1843 borders and still apply to the modern State of Victoria. The same Act created bicameral legislatures and instituted self-government for each colony.

===Conflict over resources===

With the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands with the establishment of sheep runs by squatters, conflict over resources and land use inevitably occurred. One highly notable incident called the Convincing Ground massacre occurred in Portland Bay in 1833 or 1834 in a possible dispute about a beached whale between whalers and the &quot;Kilcarer gundidj&quot; clan of the Gunditjmara people.

Melbourne was founded in 1835 by John Batman, also from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and quickly grew into a thriving community, although at great human cost to the original inhabitants. Its foundation was the result of an invasion of wealthy squatters, land speculators and their indentured servants (including ex-convicts) who arrived from 1835, in a race with one another to seize an &#x27;empty&#x27; country. The British Crown and colonial governments did not recognise prior Aboriginal ownership of their lands, waters and property, in spite of claiming that Aborigines fell within the protection of the law as British subjects.

Early in 1836, Mr Franks, one of the first immigrants to the region, and his shepherd were found dead as a result of steel hatchet wounds to the head. His station was near Cotterill&#x27;s Mount, called the Sugarloaf, near the river Exe, now Werribee. Upon discovering the scene, and a nearby food store which appeared to have been ransacked, George Smith travelled to Point Gellibrand and formed an exploratory band. The party was sent out led by tour of the Melbourne tribe, and encountered a camp from the Indigenous Wathaurong tribe, whereupon an unclear incident occurred. Port Philip Police Magistrate Captain William Lonsdale advised the Colonel Secretary that no harm was inflicted on the Aboriginal people, however Wathaurong histories report that 35 of their people were murdered in retaliatory violence. The &quot;Traralgon Record&quot; newspaper reported in 1915 that the party &quot;took vengeance on the murderes&quot; (referring to the untried Wathaurong people), while &quot;The Cornwall Chronicle&quot; of Tasmania reported with approval in 1836 that the band had scouted the Wathaurong camp overnight, and in the morning launched an attack with the intent of &quot;annihilating them&quot;. The incident is today remembered as &quot;The Mount Cottrell massacre&quot;.

Between 1836 and 1842, Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of territory bigger than England. Although the British Colonial Office appointed 5 &quot;Aboriginal Protectors&quot; for the entire Aboriginal population of Victoria, arriving in Melbourne in 1839, they worked &quot;...within a land policy that nullified their work, and there was no political will to change this.&quot; &quot;It was government policy to encourage squatters to take possession of whatever [Aboriginal] land they chose...that largely explains why almost all the original inhabitants of Port Phillip&#x27;s vast grasslands were dead so soon after 1835&quot;. By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became the patriarchs &quot;...that were to wield so much political and economic power in Victoria for generations to come.&quot;

Regarding the infamous Trial of &quot;R vs Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheener&quot;, &quot;Tragically two of these (Aboriginal) men, Tunnerminnerwait (known as Jack) and Maulboyheenner (known as Bob, or sometimes called Timmy or Jimmy), became the first people executed in the Port Phillip District. This took place in 1842, a mere seven years after John Batman&#x27;s treaties with the Kuhn people, when the two Tasmanian Aboriginal men were publicly hanged for murder.&quot; The Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner public marker exists at the place of execution near the site of the Old Melbourne Gaol, with artwork by Brook Andrew and Trent Walter.

A severe financial crisis took place in 1842–3, mainly due to the Government demanding from the banks the large rate of 7% for all moneys deposited with them, the result of land sales. The banks had to charge their customers from 10 to 12% for loans, very often on questionable securities. It was then accelerated by Lord John Russell&#x27;s instructions that all lands out of town boundaries to be sold at only £1 per acre. Sheep that had been bought at from 30s to 40s per head are now sold at less than 2s. The Insolvent Court was rushed by all classes of the community.

== Separation from New South Wales ==
The first petition for the separation of the Port Phillip District (or &#x27;Australia Felix&#x27;) from New South Wales was drafted in 1840 by Henry Fyshe Gisborne and presented by him to Governor Gipps. Gipps, who had previously been in favour of separation, rejected the petition.

Agitation of the Port Phillip settlers continued and led to the establishment of Port Phillip District as a separate colony on 1 July 1851. The British Act of Parliament separating Port Phillip District from New South Wales, and naming the new colony &quot;Victoria&quot; (after Queen Victoria) and providing it with a Constitution, was signed by Queen Victoria on 5 August 1850. Enabling legislation was passed by the New South Wales Legislative Council to take effect on 1 July 1851. This was formally the founding moment of the Colony of Victoria, with separation from New South Wales established by section 1 of the 1851 Act. La Trobe became the new colony&#x27;s first Lieutenant-Governor.

In 1851, the white population of the new colony was still only 77,000, and only 23,000 people lived in Melbourne. Melbourne had already become a centre of Australia&#x27;s wool export trade.

==1850s gold rush==

In 1851 gold was first discovered in Clunes and Buninyong near Ballarat, and subsequently at Bendigo. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the &quot;richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world&quot; and the largest gold nugget. Victoria produced in the decade 1851–1860, twenty million ounces of gold, one third of the world&#x27;s output.

Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold, principally from the British Isles and particularly from Ireland. Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs. Although there was some racism directed at them, there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the Lambing Flat riots in New South Wales. However, there was a riot at Buckland Valley near Bright in 1857. Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary – an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners.

In 1854 there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes (the &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot;). This was crushed by British troops, but some of the leaders of the rebellion subsequently became members of the Victoria Parliament, and the rebellion is regarded as a pivotal moment in the development of Australian democracy.

==Colonial politics==
In 1857, reflecting the growing presence of Irish immigrants, in Victoria the British Empire had its first Catholic government leaders: John O&#x27;Shanassy as Premier, and the former Young Irelander, Charles Gavan Duffy his deputy. Melbourne&#x27;s Protestant establishment was ill-prepared &quot;to countenance so startling a novelty&quot;. In 1858–59, &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot; cartoons linked Duffy and O&#x27;Shanassy with images of the French Revolution to undermine their Ministry. One famous &quot;Punch&quot; image, &quot;Citizens John and Charles&quot;, depicted the pair as French revolutionaries holding the skull and cross bone flag of the so-called &quot;Victorian Republic&quot;. 

In 1862 Duffy&#x27;s Land Act attempted, but failed, through a system of extended pastoral licences, to break the land-holding monopoly of the so-called &quot;squatter&quot; class. In 1871 Duffy led the opposition to Premier Sir James McCulloch&#x27;s plan to introduce a land tax, on the grounds that it unfairly penalised small farmers, and himself was briefly Premier (June 1871 to June 1872). 

In 1866, the Victorian parliament passed the &quot;McCulloch Tariff&quot;, which was the first recognisably and substantially protectionist piece of legislation in Australian tariff history, applying 10% duties to a range of manufactured commodities; there is no evidence, however, that it had an effect on the colony&#x27;s manufacturing. Although, further increases in protectionism in the late nineteenth century were consequential for Victoria manufacturing. 

The first foreign military action by the colony of Victoria was to send troops and a warship to New Zealand as part of the New Zealand Wars. Troops from New South Wales had previously participated in the Crimean War.

== Kelly Gang ==

From 1878 to 1880 Victoria was the location of the celebrated bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang. Historian Geoffrey Serle has called Kelly and his gang &quot;the last expression of the lawless frontier in what was becoming a highly organised and educated society, the last protest of the mighty bush now tethered with iron rails to Melbourne and the world&quot;. In the century after his execution in Melbourne in 1880, Kelly became a cultural icon, inspiring numerous works in the arts and popular culture, and is the subject of more biographies than any other Australian.

== Depression of 1893 ==

A period of prosperity in the 1880s led to a wild speculation in land and buildings, and money poured in from England. Land companies, mortgage societies, municipal bodies, building societies, and a host of other organisations all clamoured for a share in the good things that were on offer, and probably £40,000,000 flowed into Victoria during a period of six years. With so much money in circulation, a fictitious prosperity of a feverish sort resulted. The banks issued notes to the value of millions of pounds, and trade and industry flourished as never before. The reaction came quickly. Public confidence subsided like a pricked balloon. A run commenced on the banks, and the bursting of the boom brought with it widespread disaster.

In 1893, 14 banks failed, twelve of those with 905 branches throughout Australia, had liabilities assessed at £166,000,000, and thousands of people lost the whole of their possessions. Bank notes in many cases became worthless, and Victoria reached the farthest depth of a financial depression. Unemployment became widespread, wages and prices dropped and bankruptcies followed one another in disturbing sequence. The most drastic retrenchments were made by the Government and public bodies.

==1901 federation==

At the beginning of 1901, following a proclamation by Queen Victoria, Victoria ceased to be an independent colony and became a state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Victorian and Tasmanian politicians were particularly active in the Federation process.

As a result of the gold rush, Melbourne became the financial centre of Australia and New Zealand. Between 1901 and 1927, Australia&#x27;s Parliament sat in Melbourne while Canberra was under construction. It was also the largest city in Australia at the time, and the second largest city in the Empire (after London).
