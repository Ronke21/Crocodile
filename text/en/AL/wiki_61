<text>The Panthéon (, ), is a monument in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. It stands in the Latin Quarter (Quartier latin), atop the , in the centre of the , which was named after it. The edifice was built between 1758 and 1790, from designs by , at the behest of King Louis XV of France; the king intended it as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, Paris&#x27;s patron saint, whose relics were to be housed in the church. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV lived to see the church completed.

By the time the construction was finished, the French Revolution had started; the National Constituent Assembly voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome which had been used in this way since the 17th century. The first was , although his remains were removed from the building a few years later. The Panthéon was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century—although Soufflot&#x27;s remains were transferred inside it in 1829—until the French Third Republic finally decreed the building&#x27;s exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881. The placement of Victor Hugo&#x27;s remains in the crypt in 1885 was its first entombment in over 50 years.

The successive changes in the Panthéon&#x27;s purpose resulted in modifications of the pedimental sculptures and the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag; some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere, which compromised somewhat Soufflot&#x27;s initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the Gothic cathedral with classical principles. The architecture of the Panthéon is an early example of Neoclassicism, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante&#x27;s .

In 1851, Léon Foucault conducted a demonstration of diurnal motion at the Panthéon by suspending a pendulum from the ceiling, a copy of which is still visible today. As of December 2021 the remains of 81 people (75 men and six women) had been transferred to the Panthéon. More than half of all the were made under Napoleon&#x27;s rule during the First Empire.

==History==
===Site and earlier buildings===
The site of the Panthéon had great significance in Paris history, and was occupied by a series of monuments. It was on Mount Lucotitius, a height on the Left Bank where the forum of the Roman town of Lutetia was located. It was also the original burial site of Saint Genevieve, who had led the resistance to the Huns when they threatened Paris in 451. In 508, Clovis, King of the Franks, constructed a church there, where he and his wife were later buried in 511 and 545. The church, originally dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was rededicated to Saint Genevieve, who became the patron saint of Paris. It was at the centre of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages. Her relics were kept in the church, and were brought out for solemn processions when dangers threatened the city.

===Construction===

King Louis XV vowed in 1744 that if he recovered from his illness he would replace the dilapidated church of the Abbey of St Genevieve with a grander building worthy of the patron saint of Paris. He did recover, but ten years passed before the reconstruction and enlargement of the church was begun. In 1755 The Director of the King&#x27;s public works, Abel-François Poisson, marquis de Marigny, chose Jacques-Germain Soufflot to design the church. Soufflot (1713–1780) had studied classical architecture in Rome over 1731–38. Most of his early work was done in Lyon. Saint Genevieve became his life&#x27;s work; it was not finished until after his death.

His first design was completed in 1755, and was clearly influenced by the work of Bramante he had studied in Italy. It took form of a Greek cross, with four naves of equal length, and monumental dome over the crossing in the centre, and a classical portico with Corinthian columns and a peristyle with a triangular pediment on the main façade. The design was modified five times over the following years, with the addition of a narthex, a choir, and two towers. The design was not finalised until 1777.

The foundations were laid in 1758, but due to economic problems work proceeded slowly. In 1780, Soufflot died and was replaced by his student Jean-Baptiste Rondelet. The re-modelled Abbey of St. Genevieve was finally completed in 1790, shortly after the beginning of the French Revolution.

The building is 110 metres long by 84 metres wide, and 83 metres high, with the crypt beneath of the same size. The ceiling was supported by isolated columns, which supported an array of barrel vaults and transverse arches. The massive dome was supported by pendentives rested upon four massive pillars. Critics of the plan contended that the pillars could not support such a large dome. Soufflot strengthened the stone structure with a system of iron rods, a predecessor of modern reinforced buildings. The bars had deteriorated by the 21st century, and a major restoration project to replace them was carried out between 2010 and 2020.

The dome is actually three domes, fitting within each other. The first, lowest dome, has a coffered ceiling with rosettes, and is open in the centre. Looking through this dome, the second dome is visible, decorated with the fresco &quot;The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve&quot; by Antoine Gros. The outermost dome, visible from the outside, is built of stone bound together with iron cramps and covered with lead sheathing, rather than of carpentry construction, as was the common French practice of the period. Concealed buttresses inside the walls give additional support to the dome.

===The Revolution – The &quot;Temple of the Nation&quot;===

The Church of Saint Genevieve was nearly complete, with only the interior decoration unfinished, when the French Revolution began in 1789. In 1790, the Marquis de Vilette proposed that it be made a temple devoted to liberty, on the model of the Pantheon in Rome. &quot;Let us install statues of our great men and lay their ashes to rest in its underground recesses.&quot; The idea was formally adopted in April, 1791, after the death of the prominent revolutionary figure, The Comte de Mirabeau, the President of the National Constituent Assembly on April 2, 1791. On April 4, 1791, the Assembly decreed &quot;that this religious church become a temple of the nation, that the tomb of a great man become the altar of liberty.&quot; They also approved a new text over the entrance: &quot;A grateful nation honors its great men.&quot; On the same day the declaration was approved, the funeral of Mirabeau was held in the church.

The ashes of Voltaire were placed in the Panthéon in a lavish ceremony on 11 July 1791, followed by the remains of several revolutionaries, including Jean-Paul Marat, replacing Mirabeau and of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In the rapid shifts of power of the Revolutionary period, two of the first men honored in Pantheon, Mirabeau and Marat, were declared enemies of the Revolution, and their remains were removed. Finally, the new government of the French Convention decreed in February, 1795 that no one should be placed in the Pantheon who had not been dead at least ten years.

Soon after the church was transformed into a mausoleum, the Assembly approved architectural changes to make the interior darker and more solemn. The architect Quatremère de Quincy bricked up the lower windows and frosted the glass of the upper windows to reduce the light, and removed most of the ornament from the exterior. The architectural lanterns and bells were removed from the façade. All of the religious friezes and statues were destroyed in 1791; it was replaced by statuary and murals on patriotic themes.

===Temple to church and back to temple (1806–1830)===

Napoleon Bonaparte, when he became First Consul in 1801, signed a Concordat with the Pope, agreeing to restore former church properties, including the Panthéon. The Panthéon was under the jurisdiction of the canons of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Celebrations of important events, such as the victory of Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, were held there. However, the crypt of the church kept its official function as the resting place for illustrious Frenchmen. A new entrance directly to the crypt was created via the eastern porch (1809–1811). The artist Antoine-Jean Gros was commissioned to decorate the interior of the cupola. It combined the secular and religious aspects of the church; it showed The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve, conducted to heaven by angels, in the presence of great leaders of France, from Clovis I and Charlemagne to Napoleon and the Empress Josephine.

During the reign of Napoleon, the remains of forty-one illustrious Frenchmen were placed in the crypt. They were mostly military officers, senators and other high officials of the Empire, but also included the explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville and the painter Joseph-Marie Vien, the teacher of Napoleon&#x27;s official painter, Jacques-Louis David.
During the Bourbon Restoration which followed the fall of Napoleon, in 1816 Louis XVIII of France restored the entire Panthéon, including the crypt, to the Catholic Church. The church was also at last officially consecrated in the presence of the King, a ceremony which had been omitted during the Revolution. The sculpture on the pediment by Jean Guillaume Moitte, called &quot;The Fatherland crowning the heroic and civic virtues&quot; was replaced by a religious-themed work by David d&#x27;Angers. The reliquary of Saint Genevieve had been destroyed during the Revolution, but a few relics were found and restored to the church (They are now in the neighboring Church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont). In 1822 François Gérard was commissioned to decorate the pendentives of the dome with new works representing Justice, Death, the Nation, and Fame. Jean-Antoine Gros was commissioned to redo his fresco on the inner dome, replacing Napoleon with Louis XVIII, as well as figures of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The new version of the cupola was inaugurated in 1824 by Charles X. As to the crypt where the tombs were located, it was locked and closed to visitors.

===Under Louis Philippe I, the Second Republic and Napoleon III (1830–1871)===

The French Revolution of 1830 placed Louis Philippe I on the throne. He expressed sympathy for Revolutionary values, and on 26 August 1830, the church once again became the Pantheon. However, the crypt remained closed to the public, and no new remains were added. The only change made was to the main pediment, which had been remade with a radiant cross; it was remade again by D&#x27;Angers with a patriotic work called &quot;The Nation Distributing Crowns Handed to Her by Liberty, to Great Men, Civil and Military, While History Inscribes Their Names.&quot;

Louis Philippe was overthrown in 1848 and replaced by the elected government of the Second French Republic, which valued revolutionary themes. The new government designated the Pantheon &quot;The Temple of Humanity&quot;, and proposed to decorate it with sixty new murals honouring human progress in all fields. In 1851 the Foucault Pendulum of astronomer Léon Foucault was hung beneath the dome to illustrate the rotation of the earth. However, on complaints from the Church, it was removed in December of the same year.

Louis Napoléon, nephew of the Emperor, was elected President of France in December 1848, and in 1852 staged a coup-d&#x27;état and made himself Emperor. Once again the Pantheon was returned to the church, with the title of &quot;National Basilica&quot;. The remaining relics of Saint Genevieve were restored to the church, and two groups of sculpture commemorating events in the life of the Saint were added. The crypt remained closed.

===The Third Republic (1871–1939)===

The Basilica suffered damage from German shelling during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. During the brief reign of the Paris Commune in May 1871, it suffered more damage during fighting between the Commune soldiers and the French Army. During the early years of the Third Republic, under conservative governments, it functioned as a church, but the interior walls were largely bare. Beginning in 1874, the interior was redecorated with new murals and sculptural groups linking French history and the history of the church, by notable artists including Puvis de Chavannes and Alexandre Cabanel, and the artist Antoine-Auguste-Ernest Hébert, who made a mosaic under the vault of the apsidal chapel called &quot;Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People&quot;.
In 1881, a decree was passed to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum again. Victor Hugo was the first to be placed in the crypt afterwards. The subsequent governments approved the entry of literary figures, including the writer Émile Zola (1908), and, after World War I, leaders of the French socialist movement, including Léon Gambetta (1920) and Jean Jaurès (1924). The Third Republic governments also decreed that the building should be decorated with sculpture representing &quot;the golden ages and great men of France.&quot; The principal works remaining from this period include the sculptural group called &quot;The National Assembly&quot;, commemorating the French Revolution; a statue of Mirabeau, the first man interred in the Pantheon, by Jean-Antoine Ingabert; (1889–1920); and two patriotic murals in the apse &quot;Victory Leading the Armies of the Republic&quot; to &quot;Towards Glory&quot; by Édouard Detaille, and &quot;Glory Entering the Temple, Followed by Poets, Philosophers, Scientists and Warriors&quot;, by Marie-Désiré-Hector d&#x27;Espouy (1906).

===1945–present===

The short-lived Fourth Republic (1948–1958) following World War II pantheonized two physicists, Paul Langevin and Jean Perrin; a leader of the abolitionist movement, Victor Schœlcher; early leader of Free France and colonial administrator Félix Éboué; and Louis Braille, inventor of the Braille writing system, in 1952.

Under the Fifth Republic of President Charles de Gaulle, the first person to be buried in the Panthéon was the Resistance leader Jean Moulin. Modern figures buried in recent years include Nobel Peace Prize winner René Cassin (1987) known for drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Jean Monnet (1988) who was a moving force in the creation of the ECSC, the forerunner of the EU, was interred in the 100th anniversary of his birth; Nobel laureates physicists and chemists Marie Curie and Pierre Curie (1995); the writer and culture minister André Malraux (1996); and the lawyer, politician Simone Veil (2018). In 2021, Josephine Baker was inducted into the Pantheon.

==Architecture and art==
===Dome===
The final plan of the dome was accepted in 1777, and it was completed in 1790. It was designed to rival those of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Unlike the dome of in Paris, which has a wooden framework, the dome is constructed entirely of stone. It is actually three domes, one within the other, with the painted ceiling, visible from below, on the second dome. The dome is 83.0 metres (272 ft) high, compared with the tallest dome in the world, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica at 136.57 metres (448.1 ft).
The dome is capped by a cross. However, a statue of Saint Genevieve was initially supposed to sit at the top of the dome. A cross was put temporarily in 1790. After the transformation into a mausoleum in 1791, it was planned that the cross would be replaced by a statue representing Fame. The project was however abandoned. Between 1830 and 1851, a flag was put instead. The cross returned after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte restored the building to church use. The cross was replaced with a red flag during the Paris Commune in 1871. A cross returned subsequently.
Looking up from the crossing of the transept beneath the dome, the painting by Jean-Antoine Gros, the &quot;Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve&quot; (1811–1834), is visible through the opening in the lowest cupola. The triangle in the center symbolizes the Trinity, surrounded by a halo of light. The Hebrew characters spell the name of God. The only character seen in full is Saint Genevieve herself, seated on a rocky promontory. The groups around the painting, made during the Restoration of the Monarchy, represent Kings of France who played an important role in protecting the church. To the left of Saint Genevieve is a group including Clovis, the first King to convert to Christianity. The second group is centred around Charlemagne, who created the first universities. The third group is centred around Louis IX of France, or Saint Louis, with the Crown of Thorns which he brought back from the Holy Land to place in the church of Sainte-Chapelle. The last group is centred around Louis XVIII, the last King of the Restoration, and his niece, looking up into the clouds at the martyred Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The angels in the scene are carrying the &quot;Chartre&quot;, the document by which Louis XVIII re-established the church after the French Revolution.

The four pendentives, or arches, which support the dome are decorated with paintings from the same period by François Gérard depicting &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;Death&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; (1821–37).

===Façade, peristyle and entrance===

The façade and peristyle on the east side, modeled after a Greek temple, features Corinthian columns and pedimental sculpture by David d&#x27;Angers, completed in 1837. The sculpture on this pediment, replacing an early pediment with religious themes, represents &quot;The Nation distributing crowns handed to her by Liberty to great men, civil and military, while history inscribes their names&quot;. To the left are figures of distinguished scientists, philosophers, and statesmen, including Rousseau, Voltaire, Lafayette, and Bichat. To the right is Napoleon Bonaparte, along with soldiers from each military service and students in uniform from the École Polytechnique. Below is the inscription: &quot;To the great men, from a grateful nation&quot; (&quot;Aux grands hommes la patrie reconnaissante&quot;). This was added in 1791, when the Panthéon was created. It was removed during the Restoration of the monarchy, then put back in 1830.
Below the peristyle are five sculpted bas-reliefs; the two reliefs over the main doors, commissioned during the Revolution, represent the two main purposes of the building: &quot;Public Education&quot; (left) and &quot;Patriotic Devotion&quot; (right).

The façade originally had large windows, but they were replaced when the church became a mausoleum, to make the interior darker and more somber.

===Narthex and naves===

The primary decoration of the Western Nave is a series of paintings, beginning in the Narthex, depicting the lives of Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris, and longer series on the life of Saint Genevieve, by Puvis de Chavannes, Alexandre Cabanel, Jules Eugène Lenepveu and other notable history painters of the 19th century. The paintings of the Southern nave and Northern Nave continue this series on the Christian heroes of France, including scenes from the lives of Charlemagne, Clovis, Louis IX of France and Joan of Arc. From 1906 to 1922 the Panthéon was the site of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s famous sculpture &quot;The Thinker&quot;.

===Foucault pendulum===
In 1851, physicist Léon Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the Earth by constructing a pendulum beneath the central dome. The original sphere from the pendulum was temporarily displayed at the Panthéon in the 1990s (starting in 1995) during renovations at the Musée des Arts et Métiers. The original pendulum was later returned to the Musée des Arts et Métiers, and a copy is now displayed at the Panthéon. It has been listed since 1920 as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

== Interment in the crypt ==
Interment in the crypt of the Panthéon is severely restricted and is allowed only by a parliamentary act for &quot;National Heroes&quot;. Similar high honours exist in for historical military leaders such as Napoléon, Turenne and Vauban.

Among those buried in its necropolis are Voltaire, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Émile Zola, Jean Moulin, Louis Braille, Jean Jaurès and Soufflot, its architect. In 1907 Marcellin Berthelot was buried with his wife Mme Sophie Berthelot. Marie Curie was interred in 1995, the first woman interred on merit. Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz and Germaine Tillion, heroines of the French resistance, were interred in 2015. Simone Veil was interred in 2018, and her husband Antoine Veil was interred alongside her so that they would not be separated.

The widely repeated story that the remains of Voltaire were stolen by religious fanatics in 1814 and thrown into a garbage heap is false. Such rumours resulted in the coffin being opened in 1897, which confirmed that his remains were still present.

On 30 November 2002, in an elaborate but solemn procession, six Republican Guards carried the coffin of Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870), the author of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and other famous novels, to the Panthéon. Draped in a blue-velvet cloth inscribed with the Musketeers&#x27; motto &quot;Un pour tous, tous pour un&quot; (&quot;One for all, all for one&quot;), the remains had been transported from their original interment site in the Cimetière de Villers-Cotterêts in Aisne, France. In his speech, President Jacques Chirac stated that an injustice was being corrected with the proper honouring of one of France&#x27;s greatest authors.

In January 2007, President Jacques Chirac unveiled a plaque in the Panthéon to more than 2,600 people recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel for saving the lives of Jews who would otherwise have been deported to concentration camps. The tribute in the Panthéon underlines the fact that around three-quarters of the country&#x27;s Jewish population survived the war, often thanks to ordinary people who provided help at the risk of their own life.

<text>Irène Joliot-Curie (; ; 12 September 1897 – 17 March 1956) was a French chemist and physicist who received the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with her husband, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, for their discovery of induced radioactivity. They were the second married couple, after her parents, to win the Nobel Prize, adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date. 

Her mother Marie Skłodowska-Curie and herself also form the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes whilst Pierre and Irène Curie form the only father-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes by the same occasion, whilst there are six father-son pairs who have won Nobel Prizes by comparison.

She was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research under the Popular Front in 1936. Both children of the Joliot-Curies, Hélène and Pierre, are also scientists.

In 1945, she was one of the six commissioners of the new French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) created by de Gaulle and the Provisional Government of the French Republic. She died in Paris on 17 March 1956 from an acute leukemia linked to her exposure to polonium and X-rays.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Irène was born in Paris, France, on 12 September 1897 and was the first of Marie and Pierre&#x27;s two daughters. Her sister was Ève, born in 1904. They lost their father early on in 1906 due to a horse-drawn wagon incident and Marie was left to raise them. Education was important to Marie and Irène&#x27;s education began at a school near the Paris Observatory. This school was chosen because it had a more challenging curriculum than the school nearby the Curie&#x27;s home. In 1906, it was obvious Irène was talented in mathematics and her mother chose to focus on that instead of public school. Marie joined forces with a number of eminent French scholars, including the prominent French physicist Paul Langevin, to form &quot;The Cooperative&quot;, which included a private gathering of nine students that were children of the most distinguished academics in France. Each contributed to educating these children in their respective homes. The curriculum of The Cooperative was varied and included not only the principles of science and scientific research but such diverse subjects as Chinese and sculpture and with great emphasis placed on self-expression and play. Irène studied in this environment for about two years.

Irène and her sister Ève were sent to Poland to spend the summer with their Aunt Bronia (Marie&#x27;s sister) when Irène was thirteen. Irène&#x27;s education was so rigorous that she still had a German and trigonometry lesson every day of that break. Irène re-entered a more orthodox learning environment by going back to high school at the Collège Sévigné in central Paris until 1914. She then went onto the Faculty of Science at the Sorbonne to complete her baccalaureate, until 1916 when her studies were interrupted by World War I.

===World War I===
Irène took a nursing course during college to assist her mother, Marie Curie, in the field as her assistant. She began her work as a nurse radiographer on the battlefield alongside her mother, but after a few months she was left to work alone at a radiological facility in Belgium. She taught doctors how to locate shrapnel in bodies using radiology and taught herself how to repair the equipment. She moved throughout facilities and battlegrounds including two bombsites, Furnes and Ypres, and Amiens. She received a military medal for her assistance in X-ray facilities in France and Belgium.

After the war, Irène returned to the Sorbonne in Paris to complete her second baccalaureate degree in mathematics and physics in 1918. Irène then went on to work as her mother&#x27;s assistant, teaching radiology at the Radium Institute, which had been built by her parents. Her doctoral thesis was concerned with the alpha decay of polonium, the element discovered by her parents (along with radium) and named after Marie&#x27;s country of birth, Poland. Irène became a Doctor of Science in 1925.

===Research===
As she neared the end of her doctorate in 1924, Irène Curie was asked to teach the precision laboratory techniques required for radiochemical research to the young chemical engineer Frédéric Joliot, whom she would later wed. From 1928 Joliot-Curie and her husband Frédéric combined their research efforts on the study of atomic nuclei. In 1932, Joliot-Curie and her husband Frédéric had full access to Marie&#x27;s polonium. Experiments were done using gamma rays to identify the positron. Though their experiments identified both the positron and the neutron, they failed to interpret the significance of the results and the discoveries were later claimed by Carl David Anderson and James Chadwick respectively. These discoveries would have secured greatness indeed, as together with J. J. Thomson&#x27;s discovery of the electron in 1897, they finally replaced John Dalton&#x27;s model of atoms as solid spherical particles.

However, in 1933, Joliot-Curie and her husband were the first to calculate the accurate mass of the neutron. The Joliot-Curies continued trying to get their name into the scientific community; in doing so they developed a new theory from an interesting experiment they conducted. During an experiment bombarding aluminium with alpha rays, they discovered that only protons were detected. Based on the undetectable electron and positron pair, they proposed that the protons changed into neutrons and positrons. Later in October 1933, this new theory was presented to the Seventh Solvay Conference. The Solvay Conferences consisted of prominent scientists in the physics and chemistry community. Irene and her husband presented their theory and results to their fellow scientists, but they received criticism of their finding from most of the 46 scientists attending. However they were able to build on the controversial theory later on.

In 1934, the Joliot-Curies finally made the discovery that sealed their place in scientific history. Building on the work of Marie and Pierre Curie, who had isolated naturally occurring radioactive elements, the Joliot-Curies realised the alchemist&#x27;s dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive nitrogen from boron, radioactive isotopes of phosphorus from aluminium, and silicon from magnesium. Irradiating the natural stable isotope of aluminium with alpha particles (i.e. helium nuclei) resulted in an unstable isotope of phosphorus: 27Al + 4He → 30P + 1n. This phosporus isotope is not found in nature and decays emitting a positron. This discovery is formally known as positron emission or beta decay, where a proton in the radioactive nucleus changes to a neutron and releases a positron and an electron neutrino. By then, the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly, cheaply, and plentifully. The Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 brought with it fame and recognition from the scientific community and Joliot-Curie was awarded a professorship at the Faculty of Science.

The work that Irène&#x27;s laboratory pioneered, research into radium nuclei, would also help another group of physicists within Germany. Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman on 19 December 1938 bombarded uranium with neutrons, but misinterpreted their findings. Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch would theoretically correct Hahn and Strassmann&#x27;s findings, and after replicating their experiment based on Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard&#x27;s theory that he had confided to Meitner back in 1933, confirmed on 13 January 1939 that Hahn and Strassmann had indeed observed nuclear fission: the splitting of the nucleus itself, emitting vast amounts of energy. Lise Meitner&#x27;s now-famous calculations actually disproved Irène&#x27;s results and proved that nuclear fission was possible and replicable.

In 1948, using work on nuclear fission, the Joliot-Curies along with other scientists created the first French nuclear reactor. The Joliot-Curies were a part of the organization in charge of the project, the Atomic Energy Commission, &quot;Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique&quot; (CEA). Irène was the commissioner of the CEA and Irène&#x27;s husband, Frédéric, was the director of the CEA. The reactor, Zoé (Zéro énergie Oxyde et Eau lourde) used nuclear fission to generate five kilowatts of power. This was the beginning of nuclear energy as a source of power for France.

Years of working so closely with radioactive materials finally caught up with Joliot-Curie and she was diagnosed with leukemia. She had been accidentally exposed to polonium when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench in 1946. Treatment with antibiotics and a series of operations relieved her suffering temporarily but her condition continued to deteriorate. Despite this, Joliot-Curie continued to work and in 1955 drew up plans for new physics laboratories at the Orsay Faculty of Sciences, which is now a part of the Paris-Saclay University, south of Paris.

===Political views===
The Joliot-Curies had become increasingly aware of the growth of the fascist movement. They opposed its ideals and joined the Socialist Party in 1934, the &quot;Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes&quot; a year later, and in 1936 they actively supported the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War. In the same year, Joliot-Curie was appointed Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research by the French government, in which capacity she helped in founding the &quot;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique&quot;. 

Frédéric and Irène visited Moscow for the two hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Russian Academy of Science and returned sympathizing with Russian colleagues. Frédéric&#x27;s close connection with the Communist Party caused Irène to later be detained on Ellis Island during her third trip to the US, coming to speak in support of Spanish refugees, at the Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee&#x27;s invitation.

The Joliot-Curies had continued Pierre and Marie&#x27;s policy of publishing all of their work for the benefit of the global scientific community, but afraid of the danger that might result should it be developed for military use, they stopped: on 30 October 1939, they placed all of their documentation on nuclear fission in the vaults of the French Academy of Sciences, where it remained until 1949.

Joliot-Curie&#x27;s political career continued after the war and she became a commissioner in the &quot;Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique&quot;. However, she still found time for scientific work and in 1946 became director of her mother&#x27;s &quot;Institut Curie&quot;.

Joliot-Curie became actively involved in promoting women&#x27;s education, serving on the National Committee of the Union of French Women (&quot;Comité National de l&#x27;Union des Femmes Françaises&quot;) and the World Peace Council. The Joliot-Curies were given memberships to the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;; Irène as an officer and Frédéric as a commander, recognising his earlier work for the resistance.

===Personal life===
Irène and Frédéric hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married in 1926. The Joliot-Curies had two children, Hélène, born eleven months after they were married, and Pierre, born in 1932.

Between 1941 and 1943 during World War II, Joliot-Curie contracted tuberculosis and was forced to spend time convalescing in Switzerland. Concern for her own health together with the anguish of her husband&#x27;s being in the resistance against the German troops and her children in occupied France was hard to bear. She did make several dangerous visits back to France, enduring detention by German troops at the Swiss border on more than one occasion. Finally, in 1944, Joliot-Curie judged it too dangerous for her family to remain in France and she took her children back to Switzerland. Later in September 1944, after not hearing from Frédéric for months, Irene and her children were finally able to rejoin him.

Irène fought through these struggles to advocate for her own personal views. She was a passionate member of the feminist movement, especially regarding the sciences, and also advocated for peace. She continually applied to the French Academy of Sciences, an elite scientific organization, knowing that she would be denied. She did so to draw attention to the fact they did not accept women in the organization. Irène was also involved in many speaking functions such as the International Women&#x27;s Day conference. She also played a big role for the French contingent at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, which promoted the World Peace movement. In 1948, during a strike involving coal miners, Joliot-Curie reached out to Paris Newsletters to convince families to temporarily adopt the children of the coal miners during the strike. The Joliot-Curies adopted two girls during that time.

=== Death ===
In 1956, after a final convalescent period in the French Alps, Joliot-Curie was admitted to the Curie Hospital in Paris, where she died on 17 March at the age of 58 from leukemia, possibly due to radiation from polonium-210. Frédéric&#x27;s health was also declining, and he died in 1958 from liver disease, which too was said to be the result of overexposure to radiation.

Joliot-Curie was an atheist and anti-war. When the French government held a national funeral in her honor, Irène&#x27;s family asked to have the religious and military portions of the funeral omitted. Frédéric was also given a national funeral by the French government.

Joliot-Curie&#x27;s daughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot, went on to become a nuclear physicist and professor at the University of Paris. Joliot-Curie&#x27;s son, Pierre Joliot, went on to become a biochemist at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

===Notable honours===
* Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for the discovery of artificial radioactivity with Frédéric Joliot-Curie.
* Barnard Gold Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1940 with Frédéric Joliot-Curie.

<text>Gabrielle Roy (; March 22, 1909July 13, 1983) was a Canadian author from St. Boniface, Manitoba and one of the major figures in French Canadian literature.

==Early life==
Roy was born in 1909 in Saint-Boniface (now part of Winnipeg), Manitoba, and was educated at the Académie Saint-Joseph. She was born into a family of eleven children and reportedly began to write at an early age. She lived on rue Deschambault, a house and neighbourhood in Saint-Boniface that would later inspire one of her most famous works. The house is now a National Historic Site and museum in Winnipeg.

== Career ==
After training as a teacher at The Winnipeg Normal School, she taught in rural schools in Marchand and Cardinal and was then appointed to the Institut Collégial Provencher in Saint Boniface.

With her savings she was able to spend some time in Europe, but was forced to return to Canada in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. She returned with some of her works near completion, but settled in Quebec to earn a living as a sketch artist while continuing to write.

Her first novel, &quot;Bonheur d&#x27;occasion&quot; (1945), gave a starkly realistic portrait of the lives of people in Saint-Henri, a working-class neighbourhood of Montreal. The novel caused many Quebeckers to take a hard look at themselves, and is regarded as the novel that helped lay the foundation for Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. The original French version won her the prestigious Prix Femina in 1947. Published in English as &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; (1947), the book won the 1947 Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction as well as the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal. Distributed in the United States, where it sold more than three-quarters of a million copies, the Literary Guild of America made &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; a feature book of the month in 1947. The book garnered so much attention that Roy returned to Manitoba to escape the publicity.

There are two French versions of &quot;Bonheur d&#x27;occasion&quot;. The first was published in 1945 by Société des Éditions Pascal in two volumes. This version was translated in 1947 by Hannah Josephson, who removed several short passages from the English version. In 1965, Librairie Beauchemin published an abridged French version eliminating a number of passages. This second version was translated by Alan Brown in 1980. As a result, there has never been an unabridged version of &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; published in English.

In August 1947, she married Marcel Carbotte, a Saint Boniface doctor, and the couple set off for Europe where Carbotte studied gynecology and Roy spent her time writing.

&quot;Where Nests the Water Hen&quot;, Gabrielle Roy&#x27;s second novel, is a sensitive and sympathetic tale that captures both the innocence and the vitality of a sparsely populated frontier.

Another of her novels brought additional critical acclaim. &quot;Alexandre Chenevert&quot; (1954), is a dark and emotional story that is ranked as one of the most significant works of psychological realism in the history of Canadian literature.

She is considered by many to be one of the most important Francophone writers in Canadian history and one of the most influential Canadian authors. In 1963, she was on a panel that gave the Montreal World&#x27;s Fair, Expo 67, its theme: &quot;Terre des hommes&quot; or in English &quot;Man and His World&quot;. It was her suggestion to use Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 1939 book title as the organizing theme. In 2016, Margaret Atwood, who had read her books as a teenager, wrote an essay about her career, and noted that her works were still more relevant than ever.

Gabrielle Roy died in 1983 at the age of seventy-four. Her autobiography, &quot;La Détresse et l&#x27;enchantement&quot;, was published posthumously and translated in 1984 by Patricia Claxton, a prominent Quebec translator who is considered the primary translator of Gabrielle Roy&#x27;s works from French to English. Her translation of Gabrielle Roy&#x27;s autobiography, translated into English as &quot;Enchantment and Sorrow&quot; was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1987. The autobiography covers the years from Gabrielle Roy&#x27;s childhood in Manitoba to the time when she settled in Quebec. 

The movie &quot;Tramp at the Door&quot;, based on Roy&#x27;s short story and released in 1985, was dedicated to her memory.

Patricia Claxton won her second Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1999 for translating François Ricard&#x27;s biography of Gabrielle Roy.

<doc id="62075" wikidata="Q531563" url="?curid=62075" title="Harold Robbins">
<text>Harold Robbins (May 21, 1916 – October 14, 1997) was an American author of popular novels. One of the best-selling writers of all time, he wrote over 25 best-sellers, selling over 750 million copies in 32 languages.

==Early life==
Robbins was born Harold Rubin in New York City in 1916, the son of Frances &quot;Fannie&quot; Smith and Charles Rubin. His parents were well-educated Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire, his father from Odessa and his mother from Neshwies (Nyasvizh), south of Minsk. Robbins later falsely claimed to be a Jewish orphan who had been raised in a Catholic boys&#x27; home. Instead he was raised by his father, a pharmacist, and his stepmother, Blanche, in Brooklyn.

Robbins dropped out of high school at 15 to enlist in the U.S. Navy. He claimed to have served on a submarine that was torpedoed, leaving him as the sole survivor; in fact, no U.S. submarines were torpedoed during the 1930s.

Robbins worked a variety of jobs, including errand boy, bookies&#x27; runner, and inventory clerk in a grocers. He was employed by Universal Pictures from 1940 to 1957, starting off as a clerk and rising to an executive.

==Work==
His first book was &quot;Never Love a Stranger&quot; (1948). &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot; (1949) was a novel about the American film industry, from its beginning to the sound era in which Robbins blended his own life experiences with history, melodrama, sex, and glossy high society into a fast-moving story. His 1952 novel, &quot;A Stone for Danny Fisher,&quot; was adapted into a 1958 motion picture &quot;King Creole&quot;, which starred Elvis Presley.

Among his best-known books is &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1961) – featuring a protagonist who was a loose composite of Howard Hughes, Bill Lear, Harry Cohn, and Louis B. Mayer. &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; takes the reader from New York to California, from the prosperity of the aeronautical industry to the glamor of Hollywood. Its sequel, &quot;The Raiders&quot;, was released in 1995.

Film producer Joseph E. Levine acquired the rights to &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; in September 1962 and produced the 1964 film. He also acquired the rights to Robbins&#x27;s next book &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; (1962) with the film version also released in 1964. In 1963, Levine paid Robbins $1 million for pre-publication and film rights for Robbins&#x27;s upcoming book &quot;The Adventurers&quot;. The book was released in 1966 and was based on Robbins&#x27;s experiences living in South America, including three months spent in the mountains of Colombia with a group of bandits. The film version was released in 1970. Robbins also created the ABC television series &quot;The Survivors&quot; (1969–1970), starring Ralph Bellamy and Lana Turner.

Robbins&#x27;s editors included Cynthia White and Michael Korda and his literary agent was Paul Gitlin.

In July 1989, Robbins was involved in a literary controversy when the trade periodical &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; revealed that around four pages from Robbins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1974) had been lifted without permission and integrated into Kathy Acker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec&quot; (1975), which had recently been re-published in the UK in a selection of early works by Acker titled &quot;Young Lust&quot; (1989). After Paul Gitlin saw the exposé in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, he informed Robbins&#x27;s UK publisher, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who requested that Acker&#x27;s publisher Unwin Hyman withdraw and pulp &quot;Young Lust&quot;. Representatives for the novelist explained that Acker was well known for her deliberate use of literary appropriation—or bricolage, a postmodern technique akin to plagiarism in which fragments of pre-existing works are combined along with original writings to create new literary works. After an intervention by William S. Burroughs—a novelist who used appropriation in his own works of the 1960s—Robbins issued a statement to give Acker retroactive permission to appropriate from his work, avoiding legal action on his publisher&#x27;s part.

Since his death, several new books have been published, written by ghostwriters and based on Robbins&#x27;s own notes and unfinished stories. In several of these books, Junius Podrug has been credited as co-writer.

From the Hodder &amp; Stoughton 2008 edition of &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; &quot;about the author&quot; section:
== In popular culture ==
Robbins is mentioned by name (along with Jacqueline Susann) in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; by Admiral James T. Kirk. His first officer, Spock, then comments that Robbins was one of the 20th century &quot;giants&quot; of literature. Robbins is also mentioned by name by Basil Fawlty in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot;; he refers to Robbins&#x27;s work as &quot;transatlantic tripe, a sort of pornographic muzak&quot;. The band Squeeze mentions &quot;a Harold Robbins paperback&quot; in their song &quot;Pulling Mussels (From The Shell)&quot;. The band Sleeper also state that a character in their song &quot;Inbetweener&quot;, &quot;reads Howard Robbins&quot;. In Roger Corman&#x27;s 1970 post-apocalyptic &quot;Gas! -Or- It Became Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It.&quot;, a young couple uses a public library&#x27;s copies of the collected works of Jacqueline Susann (who took inspiration from Robbins in writing her first novel in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;) as kindling after the woman&#x27;s initial objection to burning library books to keep warm. She says, &quot;OK, but what if we run out?&quot; Her boyfriend says, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s an entire shelf full of Harold Robbins.&quot; In the movie &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, Dr Bryant, played by Michael Caine said he doubts that the examiner of the English Literature course has read &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot;.

==Personal life==
Robbins was married three times, first to his high school sweetheart, Lillian Machnivitz. In 1965 he wed Grace Palermo, who went on to pen an account of her life with Robbins in 2013. Divorced in the early 1990s, Robbins married Jann Stapp in 1992; they remained together until his death.

He spent a great deal of time on the French Riviera and at Monte Carlo until his death from respiratory heart failure, at the age of 81 in Palm Springs, California. His cremated remains are interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City. Robbins has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6743 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Posthumously published novels credited to Robbins===
Works bearing Robbins name continued to appear after his death. The earliest three posthumous Harold Robbins novels (&quot;The Predators&quot; (1998), &quot;The Secret&quot; (2000) and &quot;Never Enough&quot; (2001) are generally thought to have been completed by ghostwriters, but may have been partially or even substantially based on completed work or notes written by Robbins. Junius Podrug has been identified as the uncredited ghostwriter of &quot;Sin City&quot; (2002) and &quot;Heat of Passion&quot; (2003). From 2004-2011, a series of novels credited to Robbins and Podrug appeared, although they are strictly the work of Podrug, writing in Robbins&#x27;s style.

<text>Year 228 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ruga and Verrucosus (or, less frequently, year 526 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 228 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Carthage ====
* The Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca is killed in a battle in Hispania, ending his lengthy campaign to conquer the Iberian Peninsula for Carthage. In eight years, by force of arms and diplomacy, he has secured an extensive territory in the Iberian Peninsula, but his death in battle prevents him from completing the conquest. Command of his army in the Iberian Peninsula passes to his son-in-law Hasdrubal.
* Hasdrubal makes immediate policy changes, emphasizing the use of diplomatic rather than military methods for expanding Carthaginian Hispania and dealing with Rome. He founds Carthago Nova or New Carthage (modern Cartagena) as his capital city.

==== Asia Minor ====
* King Attalus I Soter of Pergamum defeats Antiochus Hierax (brother of the Seleucid king Seleucus II) in three battles and thereby gains control over all the Seleucid domains in Anatolia except Cilicia in the southeast.

==== Greece ====
* The Illyrian queen Teuta&#x27;s governor, Demetrius of Pharos has little alternative but to surrender to the overwhelming Roman force. In return, the Romans award him a considerable part of Teuta&#x27;s holdings to counter-balance the power of Teuta. Meanwhile, the Roman army lands further north at Apollonia. The combined Roman army and fleet proceed northward together, subduing one town after another and besieging Shkodra, the Illyrian capital.
* Archidamus V, brother of the murdered Spartan King Agis IV, is called back to Sparta by the Agiad King Cleomenes III, who has no counterpart on the throne by then. However, Archidamus V is assassinated shortly after returning.

==== China ====
* The State of Qin, its armies led by Wang Jian, completes the conquest of the State of Zhao.
* The remnants of the Zhao monarchy form a remnant state in Dai.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Ai of Chu, king of the Chu State (Warring States Period)
* Archidamus V, king of Sparta of the Eurypontid line
* Arsames I, king of Armenia, Sophene and Commagene
* Hamilcar Barca, Carthaginian general who has assumed command of the Carthaginian forces in Sicily during the last years of the First Punic War with Rome, helped Carthage win the Mercenary War and brought extensive territory in the Iberian Peninsula under Carthaginian control (b. c. 270 BC)
* You of Chu, king of the Chu State (Warring States Period)

<text>The Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was a government agency that regulated United States radio communication from its creation in 1927 until 1934, when it was succeeded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FRC was established by the Radio Act of 1927, which replaced the Radio Act of 1912 after the earlier law was found to lack sufficient oversight provisions, especially for regulating broadcasting stations. In addition to increased regulatory powers, the FRC introduced the standard that, in order to receive a license, a radio station had to be shown to be &quot;in the public interest, convenience, or necessity&quot;.

==Previous regulation==
===Radio Act of 1912===

Although radio communication (originally known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;) was developed in the late 1890s, it was largely unregulated in the United States until the passage of the Radio Act of 1912. This law set up procedures for the Department of Commerce to license radio transmitters, which initially consisted primarily of maritime and amateur stations. The broadcasting of news and entertainment to the general public, which began to be developed early 1920s, was not foreseen by this legislation.

The first Commerce Department regulations specifically addressing broadcasting were adopted on December 1, 1921, when two wavelengths were set aside for stations making broadcasts intended for a general audience: 360 meters (833 kHz) for &quot;entertainment&quot;, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for &quot;market and weather reports&quot;. The number of broadcasting stations grew tremendously in 1922, numbering over 500 in the United States by the end of the year. The number of reserved transmitting frequencies also expanded, and by 1925, the &quot;broadcast band&quot; consisted of the frequencies from 550 kHz to 1500 kHz, in ten kHz steps.

Herbert Hoover became the Secretary of Commerce in March 1921, and thus assumed primary responsibility for shaping radio broadcasting during its earliest days, which was a difficult task in a fast-changing environment. To aid decision-making, he sponsored a series of four national conferences from 1922 to 1925, where invited industry leaders participated in setting standards for radio in general.

====Legal challenges====
During his tenure Hoover was aware that some of his actions were on shaky legal ground, given the limited powers assigned to him by the 1912 Act. In particular, in 1921 the department had tried to refuse to issue a renewal license to a point-to-point radiotelegraph station in New York City, operated by the Intercity Radio Company, on the grounds that it was causing excessive interference to earlier radiotelegraph stations operating nearby. Intercity appealed, and in 1923 the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia sided with Intercity, stating the 1912 Act did not provide for licensing decisions at &quot;the discretion of an executive officer&quot;. The Department of Commerce planned to request a review by the Supreme Court, but the case was rendered moot when Intercity decided to shut down the New York City station. Still, it had raised significant questions about the extent of Hoover&#x27;s authority.

A secord, ultimately successful, challenge occurred in 1926. The Zenith Radio Corporation in late 1925 established a high-powered radio station, WJAZ, with a transmitter site outside Chicago, Illinois. After being informed that there might not be an available frequency for the station to use, company president E. F. McDonald proposed that, because they only wanted to broadcast two hours a week, they would be happy with an assignment on 930 kHz that was limited to 10:00 p.m. to midnight Central time on Thursday nights, when the only other station on the frequency, KOA in Denver, Colorado, was normally off the air. Despite McDonald&#x27;s initial expression of satisfaction with a schedule of just two hours per week, his tone soon changed. At this time the United States had an informal agreement with Canada that six designated AM band frequencies would be used exclusively by Canadian stations. In early January 1926, McDonald directed WJAZ to move from its 930 kHz assignment to 910 kHz, one of the restricted Canadian frequencies, and begin expanded hours of operation.

Invoking the Intercity Radio Company case rulings, Zenith ignored the Commerce Department&#x27;s order to return WJAZ to its assigned frequency. On January 20, 1926, a federal court suit, &quot;United States versus Zenith Radio Corporation and E. F. McDonald&quot;, was filed in Chicago. McDonald expected a narrow ruling in his favor, claiming that only a small number of stations, including WJAZ, held the &quot;Class D Developmental&quot; licenses that were free from normal restrictions. However, the actual outcome was sweeping. On April 16, 1926, Judge James H. Wilkerson&#x27;s ruling stated that, under the 1912 Act, the Commerce Department in fact could not limit the number of broadcasting licenses issued, or designate station frequencies. The government reviewed whether to try to appeal this decision, but Acting Attorney General William J. Donovan&#x27;s analysis concurred with the court&#x27;s decision.

The immediate result was that, until Congress passed new legislation, the Commerce Department could not limit the number of new broadcasting stations, which were now free to operate on any frequency and use any power they wished. Many stations showed restraint, while others took the opportunity to increase powers and move to new frequencies (derisively called &quot;wave jumping&quot;). The extent to which this new environment resulted in disruption for the average listener is difficult to judge, but the term &quot;chaos&quot; started to appear in discussions.

==Federal Radio Commission==

===Radio Act of 1927===

Prior to the early 1926 adverse ruling on the Commerce Department&#x27;s regulatory authority, there had been numerous efforts in the U.S. Congress to replace the Radio Act of 1912 with a more comprehensive bill, but none of these efforts made much headway. The need for new legislation gained additional importance because, in the absence of federal regulation, stations were taking their individual disputes to the courts, which began to render decisions favoring incumbent stations. This effectively was granting established stations &quot;property rights&quot; in the use of their assignments, which the government wanted to avoid, because it generally considered the radio spectrum to be a public resource.

Despite the recognition that new legislation was needed, there was a lack of consensus whether it should increase the authority of the Secretary of Commerce, which opponents argued would create a too-powerful &quot;Radio Czar&quot;, or if an independent regulatory body was needed, which some disputed was unneeded and overly expansive. The legislation ultimately passed was known as the Dill-White Bill, which was proposed and sponsored by Senator Clarence Dill (D-Washington) and Representative Wallace H. White Jr. (R-Maine) on December 21, 1926. It was brought to the Senate floor on January 28, 1927, and, as a compromise, specified that a five member commission would be given the power to reorganize radio regulation, but most of its duties would end after one year. After a month of debates this bill was passed on February 18, 1927, as the Radio Act of 1927, and signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on February 23, 1927. The Commission&#x27;s organizational meeting was held on March 15.

===Commissioners===


The Radio Act of 1927 subdivided the country into five geographical zones, and specified that one commissioner would be appointed who resided within each zone. Terms were initially for up to six years, although this was later reduced to one year, and no more than three commissioners could be members of the same political party. The FRC&#x27;s commissioners, by zone, from 1927 to 1934 were:

# Orestes H. Caldwell (New York), (editor of &quot;Radio Retailing&quot; magazine); Caldwell resigned February 23, 1929, and was replaced by W. D. L. Starbuck (New York), Patent Attorney, appointed May 1929.
# William H. G. Bullard (Pennsylvania); Bullard died November 24, 1927, and was replaced by Ira E. Robinson (West Virginia), State Supreme Court judge, who resigned January 1932, and was succeeded by the March 28, 1932, appointment of Col. Thad H. Brown (Ohio), lawyer and politico holding various offices including Ohio&#x27;s Secretary of State, who served for the remainder of the FRC&#x27;s existence and was appointed to the FCC in 1934.
# Eugene O. Sykes (Mississippi) served the entire time the FRC existed and was appointed to the FCC in 1934.
# Henry Adams Bellows (Minnesota); Bellows was forced to resign October 31, 1927, and later became chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters. He was replaced by Sam Pickard (Kansas), who resigned January 31, 1929, and was succeeded by Charles McKinley Saltzman (Iowa), who was appointed May 1929, resigned in June 1932, and was succeeded by James H. Hanley
# John F. Dillon (California); Dillon died October 8, 1927, and was replaced by Harold A. Lafount (Utah); Lafount stayed on the FRC until its replacement by the FCC, but he was not appointed to that body. In the late 1930s he became president of the National Independent Broadcasters.

The five initial appointments, made by President Coolidge on March 2, 1927, were: Admiral William H. G. Bullard as chairman, Colonel John F. Dillon, Eugene O. Sykes, Henry A. Bellows, and Orestes H. Caldwell. Bullard, Dillon and Sykes were confirmed on March 4, but action on Bellows and Caldwell was deferred, so they initially participated without pay. In October 1927 Dillon died and Bellows resigned. During the next month Bullard died, and Harold Lafount and Sam Pickard were appointed. It was not until March 1928, after Caldwell was approved by a one vote margin and Ira E. Robinson was appointed as chairman, that all five commissioner posts were filled with confirmed members.

===Responsibilities===

To rectify the limitations of the 1912 act, the FRC was given the power to grant and deny licenses, assign station frequencies and power levels, and issue fines for violations. The opening paragraph of the Radio Act of 1927 summarized its objectives as:
&quot;...this Act is intended to regulate all forms of interstate and foreign radio transmissions and communications within the United States, its Territories and possessions; to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission; and to provide for the use of such channels, but not the ownership thereof, by individuals, firms, or corporations, for limited periods of time, under licenses granted by Federal authority, and no such license shall be construed to create any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.&quot;

Some technical duties remained the responsibility of the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce, and because Congress failed to provide funding for a staff, during the FRC&#x27;s first year the commission was heavily dependent on support from Commerce personnel. Moreover, most of the FRC&#x27;s work was expected to be completed within one year, and the original intention was that a majority of its functions would then revert to the Secretary of Commerce:&quot;Sec 5. From and after one year after the first meeting of the commission created by this Act, all the powers and authority vested in the commission under the terms of this Act, except as to the revocation of licenses, shall be vested in and exercised by the Secretary of Commerce; except that thereafter the commission shall have power and jurisdiction to act upon and determine any and all matters brought before it under the terms of this section.&quot;

Acting as a check on the commission&#x27;s power, &quot;censorship&quot; of station programming was not allowed, although extreme language was prohibited:
&quot;Sec. 29. Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the licensing authority the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the licensing authority which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communications. No person within the jurisdiction of the United States shall utter any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communication.&quot;

However, the &quot;public interest, convenience, or necessity&quot; standard allowed the Commission to take into consideration program content when renewing licenses, and the ability to take away a license provided some degree of content control. This allowed the FRC to crack down on &quot;vulgar&quot; language — for example the profanity-filled rants of William K. Henderson on KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana. But it also led to First Amendment free speech disputes over the appropriateness of some FRC actions.

A forerunner of the FCC&#x27;s later &quot;equal-time rule&quot; required stations to give equal opportunities for political candidates:
&quot;Sec 18. If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station, and the licensing authority shall make rules and regulations to carry this provision into effect: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this paragraph. No obligation is hereby imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate.&quot;

The Radio Act of 1927 did not authorize the Federal Radio Commission to make any rules regulating advertising, although section 19 required advertisers to properly identify themselves. There was almost no mention of the radio networks — notably the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and, a bit later the Columbia Broadcasting System) (CBS) — that were in the process of dominating broadcasting, other than a statement in section 3 that &quot;The Commission shall have the authority to make special regulations applicable to stations engaged in chain broadcasting&quot;.

In early 1928 it became clear that the FRC needed more than a single year to perform its tasks, and its tenure was extended for an additional year. In December 1929 the commission&#x27;s mandate was extended indefinitely.

The FRC&#x27;s regulatory activities, and the public&#x27;s knowledge of its work, primarily focused on broadcasting stations. However, in 1932, in addition to 625 broadcasting stations, the commission oversaw numerous other station classifications, including approximately thirty thousand amateur radio stations, two thousand ship stations, and one thousand fixed-point land stations. On February 25, 1928, Charles Jenkins Laboratories of Washington, DC, became the first holder of a television license.

===Selected major FRC actions===

The most critical issue the FRC faced at the time of its creation was an excess of broadcasting stations, which now numbered 732, all on the AM band. (The FM broadcast band would not be created until 1941). There were some significant technical restraints on the number of stations that could operate simultaneously. At night, a change in the ionosphere allows radio signals, especially from more powerful stations, to travel hundreds of kilometers. In addition, at this time transmitter frequency stability was often limited, which meant that stations broadcasting on nominally the same frequency often were actually slightly offset from each other, which produced piercing high-pitched &quot;heterodyne&quot; interference at even greater distances than the mixing of their audio. Another tool that was not yet available was directional antennas that could restrict signals to specified directions. Overall, the main tools available for insuring quality reception was limiting the number of stations operating concurrently, which meant restricting some stations to daytime-only operation, and in many cases requiring time-sharing, where up to four stations in a given region had to divide up the hours each used on a single frequency.

====General Order 32====
On May 3, 1927, the FRC made the first of a series of temporary frequency assignments, which served to reassign the stations operating on Canadian frequencies, and also eliminate &quot;split-frequency&quot; operations that fell outside of the standard of transmitting on frequencies evenly divided by 10 kHz. The FRC conducted a review and census of the existing stations, then notified them that if they wished to remain on the air they had to file a formal license application by January 15, 1928, as the first step in determining whether they met the new &quot;public interest, convenience, or necessity&quot; standard.

After reviewing the applications, on May 25, 1928, the FRC issued General Order 32, which notified 164 stations that the initial review had found their justification for receiving a license insufficient, and they would have to attend a hearing in Washington, D.C. Moreover, &quot;At this hearing, unless you can make an affirmative showing that public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by the granting of your application, it will be finally denied.&quot;

Many low-powered independent stations were eliminated, although eighty-one stations did survive, most with reduced power. Educational stations fared particularly poorly. They were usually required to share frequencies with commercial stations and operate during the daytime, which was considered of limited value for adult education.

====General Order 40====
With the roster of stations now reduced to a somewhat more manageable level, the FRC next embarked on a major reorganization of broadcasting station frequency assignments. On August 30, 1928, the Commission issued General Order 40, which defined a &quot;broadcast band&quot; consisting of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500 kHz. Six frequencies were restricted for exclusive use Canadian stations, leaving 90 available for the slightly fewer than 600 U.S. stations. The new assignments went into effect on November 11, 1928.

Forty of the available frequencies were reserved for high-powered &quot;clear channel&quot; stations, which in most cases had only a single station with an exclusive nationwide assignment. Although generally accepted as being successful on a technical level of reducing interference and improving reception, there was also a perception that large companies and their stations had received the best assignments. Commissioner Ira E. Robinson publicly dissented, stating that: &quot;Having opposed and voted against the plan and the allocations made thereunder, I deem it unethical and improper to take part in hearings for the modification of same&quot;. Some later economic analysis has concluded that the early radio regulation policies reflected regulatory capture and rent-seeking.

====WGY assignment====
Most of the FRC decisions reviewed by the courts were upheld, however a notable exception involved WGY in Schenectady, New York, a long established high-powered station owned by General Electric. Under the November 11, 1928, reassignment plan, WGY was limited to daytime hours plus evening hours until sunset in Oakland, California, where KGO, transmitting on the same frequency, was located. Previously, WGY had operated with unlimited hours. On February 25, 1929, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia ruled that restricting WGY&#x27;s hours &quot;was unreasonable and not in the public interest, convenience or necessity&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take the FRC&#x27;s appeal, but following oral arguments declined to issue a ruling, after deciding that under current legislation it did not have oversight, thus allowing the lower court ruling to stand.

====KFKB deletion====
KFKB was a popular Milford, Kansas broadcasting station, licensed to an organization controlled by John R. Brinkley, known as &quot;The Goat Gland Doctor&quot; due to his promotion of &quot;sexual rejuvenation&quot; surgery that included implantation of slivers of goat testes.

In 1930 the Federal Radio Commission denied his request for renewal, primarily on the grounds that, instead of being operated as a public service, the station was primarily being run as &quot;a mere adjunct of a particular business&quot;. (In one of Brinkley&#x27;s programs he read listener mail describing medical issues, then recommended medication of dubious value, identified by numbers, over the air. Listeners had to visit a Brinkley &quot;kick back&quot; pharmacy to purchase these items.)

Brinkley appealed on the grounds that this was prohibited censorship, but the U.S. Court of Appeals denied his appeal, stating &quot;This contention is without merit. There has been no attempt on the part of the commission to subject any part of appellant&#x27;s broadcasting matter to scrutiny prior to its release. In considering the question whether the public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by a renewal of appellant&#x27;s license, the commission has merely exercised its undoubted right to take note of appellant&#x27;s past conduct, which is not censorship.&quot;

Denied this station, Brinkley moved his operations to a series of powerful Mexican outlets located on the U.S. border, which helped to lead to implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement in 1941.

====KGEF deletion====
KGEF was a broadcasting station first licensed in late 1926 to Trinity Methodist Church, South, in downtown Los Angeles. Its programming was dominated by long denunciations made by pastor Robert &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Shuler, who stated that he operated the station in order to &quot;make it hard for the bad man to do wrong in the community&quot;, but his strident broadcasts soon became very controversial. After a 1931 evaluation of the station&#x27;s renewal application, chief examiner Ellis A. Yost expressed misgivings about Shuler&#x27;s &quot;extremely indiscreet&quot; broadcasts, but recommended approval. However, a review by the Commission concluded that the station should be deleted, because it &quot;...could not determine that the granting thereof was in the public interest; that the programs broadcast by its principal speaker were sensational rather than instructive and in two instances he had been convicted of attempting over the radio to obstruct orderly administration of public justice&quot;.

The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirmed the Commission&#x27;s decision and held that, despite First Amendment protections: &quot;...this does not mean that the Government, through agencies established by Congress, may not refuse a renewal license to one who has abused it to broadcast defamatory and untrue matter. In that case there is not a denial of the freedom of speech but merely the application of the regulatory power of Congress in a field within the scope of its legislative authority&quot;. The court also ruled that denying license renewal as not in the public interest did not violate the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition of &quot;taking of property&quot; without due process of law. This ruling became final after a petition for &quot;writ of certiorari&quot; requesting review by United States Supreme Court was denied.

====WNYC assignment====

Under the November 11, 1928, reorganization, WNYC, the municipal station of New York City, was given a half-time, low-power assignment. The station appealed on the grounds that it should have been given a full-time authorization, but lost. Even though the station was government owned, the Federal Radio Commission said that city ownership did not give the station any special standing under the &quot;public interest, convenience, and necessity&quot; standard. However, the case was viewed as representative of the preferences given to commercial interests above those of non-commercial stations.

====Davis Amendment implementation====
Section 9 of the 1927 Act included a general declaration about the need to equitably distribute station assignments, stating: &quot;In considering applications for licenses and renewals of licenses, when and in so far as there is a demand for the same, the licensing authority shall make such a distribution of licenses, bands of frequency of wave lengths, periods of time for operation, and of power among the different States and communities as to give fair, efficient, and equitable radio service to each of the same.&quot; The 1928 reauthorization strengthened this mandate, by including a provision, known as the &quot;Davis Amendment&quot; after its sponsor Representative Ewin L. Davis (D-Tennessee), that required &quot;a fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each of the States, the District of Columbia, the Territories and possessions of the United States within each zone, according to population&quot;. This resulted in an additional degree of complexity, for in addition to stations being judged on their individual merits, the commission had to monitor whether in heavily populated areas a decision would cause a zone or state to exceed its calculated quota.

In cases where two or more stations shared a common frequency on a timesharing basis, a station could petition the FRC to have its hours of operation increased by having the other stations deleted. A prominent example under the FRC&#x27;s jurisdiction occurred when a Gary, Indiana station, WJKS, proposed the deletion of its two timeshare partners, WIBO and WPCC, both located in Chicago, Illinois. A major justification was that Indiana was currently under-quota based on the Davis Amendment provisions, while Illinois had exceeded its allocation. The commission ruled in favor of WJKS, however the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the decision, calling it &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot;. The FRC appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court, stating that the issue impacted 116 separate cases pending before it.

A unanimous Supreme Court overturned the District Court, and ruled in FRC&#x27;s favor, upholding the validity of the Davis Amendment provisions. WIBO made a final attempt to convince the FRC that the expression of strong ties to Indiana by WJKS was fraudulent, and WJKS&#x27;s owners were really attempting to establish another Chicago station. This appeal was unsuccessful, and both WIBO and WPCC had to cease broadcasting. In 1934 the Davis Amendment provisions were carried over to the FCC, but they were repealed on June 5, 1936. In 1944 WJKS, after changing its call letters to WIND, moved from Gary to Chicago.

==Replacement by the Federal Communications Commission==
The Communications Act of 1934 abolished the Federal Radio Commission and transferred jurisdiction over radio licensing to the new Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Title III of the Communications Act contained provisions very similar to the Radio Act of 1927, and the FCC largely took over the operations and precedents of the FRC. The law also transferred jurisdiction over communications common carriers, such as telephone and telegraph companies, from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the FCC.

<doc id="62078" wikidata="Q381666" url="?curid=62078" title="USS Housatonic (1861)">
<text>USS &quot;Housatonic&quot; was a screw sloop-of-war of the United States Navy, taking its name from the Housatonic River of New England.

&quot;Housatonic&quot; was launched on 20 November 1861, by the Boston Navy Yard at Charlestown, Massachusetts, sponsored by Miss Jane Coffin Colby and Miss Susan Paters Hudson; and commissioned there on 29 August 1862, with Commander William Rogers Taylor in command. &quot;Housatonic&quot; was one of four sister ships which included , , and . &quot;Housatonic&quot; is recognized as being the first ship sunk in combat by a submarine when she was attacked and sunk by in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, though the Hunley was also sunk in the encounter. 

==Service history==

===Blockading Charleston===
&quot;Housatonic&quot; departed Boston on 11 September and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 19 September to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She took station outside the bar.

===Capture of &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and Confederate counter-attack===
On 29 January 1863, her boats, aided by those of , , and USS &quot;America&quot;, boarded and refloated the iron steamer . The gunboat had driven the blockade runner ashore as she attempted to slip into Charleston from England with a cargo consisting of two marine engines destined for Confederate ironclads and a large quantity of ordnance and ammunition. These imports were of such great potential value to the South that they have been called &quot;the war&#x27;s most important single cargo of contraband.&quot;

It is possibly in the hope of recovering this invaluable prize that the Confederate ironclad rams and slipped out of the main ship channel of Charleston Harbor to attack the Union blockading fleet in the early morning fog two days later. They rammed , forcing her to strike her colors &quot;in a sinking and perfectly defenseless condition&quot;, and moved on to cripple . Gunfire from the rams also damaged and before the Confederate ships withdrew under fire from &quot;Housatonic&quot; to the protection of shore batteries.

===Capture of &quot;Georgiana&quot;===
On 19 March 1863, &quot;Housatonic&quot; and , responding to signal flares sent up by &quot;America&quot;, chased the 407 ton iron-hulled blockade runner ashore on Long Island, South Carolina. &quot;Georgiana&quot;″s cargo of munitions, medicine and merchandise was then valued at over $1,000,000. &quot;Georgiana&quot; was described in contemporary dispatches and newspaper accounts as more powerful than the Confederate cruisers , , and . This was a serious and very important blow to the Confederacy. The wreck of &quot;Georgiana&quot; was discovered by pioneer underwater archaeologist Lee Spence in 1965.

===Further captures, and attacks on Charleston===
&quot;Housatonic&quot; captured the sloop &quot;Neptune&quot; on 19 April as she attempted to run out of Charleston with a cargo of cotton and turpentine. She was credited with assisting in the capture of the steamer &quot;Seesh&quot; on 15 May. Howitzers mounted in &quot;Housatonic&quot;″s boats joined in the attack on Fort Wagner on 10 July, which began the continuing bombardment of the Southern works at Charleston. In ensuing months her crew repeatedly deployed boats which shelled the shoreline, patrolled close ashore gathering valuable information, and landed troops for raids against the outer defenses of Charleston. On Sept 9th, 1863 Charles W. Pickering, Captain of the USS Housatonic, would submit a report to Rear Admiral Dahlgren concerning the men of his command who were involved in the attack on Fort Sumter of the evening prior. He would list men of the 4th cutter- Lieut Edwin T. Brower, commanding. Among the 17 men of Cutter Four was Frederic Augustus James - the report ends with &quot;All the above, with the boat, are missing.&quot;

===Sunk in the first submarine attack===
At just before 9pm, 17 February 1864, &quot;Housatonic&quot;, commanded by Charles Pickering, was maintaining her station in the blockade outside the bar. Robert F. Flemming, Jr., a black landsman, first sighted an object in the water 100 yards off, approaching the ship. &quot;It had the appearance of a plank moving in the water,&quot; Pickering later reported. Although the chain was slipped, the engine backed, and all hands were called to quarters, it was too late. Within two minutes of the first sighting, the Confederate submarine rammed her spar torpedo into &quot;Housatonic&quot;″s starboard side, forward of the mizzenmast, in history&#x27;s first successful submarine attack on a warship. Before the rapidly sinking ship went down, the crew managed to lower two boats which took all the men they could hold; most others saved themselves by climbing into the rigging which remained above water after the stricken ship settled on the bottom. Two officers and three men in &quot;Housatonic&quot; died. The Confederate submarine escaped but was lost with all hands not long after this action; new evidence announced by archaeologists in 2013 indicates that the submarine may have been much closer to the point of detonation than previously realized, thus damaging the submarine as well. In 2017, researchers at Duke University further established through simulation that the Hunley&#x27;s crew were most likely killed immediately at their posts by the blast&#x27;s pressure wave damaging their lungs and brains.

==Wreck==
On February 20, 1864, Capt. Joseph W. Green of the USS &quot;Canandaigua&quot; surveyed the wreck and observed that the ship&#x27;s spar deck was about [ below the water and that the deck &quot;appears to have been entirely blown off.&quot; Soon thereafter, the Union began recovery efforts to raise the &quot;Housatonic&quot;″s guns, which was accomplished later in 1864. In 1872, the Army Corps of Engineers commissioned Benjamin Maillefert to clear some of the wrecks from the Charleston Harbor, including the &quot;Housatonic&quot;. Throughout 1873 and 1874, Maillefert scavenged the wreck of any useful materials, and in 1909, the remnants of the ship (notably, its boilers) were further broken up to ensure the wreck was not a hazard. In 199596, NUMA-funded researchers tentatively located the wreck of the &quot;Housatonic&quot;, and in 1999, the wreck was surveyed by researchers from the Submerged Resources Center, the Naval Historical Center, and SCIAA.

<text>H. L. Hunley, also known as the Hunley, CSS &quot;H. L. Hunley, orCSS &quot;Hunley, was a submarine of the Confederate States of America that played a small part in the American Civil War. &quot;Hunley&quot; demonstrated the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to sink a warship (), although &quot;Hunley&quot; was not completely submerged and, following her attack, was lost along with her crew before she could return to base. Twenty-one crewmen died in the three sinkings of &quot;Hunley&quot; during her short career. She was named for her inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley, shortly after she was taken into government service under the control of the Confederate States Army at Charleston, South Carolina.

&quot;Hunley&quot;, nearly long, was built at Mobile, Alabama, and launched in July 1863. She was then shipped by rail on 12 August 1863 to Charleston. &quot;Hunley&quot; (then referred to as the &quot;fish boat&quot;, the &quot;fish torpedo boat&quot;, or the &quot;porpoise&quot;) sank on 29 August 1863 during a test run, killing five members of her crew. She sank again on 15 October 1863, killing all eight of her second crew, including Horace Lawson Hunley himself, who was aboard at the time, even though he was not a member of the Confederate military. Both times &quot;Hunley&quot; was raised and returned to service.

On 17 February 1864, &quot;Hunley&quot; attacked and sank the 1,240-ton United States Navy screw sloop-of-war &quot;Housatonic&quot;, which had been on Union blockade-duty in Charleston&#x27;s outer harbor. &quot;Hunley&quot; did not survive the attack and sank, taking all eight members of her third crew with her, and was lost.

Finally located in 1995, &quot;Hunley&quot; was raised in 2000 and is on display in North Charleston, South Carolina, at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center on the Cooper River. Examination in 2012 of recovered &quot;Hunley&quot; artifacts suggested that the submarine was as close as to her target, &quot;Housatonic&quot;, when her deployed torpedo exploded, which caused the submarine&#x27;s sinking.

== Historical context ==
The Civil War, April 12, 1861 – April 9, 1865, was a domestic American war where the Union (also called the North) was locked in combat with the Confederates (also called the South).

In the beginning of the war, combat was fought with bayonets, horses, wooden ships, and imprecise artillery. During the course of the battle the weaponry changed and such things as: mines, accurate guns, more deadly bullets, torpedoes, and &quot;ironclad&quot; ships became a new standard. Though most of the fighting occurred on land, a critical element of the war was the power struggle at sea. Whichever side controlled the coastline also controlled the shipping imports from Europe and Coastal America, which contained critical resources such as clothes, food, artillery, medicine, and, at times, reinforcements. The Hunley was created to destroy the Union blockade and help gain this all-important coastline advantage.

== Predecessors ==
Horace Lawson Hunley provided financing for James McClintock to design three submarines: in New Orleans, Louisiana, built in Mobile, and &quot;Hunley&quot;.

While the United States Navy was constructing its first submarine , in late 1861, the Confederacy was developing their own. Likely having within them an incessant loyalty to the Confederate states as well as understanding the financial gains that would come from sinking enemy ships, Hunley, McClintock, and Baxter Watson first built &quot;Pioneer.&quot; She was tested in February 1862 in the Mississippi River and was later towed to Lake Pontchartrain for additional trials. The Union advance towards New Orleans caused the men to abandon development, however, and &quot;Pioneer&quot; was scuttled the following month.
McClintock noted the significance that a boat capable of moving in any direction at any depth could be made, but ultimately decided that such a vessel could be improved. Hunley, Watson, and McClintock moved to Mobile to develop a second submarine, &quot;American Diver.&quot; They collaborated with Park &amp; Lyons machine shops owners, Thomas Park and Thomas Lyons, in the construction of the vessel. Their efforts were supported by the Confederate States Army. Lieutenant William Alexander of the 21st Alabama Infantry Regiment was assigned to oversee the project. The builders experimented with several methods of providing the new submarine with self-propulsion, including McClintock&#x27;s electromagnetic drive, followed by a custom steam engine, but eventually settled on a simple hand-cranked propulsion system as they felt that the time and money lost in implementing such an engine would not be worth the trouble. &quot;American Diver&quot; was ready for harbor trials by January 1863, but she proved too slow to be practical. Nonetheless, it was decided to tow the submarine down the bay to Fort Morgan and attempt an attack on the Union blockade. However, the submarine foundered in the rough waters caused by foul weather and the currents at the mouth of Mobile Bay and sank. The crew escaped, but the boat was not recovered.

== Construction and testing ==


Construction of &quot;Hunley&quot; began soon after the loss of &quot;American Diver&quot;. At this stage, &quot;Hunley&quot; was variously referred to as the &quot;fish boat&quot;, the &quot;fish torpedo boat&quot;, or the &quot;porpoise&quot;. Legend held that &quot;Hunley&quot; was made from a cast-off steam boiler—perhaps because a cutaway drawing by William Alexander, who had seen her, showed a short and stubby machine. In fact, &quot;Hunley&quot; was designed and built for her role, and the sleek, modern-looking craft shown in R.G. Skerrett&#x27;s 1902 drawing is an accurate representation. Each end was equipped with ballast tanks that could be flooded by valves or pumped dry by hand pumps. Extra ballast was added using iron weights bolted to the underside of the hull. If the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency, the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel.

The hull of the ship is estimated to originally have been 4 feet 3 inches (1.30) in diameter. The two hatches, accessible by means of conning tower, located in the forward and aft of the vessel, are estimated to have originally measured at 16.5 inches (420 mm) in width and 21 inches (530 mm) in length. The small sizing of the hatches and the cramped quarters made entering, exiting, and maneuvering about the ship remarkably difficult. Hunley was designed for a crew of eight, seven to turn the hand-cranked ducted propeller at about 3.5 horsepower (2.6 kW), and one to steer and direct the boat. At the height of its speed, Hunley could reach 4 knots [Wills, 2017].

By July 1863, &quot;Hunley&quot; was ready for a demonstration. Supervised by Confederate Admiral Franklin Buchanan, &quot;Hunley&quot; successfully attacked a coal flatboat in Mobile Bay. Following this, the submarine was shipped by rail to Charleston, South Carolina, on 12 August 1863. However, the Confederate military seized the submarine from her private builders and owners shortly after arriving, turning her over to the Confederate Army. &quot;Hunley&quot; would operate as a Confederate Army vessel from then on, although Horace Hunley and his partners would remain involved in her further testing and operation. While sometimes called CSS &quot;Hunley&quot;, she was never officially commissioned into service.

Confederate Navy Lieutenant John A. Payne of CSS &quot;Chicora&quot; volunteered to be &quot;Hunley&quot;″s captain, and seven men from &quot;Chicora&quot; and CSS &quot;Palmetto State&quot; volunteered to operate her. On 29 August 1863, &quot;Hunley&quot;″s new crew was preparing to make a test dive when Lieutenant Payne accidentally stepped on the lever controlling the sub&#x27;s diving planes as she was running on the surface. This caused &quot;Hunley&quot; to dive with one of her hatches still open. Payne and two others escaped, but the other five crewmen drowned.
&quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; crew lost 29 August 1863:
* Michael Cane
* Nicholas Davis
* Frank Doyle
* John Kelly
* Absolum Williams

The Confederate Army took control of &quot;Hunley&quot;, with all orders coming directly from General P. G. T. Beauregard, with Lt. George E. Dixon placed in charge. On 15 October 1863, &quot;Hunley&quot; failed to surface after a mock attack, killing all eight crewmen. Among these was Hunley himself, who had joined the crew for the exercise and possibly had taken over command from Dixon for the attack maneuver. The Confederate Navy once more salvaged the submarine and returned her to service.
&quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; Crew lost 15 October 1863:
* Horace Hunley
* Thomas S. Parks
* Henry Beard.
* R. Brookbanks
* John Marshall
* Charles McHugh
* Joseph Patterson
* Charles L. Sprague

== Armament ==

&quot;Hunley&quot; was initially intended to attack by using a floating explosive charge with a contact fuse (a torpedo in 19th-century terminology). The Hunley&#x27;s methodology of deploying the explosive charge consisted of them diving beneath the ship and catching the charge on the side/hull of the vessel and re-emerging outside of the blast range of the explosive. This plan was discredited and not used as the possibility of &quot;Hunley&quot; becoming entangled in the rope, the rope drifting away from the ship, or the charge exploding on the submarine was too great.

Instead, a spar torpedo—a copper cylinder containing of black powder—was attached to a -long wooden spar, as seen in illustrations made at this time. Mounted on &quot;Hunley&quot;″s bow, the spar was to be used when the submarine was or more below the surface. Previous spar torpedoes had been designed with a barbed point: the spar torpedo would be jammed in the target&#x27;s side by ramming and then detonated by a mechanical trigger attached to the submarine by a line so that as she backed away from her target, the torpedo would set off. However, archaeologists working on &quot;Hunley&quot; discovered evidence, including a spool of copper wire and components of a battery, that it may have been electrically detonated. In the configuration used in the attack on &quot;Housatonic&quot;, it appears &quot;Hunley&quot;″s torpedo had no barbs and was designed to explode on contact as it was pushed against an enemy vessel at close range. After Horace Hunley&#x27;s death, General Beauregard ordered that the submarine should no longer be used to attack underwater. An iron pipe was then attached to her bow, angled downwards so the explosive charge would be delivered sufficiently underwater to make it effective. This was the same method developed for the earlier &quot;David&quot; surface attack craft used successfully against the USS &quot;New Ironsides&quot;. &quot;The Confederate Veteran&quot; of 1902 printed a reminiscence authored by an engineer stationed at Battery Marshall who, with another engineer, made adjustments to the iron pipe mechanism before &quot;Hunley&quot; left on her last fatal mission on 17 February 1864. A drawing of the iron pipe spar, confirming her &quot;David&quot; type configuration, was published in early histories of submarine warfare.

== Attack on &quot;Housatonic&quot; ==

&quot;Hunley&quot; made her only attack against an enemy target on the night of 17 February 1864. The target was United States Navy ship, USS &quot;Housatonic&quot;, a wooden-hulled steam-powered screw sloop-of-war with 12 large cannons, which was stationed at the entrance to Charleston, about offshore. &quot;Hunley&quot; happened to be on patrol around that area at the time. Helmed by Lieutenant George E. Dixon with a crew of seven and desperate to break the naval blockade of the city, H. L. Hunley successfully attacked &quot;Housatonic&quot;, ramming &quot;Hunley&#x27;s&quot; only spar torpedo against the enemy&#x27;s hull. The torpedo was detonated, sending &quot;Housatonic&quot; to the bottom in three minutes, along with five of her crewmen. &quot;Hunley&quot; and her crew went missing after the attack. They would not be found for over 100 years.

== Disappearance ==

After the attack, &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot; failed to return to her base. At one point, there appeared to be evidence that &quot;Hunley&quot; survived as long as one hour following the attack, which occurred at about 20:45. The day after the attack, the commander of &quot;Battery Marshall&quot; reported that he had received &quot;the signals&quot; from the submarine indicating she was returning to her base. The report did not say what the signals were. A postwar correspondent wrote that &quot;two blue lights&quot; were the prearranged signals, and a lookout on &quot;Housatonic&quot; reported he saw a &quot;blue light&quot; on the water after his ship sank. &quot;Blue light&quot; in 1864 referred to a pyrotechnic signal in long use by the U.S. Navy. It has been falsely represented in published works as a blue lantern; the lantern eventually found on the recovered &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; had a clear, not a blue, lens. Pyrotechnic &quot;blue light&quot; could be seen easily over the distance between Battery Marshall and the site of &quot;Hunley&quot;″s attack on &quot;Housatonic&quot;.

After signaling, Dixon&#x27;s plan could have been to take his submarine underwater to make a return to Sullivan&#x27;s Island, although he left no confirmed documentation of this plan. At one point, the finders of &quot;Hunley&quot; suggested she was unintentionally rammed by USS &quot;Canandaigua&quot; when that warship was going to rescue the crew of &quot;Housatonic&quot;, but no such damage was found when she was raised from the bottom of the harbor. Instead, all evidence and analysis eventually pointed to the instantaneous death of &quot;Hunley&quot;″s entire crew at the moment of the spar torpedo&#x27;s contact with the hull of &quot;Housatonic&quot;. Upon removal of the silt inside the hull, the skeletons of the crewmembers were found seated at their stations with no signs of skeletal trauma. In October 2008, scientists reported they had found that the crew of &quot;Hunley&quot; had not set her pump to remove water from the crew&#x27;s compartment, and this might indicate she was not flooded until after they died. In January 2013, it was announced that conservator Paul Mardikian had found evidence of a copper sleeve at the end of &quot;Hunley&quot;″s spar. This finding indicated the torpedo had been attached directly to the spar, meaning the submarine may have been less than from &quot;Housatonic&quot; when the torpedo exploded. In 2018, researchers reported that the keel blocks, which the crew could release from inside the vessel to allow the sub to surface quickly in an emergency, had never been released.

The short distance between the torpedo and the vessel, in addition to the signs that the crew died instantaneously and without a struggle to survive, led a team of blast trauma specialists from Duke University to theorize that the &quot;Hunley&quot;″s crew was killed by the blast itself, which could have transmitted pressure waves inside the vessel without damaging its hull. Their research, which included scaled experiments with live black powder bombs, provided data indicating the crew was likely killed by the explosion of their own torpedo, which could have caused immediate pulmonary blast trauma. The Duke team&#x27;s experiments and results were published August 2017 in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;PLoS One&quot; and eventually became the subject of the book &quot;In the Waves: My Quest to Solve the Mystery of a Civil War Submarine&quot;. Although their conclusions have been disputed by archaeologists with the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), the NHCC website disputing the results of the scientific experiments contains several inconsistencies. For example, the website implies that the experiments are not valid because &quot;a 1/8th inch plate at 1/6th scale is only 0.02 inches thick,&quot; but neither of these dimensions is relevant to either the original &quot;Hunley&quot; or the scale model used by Duke.

Years after &quot;Hunley&quot; went missing, when the area around the wreck of &quot;Housatonic&quot; was surveyed, the sunken &quot;Hunley&quot; was found on the seaward side of the sloop, where no one had considered looking before. This later indicated that the ocean current was going out following the attack on &quot;Housatonic&quot;, taking &quot;Hunley&quot; with her to where she was eventually found and later recovered.

== Recovery of wreckage ==

&quot;Hunley&quot;″s discovery was described by William Dudley, Director of Naval History at the Naval Historical Center as &quot;probably the most important find of the century.&quot;


The discovery of &quot;Hunley&quot; has been claimed by two different individuals. Underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence, president, Sea Research Society, reportedly discovered &quot;Hunley&quot; in 1970, and has a collection of evidence claiming to validate this, including a 1980 Civil Admiralty Case. The court took the position that the wreck was outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Marshals Office, and no determination of ownership was made.

On 13 September 1976, the National Park Service submitted the Sea Research Society&#x27;s (Spence&#x27;s) location for &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Spence&#x27;s location for &quot;Hunley&quot; became a matter of public record when &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot;″s placement on that list was officially approved on 29 December 1978. Spence&#x27;s book &quot;Treasures of the Confederate Coast&quot;, which had a chapter on his discovery of &quot;Hunley&quot; and included a map complete with an &quot;X&quot; showing the wreck&#x27;s location, was published in January 1995.

Diver Ralph Wilbanks located the wreck in April 1995 while leading a NUMA dive team originally organized by archaeologist Mark Newell and funded by novelist Clive Cussler, who announced the find as a new discovery and first claimed that the location was in about of water over inshore of &quot;Housatonic&quot;, but later admitted to a reporter that that was false. The wreck was actually away from and on the &quot;seaward&quot; side of &quot;Housatonic&quot; in of water. The submarine was buried under several feet of silt, which had concealed and protected the vessel for over a hundred years. The divers exposed the forward hatch and the ventilator box (the air box for the attachment of her twin snorkels) to identify her. The submarine was resting on her starboard side, at about a 45-degree angle, and was covered in a thick encrustation of rust bonded with sand and seashell particles. Archaeologists exposed part of the ship&#x27;s port side and uncovered the bow dive plane. More probing revealed an approximate length of , with the entire vessel preserved under the sediment.

On 14 September 1995, at the official request of Senator Glenn F. McConnell, Chairman, South Carolina &quot;Hunley&quot; Commission, E. Lee Spence, with South Carolina Attorney General Charles M. Condon signing, donated &quot;Hunley&quot; to the State of South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, NUMA disclosed to government officials Wilbank&#x27;s location for the wreck which, when finally made public in October 2000, matched Spence&#x27;s 1970s plot of the wreck&#x27;s location well within standard mapping tolerances. Spence avows that he discovered &quot;Hunley&quot; in 1970, revisiting and mapping the site in 1971 and again in 1979, and that after he published the location in his 1995 book he expected NUMA to independently verify the wreck as &quot;Hunley&quot;, not to claim that NUMA had discovered her. NUMA was actually part of a SCIAA expedition directed by Dr. Mark M. Newell and not Cussler. Dr. Newell swore under oath that he used Spence&#x27;s maps to direct the joint SCIAA/NUMA expedition and credited Spence with the original discovery. Dr. Newell credits his expedition only with the official verification of &quot;Hunley&quot;.

The &quot;in situ&quot; underwater archaeological investigation and excavation culminated with the raising of &quot;Hunley&quot; on 8 August 2000. A large team of professionals from the Naval Historical Center&#x27;s Underwater Archaeology Branch, National Park Service, the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, and various other individuals investigated the vessel, measuring and documenting her before removal. Once the on-site investigation was complete, harnesses were slipped underneath the sub and attached to a truss designed by Oceaneering International. After the last harness had been secured, the crane from the recovery barge &quot;Karlissa B&quot; hoisted the submarine from the sea floor. She was raised from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean, just over from Sullivan&#x27;s Island outside the entrance to Charleston Harbor. Despite having used a sextant and hand-held compass thirty years earlier to plot the wreck&#x27;s location, Dr. Spence&#x27;s accuracy turned out to be well within the length of the recovery barge, which was long. On 8 August 2000, at 08:37, the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years, greeted by a cheering crowd on shore and in surrounding watercraft, including author Clive Cussler. Once safely on her transporting barge, &quot;Hunley&quot; was shipped back to Charleston. The removal operation concluded when the submarine was secured inside the Warren Lasch Conservation Center, at the former Charleston Navy Yard in North Charleston, in a specially designed tank of fresh water to await conservation until she could eventually be exposed to air.

The exploits of &quot;Hunley&quot; and her final recovery were the subject of an episode of the television series &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot;, called &quot;Hunley: First Kill&quot;. This program was based on a section (&quot;Part 6&quot;) in Clive Cussler&#x27;s 1996 non-fiction book of the same name (which was accepted by the Board of Governors of the Maritime College of the State University of New York in lieu of his Ph.D. thesis).

In 2001, Clive Cussler filed a lawsuit against E. Lee Spence for unfair competition, injurious falsehood, civil conspiracy, and defamation. Spence filed a countersuit against Cussler, in 2002, seeking damages, claiming that Cussler was engaging in unfair competition, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy by claiming Cussler had discovered the location of the wreck of &quot;Hunley&quot; in 1995 when she had already been discovered by Spence in 1970, and that such claims by Cussler were damaging to Spence&#x27;s career, and had caused him damages over $100,000. Spence&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed through summary judgment in 2007, on the legal theory that, under the Lanham Act, regardless of whether Cussler&#x27;s claims were factual or not, Cussler had been making them for over three years before Spence brought his suit against Cussler; thus the suit was not filed within the statute of limitations. Cussler dropped his suit a year later, after the judge agreed that Spence could introduce evidence in support of his discovery claims as a truth defense against Cussler&#x27;s claims against him.

&quot;Hunley&quot; may be viewed during tours at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston. A replica is on display at the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, Mobile, Alabama, alongside the and the .

== Crew ==

The crew was composed of Lieutenant George E. Dixon (Commander) (of Alabama or Ohio), Frank Collins (of Virginia), Joseph F. Ridgaway (of Maryland), James A. Wicks (North Carolina native living in Florida), Arnold Becker (of Germany), Corporal Johan Frederik Carlsen (of Denmark), C. Lumpkin (probably of the British Isles), and Augustus Miller (probably a former member of the German Artillery).

Apart from the submarine commander, Lieutenant George E. Dixon, the identities of the volunteer crewmen of &quot;Hunley&quot; had long remained a mystery. Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist working for the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History, examined the remains and determined that four of the men were American born, while the four others were of European birth, based on the chemical signatures left on the men&#x27;s teeth and bones by the predominant components of their diet. Four men had eaten plenty of corn, an American diet, while the remainder ate mostly wheat and rye, a mainly European diet. By examining Civil War records and conducting DNA testing with possible relatives, forensic genealogist Linda Abrams identified the remains of Dixon and the three other Americans: Frank G. Collins of Fredericksburg, Va., Joseph Ridgaway, and James A. Wicks. Identifying the European crewmen has been more problematic, but was apparently solved in late 2004. The position of the remains indicated that the men died at their stations and were not trying to escape from the sinking submarine.

On 17 April 2004, the remains of the crew were laid to rest at Magnolia Cemetery, in Charleston. Tens of thousands of people attended including some 6,000 reenactors and 4,000 civilians wearing period clothing. Color guards from all five branches of the U.S. armed forces—wearing modern uniforms—were also in the procession. Even though only two of the crew were from the Confederate States, all were buried with full Confederate honors, including being buried with the 2nd Confederate national flag, known as the Stainless Banner.

Another surprise occurred in 2002, when lead researcher Maria Jacobsen, examining the area close to Lieutenant Dixon, found a misshapen $20 gold piece, minted in 1860, with the inscription &quot;Shiloh April 6, 1862, My life Preserver G. E. D.&quot; on a sanded-smooth area of the coin&#x27;s reverse side, and a forensic anthropologist found a healed injury to Lt. Dixon&#x27;s hip bone. The findings matched a family legend that Dixon&#x27;s sweetheart, Queenie Bennett, had given him the coin to protect him. However, the supposed relationship between Bennett and Dixon has not been supported by archaeological investigations of the legend. Dixon had the coin with him at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded in the thigh on 6 April 1862. The bullet struck the coin in his pocket, saving his leg and possibly his life. He had the gold coin engraved and carried it as a lucky charm.

Adam Jon Kronegh of the Danish National Archive identified the J.F. Carlsen of &quot;Hunley&quot;. Johan Frederik Carlsen was born in Ærøskøbing 9 April 1841. The last year he was registered in the census of Ærøskøbing was 1860, when he was registered as a &quot;sailor&quot;. His father was registered as a cobbler, and the teeth of Carlsen&#x27;s remains in &quot;Hunley&quot; still bear significant marks of a so-called &quot;tailor&#x27;s notch&quot;, probably from helping his father with needle and thread from childhood. In 1861, J.F. Carlsen entered the freight ship &quot;Grethe&quot; of Dragør. The ship landed in Charleston in February 1861, where records in the Danish military archives show that Carlsen deserted the ship. In June 1861, he entered &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot; (the Confederate privateer brig originally named &quot;Putnam&quot;) as a mate.

<text>Arthur Frederick Hailey, AE (5 April 1920 – 24 November 2004) was a British/Canadian novelist whose plot-driven storylines were set against the backdrops of various industries. His books, which include such best sellers as &quot;Hotel&quot; (1965), &quot;Airport&quot; (1968), &quot;Wheels&quot; (1971), &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; (1975), and &quot;Overload&quot; (1979), have sold 170 million copies in 38 languages.

==Early life==
Arthur Frederick Hailey was born on 5 April 1920, in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, the only child of George Wellington Hailey, a factory worker, and Elsie Wright Hailey. An avid reader, Hailey began to write poems, plays and stories at a young age. He once said, &quot;My mother left me off chores so I could write.&quot; Elsie encouraged her son to learn typing and shorthand so that he might become a clerk instead of a factory worker.

At fourteen, Hailey failed to win a scholarship which would have enabled him to continue his schooling. From 1934 to 1939 he was an office boy and clerk in London. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1939, and served as a pilot during World War II, eventually rising to the rank of flight lieutenant. In 1947, unhappy with the post-war Labour government, he emigrated to Canada, becoming a dual citizen. Settling in Toronto, he held a variety of jobs in such fields as real estate, sales, and advertising. He was editor of a trade magazine called &quot;Bus and Truck Transport&quot;. During these years, he continued to write.

==Career==
Hailey&#x27;s professional writing career began in 1955 with a script called &quot;Flight into Danger&quot;, which was purchased by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and telecast on 3 April 1956. This story of a plane flight in jeopardy after its crew is incapacitated was &quot;the smash hit of the season,&quot; won enormous acclaim, and was broadcast internationally. It was adapted as a novel by &quot;John Castle&quot; (a pseudonym for Ronald Payne and John Garrod), with Hailey credited as co-author; it was published by Britain&#x27;s Souvenir Press in 1958 under its original title, but renamed &quot;Runway Zero-Eight&quot; (Doubleday) for its 1959 American publication. The story was filmed in 1957 as &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; (Paramount), and for television in 1971 as &quot;Terror in the Sky&quot;.

With the success of &quot;Flight into Danger&quot;, Hailey was in demand as a television writer, and wrote for such shows as &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;Suspense&quot;. In 1959, he adapted his teleplay &quot;No Deadly Medicine&quot; (for which he won an Emmy nomination) into his first novel &quot;The Final Diagnosis.&quot; Published by Doubleday, it is the story of the chief pathologist at a Burlington, Pennsylvania, hospital. The book received good reviews, and was a selection of the Literary Guild of America.
Hailey&#x27;s second novel, &quot;In High Places&quot; (Doubleday) was published in 1962. Dealing with international politics the book was again selected by the Literary Guild, and was a best seller in Canada.

Hailey&#x27;s commercial breakthrough came in 1965 with publication of &quot;Hotel&quot; (Doubleday), which followed five days in the lives of employees and residents of New Orleans&#x27; luxurious St. Gregory Hotel. The book spent 48 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, peaking at No. 3, and became the eighth highest-selling novel of the year. It established the template for Hailey&#x27;s future works: ordinary people involved in extraordinary situations in a business or industry which is described in meticulous detail.

Following the success of &quot;Hotel&quot;, Hailey moved to California. In 1968 he achieved international fame with his fourth novel, &quot;Airport&quot; (Doubleday), the story of one eventful night at a midwestern international airport. The novel was No. 1 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; for 30 weeks, and became the top-selling novel of the year. The film adaptation, released in 1970, was the second-highest-grossing film of the year (second only to &quot;Love Story&quot;) and received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The success of the film, together with that of 1972&#x27;s &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, led to the proliferation of &quot;disaster films&quot; during the 1970s, which included three additional films in what became the &quot;Airport&quot; franchise.

After the financial success of &quot;Airport&quot;, on the advice of his tax attorney, Hailey moved as a tax exile to the Bahamas settling in Lyford Cay on New Providence Island. He had intended to stay for just two years, but liked it so much that he remained there for the rest of his life. In 1971, he published &quot;Wheels&quot; (Doubleday), set in the automobile industry; like &quot;Airport&quot;, it was a no. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller, and the highest-selling novel of its year. Hailey followed it with two additional no. 1 sellers: &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; (Doubleday, 1975), about the banking industry; and &quot;Overload&quot; (Doubleday, 1979), about an electric utility company.

In 1979, following publication of &quot;Overload&quot;, Hailey announced his retirement. After undergoing quadruple heart bypass surgery, however, he felt rejuvenated, and returned to work. His novel &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; (Doubleday), about the pharmaceutical industry, was published in 1984 and was another major best seller; it became the thirteenth highest-selling novel of the year. His commercial success had declined somewhat by 1990 with publication of &quot;The Evening News&quot; (Doubleday), and with his final novel, &quot;Detective&quot; (Crown), which appeared in 1997. Hailey continued to write, but—except for the slim &quot;The Lyford Legacy: A Brief History of Lyford Cay from 1788&quot; (Lyford Cay Foundation, 2000),—Hailey now wrote only as a hobby.

Arthur Hailey&#x27;s papers are housed at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto, and at the Harry C. Moore Library of the College of The Bahamas.

==Writing method and critical reception==

Hailey would usually spend three years on each book. First, he would dedicate a year to research, then six months reviewing his notes, and finally 18 months writing. His research was painstaking: he read 27 books about the hotel industry for &quot;Hotel&quot;, he spent months at a Detroit car plant for &quot;Wheels&quot;, and he spent time—at the age of 67—with rebel guerillas in the jungles of Peru for &quot;The Evening News&quot;. Hailey had no discernible literary pretensions; he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a storyteller and anything else is incidental.&quot;

Hailey was not a critical favourite. In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Martin Levin called him &quot;a plodding sort of writer.&quot; Martha Gellhorn, reviewing &quot;The Evening News&quot; for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;This is not a book you cannot put down; it is a book you can hardly hold up. It will sell in millions and be translated into 34 languages. Possibly it is more readable in Icelandic or Urdu.&quot; And &quot;Time&quot; magazine, reviewing &quot;Wheels&quot; together with Harold Robbins&#x27;s &quot;The Betsy&quot;, said, &quot;Yes, junk fans, it is a mano a mano for novelists who are all thumbs. Two of the greatest schlockmeisters in the history of solid waste have just published novels about the auto industry.&quot;

But Hailey&#x27;s ability to tell a story was recognised by some critics. In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, John Reed conceded, in a review of &quot;Wheels&quot;, that &quot;Mr. Hailey is nothing if not a competent craftsman.&quot; Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; wrote, &quot;What I had in mind was diversion, and, to tell the shameful truth, I found it.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Old pro Hailey... remains adept at hooking readers with his propulsive brand of storytelling.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hailey was married twice. In 1944 he married Joan Fishwick (1918–2004), with whom he had three children before divorcing in 1950. In 1951 he married Sheila Dunlop (1927–2017), with whom he also had three children. In 1978 Sheila Hailey published &quot;I Married a Best Seller: My Life with Arthur Hailey&quot; (Doubleday), which was not always complimentary, but the couple remained together for 53 years.

Arthur Hailey died at age 84 in his sleep on 24 November 2004, at his home in Lyford Cay in the Bahamas, of what doctors believed to be a stroke.

<text>The Adventures of Robin Hood is a 1938 American epic swashbuckler film from Warner Bros. Pictures. It was produced by Hal B. Wallis and Henry Blanke, directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller.

It stars Errol Flynn as the legendary Saxon knight Robin Hood, who in Richard I&#x27;s absence in the Holy Land during the Crusades, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla band against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The cast also includes Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette, and Alan Hale.

Upon its premiere on May 14, 1938, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was very well received by critics. The film was a commercial success; it grossed around $4 million at the box office, making it one of the highest grossers of 1938.

At the 11th Academy Awards, it received four nominations, winning three—Best Art Direction (Carl Jules Weyl), Best Film Editing (Ralph Dawson) and Best Original Score (Erich Wolfgang Korngold). In 1995, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

Richard, the Norman King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by Duke Leopold while returning from the Third Crusade. Richard&#x27;s treacherous brother Prince John, aided by fellow Norman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, names himself regent of England, increasing the Saxons&#x27; taxes under the pretense of gathering a ransom for Richard.

The Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. Sir Robin of Locksley, a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues Much the Miller&#x27;s Son from being executed for poaching, earning Gisbourne&#x27;s ire. Robin later confronts Prince John at a Nottingham Castle banquet, telling the assembled guests that he regards John&#x27;s declaring himself regent as treason. John orders Robin&#x27;s execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and Will Scarlet into Sherwood Forest. John seizes Robin&#x27;s lands and names him outlaw.

Much is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will encounter John the Little on a log bridge, and after a quarterstaff contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robin&#x27;s band, swearing an oath to despoil the rich while aiding the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a war against John and Gisbourne, dispatching those who abuse their power.

Robin&#x27;s band encounters the rotund Friar Tuck, a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans transporting a shipment of gathered taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and King Richard&#x27;s ward Lady Marian. After their capture, the men are humiliated at a celebratory woodland banquet, with Marian given a seat of honor. Initially scornful, she comes to share Robin&#x27;s views after he shows her examples of Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian&#x27;s presence to thank for their lives being spared.

Having noted Robin&#x27;s focus on Marian during the Sherwood banquet, the sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament, with the Lady Marian presenting a golden arrow as the prize to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his archery skill, and is captured and sentenced to be hanged. Marian aids Robin&#x27;s Men in a scheme to save him. After his daring escape, he scales the palace walls to thank her, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin&#x27;s marriage proposal, electing to instead remain in the castle as a spy.

King Richard returns with several of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard&#x27;s disguise and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin&#x27;s title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. He intercepts Dickon and kills him after a fight.

Richard and his men, disguised as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the king&#x27;s business, Richard accepts Robin&#x27;s offer of hospitality and his condemnation of Holy Crusade, but does not reveal his identity.

Much relays Bess&#x27; news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now certain of Robin&#x27;s loyalty, Richard reveals himself. Robin coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter Nottingham Castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin kills Gisbourne after a lengthy duel, frees Marian, and prompts John&#x27;s men to surrender.

Returned to his throne, Richard banishes John and restores Robin&#x27;s rank, raising him to Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The king also pardons Robin&#x27;s men, and commands Robin to take the hand of the Lady Marian in marriage. As Robin exits the castle with her, he responds &quot;May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made up to that time. It was also the studio&#x27;s second film utilizing the three-strip Technicolor process. The film was, in fact, planned to be shot in black and white for most of its development; the switch to Technicolor happened just three months before production started. It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which was known in the 1930s for socially conscious crime films.

Producer Hal B. Wallis is generally seen as the film&#x27;s creative helmsman. The first draft of the script was written by Rowland Lee, but Wallis objected to its heavily archaic and fanciful dialogue (one line he cited was &quot;Oh my lord, tarry not too long, for I fear that in her remorse she may fling herself from the window. Some harm may befall her, I know.&quot;). At Wallis&#x27;s insistence, the script was heavily rewritten to modernize the dialogue, and whether any of Lee&#x27;s work survives in the completed film is unclear.

The scene in which Robin Hood first meets Prince John, Guy of Gisbourne, and Maid Marian went through several iterations. Initially, the scene was to be at a jousting tournament with Robin tilting against Guy of Gisbourne, mimicking the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, but screenwriter Norman Reilly Raine pointed out that a banquet scene would be much less expensive to produce, and so long as Technicolor was employed, would look just as lavish to the average moviegoer. In another draft, instead of a deer, a slain villager was who Robin Hood brought in and dumped on Prince John&#x27;s table. Wallis felt the use of a dead villager expended all the tension of the scene in &quot;a momentary kick&quot;, and preferred the use of a deer from an earlier draft, which allowed the tension to simmer with the threat of an explosion at any moment. During the brawl where Robin escapes from the banquet hall, Basil Rathbone was trampled by an extra whose spear cut his foot badly, requiring eight stitches to close the wound.

James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his Warner Bros. contract, paving the way for the role to go to Errol Flynn. The filming was postponed three years as a result. Though Olivia de Havilland was an early frontrunner for the role of Maid Marian, for a time, the studio vacillated between Anita Louise and her for the part. De Havilland was ultimately chosen because the success of &quot;Captain Blood&quot; established the pairing of Flynn and de Havilland as a safe bet to help ensure box-office success.

Location work for &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; included Bidwell Park in Chico, California, which substituted for Sherwood Forest, although one major scene was filmed at the California locations &quot;Lake Sherwood&quot; and &quot;Sherwood Forest&quot;, so named because they were the location sites for the Fairbanks production of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at the former Busch Gardens, now part of Lower Arroyo Park, in Pasadena.

Scenes which were filmed, but not included in the final cut include the disguised King Richard brawling with Friar Tuck, and Robin riding off with Maid Marian; the latter would have been the concluding scene of the film, and appears in the theatrical trailer despite not appearing in the film itself.

===Stunts===
All the arrows in the film were shot by professional archer Howard Hill. Those shot with arrows wore clothing padded with balsa wood on protective metal plates; the metal plates prevented injury (though impact was fairly painful), and the arrows lodged into the balsa wood to create the illusion of bodily penetration. Hill, although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, was cast as Elwyn the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham Castle, and later, defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. Hill did, in fact, split one arrow with another during filming (albeit while firing from a much closer range than from which Robin Hood is portrayed as shooting), but it did not look good enough on film, so the shot was redone with some effects trickery. Stuntman Buster Wiles, a close friend of Errol Flynn&#x27;s and his frequent on-set stand-in, maintained that the arrow-splitting stunt was carried out using an extra-large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. This wire can briefly be seen attached to the fletching of the arrow, in the final film. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, &quot;My Days with Errol Flynn&quot;.

Flynn performed most of his own stunts in the film; exceptions include Robin jumping onto a horse with hands tied behind his back (during the hanging scene), scaling the fortress gate and coming down the other side, and a few select shots in the duel between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne.

===Music score===
In 1938, Erich Wolfgang Korngold was conducting opera in Austria when he was asked by Warner Bros. to return to Hollywood and compose a score for &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Music historian Laurence E. MacDonald notes that many factors made the film a success, including its cast, its Technicolor photography, and fast-paced direction by Michael Curtiz, but &quot;most of all, there is Korngold&#x27;s glorious music&quot;. Also, film historian Rudy Behlmer describes Korngold&#x27;s contribution to this and his other films:
In reply to Warner Bros.’ request, Korngold told studio head of production Hal B. Wallis that he was a composer of drama and the heart, and felt little connection to what he perceived as &quot;a 90% action picture.&quot; Wallis was persistent, and Korngold finally agreed to begin composing on the condition that he not have a contract, and work on a week-by-week basis so that he could withdraw if he were dissatisfied with the music he composed. However, Korngold later admitted that the real reason he changed his mind was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s November 1937 meeting with Austrian ministers, which convinced Korngold that the situation was no longer safe in his home country. As Korngold feared, Austria was annexed by the Nazis, and his home in Vienna was confiscated. This meant that all Jews in Austria were now at risk, so Korngold stayed in America until the end of World War II.

Korngold called his film scores &quot;Opern ohne Singen&quot;, operas without singing, but otherwise approached their composition just as he would for the operatic stage. &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was, therefore, a large-scale symphonic work, and despite the studio music department&#x27;s providing a team of orchestrators, including future Oscar-winner Hugo Friedhofer, to assist Korngold, the amount of work was immense, especially for the limited time he was given to compose. In describing this dilemma to his father, Julius Korngold, one of Vienna&#x27;s foremost music critics, the elder Korngold suggested that themes from his 1920 symphonic overture &quot;Sursum Corda&quot; (&quot;Lift Up Your Hearts&quot;) would serve splendidly for much of the most demanding action-scene music, and Erich agreed.

It also gave him his second Academy Award for Best Original Score and established the symphonic style that was later used in action films during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. Modern-day epics such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogies similarly included original symphonic scores. Composer John Williams has cited Korngold as his inspiration in scoring the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. The love theme of Robin and Marian went on to become a celebrated concert piece.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were highly positive. &quot;A richly produced, bravely bedecked, romantic and colorful show, it leaps boldly to the forefront of this year&#x27;s best&quot;, wrote Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times.&quot; The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall. &quot;It is cinematic pageantry at its best&quot;, raved &quot;Variety&quot;. &quot;A highly imaginative retelling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor, deserving handsome box office returns&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it &quot;high class entertainment&quot; with &quot;excellent direction&quot; and an &quot;ideal choice&quot; in the casting of Flynn. &quot;Excellent entertainment!&quot; wrote &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;. &quot;Adventure, romance, comedy, and human appeal have been skilfully blended to give satisfaction on all counts ... The duel in the closing scenes between the hero and his arch enemy is the most exciting ever filmed&quot;. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a rich, showy, and, for all its tussles, somewhat stolid affair&quot;, praising Flynn&#x27;s performance and the action sequences but finding the &quot;excellent collection&quot; of supporting actors to be &quot;somewhat buried under the medieval panoply&quot;. 
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics gave the film a positive rating based on 50 reviews, with an average score of 8.94/10. The film is 13th on their list of the 100 best classic films. Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus as, &quot;Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen&quot;.

===Box office===

&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year, with just over $4 million in revenues at a time when the average ticket price was less than 25 cents.

According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,928,000 domestically and $2,053,000 overseas.

In 1938, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was the eighth-highest-grossing film nationally in the U.S., and the highest-grossing film the same year in the southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas.

Warner Bros. was so pleased with the results that the studio cast Flynn in two more color epics before the end of the decade: &quot;Dodge City&quot; and &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Sir Robin of Locksley,&quot; was announced, but never developed.

==Legacy==
The film&#x27;s popularity inextricably linked Errol Flynn&#x27;s name and image with that of Robin Hood in the public eye, even more so than those of Douglas Fairbanks, who had played the role in 1922. The film became a benchmark for later movie adaptations of Robin Hood.

This was the third film to pair Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (after &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;). They would ultimately star together in nine films, the aforementioned and &quot;Four&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1938), &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939), &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941) and &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), although they shared no scenes in the last film.

Scenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly. For instance, in the 1949 Bugs Bunny animated short film, &quot;Rabbit Hood&quot;, Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John, &quot;Don&#x27;t you worry, never fear; Robin Hood will soon be here.&quot; When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, &quot;It &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot; be him!&quot;). Other parodies were Daffy Duck and Porky Pig in &quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot; (1958) and Goofy and Black Pete in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; episode &quot;Goofin&#x27; Hood &amp; His Melancholy Men&quot; (1992).

&quot;The Court Jester&quot;, a musical comedy starring Danny Kaye, is in great measure a spoof of Robin Hood. Basil Rathbone even appears as the villain and has a climactic sword fight with Kaye.

Most of the Mel Brooks parody &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; relied on this film for its aesthetics, although the plot was almost completely a riff on &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, as well as referencing the 1973 Disney version. Mel Brooks also spoofed the Robin Hood legend in his 1975 television series &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot;.

A fragment of one of the film&#x27;s sword fighting scenes was converted to sprites by Jordan Mechner and used for his 1989 platform game &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;.

Errol Flynn&#x27;s acrobatic swordplay became a crucial touchstone for the light-saber duels choreography in &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies.

In Disney’s 2010 animated film &quot;Tangled&quot;, the appearance and personality of Flynn Rider are partly inspired by that of Errol Flynn, with his surname also being used in homage.

==Comic and Storybook adaptations==
&quot;Knockout Comic&quot; (weekly picture paper, Amalgamated Press, London) No 434, June 21, 1947 – No 447, September 20, 1947, 14 issues, 28pp in black-and-white and drawn by Michael Hubbard) Produced when the film was first revived after World War II, with several deviations made from the film&#x27;s plot, the comic strip&#x27;s storyline is generally faithful to the look and narrative of the Warner Bros.&#x27; film. However, the famous climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy is reduced to a couple of strip panels, with Robin remaining dressed in his earlier monk&#x27;s habit. The strip opens with a joust between Robin and Sir Guy, a scene which was in the original screenplay, but was never actually filmed.

London&#x27;s Ward, Lock &amp; Co. published a thick children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; to coincide with the film&#x27;s opening. Although no year is given it must have appeared early in 1938 since Warner&#x27;s publicity department used the hand-tinted pictures found in the book--whose costume colors are often different from those in the film--for Sunday supplements in newspapers. With very few differences, the storyline hews closely to that of the screenplay, even inserting the fight between Friar Tuck and the disguised King Richard deleted from the final print. 16 color plates and well over 100 black and white stills, all taken from the movie, are scattered throughout the text.

Another, thinner but taller, hardbound edition came out without a date but in what must have been 1955. This is deduced from its dust-jacket, the rear fold-over of which contains an advertisement for Ward, Lock&#x27;s storybook version of &quot;Rogues of Sherwood Forest&quot;, a film which appeared in 1955. In this volume only 8 color plates appeared but all the black and white photos are reprinted and the text is identical to the first version. Yet another edition,similar to the second was produced, again, without a year and also sans dust jacket, the picture from the dust-jacket being printed in color directly onto the book&#x27;s hard cover.

<doc id="62085" wikidata="Q1293813" url="?curid=62085" title="Alexander's Ragtime Band">
<text>&quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; is a Tin Pan Alley song by American composer Irving Berlin released in 1911; it is often inaccurately cited as his first global hit. Despite its title, the song is a march as opposed to a rag and contains little syncopation. The song is a narrative sequel to Berlin&#x27;s earlier 1910 composition &quot;Alexander and His Clarinet&quot;. This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander&#x27;s innovative musical style. Berlin&#x27;s friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.

Emma Carus, a famous contralto renowned for her high lung power, introduced Berlin&#x27;s song to the public in Spring 1911. Carus&#x27; brassy performance of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; at the American Music Hall in Chicago on April 18, 1911, electrified the audience, and she toured other metropolises such as Detroit and New York City with acclaimed performances that featured the catchy tune. Carus&#x27; tour showcased the song in the United States and contributed to its immense popularity.

Amid the success of Carus&#x27; national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Soon after, Berlin&#x27;s jaunty melody &quot;sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards,&quot; and it became &quot;the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912.&quot; Although not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin&#x27;s composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee—a belated celebration of the music which African-Americans had originated a decade prior in the 1890s. The positive international reception of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; led to a musical and dance revival known as &quot;the ragtime craze&quot;. 

Nearly two decades later, singer Bessie Smith recorded a 1927 cover which became one of the hit songs of that year. The song&#x27;s popularity re-surged in 1934 with the release of a close harmony cover by the Boswell Sisters, and a 1938 musical film of the same name starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye. A variety of artists covered the song such as Al Jolson, Billy Murray, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and others. The song had at least a dozen hit covers within fifty years of its release. 

== History ==
=== Composition and difficulties ===
In March 1911, the Ted Snyder Company in New York City employed the 23-year-old Irving Berlin as a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. One morning after arriving at work, Berlin decided to compose an instrumental ragtime number. By this time, the ragtime phenomenon popularized by pianist Scott Joplin and other African-American musicians had begun to wane, and over a decade had passed since the syncopated genre&#x27;s initial heyday in the Gay Nineties.

A tireless workaholic, Berlin composed the piece while in the noisy offices of Ted Snyder&#x27;s music publishing firm where &quot;five or six pianos and as many vocalists were making bedlam with songs of the day.&quot; Berlin composed the lyrics of the song as a narrative sequel to his earlier 1910 composition &quot;Alexander and His Clarinet&quot;. This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander&#x27;s innovative musical style. Berlin&#x27;s friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.

By the next day, Berlin completed four pages of notes for the copyist-arranger. Berlin registered the song in the name of the Ted Snyder Company as E252990 and published it on March 18, 1911. Upon playing the composition for others, listeners criticized the song as too lengthy (&quot;running beyond the conventional 32 bars&quot;), too rangy, and not &quot;a real ragtime number&quot;. In fact, the tune is a march as opposed to a rag and barely contains a trace of syncopation. Its sole notability consists of quotes from &quot;Swanee River&quot; and a bugle call. Due to such criticisms, the tune unimpressed listeners at the Ted Snyder Company.

Undaunted by the lackluster response, Berlin submitted the song to Jesse L. Lasky, a Broadway theater producer planning an extravagant debut for his nightclub theater called the Follies Bergère. Lasky hesitated to incorporate the pseudo-ragtime number into his show. When the show opened on April 27, 1911, Lasky chose only to use its melody whistled by performer Otis Harlan. Thus the song failed to find an appreciative audience.

Fortunately for Berlin, vaudeville singer and baritone Emma Carus liked his humorous composition, and she introduced the song on April 18, 1911, at the American Music Hall in Chicago. She next embarked on a tour of the Midwest in Spring 1911. Consequently, music historians credit Carus for showcasing the song to the country and helping contribute to its immense popularity. In gratitude, Berlin credited Carus on the cover of the sheet music. The catchy song became indelibly linked with Carus in the public consciousness, although rival performers such as Al Jolson later co-opted the hit tune.

Amid the success of Carus&#x27; national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Five days later, Berlin performed the song himself on May 28, 1911, in a special charity performance of the first &quot;Friars Frolic&quot; by the New York Friars Club at the New Amsterdam Theater. A fellow composer in attendance, George M. Cohan, instantly recognized the catchiness of the tune and told Berlin that the song would be an obvious hit. Soon after, Berlin&#x27;s jaunty melody &quot;sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards.&quot; &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; became &quot;the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912.&quot;

=== Cultural sensation ===

Although neither Irving Berlin&#x27;s first commercial hit nor his first composition to attract international attention, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; nevertheless catapulted Berlin&#x27;s career. American newspapers hailed Berlin&#x27;s jumpy tune as the decade&#x27;s musical sensation, and he became a cultural luminary over night. An adoring international press subsequently touted him as the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot;, an inaccurate title as the song &quot;had little to do with ragtime and everything to do with ragtime audacity, alerting Europe to hot times in the colonies.&quot; Baffled by this new title, Berlin publicly insisted that he did not originate ragtime but merely &quot;crystallized it and brought it to people&#x27;s attention.&quot; Historian Mark Sullivan later claimed that, with the auspicious debut of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, Berlin abruptly &quot;lifted ragtime from the depths of sordid dives to the of fashionable vogue.&quot;

Although not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin&#x27;s jaunty composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee—a belated popular celebration of the musical style which African-American composers such as Scott Joplin had originated a decade earlier in the 1890s. The positive international reception of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; in 1911 led to a musical and dance revival known as &quot;the ragtime craze&quot;. 
At the time, ragtime music caught &quot;its second wind&quot; and ragtime dancing spread &quot;like wildfire.&quot; One dancing couple in particular who exemplified this faddish sensation were Vernon and Irene Castle. The charismatic, trendsetting duo frequently danced to Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; and his other modernist compositions. The Castles&#x27; modern dancing paired with Berlin&#x27;s modern songs came to embody the ongoing culture clash between the waning propriety of the Edwardian era and the waxing joviality of the Ragtime revolution on the eve of World. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; wrote in 1913 that:

Writers such as Edward Jablonski and Ian Whitcomb have emphasized the irony that, in the 1910s, even the upper class of the Russian Empire—a reactionary nation from which Berlin&#x27;s Jewish forebears had been compelled to flee decades earlier—became enamored with &quot;the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.&quot; Specifically, British socialite Lady Diana Cooper described Prince Felix Yusupov, an affluent Russian aristocrat who married the niece of Tsar Nicholas II and later murdered Grigori Rasputin, as dancing &quot;around the ballroom like a demented worm&quot; and shouting, &quot;More ragtime!&quot;

Hearing of such behavior, commentators diagnosed such individuals as &quot;bitten by the ragtime bug&quot; and behaving like &quot;a dog with rabies.&quot; They declared that &quot;whether [the ragtime mania] is simply a passing phase of our decadent culture or an infectious disease which has come to stay, like &quot;la grippe&quot; or leprosy, time alone can show.&quot;

=== Continued popularity ===

As the years passed, Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; had many recurrent manifestations as many artists covered it: Billy Murray, in 1912; Bessie Smith, in 1927; Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, in 1930; the Boswell Sisters, in 1934; Louis Armstrong, in 1937; Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell, in 1938; Johnny Mercer, in 1945; Al Jolson, in 1947; Nellie Lutcher, in 1948, and Ray Charles in 1959. Consequently, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; had a dozen hit covers within the half-a-century prior to 1960.

Reflecting decades later upon the song&#x27;s unlikely success, Berlin confessed his amazement at its immediate global acclaim and continued popularity. He ascribed its unexpected success to the farcical and silly lyrics which were &quot;fundamentally right&quot; and &quot;started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.&quot;

In 1937, 20th Century Fox approached Irving Berlin to write a story treatment for an upcoming film tentatively titled &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Berlin agreed to write a story outline for the film which featured twenty-six of Berlin&#x27;s well-known musical scores. 

During press interviews promoting the film prior to its premiere, Berlin decried articles by the American press which painted ragtime as jazz&#x27;s forerunner. Berlin stated: &quot;Ragtime really shouldn&#x27;t be called &#x27;the forerunner of jazz&#x27; or &#x27;the father of jazz&#x27; because, as everyone will tell when they hear some of the old rags, ragtime and jazz are the same.&quot;

Released on August 5, 1938, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; starring Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche became a smash hit and grossed in excess of five million dollars. Soon after the film&#x27;s release, writer Marie Cooper Dieckhaus filed a plagiarism lawsuit. After Dieckhaus presented evidence at the trial, a federal judge ruled in Dieckhaus&#x27; favor that Berlin had stolen the plot of her unpublished 1937 manuscript and used many of its elements for the film. Dieckhaus had submitted the unpublished manuscript in 1937 to various Hollywood studios, literary agents, and other individuals for their perusal. The judge believed that, after rejecting her manuscript, Berlin nonetheless appropriated much of her work. In 1946, an appellate court reversed the ruling on appeal.

== Alleged plagiarism ==

There are allegations that Berlin purloined the melody for &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (in particular, the four notes of &quot;oh, ma honey&quot;) from drafts of &quot;Mayflower Rag&quot; and &quot;A Real Slow Drag&quot; by prolific composer Scott Joplin. Berlin and Joplin were acquaintances in New York, and Berlin had opportunities to hear Joplin&#x27;s scores prior to publication. At the time, &quot;one of Berlin&#x27;s functions at the Ted Snyder Music Company was to be on the lookout for publishable music by other composers.&quot;

Allegedly, Berlin &quot;heard Joplin&#x27;s music in one of the offices, played by a staff musician (since Berlin could not read music) or by Joplin himself.&quot; According to one account: 

Joplin&#x27;s widow claimed that, &quot;after Scott had finished writing &quot;Treemonisha&quot;, and while he was showing it around, hoping to get it published, [Berlin] stole the theme, and made it into a popular song. The number was quite a hit, too, but that didn&#x27;t do Scott any good.&quot; A relative of John Stillwell Stark, Joplin&#x27;s music publisher, asserted &quot;the publication of &#x27;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&#x27; brought Joplin to tears because it was his [own] composition.&quot; Joplin later died bankrupt after undertaking the financial burden of his unsuccessful &quot;Treemonisha&quot; opera and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave (remaining unmarked for 57 years) in Queens, New York, on April 1, 1917. As writer Edward A. Berlin notes in &quot;King of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era&quot;:

For the next half-century, Berlin was incensed by the allegation that a &quot;&#x27;black boy&#x27; had written &#x27;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&#x27;.&quot; Responding to his detractors, Berlin stated: &quot;If a negro could write &#x27;Alexander,&#x27; why couldn&#x27;t I? ... If they could produce the negro and he had another hit like &#x27;Alexander&#x27; in his system, I would choke it out of him and give him twenty thousands dollars in the bargain.&quot; In 1914, Berlin referenced the allegation in the lyrics of his composition &quot;He&#x27;s A Rag Picker.&quot; The song features a verse in which a &quot;black character&quot; named Mose claims authorship of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band.&quot;

== Lyrical implications ==
Although the 1911 sheet music cover drawn by artist John Frew depicts the band&#x27;s musicians as either white or biracial, Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;—and his earlier 1910 composition &quot;Alexander and His Clarinet&quot;—employ certain idiomatic expressions (&quot;oh, ma honey&quot;, &quot;honey lamb&quot;) and vernacular English (&quot;bestest band what am&quot;) in the lyrics to indicate to the listener that the characters in the song should be understood to be African-American.

For example, an often-omitted and second verse identifies the race of Alexander&#x27;s clarinet player:

<text>Boys Town, officially Father Flanagan&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Home, is a nonprofit based in Boys Town, Nebraska dedicated to caring for children and families.

==History==
Boys Town was founded on December 12, 1917, as an orphanage for boys. Originally known as &quot;The City of Little Men&quot;, the organization was begun by Edward J. Flanagan, a Roman Catholic priest, while he worked in the Diocese of Omaha. Using a loan of $90, he first rented a home at 25th and Dodge streets, in Omaha, to care for five boys. From these beginnings, the City of Little Men developed new juvenile care methods in 20th-century America, emphasizing &quot;social preparation as a model for public boys&#x27; homes worldwide&quot;. Flanagan is now a candidate for beatification.

=== 1917–1921: Early growth and move to Overlook Farm ===
Boys Town quickly grew from the original five boys living in a home in downtown Omaha in 1917 to more than 100 boys by early 1918. The increase required a relocation in 1919 to South Omaha. Flanagan had been contending with criticism about having kids of different races, religions, nationalities, and backgrounds all living together under the same roof. Mounting societal tensions and the need for even more space led to Flanagan’s 1921 decision to relocate Boys Town to Overlook Farm.

In 1921, Father Flanagan purchased Overlook Farm on the outskirts of Omaha and moved his boys&#x27; home there. The move to Overlook Farm was a major step in Father Flanagan&#x27;s plan to create a developed community. In time, the Home became known as the Village of Boys Town. By the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at the Village, which was developed to include a school, dormitories, and administration buildings. Adapting the &quot;Junior Republic&quot; model, the boys elected their own government, including a mayor, council, and commissioners. In 1936, the community of Boys Town was designated as an official village in the state of Nebraska.

By the late 1930s, Boys Town&#x27;s development and staff efforts to court public support had made it the subject of many newspaper and magazine articles. In 1938, producers from MGM Studios traveled to Boys Town to discuss the prospects of a movie about the Home. A few months later, actors Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, along with a 61-member crew, arrived at Boys Town to begin ten days of on-location filming. Tracy won an Academy Award for his role.

In 1943, Boys Town adopted as its image and logo a picture of a boy carrying a younger boy on his back, captioned &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother,&quot; a phrase originating with the United Free Church of Scotland.

When Flanagan suffered a fatal heart attack in Berlin, Germany in 1948, the archbishop of Omaha, Gerald T. Bergan, named Monsignor Nicholas H. Wegner as Boys Town&#x27;s second executive director. The best records available indicate that the home&#x27;s population peaked at 880, in the 1960s.

=== Fundraising controversy and Wegner&#x27;s resignation ===
Boys Town&#x27;s fundraising practices drew scrutiny in 1972 after the Omaha Sun, a local newspaper, investigated the nonprofit after a tip from local Omaha businessman Warren Buffett. The charity was found to have an endowment of over $191 million in 1971, enough to place it at #230 on the Fortune 500, yet continued to fundraise even with a shrinking population and no new expansion projects. Wegner was forced to resign and temporarily halted its fundraising activities. The Omaha Sun received the Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting in 1973 for the story. On October 11, 1973, Robert P. Hupp was named the third national executive director.

== Transition to Family Home programs ==
In late 1974, Boys Town hired its first &quot;Family-Teachers&quot;, a married couple who would begin caring for a small group of youth in a former cottage being converted into a &quot;Family Home&quot;. Three other couples were hired soon after. That core group worked with other staff members to develop formal training materials for the Family-Teachers who were being recruited. As new couples were trained, they moved into newly built homes and converted cottages. By the end of 1975, the last of the dormitories was closed and the transition to the Boys Town Family Home Program was complete.

=== Boys Town admits girls (1979) ===
The executive director Robert Hupp had experience working with troubled girls. He had served from 1946 to 1950 as chaplain, teacher, and athletic coach for a girls&#x27; home run by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd Convent in Omaha. In 1979, a few girls were admitted to live in a Family Home on the main campus. More followed and by 1985, twenty-six girls were citizens of Boys Town.

== National Historic Landmark ==
The national headquarters of Boys Town is in the village of Boys Town, Nebraska; the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on February 4, 1985.

Facilities include the Hall of History, dedicated to the history of Boys Town; the restored home of Father Flanagan; the Dowd Memorial Chapel and the Chambers Protestant Chapel; and the Leon Myers Stamp Center. The latter provides historical stamp-collecting exhibits and sells donated stamps to provide support for Boys Town programs.

It has a summer camp on West Lake Okoboji, located near West Okoboji, Iowa.

== Hospitals and clinics ==
In 1977, Boys Town founded and continues to operate the Boys Town National Research Hospital, located at 555 N. 30th Street in Omaha. Its sister hospital, Boys Town National Research Hospital – West, is operated on the Boys Town campus. The NPO also operates several medical clinics in Nebraska, and one in Iowa.

==National locations==
Boys Town has nine sites across the United States, in Central Florida, North Florida, South Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Iowa, New England, Nevada, and Washington, D.C.

<doc id="62092" wikidata="Q181133" url="?curid=62092" title="Trotskyism">
<text>Trotskyism (, ) is the political ideology and branch of Marxism developed by Russian revolutionary and intellectual Leon Trotsky along with some other members of the Left Opposition and the Fourth International. Trotsky described himself as an orthodox Marxist, a revolutionary Marxist, and a Bolshevik–Leninist as well as a follower of Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Liebknecht, and Rosa Luxemburg. His relations with Lenin have been a source of intense historical debate. However, on balance, scholarly opinion among a range of prominent historians and political scientists such as E.H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, Moshe Lewin, Ronald Suny, Richard B. Day and W. Bruce Lincoln was that Lenin’s desired “heir” would have been a collective responsibility in which Trotsky was placed in &quot;an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)&quot;.

Trotsky advocated for a decentralized form of economic planning, worker&#x27;s control of production, elected representation of Soviet socialist parties, mass soviet democratization,
the tactic of a united front against far-right parties,
cultural autonomy for artistic movements, voluntary collectivisation, a transitional program and socialist internationalism. He supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, and a dictatorship of the proletariat (as opposed to the &quot;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&quot;, which Marxists argue is a major component of capitalism) based on working-class self-emancipation and council democracy. Trotsky also adhered to scientific socialism and viewed this as a conscious expression of historical processes. Trotskyists are critical of Stalinism as they oppose Joseph Stalin&#x27;s theory of socialism in one country in favour of Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution. Trotskyists criticize the bureaucracy and anti-democratic current developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin.

Despite their ideological disputes, Trotsky and Lenin were close personally prior to the London Congress of Social Democrats in 1903 and during the First World War. Lenin and Trotsky were close ideologically and personally during the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Trotskyists and some others call Trotsky its &quot;co-leader&quot;. This was also alluded to by Rosa Luxemburg. Lenin himself never mentioned the concept of &quot;Trotskyism&quot; after Trotsky became a member of the Bolshevik party. Trotsky was the Red Army&#x27;s paramount leader in the Revolutionary period&#x27;s direct aftermath. Trotsky initially opposed some aspects of Leninism but eventually concluded that unity between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks was impossible and joined the Bolsheviks. Trotsky played a leading role with Lenin in the October Revolution. Lenin and Trotsky were also both honorary presidents of the Third International. Trotskyists have traditionally drawn upon Lenin&#x27;s testament and his alliance with Trotsky in 1922–23 against the Soviet bureaucracy as primary evidence that Lenin sought to remove Stalin from the position of General Secretary. Various historians have also cited Lenin&#x27;s proposal to appoint Trotsky Vice- of the Soviet Union as further evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government.

In 1927, Trotsky was purged from the Communist Party and Soviet politics. In October, by order of Stalin, Trotsky was removed from power and, in November, expelled from the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (aka: VKP(b)). He was exiled to Alma-Ata (now Almaty) in January 1928 and then expelled from the USSR in February 1929. As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued in exile to oppose what he termed the degenerated workers&#x27; state in the USSR. On 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in Mexico City by Ramón Mercader, a Spanish-born NKVD agent, and died the next day in a hospital. His murder is considered a political assassination. Almost all Trotskyists within the VKP(b) were executed in the Great Purges of 1937–1938, effectively removing all of Trotsky&#x27;s internal influence in the USSR. Nikita Khrushchev had come to power as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, signing lists of other Trotskyists to be executed. Trotsky and the party of Trotskyists were still recognized as enemies of the USSR during Khrushchev&#x27;s rule of the USSR after 1956. Trotsky&#x27;s Fourth International was established in the French Third Republic in 1938 when Trotskyists argued that the Comintern or Third International had become irretrievably &quot;lost to Stalinism&quot; and thus incapable of leading the international working class to political power.

== Definition ==
According to Trotsky, his programme could be distinguished from other Marxist theories by five key elements:
* Support for the strategy of permanent revolution in opposition to the two-stage theory of his opponents.
* Criticism of the post-1924 leadership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and analysis of its features, after 1933, also support for political revolution in the USSR and what Trotskyists term the degenerated workers&#x27; states.
* Support for social revolution in the advanced capitalist countries through working-class mass action.
* Support for proletarian internationalism.
* Use of a transitional programme of demands that bridge between daily struggles of the working class and the maximal ideas of the socialist transformation of society.

On the political spectrum of Marxism, Trotskyists are usually considered to be on the left. In the 1920s, they called themselves the Left Opposition, although today&#x27;s left communism is distinct and usually non-Bolshevik. The terminological disagreement can be confusing because different versions of a left-right political spectrum are used. Anti-revisionists consider themselves the ultimate leftists on a spectrum from communism on the left to imperialist capitalism on the right. However, given that Stalinism is often labelled rightist within the communist spectrum and left communism leftist, anti-revisionists&#x27; idea of the left is very different from that of left communism. Despite being Bolshevik-Leninist comrades during the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, Trotsky and Stalin became enemies in the 1920s and, after that, opposed the legitimacy of each other&#x27;s forms of Leninism. Trotsky was highly critical of the Stalinist USSR for suppressing democracy and the lack of adequate economic planning.

Overall, Trotsky and the Left-United Opposition factions advocated for rapid industrialization, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and the expansion of a worker&#x27;s democracy.

== Theory ==
Until 1905, some revolutionaries claimed that Marx&#x27;s theory of history posited that only a revolution in a European capitalist society would lead to a socialist one. According to this position, a socialist revolution could not occur in a backward, feudal country such as early 20th-century Russia when it had such a small and almost powerless capitalist class. In 1905, Trotsky formulated his theory of permanent revolution, which later became a defining characteristic of Trotskyism.

The theory of permanent revolution addressed how such feudal regimes were to be overthrown and how socialism could establish itself, given the lack of economic prerequisites. Trotsky argued that only the working class could overthrow feudalism and win the peasantry&#x27;s support in Russia. Furthermore, he argued that the Russian working class would not stop there. They would win their revolution against the weak capitalist class, establish a workers&#x27; state in Russia and appeal to the working class in the advanced capitalist countries worldwide. As a result, the global working class would come to Russia&#x27;s aid, and socialism could develop worldwide.

According to political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz, Trotsky’s theory of “permanent revolution” was grossly misrepresented by Stalin as defeatist and adventurist during the succession struggle when in fact Trotsky encouraged revolutions in Europe but was not at any time proposing “reckless confrontations” with the capitalist world.

=== Capitalist or bourgeois-democratic revolution ===
Revolutions in Britain in the 17th century and in France in 1789 abolished feudalism and established the essential requisites for the development of capitalism. Trotsky argued that these revolutions would not be repeated in Russia.

In &quot;Results and Prospects&quot;, written in 1906, Trotsky outlines his theory in detail, arguing: &quot;History does not repeat itself. However much one may compare the Russian Revolution with the Great French Revolution, the former can never be transformed into a repetition of the latter.&quot; In the French Revolution of 1789, France experienced what Marxists called a &quot;bourgeois-democratic revolution&quot;—a regime was established wherein the bourgeoisie overthrew the existing French feudalistic system. The bourgeoisie then moved towards establishing a regime of democratic parliamentary institutions. However, while democratic rights were extended to the bourgeoisie, they were not generally extended to a universal franchise. The freedom for workers to organize unions or to strike was not achieved without considerable struggle.

=== Passivity of the bourgeoisie ===
Trotsky argues that countries like Russia had no &quot;enlightened, active&quot; revolutionary bourgeoisie which could play the same role, and the working class constituted a tiny minority. By the time of the European revolutions of 1848, &quot;the bourgeoisie was already unable to play a comparable role. It did not want and was not able to undertake the revolutionary liquidation of the social system that stood in its path to power.&quot;

The theory of permanent revolution considers that in many countries that are thought under Trotskyism to have not yet completed a bourgeois-democratic revolution, the capitalist class opposes the creation of any revolutionary situation. They fear stirring the working class into fighting for its revolutionary aspirations against their exploitation by capitalism. In Russia, the working class, although a small minority in a predominantly peasant-based society, was organised in vast factories owned by the capitalist class and into large working-class districts. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the capitalist class found it necessary to ally with reactionary elements such as the essentially feudal landlords and, ultimately, the existing Czarist Russian state forces. This was to protect their ownership of their property—factories, banks, etc.—from expropriation by the revolutionary working class.

Therefore, according to the theory of permanent revolution, the capitalist classes of economically backward countries are weak and incapable of carrying through revolutionary change. As a result, they are linked to and rely on the feudal landowners in many ways. Thus, Trotsky argues that because a majority of the branches of industry in Russia originated under the direct influence of government measures—sometimes with the help of government subsidies—the capitalist class was again tied to the ruling elite. The capitalist class was subservient to European capital.

=== The incapability of the peasantry ===
The theory of permanent revolution further considers that the peasantry as a whole cannot take on the task of carrying through the revolution because it is dispersed in small holdings throughout the country and forms a heterogeneous grouping, including the rich peasants who employ rural workers and aspire to landlordism as well as the poor peasants who aspire to own more land. Trotsky argues: &quot;All historical experience [...] shows that the peasantry are absolutely incapable of taking up an independent political role&quot;.

=== The key role of the proletariat ===
Trotskyists differ on the extent to which this is true today. However, even the most orthodox tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in the revolts of the rural poor: the self-organising struggles of the landless, along with many other struggles that in some ways reflect the militant united, organised struggles of the working class, which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant struggles of previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town- and city-based working-class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution linked to these struggles of the rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of the necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance, in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces; and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.

Trotsky himself argued that only the proletariat or working class were capable of achieving the tasks of that bourgeois revolution. In 1905, the working class in Russia, a generation brought together in vast factories from the relative isolation of peasant life, saw the result of its labour as a vast collective effort, also seeing the only means of struggling against its oppression in terms of a collective effort, forming workers councils (soviets) in the course of the revolution of that year. In 1906, Trotsky argued: 

For instance, the Putilov Factory numbered 12,000 workers in 1900 and, according to Trotsky, 36,000 in July 1917.

Although only a tiny minority in Russian society, the proletariat would lead a revolution to emancipate the peasantry and thus &quot;secure the support of the peasantry&quot; as part of that revolution, on whose support it will rely. However, to improve their conditions, the working class must create a revolution of their own, which would accomplish the bourgeois revolution and establish a workers&#x27; state.

=== International revolution ===
Only fully developed capitalist conditions prepare the basis for socialism. According to classical Marxism, a revolution in peasant-based countries such as Russia ultimately prepares the ground for capitalism&#x27;s development since the liberated peasants become small owners, producers, and traders. This leads to the growth of commodity markets, from which a new capitalist class emerges.

Trotsky agreed that a new socialist state and economy in a country like Russia would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world and the internal pressures of its backward economy. Trotsky argued that the revolution must quickly spread to capitalist countries, bringing about a socialist revolution that must spread worldwide. In this way, the revolution is &quot;permanent&quot;, moving out of necessity first, from the bourgeois revolution to the workers&#x27; revolution and from there uninterruptedly to European and worldwide revolutions.

An internationalist outlook of permanent revolution is found in the works of Karl Marx. The term &quot;permanent revolution&quot; is taken from a remark of Marx in his March 1850 Address: &quot;it is our task&quot;, Marx said: 

His biographer, Isaac Deutscher, has explicitly contrasted his support for proletarian internationalism against his opposition to revolution by military conquest as seen with his documented opposition to the war with Poland in 1920, proposed armistice with the Entente and temperance with staging anti-British revolts in the Middle East. Historian Robert Vincent Daniels believed that the practical differences, in the domain of international policy, between the Left Opposition and other factions had been exaggerated and he contended that Trotsky was no more prepared than other Bolshevik figures to risk war or for the loss of trade opportunities despite his support for world revolution.

=== Socialist democracy and Workers&#x27; Control===

Prior to the October Revolution, Trotsky had been part of a tendency toward radical democracy which included both Left Mensheviks and Left Bolsheviks. His work, &quot;Our Political Tasks&quot;, published in 1904 reviewed issues related to party organisation, mass participation and the potential dangers of substitutionism which he foresaw in a Leninist party model. Trotsky would also assume a central role in the 1905 revolution and serve as the Chairman of the Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#x27; Delegates in which he wrote several proclamations urging for improved economic conditions, political rights and the use of strike action against the Tsarist regime on behalf of workers.

In 1917, he had proposed the election of a new Soviet presidium with other socialist parties on the basis of proportional representation. On the other hand, he had accepted the ban on rival parties in Moscow during the Russian Civil War due to their opposition to the October Revolution. Yet, he also opposed the extension of the ban to the Mensheviks in Soviet Georgia.

In 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party&#x27;s growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. In 1923, Trotsky and a number of Old Bolsheviks who signed The Declaration of 46 raised concerns to the Poliburo concerning intra-party democracy which shared similarities with Lenin&#x27;s proposed party reforms before his death. The signatories of the 46 letter expressed grievances related to the provincial conferences, party congresses and the election of committees. Separately, Trotsky would develop his views further with the publication of the &quot;New Course&quot; in 1924.

In 1927, Trotsky and the United Opposition had argued for the expansion of industrial democracy with their joint platform which demanded majority representation of workers in trade union congresses including the All-Union Congress and an increase of non-party workers to one-third of representation in these elected organs. They also supported legal protection for worker&#x27;s right to criticise such as the right to make independent proposals. According to historian Vadim Rogovin, these proposals would have developed democracy in the sphere of production and facilitated the establishment of worker&#x27;s control over economic management.

Following Stalin&#x27;s consolidation of power in the Soviet Union and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government&#x27;s policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing workers&#x27; self-management and democratic participation in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers&#x27; state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by orthodox Trotskyist theories as degenerated or deformed workers&#x27; states and not socialist states.

In 1931, Trotsky wrote a pamphlet on the Spanish Revolution and called for the creation of worker’s juntas in emulation of elected soviets as an expression of working class organisation. Trotsky stipulated the need for shared participation of the communist factions, anarcho-syndicalists and socialists.

In 1936, Trotsky argued in his work, &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot;, for the restoration of the right of criticism in areas such as economic matters, the revitalization of trade unions and free elections of the Soviet parties. Trotsky also argued that the excessive authoritarianism under Stalin had undermined the implementation of the First five-year plan. He noted that several engineers and economists who had created the plan were themselves later put on trial as &quot;conscious wreckers who had acted on the instructions of a foreign power&quot;.
Polish historian and biographer, Isaac Deutscher, viewed his inner-party reforms in 1923–24 as arguably the first act in the restoration of free Soviet institutions which the party had sought to establish in 1917 and the return of worker&#x27;s democracy which would correspond with a gradual dismantlement of the single-party system.
At the same time, Deutscher noted that Trotsky&#x27;s attitude towards democracy could be characterised as inconsistent and hesitant by opponents but this stemmed from a range of reasons such as the ill timing after the failed revolutions in the West and controversies around party schisms.

In the &quot;Transitional Program&quot;, which was drafted in 1938 during the founding congress of the Fourth International, Trotsky reiterated the need for the legalization of the Soviet parties and worker&#x27;s control of production.

=== Uneven and combined development ===
The concept of uneven and combined development derived from the political theories of Trotsky. This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario. According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to &quot;the entire history of mankind&quot;.

Political scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a &quot;signal contribution&quot; to the discipline of international relations. They argued his theory presented &quot;a specific understanding of capitalist development as &quot;uneven&quot;, insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; regions&quot; across the world economy.

=== Socialist culture ===


In &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot;, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the &quot;first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader&quot; and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories. He had also defended intellectual autonomy in relation to the Russian literary movements and scientific theories such as Freudian psychoanalytic theory along with Einstein’s theory of relativity during the succession period. However, these theories were increasingly marginalised during the Stalin era.

Trotsky would later co-author the 1938 &quot;Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art&quot; with the endorsement of prominent artists Andre Breton and Diego Rivera. Trotsky&#x27;s writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance, limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals.

Trotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised &quot;like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art&quot;. Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as &quot;temporary and transitional&quot; which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.

Political scientist, Baruch Knei-Paz, characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky&#x27;s approach on cultural matters and Stalin&#x27;s policy in the 1930s.

=== Economics ===

Trotsky was an early proponent of economic planning since 1923 and favored an accelerated pace of industrialization. In 1921, he had also been a prominent supporter of Gosplan as a newly established body and called for the strengthening of its formal responsibilities to support a balanced level of economic reconstruction after the Civil War. Lenin and Politburo members had also proposed he served as deputy chairman with a focus on economic matters related to the either STO, Gosplan or the Council of National Economy.

Trotsky had urged economic decentralisation between the state, oblast regions and factories to counter structural inefficiency and the problem of bureaucracy. He had proposed the principles underlying the N.E.P. in 1920 to the Politburo to mitigate urgent economic matters arising from war communism. He would later reproach Lenin privately about the delayed government response in 1921-1922. However, his position also differed from the majority of Soviet leaders at the time who fully supported the New Economic policy.

Comparatively, Trotsky believed that planning and N.E.P should develop within a mixed framework until the socialist sector gradually superseded the private industry. He found allies among a circle of economic theorists and administrators which included Evgenii Preobazhensky along Georgy Pyatakov, deputy chairman of the Council of the National Economy and had more broadly the support of many party intellectuals.

Trotsky had specified the need for the &quot;overall guidance in planning i.e. the systematic co-ordination of the fundamental sectors of the state economy in the process of adapting to the present market&quot; and urged for a national plan alongside currency stabilization. He also rejected the Stalinist conception of industrialisation which favoured heavy industry. Rather, he proposed the use of foreign trade as an accelerator and to direct investments by means of a system of comparative coefficients.

Trotsky and the Left Opposition developed a number of economic proposals in response to the scissor crisis which had undermined relations between the workers and peasants in 1923–1924. This included a progressive tax on the wealthier sections of populations such as the kulaks and NEPmen alongside an equilibrium of the import-export balance to access accumulated reserves to purchase machinery from abroad to increase the pace of industrialization. The policy was later adopted by members of the United Opposition which also advocated a programme of rapid industrialization during the debates of 1924 and 1927. The United Opposition proposed a progressive tax on wealthier peasants, the encouragement of agricultural cooperatives and the formation of collective farms on a voluntary basis.

Trotsky as president of the electrification commission along with members of the Opposition bloc had also put forward an electrification plan which involved the construction of the hydroelectric Dnieprostroi dam. According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation. In exile, Trotsky maintained that the disproportions and imbalances which became characteristic of Stalinist planning in the 1930s such as the underdeveloped consumer base along with the priority focus on heavy industry were due to a number of avoidable problems. He argued that the industrial drive had been enacted under more severe circumstances, several years later and in a less rational manner than originally conceived by the Left Opposition.

Ernest Mandel argued the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement. Notably, Trotsky sought to raise taxation on wealthier farmers and encourage farm labourers along with poor peasants to form collective farms on a voluntary basis in conjunction with the allocation of state resources to agricultural machinery, fertilizers, credit and agronomic assistance.

In 1932–33, Trotsky insisted upon the need for mass participation in the operationalisation of the planned economy:&quot;Insoluble without the daily experience of millions, without their critical review of their own collective experience, without their expression of their needs and demands and could not be carried out within the confines of the official sanctums... even if the Politburo consisted of seven universal geniuses, of seven Marxes, or seven Lenins, it will still be unable, all on its own, with all its creative imagination, to assert command over the economy of 170 million people&quot;.

British cybernetician Stafford Beer who worked on a decentralized form of economic planning, Project Cybersyn from 1970 to 1973, was reported to have read and been influenced by Trotsky&#x27;s critique of the Soviet bureaucracy.

The economic platform of a planned economy combined with an authentic worker&#x27;s democracy as originally advocated by Trotsky has constituted the programme of the Fourth International and the modern Trotskyist movement.

=== Transitional program ===
Trotsky drafted the transitional programme as a programmatic document for the founding congress of the Fourth International in 1938.

He explicitly emphasised the core need for the programme::

&quot;It is explicitly necessary to help the masses in the process of the daily struggle to find the bridge between present demands and the socialist program of the revolution. This bridge should include a system of transitional demands, stemming from today&#x27;s conditions and from today&#x27;s consciousness of wide layers of the working class and unalterably leading to one final conclusion: the conquest of power by the proletariat&quot;.

The transitional programme features three types of proposals for action. This includes democratic demands such as the right of unions and self-determination; immediate demands which are concerned with everyday struggles such as wage increases and transitional demands which are directed at the capitalist system such as worker&#x27;s control of production .

=== Scientific socialism ===

In his collection of texts, &quot;In Defence of Marxism&quot;, Leon Trotsky defended the dialectical method of scientific socialism during the factional schisms within the American Trotskyist movement during 1939–40. Trotsky viewed dialectics as an essential method of analysis to discern the class nature of the Soviet Union. Specifically, he described scientific socialism as the &quot;conscious expression of the unconscious historical process&quot;. According to Daniels, Trotsky conceived historical revolutions as a long, interrelated process of political and social struggle which undergo various stages with national and international dimensions.

Prior to his expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotsky had encouraged empirical studies with the use of Marxist methods for social and historical development. He also insisted on the need for a freedom of science, including theoretical research, in 1925 for socially useful purposes. Trotsky defended Einstein’s theory of relativity in Soviet intellectual circles but this became an anathema during the Stalin era and was only rehabilitated following the latter&#x27;s death.

In line with the scientific outlook of Marxist philosophy, Trotsky placed a heavy emphasis on science to alleviate the level of backwardness among the Soviet masses. Concurrently, he viewed socialism as a progressive struggle for science, culture and morality in which science should be given the maximum scope for development. In 1918, he had supported Taylorism along with Lenin as a means of scientifically managing industries with the support of foreign engineers. Multiple historians have stressed the technocratic nature of his governance proposals compared to Stalin and Bukharin with a higher reliance on &quot;bourgeois&quot; experts and specialists.

Trotskyists have emphasised the dialectical relationship between objective, material conditions and subjective factors such as party, leadership in understanding the nature of change in historical events.

=== United front and theory of fascism ===


Trotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.

After he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in &quot;International Socialism&quot;, his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.

Trotsky also formulated a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933.

Marxist theorist and economist Hillel Ticktin argued that his political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the German Communist Party and Social-Democratic party during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Adolf Hitler from ascending to political power.

=== Political ethics and morality ===

In 1938, Trotsky had written &quot;Their Morals and Ours&quot; which consisted of ethical polemics in response to criticisms around his actions concerning the Kronstadt rebellion and wider questions posed around the perceived, &quot;amoral&quot; methods of the Bolsheviks. Critics believed these methods seemed to emulate the Jesuit maxim that the &quot;ends justifies the means&quot;. Trotsky argued that Marxism situated the foundation of morality as a product of society to serve social interests rather than “&quot;eternal moral truths&quot; proclaimed by institutional religions. On the other hand, he regarded it as farcical to assert that an end could justify any criminal means and viewed this to be a distorted representation of the Jesuit maxim. Instead, Trotsky believed that the means and ends frequently “exchanged places” as when democracy is sought by the working class as an instrument to actualize socialism. He also viewed revolution to be deducible from the laws of the development and primarily the class struggle but this did not mean all means are permissible. Fundamentally, Trotsky argued that ends &quot;rejects&quot; means which are incompatible with itself. In other words, socialism cannot be furthered through fraud, deceit or the worship of leaders but through honesty and integrity as essential elements of revolutionary morality in dealing with the working masses.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
According to Trotsky, the term &quot;Trotskyism&quot; was coined by Pavel Milyukov (sometimes transliterated as Paul Miliukoff), the ideological leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Russia. Milyukov waged a bitter war against Trotskyism &quot;as early as 1905&quot;.

Trotsky was elected chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He pursued a policy of proletarian revolution at a time when other socialist trends advocated a transition to a &quot;bourgeois&quot; (capitalist) regime to replace the essentially feudal Romanov state. This year, Trotsky developed the theory of permanent revolution, as it later became known (see below). In 1905, Trotsky quotes from a postscript to a book by Milyukov, &quot;The Elections to the Second State Duma&quot;, published no later than May 1907: 

Milyukov suggests that the mood of the &quot;democratic public&quot; was in support of Trotsky&#x27;s policy of the overthrow of the Romanov regime alongside a workers&#x27; revolution to overthrow the capitalist owners of industry, support for strike action and the establishment of democratically elected workers&#x27; councils or &quot;soviets&quot;. This differed from variations of Council Communism in Germany due to the Russian Peasantry and the role they have in overall Leninism including Trotskyism compared to the role they have in Council Communism

=== Trotskyism and the 1917 Russian Revolution ===
During his leadership of the Russian revolution of 1905, Trotsky argued that once it became clear that the Tsar&#x27;s army would not come out in support of the workers, it was necessary to retreat before the armed might of the state in as good an order as possible. In 1917, Trotsky was again elected chairman of the Petrograd soviet, but this time soon came to lead the Military Revolutionary Committee, which had the allegiance of the Petrograd garrison and carried through the October 1917 insurrection. Stalin wrote: 

As a result of his role in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the theory of permanent revolution was embraced by the young Soviet state until 1924.

The Russian revolution of 1917 was marked by two revolutions: the relatively spontaneous February 1917 revolution and the 25 October 1917 seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, who had gained the leadership of the Petrograd soviet.

Before the February 1917 Russian revolution, Lenin had formulated a slogan calling for the &quot;democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry&quot;, but after the February revolution, through his April Theses, Lenin instead called for &quot;all power to the Soviets&quot;. Nevertheless, Lenin continued to emphasise (as did Trotsky) the classical Marxist position that the peasantry formed a basis for the development of capitalism, not socialism.

Also, before February 1917, Trotsky had not accepted the importance of a Bolshevik-style organisation. Once the February 1917 Russian revolution had broken out, Trotsky admitted the importance of a Bolshevik organisation and joined the Bolsheviks in July 1917. Although many, like Stalin, saw Trotsky&#x27;s role in the October 1917 Russian revolution as central, Trotsky wrote that without Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, the October revolution of 1917 would not have taken place.

Other Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky agreed that Lenin&#x27;s influence on the Bolshevik party was decisive but the October insurrection was carried out according to Trotsky&#x27;s, not to Lenin&#x27;s plan.

As a result, since 1917, Trotskyism as a political theory has been fully committed to a Leninist style of democratic centralist party organisation, which Trotskyists argue must not be confused with the party organisation as it later developed under Stalin. Trotsky had previously suggested that Lenin&#x27;s method of organisation would lead to a dictatorship. However, it is essential to emphasise that after 1917, orthodox Trotskyists argue that the loss of democracy in the USSR was caused by the failure of the revolution to spread internationally and the consequent wars, isolation, and imperialist intervention, not the Bolshevik style of organisation.

Lenin&#x27;s outlook had always been that the Russian revolution would need to stimulate a Socialist revolution in Western Europe so that this European socialist society would come to the aid of the Russian revolution and enable Russia to advance towards socialism. Lenin stated: 

This outlook matched Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution precisely. Trotsky&#x27;s permanent revolution had foreseen that the working class would not stop at the bourgeois democratic stage of the revolution but proceed towards a workers&#x27; state, as happened in 1917. The Polish Trotskyist Isaac Deutscher maintains that in 1917, Lenin changed his attitude toward Trotsky&#x27;s theory of Permanent Revolution, and after the October revolution, it was adopted by the Bolsheviks.

Lenin was met with initial disbelief in April 1917. Trotsky argues that: 

=== &quot;Legend of Trotskyism&quot; ===

In &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot;, Trotsky argues that what he calls the &quot;legend of Trotskyism&quot; was formulated by Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in collaboration with Stalin in 1924 in response to the criticisms Trotsky raised of Politburo policy. Orlando Figes argues: &quot;The urge to silence Trotsky, and all criticism of the Politburo, was in itself a crucial factor in Stalin&#x27;s rise to power&quot;.

During 1922–1924, Lenin suffered a series of strokes and became increasingly incapacitated. In a document dictated before his death in 1924 while describing Trotsky as &quot;distinguished not only by his exceptional abilities—personally he is, to be sure, the most able man in the present Central Committee&quot; and also maintaining that &quot;his non-Bolshevik past should not be held against him&quot;, Lenin criticized him for &quot;showing excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of the work&quot; and also requested that Stalin be removed from his position of General Secretary, but his notes remained suppressed until 1956. Zinoviev and Kamenev broke with Stalin in 1925 and joined Trotsky in 1926 in what was known as the United Opposition.

In 1926, Stalin allied with Nikolai Bukharin, who led the campaign against &quot;Trotskyism&quot;. In &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot;, Trotsky quotes Bukharin&#x27;s 1918 pamphlet, &quot;From the Collapse of Czarism to the Fall of the Bourgeoisie&quot;, which was re-printed in 1923 by the party publishing house, Proletari. Bukharin explains and embraces Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution in this pamphlet: &quot;The Russian proletariat is confronted more sharply than ever before with the problem of the international revolution ... The grand total of relationships which have arisen in Europe leads to this inevitable conclusion. Thus, the permanent revolution in Russia is passing into the European proletarian revolution&quot;. Yet it is common knowledge, Trotsky argues, that three years later in 1926 &quot;Bukharin was the chief and indeed the sole theoretician of the entire campaign against &#x27;Trotskyism&#x27;, summed up in the struggle against the theory of the permanent revolution.&quot;

Trotsky wrote that the Left Opposition grew in influence throughout the 1920s, attempting to reform the Communist Party, but in 1927 Stalin declared &quot;civil war&quot; against them:

Internationally, Trotsky&#x27;s opposition and criticism of the ruling troika received support from several, Central Committee members of foreign communist parties. This included Christian Rakovsky, Chairman of the Ukraine Sovnarkom, Boris Souvarine of the French Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party which was led by prominent theoreticians such as Maksymilian Horwitz, Maria Koszutska and Adolf Warski.

The defeat of the European working class led to further isolation in Russia and further suppression of the Opposition. Trotsky argued that the &quot;so-called struggle against &#x27;Trotskyism&#x27; grew out of the bureaucratic reaction against the October Revolution [of 1917]&quot;. He responded to the one-sided civil war with his &quot;Letter to the Bureau of Party History&quot; (1927), contrasting what he claimed to be the falsification of history with the official history of just a few years before. He further accused Stalin of derailing the Chinese revolution and causing the massacre of the Chinese workers: 

Trotsky was sent into internal exile, and his supporters were jailed. For instance, Victor Serge first &quot;spent six weeks in a cell&quot; after a visit at midnight, then 85 days in an inner GPU cell, most of it in solitary confinement. He details the jailings of the Left Opposition. However, the Left Opposition worked secretly within the USSR. Trotsky was eventually exiled to Turkey and moved to France, Norway and finally Mexico.

After 1928, the various Communist Parties worldwide expelled Trotskyists from their ranks. Most Trotskyists defend the economic achievements of the planned economy in the USSR during the 1920s and 1930s, despite the &quot;misleadership&quot; of the Soviet bureaucracy and what they claim to be the loss of democracy. Trotskyists claim that in 1928 inner party democracy and soviet democracy, which was at the foundation of Bolshevism, had been destroyed within the various Communist Parties. Anyone who disagreed with the party line was labelled a Trotskyist and even a fascist.

In 1937, Stalin again unleashed what Trotskyists say was a political terror against their Left Opposition and many of the remaining Old Bolsheviks (those who had played vital roles in the October Revolution in 1917) in the face of increased opposition, particularly in the army.

=== Founding of the Fourth International ===
Trotsky founded the International Left Opposition in 1930. It was meant to be an opposition group within the Comintern, but anyone who joined or was suspected of joining the ILO was immediately expelled from the Comintern. The ILO, therefore, concluded that opposing Stalinism from within the communist organizations controlled by Stalin&#x27;s supporters had become impossible, so new organizations had to be formed. In 1933, the ILO was renamed the International Communist League (ICL), which formed the basis of the Fourth International, founded in Paris in 1938.

Trotsky said that only the Fourth International, based on Lenin&#x27;s theory of the vanguard party, could lead the world revolution and that it would need to be built in opposition to the capitalists and the Stalinists.

Trotsky argued that the defeat of the German working class and the coming to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933 was due in part to the mistakes of the Third Period policy of the Communist International and that the subsequent failure of the Communist Parties to draw the correct lessons from those defeats showed that they were no longer capable of reform and a new international organisation of the working class must be organised. The transitional demand tactic had to be a key element.

At the time of the founding of the Fourth International in 1938, Trotskyism was a mass political current in Vietnam, Sri Lanka and slightly later Bolivia. There was also a substantial Trotskyist movement in China which included the founding father of the Chinese communist movement, Chen Duxiu, amongst its number. Wherever Stalinists gained power, they prioritised hunting down Trotskyists and treated them as the worst enemies.

The Fourth International suffered repression and disruption through the Second World War. Isolated from each other and faced with political developments quite unlike those anticipated by Trotsky, some Trotskyist organizations decided that the USSR could no longer be called a degenerated workers&#x27; state and withdrew from the Fourth International. After 1945, Trotskyism was smashed as a mass movement in Vietnam and marginalised in many other countries.

The International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) organised an international conference in 1946 and then World Congresses in 1948 and 1951 to assess the expropriation of the capitalists in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia, the threat of a Third World War and the tasks of revolutionaries. The Eastern European Communist-led governments, which came into being after World War II without a social revolution, were described by a resolution of the 1948 congress as presiding over capitalist economies. By 1951, the Congress had concluded that they had become &quot;deformed workers&#x27; states&quot;. As the Cold War intensified, the ISFI&#x27;s 1951 World Congress adopted theses by Michel Pablo that anticipated an international civil war. Pablo&#x27;s followers considered that the Communist Parties, under pressure from the real workers&#x27; movement, could escape Stalin&#x27;s manipulations and follow a revolutionary orientation.

The 1951 Congress argued that Trotskyists should start to conduct systematic work inside those Communist Parties, followed by the majority of the working class. However, the ISFI&#x27;s view that the Soviet leadership was counterrevolutionary remained unchanged. The 1951 Congress argued that the USSR took over these countries because of the military and political results of World War II and instituted nationalized property relations only after its attempts at placating capitalism failed to protect those countries from the threat of incursion by the West.
Pablo began expelling many people who disagreed with his thesis and did not want to dissolve their organizations within the Communist Parties. For instance, he expelled most of the French section and replaced its leadership. As a result, the opposition to Pablo eventually rose to the surface, with the Open Letter to Trotskyists of the World, by Socialist Workers Party leader James P. Cannon.

The Fourth International split in 1953 into two public factions. Several sections of the International established the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) as an alternative centre to the International Secretariat, in which they felt a revisionist faction led by Michel Pablo had taken power and recommitted themselves to the Lenin-Trotsky Theory of the Party and Trotsky&#x27;s theory of Permanent Revolution. From 1960, led by the U.S Socialist Workers Party, many ICFI sections began the reunification process with the IS, but factions split off and continued their commitment to the ICFI. Today, national parties committed to the ICFI call themselves the Socialist Equality Party.

=== Cuban Revolution ===

Historian Theodore Draper had been a Trotskyist in his youth, but eventually became a more independently minded historian, still skeptical of Stalinism. Draper originally gained scholarly recognition for his writings on the history of the American Communist Party. 

After the Cuban Revolution, a variety of socialist writers like C. Wright Mills, Paul Sweezy, Herbert Matthews, and Paul Johnson were delivering polemics in defense of the new &quot;Fidelista&quot; government. In 1961 Encounter magazine asked Theodore Draper to write an assessment of the Cuban Revolution and the new provisional government. Draper published &quot;Castro&#x27;s Cuba - A Revolution Betrayed&quot; in which, Draper presents a Marxist analysis which claims that &quot;Castroism&quot; is a rudimentary nationalism which ignores the principles of Marxism, and that Fidel Castro is a demagogue. Draper also describes his &quot;Betrayal thesis&quot; by alluding to Trotsky&#x27;s allegation that Stalin &quot;betrayed&quot; the Russian Revolution. Draper alleges that Castro had &quot;betrayed&quot; the Cuban Revolution in a similar manner.

Trotskyists in general, were split about Castroism. Trotskyists like J. Posadas celebrated Castroism, and claimed that Cuba is on the road to socialism, while the British and French sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International, claimed that the Cuban Revolution only developed a form of state capitalism in Cuba.

== Trotskyist movements ==
Trotskyists believe that Marxist–Leninist regimes will lead to the establishment of a degenerated or deformed workers&#x27; state, where the capitalist elite have been replaced by an unaccountable bureaucratic elite and there is no true democracy or workers&#x27; control of industry. In particular, American Trotskyist David North noted that the generation of bureaucrats that rose to power under Stalin&#x27;s tutelage presided over the stagnation and breakdown of the Soviet Union. In contemporary English language usage, an advocate of Trotsky&#x27;s ideas is often called a &quot;Trotskyist&quot;. Trotskyists are derogatorily referred to as &quot;Trotskyites&quot; or &quot;Trots&quot;, especially by Stalinist critics of Trotskyism.

=== Latin America ===
Trotskyism has influenced some recent major social upheavals, particularly in Latin America. The Bolivian Trotskyist party (, POR) became a mass party in the late 1940s and early 1950s and, together with other groups, played a central role during and immediately after the period termed the Bolivian National Revolution.

In Brazil, as an officially recognised platform or faction of the PT until 1992, the Trotskyist Movimento Convergência Socialista (CS), which founded the United Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSTU) in 1994, saw a number of its members elected to national, state and local legislative bodies during the 1980s. The Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) presidential candidate in the 2006 general elections, Heloísa Helena, is a Trotskyist member of the Workers Party of Brazil (PT), a legislative deputy in Alagoas, and in 1999 was elected to the Federal Senate. Expelled from the PT in December 2003, she helped found PSOL, in which various Trotskyist groups play a prominent role.
In Argentina, the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores, PRT) lay in the merger of two leftist organizations in 1965, the Revolutionary and Popular Amerindian Front (, FRIP) and Worker&#x27;s Word . In 1968, the PRT adhered to the Fourth International, based in Paris. That same year, a related organisation was founded in Argentina, the ERP (People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army), which became South America&#x27;s most powerful rural guerrilla movement during the 1970s. The PRT left the Fourth International in 1973. During the Dirty War, the Argentine military regime suppressed both the PRT and the ERP. ERP commander Roberto Santucho was killed in July 1976. Owing to the ruthless repression, PRT showed no signs of activity after 1977. During the 1980s in Argentina, the Trotskyist party founded in 1982 by Nahuel Moreno, MAS (, Movement for Socialism), claimed to be the &quot;largest Trotskyist party&quot; in the world before it broke into many different fragments in the late 1980s, including the present-day Workers&#x27; Socialist Movement (MST), Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PTS), Nuevo MAS, Socialist Left (IS), Self-determination and Freedom (AyL, which is not outspoken Trotskyist) etc. In 1989, an electoral front with the Communist Party and MRS called (&quot;United Left&quot;) retrieved 3.49% of the vote, representing 580,944 voters. Today, the Workers&#x27; Party (Partido Obrero) in Argentina has an electoral base in Salta Province in the far north, particularly in the city of Salta itself; and has become the third political force in the provinces of Tucumán, also in the north; and Santa Cruz, in the south. This party later founded with other Trotskyist groups the Workers&#x27; Left Front which is represented in parliament.

Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez declared himself a Trotskyist during the swearing-in of his cabinet two days before his inauguration on 10 January 2007. Venezuelan Trotskyist organizations do not regard Chávez as a Trotskyist, with some describing him as a bourgeois nationalist. In contrast, others consider him an honest revolutionary leader who made significant mistakes due to his lack of a Marxist analysis.

=== North America ===
The development of the American Trotskyism movement emerged with the Communist League of America (CLA), then as the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS) and briefly as the Socialist Party (SP) of America before beginning in 1938 as the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). According to historian Paul Le Blanc, James Cannon and Max Shachtman were the most influential leaders of early US Trotskyism.

Trotsky engaged with members of the American Socialist Workers Party on reaching the Black population. He had correspondence with C.L.R. James on the question of self-determination and expressed support for Black Americans seeking equal rights and an autonomous state.

In 1953 there was a major split in the Fourth International between the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) led by Michel Pablo and the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) led iniatially by James Cannon of the SWP. While a decade later in 1963 the majority of the SWP reunited with Pablo&#x27;s supporters, a minority group persisted in their independence and criticisms of what they deemed to be the ISFI&#x27;s abandonment of Permanent Revolution and their promotion of Stalinst regimes and parties. This group that remained loyal to the ICFI would go on to become the Socialist Equality Party (US). There is also another North American national section of the ICFI in Canada, also known as the Socialist Equality Party.

There is a Trotskyist-influenced caucus within the Democratic Socialists of America, Reform and Revolution.

=== Africa ===

Trotsky had advocated for national self-determination for the black population in South Africa. In response to the programmatic document of the South African Left Opposition, he wrote in 1935:

&quot;We must accept decisively and without any reservation the complete and unconditional right of the blacks to independence. Only on the basis of a mutual struggle against the domination of the white exploiters can the solidarity of black and white toilers be cultivated and strengthened&quot;.

The Left Opposition in South Africa had criticised the Stalinist Comintern for advocating a two-stage theory in which a bourgeois-democratic republic would precede a socialist transformation of the society. Through the 1930s, the first viable black trade unions in Transvaal were established by Trotskyists.

The Democratic Socialist Movement (Nigeria) exists in Nigeria, it was founded in 1986 among a confederation of labour and student socialists. It is affiliated to the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International, of which it is the second largest section.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
In China, various left opposition groups in the late 1920s sought to engage Trotsky against the Comintern policy of support for the Kuomintang. In 1931, at Trotsky&#x27;s urging, the various factions united in the Communist League of China, adopting Trotsky&#x27;s document &quot;The Political Situation in China and the Task of the Bolshevik-Leninist Opposition&quot;. Prominent members include Chen Duxiu, Wang Fanxi and Chen Qichang. The League was persecuted by the Nationalist government and by the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1939, Ho Chi Minh, then a Comintern agent in southern China, reported that &quot;everyone united to fight the Japanese except the Trotskyists. These traitors . . . adopted the &#x27;resolution&#x27;: &#x27;In the war against the Japanese, our position is clear: those who wanted the war and have illusions about the Kuomintang government, those concretely have committed treason. The union between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang is nothing but conscious treason&#x27;. And other ignominies of this kind.&quot; The Trotskyists were to be &quot;crushed&quot;. In 1949, the Revolutionary Communist Party of China (; RCP) fled to Hong Kong. Since 1974, the party has been legally active as October Review, its official publication.

==== Vietnam ====
In French Indochina during the 1930s, Vietnamese Trotskyism, led by Tạ Thu Thâu, was a significant current, particularly in Saigon, Cochinchina. In 1929, in the French Left Opposition , Ta Thu Thau condemned the Comintern for leading Chinese Communists (in 1927) to &quot;the graveyard&quot; through its support for the Kuomintang. The Sun Yat-sen-ist&#x27; synthesis of democracy, nationalism and socialism&quot; was &quot;a kind of nationalist mysticism&quot;. In Indochina, it could only obscure &quot;the concrete class relationships, and the real, organic liaison between the indigenous bourgeoisie and French imperialism,&quot; in the light of which the call for independence is &quot;mechanical and formalistic&quot;. &quot;A revolution based on the organisation of the proletarian and peasant masses is the only one capable of liberating the colonies ... The question of independence must be bound up with that of the proletarian socialist revolution.&quot;

For a period in the 1930s, Ta Thu Thau&#x27;s Struggle group, centred around the newspaper La Lutte, was sufficiently strong to induce &quot;Stalinists&quot; (members of the then Indochinese Communist Party) to collaborate with the Trotskyists in support of labour and peasant struggles, and in the presentation of a common Workers Slate for Saigon municipal, and Cochinchina Council, elections. Ta Thu Thau was captured and executed by the Communist-front &quot;Viet Minh&quot; in September 1945. Many, if not most, of his fellow &quot;luttuers&quot; were subsequently killed, caught between the Viet Minh and the French effort at colonial reconquest.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In Sri Lanka, a group of Trotskyists (known as the &quot;T Group&quot;), including South Asia&#x27;s pioneer Trotskyist, Philip Gunawardena, who had been active in Trotskyist politics in Europe, and his colleague N. M. Perera, were instrumental in the foundation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935. It expelled its pro-Moscow wing in 1940, becoming a Trotskyist-led party. After a prison break it helped form the short lived Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI).

After the war, the Sri Lanka section split into the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party (BSP). In the general election of 1947, the LSSP became the main opposition party, winning ten seats, the BSP winning a further 5. It joined the Trotskyist Fourth International after fusion with the BSP in 1950 and led a general strike (Hartal) in 1953.

In 1964, the LSSP joined a coalition government with Sirimavo Bandaranaike, with three members, NM Perera, Cholomondeley Goonewardene, and Anil Moonesinghe, brought into the new cabinet. This led to the expulsion of the party from the Fourth International. A section of the LSSP split to form the LSSP (Revolutionary) and joined the Fourth International after the LSSP proper was expelled. The LSSP (Revolutionary) later split into factions led by Bala Tampoe and Edmund Samarakkody. Another faction, the &quot;Sakthi&quot; Group, led by V. Karalasingham, rejoined the LSSP in 1966.

In 1968, another faction of the LSSP (Revolutionary), led by Keerthi Balasooriya split, to form the Revolutionary Communist League – more commonly known as the &quot;&quot;Kamkaru Mawatha&quot; Group&quot;, after the name of their publication – and joined the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). In 1996, the group changed its name to Socialist Equality Party. In 2024 with assistance from European comrades, particularly in France, many of who fled the Sri Lankan Civil War a historic Tamil translation of Trotsky’s The Revolution Betrayed was published, accompanied with public meetings for the book’s launch.

In 1974, a secret faction of the LSSP, allied to the Militant group in the United Kingdom, emerged. In 1977, this faction was expelled and formed the Nava Sama Samaja Party, led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara.

==== India ====
In 1942, following the escape of the leaders of the Sri Lankan LSSP from a British prison, a unified Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) was established in India, bringing together the many Trotskyist groups in the subcontinent. The BLPI was active in the Quit India Movement and the labour movement, capturing the second oldest union in India. Its high point was when it led the strikes which followed the Bombay Mutiny.

In India, the BLPI fractured. In 1948, at the Fourth International&#x27;s request, the party&#x27;s rump dissolved into the Congress Socialist Party as an exercise in entryism.

=== Europe ===

===Spain===
In the Spanish Civil War, Stalinist-directed NKVD oversaw purges of anti-Stalinist elements in the Spanish Republican forces including Trotskyist and anarchist factions. Notable cases involved the execution of Andreu Nin, former government minister in Revolutionary Catalonia, Jose Robles, a left-wing academic and translator along with many members of the Trotskyist-aligned POUM faction, such as Mary Stanley Low.

===United Kingdom===
In Britain during the 1980s, the entryist Militant group operated within the Labour Party with three members of parliament and effective control of Liverpool City Council. Described by journalist Michael Crick as &quot;Britain&#x27;s fifth most important political party&quot; in 1986, it played a prominent role in the 1989–1991 anti-poll tax movement, which was widely thought to have led to the downfall of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The most enduring of several Trotskyist parties in Britain has been the Socialist Workers Party, formerly the International Socialists (IS). Its founder Tony Cliff rejected the orthodox Trotskyist view of the USSR as a &quot;deformed worker&#x27;s state&quot;. Communist-party regimes were &quot;state capitalist&quot;. The SWP has helped found several organisations through which they have sought to exert influence over the broader left, such as the Anti-Nazi League in the late 1970s and the Stop the War Coalition in 2001. It also allied with George Galloway and Respect, whose dissolution in 2007 caused an internal crisis in the SWP. A more serious internal crisis, leading to a significant decline in the party&#x27;s membership, emerged in 2013. Allegations of rape and sexual assault made against a leading party member developed into a dispute over the practice of democratic centralism (defended by the party&#x27;s international secretary Alex Callinicos).

The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) was formed in 2010 between the Socialist Party, the SWP and Socialist Resistance, along with the RMT union, has participated in several general elections. The TUSC stood 40 candidates at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

In April 2019, a 1970s splinter from IS made headlines when three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party campaigned in the European Parliamentary election as candidates for the Brexit Party, and a fourth, Munira Mirza, was appointed head of the Number 10 Downing Street policy unit by the new Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The RCP&#x27;s rejection of the SWP&#x27;s critical engagement with the Labour Party and trade unions had morphed into embracing right-wing libertarian positions.

===Ireland===
The Socialist Party in Ireland was formed in 1996 by members who had been expelled from the Labour Party in 1989 under the leadership of Dick Spring. It achieved electoral success at the 1997 general election with the election of Joe Higgins in Dublin West. The Socialist Party has been part of electoral alliances such as the United Left Alliance, Solidarity and People Before Profit–Solidarity. , it is represented at a national level by Mick Barry, a TD for Cork North-Central. It contests elections in Northern Ireland as part of the Cross-Community Labour Alternative.

===Portugal===
In Portugal&#x27;s October 2015 parliamentary election, the Left Bloc won 550,945 votes, translating into 10.19% of the expressed votes and 19 (out of 230) &quot;deputados&quot; (members of parliament). Although founded by several leftist tendencies, it still expresses much of the Trotskyist thought upheld and developed by its former leader, Francisco Louçã.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, there are some Trotskyist organizations, including the International Socialist Tendency&#x27;s section (Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Socialist Party), Coordinating Committee for the Refoundation of the Fourth International&#x27;s section (Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Party), Permanent Revolution Movement (SDH), &quot;Socialism Magazine&quot; (sympathizers of the International Committee of the Fourth International) who in 2022 were officially recognized as the ICFI&#x27;s section in Turkey under the name Sosyalist Eşitlik Grubu (Socialist Equality Group), and several small groups.

===Russia===
In Russia on 23 February 2018, the centenary of the formation of the Red Army under the leadership of Leon Trotsky, a group named the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists (YGBL) was formed. They made contact with the International Committee of the Fourth International shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has since declared its solidarity with the ICFI and intention to become its official section in Russia as well as throughout the former USSR. On 25 April 2024 a leading Ukrainian member of the YGBL, Bogdan Syrotiuk, was arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine on charges of being a Russian agent and undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine, claims that the ICFI and David North (socialist), chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, have completely rejected and say are the “latest example of the Zelensky regime’s brutal repression of left wing movements whose opposition to the war is finding a growing response within the Ukrainian working class”.

===France===
The Communist League was formed in 1930, becoming the first Trotskyist group in the country. French Trotskyists have historically faced internal splits and external repression, notably during World War II when their activities were banned. Postwar, French Trotskyism was shaped by significant divisions, such as the 1952 split between Lambertist and Pabloist factions, reflecting global tensions within the Fourth International. The movement gained public attention during events like the May 1968 protests, where Trotskyist groups, including the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR), played a prominent role.

The French section of the Fourth International was the Internationalist Communist Party (PCI). In 1952 the party split when the Fourth International removed its Central Committee and split again when in 1953, the Fourth International itself divided. Further divisions occurred over which independence faction to support in the Algerian War. In 1967, the rump of the PCI renamed itself the &quot;Internationalist Communist Organisation&quot; (, OCI). It proliferated during the May 1968 student demonstrations but was banned alongside other far-left groups, such as the (Proletarian Left). Members temporarily reconstituted the group as the Trotskyist Organisation but soon obtained a state order permitting the reformation of the OCI. By 1970, the OCI was able to organise a 10,000-strong youth rally. The group also gained a strong base in trade unions. However, further splits and disintegration followed.

Today, France remains a hub for Trotskyist activity, represented by groups such as which advocates a revolutionary program rooted in Marxist principles. In 2002, three trotskyist candidates ran in the election. Arlette Laguiller of got 5.72%, Olivier Besancenot of the Revolutionary Communist League () got 4.25% and Daniel Gluckstein of the Workers&#x27; Party () got 0.47%. In 2016 Jean-Luc Mélenchon, formerly of the ICO, launched the left-wing political platform (Unbowed France), subsequently endorsed by several parties, including his own Left Party and the French Communist Party. In the 2017 French Presidential Election, he received 19% in the first round. In the same election, Philippe Poutou of the New Anticapitalist Party, into which the Revolutionary Communist League dissolved itself in 2008, won 1.20% of the vote. The only openly Trotskyist candidate, Nathalie Arthaud of Workers&#x27; Struggle, won 0.64% of the vote.

In November 2016 a long-standing sympathizing group of the International Committee of the Fourth International held a founding congress to establish themselves as a full section of the ICFI. As part of the congress international delegates of the ICFI ratified their membership as the (PES) in French. PES includes a number of members of Sri Lankan origin who sought asylum in France due to the effects of the Sri Lankan Civil War, some of whom were members of the Socialist Equality Party (Sri Lanka) or its predecessor organization, the Revolutionary Communist League, at the time of their flight while many were won to Trotskyism during their exile. These Sri Lankan PES members played a leading role in making a historic translation of Trotsky’s seminal work, The Revolution Betrayed, into Tamil in 2024.

== Internationals ==

The Fourth International derives from the 1963 reunification of the two public factions into which the Fourth International split in 1953: the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) and some sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). It is often referred to as the United Secretariat of the Fourth International, the name of its leading committee before 2003. The USFI retains sections and sympathizing organizations in over 50 countries, including France&#x27;s &quot;Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire&quot; (LCR) and sections in Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Pakistan.

The International Committee of the Fourth International maintains its independent organization and publishes the World Socialist Web Site. They have full sections in the US, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Australia with sympathizing groups in Russia, Ukraine, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Croatia, Ireland, and other countries.

The Committee for a Workers&#x27; International (CWI) was founded in 1974 and has sections in over 35 countries. Before 1997, most organisations affiliated with the CWI sought to build an entrist Marxist wing within the large social democratic parties. The CWI has adopted a range of tactics, including working with trade unions, but in some cases working within or supporting other parties, endorsing Bernie Sanders for the 2016 U.S. Democratic Party nomination and encouraging him to run independently.

In France, the LCR is rivalled by , the French section of the Internationalist Communist Union (UCI), with small sections in a handful of other countries. It focuses its activities, whether propaganda or intervention, on the industrial proletariat.

The Committee for a Marxist International (CMI) founders claims they were expelled from the CWI when the CWI abandoned entryism. The CWI claims they left, and no expulsions were carried out. In 2006, it became the International Marxist Tendency (IMT). CMI/IMT groups continue the policy of entering mainstream social democratic, communist or radical parties. Known as the Revolutionary Communist International (RCI) since 2024, it is headed by Alan Woods.

The list of Trotskyist internationals shows that there are a large number of other multinational tendencies that stand in the tradition of Leon Trotsky.

== Debated comparison with Stalinism ==


Some Western historians have regarded Trotsky as a forerunner to Stalinism and centred this notion on his record during the period of war communism which included practices such as the militarization of labour. Criticism has also been levied at his support for concentration camps to detain war prisoners and the Red Terror. Other historians such as Robert Service, Dmitri Volkogonov, N.A. Vasetskii and Alter Litvin contend that Trotsky shared the same totalitarian strand of thought as Stalin and would not have represented a radically different USSR. Concerning the ideological differences between the varieties of Marxist philosophy that are Stalinism and Trotskyism, novelist George Orwell said:
However, literary critic Jeffrey Meyers who reviewed the political allegories in Orwell’s work stated that:

&quot;Orwell ignores the fact that Trotsky passionately opposed Stalin’s dictatorship from 1924 to 1940, which featured Siberian prison camps, the deliberately created Ukraine famine and the massive slaughter during the Moscow Purge Trials of 1937.”

Meyers further added that Orwell drew on the views of a right-wing combatant to reinforce his arguments. In contrast, Meyers cited Isaac Deutscher&#x27;s biographical account of Trotsky which presented him to be a much more civilised figure than Stalin and suggested that he would not have purged the Red Army generals or millions of Soviet citizens.

Historian Sheila Fitzpatrick has also questioned the premise of historical inevitability presented by conservative critics such as Robert Service in that the Soviet Union would have experienced the same &quot;totalitarian despotism under Trotskyist rule&quot;. Fitzpatrick suggested it was implausible that Trotsky like Stalin would have launched an anti-semitic campaign after World War II or initiated the Great Purges. Rather, she inferred that Trotsky would presumably have provided good leadership during the Second World War but may have struggled to maintain party cohesion as seen during the succession struggle after 1924.

Moreover, several scholars such as Richard B.Day, Vadim Rogovin and Robert Vincent Daniels along with Western socialists have considered Trotsky to have represented a more democratic alternative to Stalin. In particular, emphasis has been drawn to his activities in the pre-Civil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition. Proponents of this view have specified further differences with Stalinism, which emerged during the succession struggle, over intraparty democracy, autonomy of the Comintern and the dogmatization of Leninist orthodoxy. Mandel and Deutscher maintain that his intra-party reforms from 1923-1926 would have revitalised party democratization, mass participation, worker&#x27;s self-management and eventually a multi-party socialist democracy. Trotsky also opposed the policy of forced collectivisation under Stalin and favoured a voluntary, gradual approach towards agricultural production, with greater tolerance for the rights of Soviet Ukrainians. Daniels viewed Trotsky and the Left Opposition as a critical alternative to the Stalin-Bukharin majority in a number of areas. He also stated that the Left Opposition would have prioritised industrialisation but never contemplated the &quot;violent uprooting&quot; employed by Stalin and contrasted most directly with Stalinism on the issue of party democratization and bureaucratization.

Other figures such as Baruch Knei-Paz and Victor Serge acknowledge some affinities with Stalinism in regards to the use of coercion but have also recognised clear differences between Trotsky and Stalin. On the cultural field, Knei-Paz highlighted their contrasting attitudes towards matters such as the arts and sciences. According to Knei-Paz, it does not seem credible that Trotsky would have treated culture and society with the same total, brutal disregard as Stalin. He also argued that Trotsky sought far-reaching economic, commercial relations with European countries which was at variance with the economic policy of isolationism and harsher measures pursued under Stalin. In the view of Knei-Paz, the most discernible difference between Trotsky and Stalin was their respective approaches towards international affairs. In this matter, Trotsky firmly adhered to the notion that socialism in Russia as “backward society” was dependent on revolution in the West. Biographer Geoffrey Swain believed that the Soviet Union under the leadership of Trotsky would have been more technocratic as he would have made far more use of &quot;bourgeois experts&quot; in the planning process, and inferred this from his conduct during the Civil War along with his writings in the early 1920s. Swain also expressed the view that the Soviet Union under Trotsky would certainly have been a less terrorised society yet was critical of his military methods in relation to desertion and hostage taking during the Civil War.

In post-exile, Trotsky challenged claims from American socialist Norman Thomas that the Soviet Union would have been no better under his leadership. Trotsky countered that it was not a question of personalities but opposing, social interests represented by the bureaucracy and the working class. More specifically, Trotsky attributed the retraction of the progressive gains of the October revolution, the mass purge and Soviet foreign policy as seen in Spanish Civil War to the interests of the bureaucracy rather than the socialist proletariat or Bolshevik tradition. He asserted that the excessive form of totalitarianism under Stalinism would not have emerged under his variant of Bolshevism. Comparatively, he viewed his interpretation of Marxism to represent a political and moral regeneration of the Soviet Union against the Stalinist bureaucracy.

Separately, Trotsky would defend his military decisions as necessary and argued that had draconian measures rather than excess &quot;magnanimity&quot; been shown to opponents at the start of the October Revolution then Russia would have experienced far less human casualties. He made a historical comparison between his military endeavours with Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s ruthlessness during the American Civil War. Deutscher drew attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them. He recounts that Trotsky had released General Krasnov on parole in 1918 after the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising during the initial stage of the Civil War but the general would take up arms against the Soviets shortly again afterwards.

Trotskyist theoreticians have disputed the view that the Stalinist dictatorship was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks&#x27; actions as most of the original, central committee members from 1917 were later eliminated by Stalin. George Novack stressed the initial efforts by the Bolsheviks to form a multi-party government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Upon the Menshevik 
walkout from the Soviet congress, Trotsky released a number of arrested, socialist ministers of the Provisional government from prison, at the request of Julius Martov. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the Constituent Assembly due to a number of reasons. They cited the outdated voter-rolls which did not acknowledge the split among the Socialist Revolutionary party and the assemblies conflict with the Congress of the Soviets as an alternative democratic structure. David North has argued that Trotsky&#x27;s policies would have averted the dismantlement of Soviet defenses alongside the high levels of human casualties associated with Operation Barbarossa and the Second World War.

== Criticism ==
Trotskyism has been criticised from various directions. In 1935, Marxist–Leninist Moissaye J. Olgin argued that Trotskyism was &quot;the enemy of the working class&quot; and &quot;should be shunned by anybody who has sympathy for the revolutionary movement of the exploited and oppressed the world over.&quot; The African American Marxist–Leninist Harry Haywood, who spent much time in the USSR during the 1920s and 1930s, stated that although he had been somewhat interested in Trotsky&#x27;s ideas when he was young, he came to see it as &quot;a disruptive force on the fringes of the international revolutionary movement&quot; which eventually developed into &quot;a counter-revolutionary conspiracy against the Party and the Soviet state&quot;. He continued to put forward his following belief:
Trotsky was not defeated by bureaucratic decisions or Stalin&#x27;s control of the Party apparatus—as his partisans and Trotskyite historians claim. He had his day in court and finally lost because his whole position flew in the face of Soviet and world realities. He was doomed to defeat because his ideas were incorrect and failed to conform to objective conditions, as well as the needs and interests of the Soviet people.

Other figures associated with Marxism–Leninism criticized Trotskyist political theory, including Régis Debray and Earl Browder.

In 1966, Fidel Castro said that &quot;Even though at one time Trotskyism represented an erroneous position, but a position in the field of political ideas, Trotskyism became during the following years a vulgar instrument of imperialism and reaction.&quot;

Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski wrote: &quot;Both Trotsky and Bukharin were emphatic in their assurances that forced labour was an organic part of the new society.&quot;

Sociologist Peter Beilharz was critical of Trotskyism and viewed it as the most complete expression of Jacobinism. Although, Beiharz acknowledged that Trotsky had opposed Jacobinism as a young democrat but in his view had extended the tradition during the period of war communism and through his ideological defence of terror. On the other hand, historian Paul Le Blanc found Beilharz&#x27;s historical comparisons between Trotsky and earlier Jacobin figures to be unconvincing and suggested his analogies were more centred in rhetoric rather than in analysis due to his blurring of ideological concepts.

Some left communists, such as Paul Mattick, claim that the October Revolution was totalitarian from the start. Therefore, Trotskyism has no fundamental differences from Stalinism in practice or theory. French historian and Trotskyist Pierre Broue rejected this form of criticism and characterised it in the following way:&quot;The theory according to which Stalin and Trotsky were two rival wild beasts [which] is useful for historians serving those in power: the establishment of an equivalence between Stalinism and Trotskyism aids the idea of a continuity from Bolshevism and Leninism to Stalinism and strengthens a regime which fears revolutionary sentiments&quot;.

British historian Christian Høgsbjerg believed that the academic literature and wider criticisms of Trotskyist organisations had minimised its historical role in building wider social movements. Høgsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (1966–71), the Anti-Nazi League (1977–81), the Anti Poll Tax Federation (1989–91) and the Stop the War Coalition (2001).

In the United States, Dwight Macdonald broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party by raising the question of the Kronstadt rebellion, which Trotsky, as leader of the Soviet Red Army, and the other Bolsheviks had brutally repressed. He then moved towards democratic socialism and anarchism. The Lithuanian-American anarchist Emma Goldman raised a similar critique of Trotsky&#x27;s role in the events around the Kronstadt rebellion. In her essay &quot;Trotsky Protests Too Much&quot;, she says: &quot;I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin&#x27;s rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes&quot;.

Trotsky defended the actions of the Red Army in his essay &quot;Hue and Cry over Kronstadt&quot;. He would also argue that the attitudes and social composition of the Kronstadt sailors had changed over the course of the Civil War. Trotsky further argued that the isolated location of the naval fortress would have enabled financial funding to flow between Kronstadt and White army emigres. Separately, he would also argue that he and Lenin had intended to lift the ban on the opposition parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as soon as the economic and social conditions of Soviet Russia had improved after the Civil War.

<text>Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, later Philip Mountbatten; 10 June 19219 April 2021), was the husband of Queen Elizabeth II. As such, he was the consort of the British monarch from his wife&#x27;s accession on 6 February 1952 until his death in 2021, making him the longest-serving royal consort in history.

Philip was born in Greece into the Greek and Danish royal families; his family was exiled from the country when he was eighteen months old. After being educated in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, he joined the Royal Navy in 1939, when he was 18 years old. In July 1939, Philip began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. During the Second World War, he served with distinction in the British Mediterranean and Pacific fleets.

In the summer of 1946, the King granted Philip permission to marry Elizabeth, then aged 20. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, Philip stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles and styles, became a naturalised British subject, and adopted his maternal grandparents&#x27; surname Mountbatten. In November 1947, he married Elizabeth, was granted the style &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; and was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich. Philip left active military service when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, having reached the rank of commander. In 1957, he was created a British prince. Philip had four children with Elizabeth: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

A sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving. He was patron, president, or member of over 780 organisations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, and served as chairman of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, a youth awards programme for people aged 14 to 24. Philip is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family. He retired from royal duties in 2017, aged 96, having completed 22,219 solo engagements and 5,493 speeches since 1952, and died at the age of 99 at Windsor Castle.

== Early life and education ==
=== Family, infancy and exile from Greece ===

Prince Philip () of Greece and Denmark was born on 10 June 1921 on the dining room table in Mon Repos, a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. He was the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg. Philip&#x27;s father was the fourth son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece, and his mother was the eldest child of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, and Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven (formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine). A member of the House of Glücksburg, Philip was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from George I of Greece and George&#x27;s father, Christian IX of Denmark; he was from birth in the line of succession to both thrones. Philip&#x27;s four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie. He was baptised in the Greek Orthodox rite at St. George&#x27;s Church in the Old Fortress in Corfu. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece; his cousin George, Crown Prince of Greece; his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten; and the municipality of Corfu, represented by its mayor, Alexandros Kokotos, and by the president of the council, Stylianos Maniarizis.

Shortly after Philip&#x27;s birth, his maternal grandfather died in London. The Marquess of Milford Haven was a naturalised British subject who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten—an Anglicised version of Battenberg—during the First World War, owing to anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom. After visiting London for his grandfather&#x27;s memorial service, Philip and his mother returned to Greece, where Prince Andrew had remained to command a Greek Army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War.

Greece suffered significant losses in the war and the Turks made substantial gains. Philip&#x27;s uncle and high commander of the Greek expeditionary force, King Constantine I, was blamed for the defeat and was forced to abdicate in September 1922. The new military government arrested Andrew, along with others. General Georgios Hatzianestis, who was commanding officer of the army, and five senior politicians were arrested, tried, and executed in the Trial of the Six. Andrew&#x27;s life was also believed to be in danger and Alice was under surveillance. Finally, in December, a revolutionary court banished Andrew from Greece for life. The British naval vessel evacuated Andrew&#x27;s family, with Philip carried to safety in a fruit box.

=== Upbringing in France, Britain and Germany ===
Philip&#x27;s family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark. During his time there, Philip was first educated at The Elms, an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a &quot;know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite&quot;. In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire. He was then enrolled at Cheam School. Over the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum, and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo. Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood.

In 1933 Philip was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the &quot;advantage of saving school fees&quot;, because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law Berthold, Margrave of Baden. With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem&#x27;s Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland, to which Philip moved after two terms at Salem. In 1937, his sister Cecilie; her husband, Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse; their two sons; and Georg Donatus&#x27;s mother were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then 16 years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt. Cecilie and Georg Donatus were members of the Nazi Party. The following year, Philip&#x27;s uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of bone marrow cancer. Milford Haven&#x27;s younger brother Lord Louis took parental responsibility for Philip for the remainder of his youth.

Philip did not speak Greek because he had left Greece as an infant. In 1992 he said that he &quot;could understand a certain amount&quot;. He stated that he thought of himself as Danish and spoke mostly English, while his family was multilingual. Known for his charm in his youth, Philip was linked to several women, including Osla Benning.

== Naval and wartime service ==

After leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then repatriated to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939. At the behest of King George II of Greece, his first cousin, he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy. He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course. During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side. Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940. He spent four months on the battleship , protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on , on , and in British Ceylon. After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet.

Philip was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on 1 February 1941 after a series of courses at Portsmouth, in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination. Among other engagements, he was involved in the Battle of Crete and was mentioned in dispatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship&#x27;s searchlights. He was also awarded the Greek War Cross. In June 1942, he was appointed to the destroyer , which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the Allied invasion of Sicily.
Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942. In October of the same year, aged 21, Philip became first lieutenant of HMS &quot;Wallace&quot;. He was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second-in-command of &quot;Wallace&quot;, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack. He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers, allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed. In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, , where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla. He was present in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the &quot;Whelp&quot; in January 1946 and was posted as an instructor at , the Petty Officers&#x27; School in Corsham, Wiltshire.

== Marriage ==

In 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During the visit, the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couple&#x27;s daughters, 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret, who were Philip&#x27;s third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark. Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent, to Philip&#x27;s first cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. After their 1939 meeting, Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.

Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked George VI for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage. The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth&#x27;s 21st birthday the following April. By March 1947, Philip had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother&#x27;s family and had stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles upon becoming a naturalised British subject. The engagement was announced to the public on 9 July 1947.

The engagement attracted some controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born, and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. Marion Crawford wrote: &quot;Some of the King&#x27;s advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip&#x27;s foreign origin.&quot; Later biographies reported that Elizabeth&#x27;s mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as &quot;the Hun&quot;. In later life, however, she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was &quot;an English gentleman&quot;.

Though Philip appeared &quot;always to have regarded himself as an Anglican&quot;, and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days, he was baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, wanted to &quot;regularise&quot; Philip&#x27;s position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947. The day before the wedding, the King bestowed the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; on Philip, and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London. Consequently, being already a Knight of the Garter, between 19 and 20 November 1947, he bore the unusual style Lieutenant His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the letters patent of 20 November 1947.

Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world. In post-war Britain, it was unacceptable for any of Philip&#x27;s German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding. After their marriage, Philip and Elizabeth took residence at Clarence House. Their first two children were born before Elizabeth&#x27;s accession in 1952: Prince Charles in November 1948 and Princess Anne in August 1950. The couple&#x27;s marriage was the longest of any British monarch, lasting over 73 years until Philip died in 2021. Concerned by her father&#x27;s poor health, Elizabeth insisted that Philip give up smoking, which he did cold turkey on their wedding day.

Philip was introduced to the House of Lords on 21 July 1948, immediately before his uncle Louis Mountbatten, who had been made Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Philip ostensibly never spoke in the House of Lords. He, his sons and other royals ceased to be members of the House of Lords following the House of Lords Act 1999, although Philip&#x27;s former brother-in-law, Lord Snowdon, remained in the House.

== Early duties ==

After his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, Broadlands, Philip returned to the navy, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich. From 1949 he was stationed in Malta (residing at Villa Guardamangia) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer , the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1950 and given command of the frigate . Philip was promoted to commander on 30 June 1952, though his active naval career had ended in July 1951.

With the King in ill health, Elizabeth and Philip were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada. At the end of January 1952, the couple set out on a tour of the Commonwealth. They were in Kenya when Elizabeth&#x27;s father died on 6 February 1952, and she became queen. Philip broke the news to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom.

In December 1952, Philip was initiated into Freemasonry by the Worshipful Master of Navy Lodge No 2612, honouring a commitment he had made to George VI, who had made it clear that he expected Philip to maintain the tradition of royal patronage of Freemasonry. However, according to one journalist writing in 1983, Philip&#x27;s mother-in-law and his uncle Lord Mountbatten had unfavourable views of Freemasonry; after his initiation, Philip took no further part in the organisation. Although as the consort of the Queen, he might in time have been made Grand Master of British Freemasonry, Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, assumed that role in 1967. Philip&#x27;s son Charles apparently never joined Freemasonry.

== Consort of the Queen ==
=== Royal house ===

Elizabeth&#x27;s accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip&#x27;s last name upon marriage. Lord Mountbatten advocated the name &quot;House of Mountbatten&quot;. Philip suggested &quot;House of Edinburgh&quot; after his ducal title. When Elizabeth&#x27;s grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Philip privately complained, &quot;I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.&quot;

In February 1960, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that Mountbatten-Windsor would be the surname of the couple&#x27;s male-line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as prince or princess. While it seems Elizabeth had &quot;absolutely set her heart&quot; on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only 11 days before the birth of their third child, Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between English constitutional expert Edward Iwi (who averred that, without such a change, the royal child would be born with &quot;the Badge of Bastardy&quot;) and Harold Macmillan, who had attempted to refute Iwi&#x27;s arguments. Elizabeth and Philip&#x27;s fourth child, Prince Edward, was born in March 1964.

Six months after she acceded to the throne, Elizabeth announced that Philip was to have &quot;place, pre-eminence and precedence&quot; next to her &quot;on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament&quot;. She also intervened to ensure that Philip would serve as regent for their son Charles in the event of her unexpected death. Parliament passed a bill to that effect in 1953. Contrary to rumours over the years, Elizabeth and Philip were said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. Elizabeth referred to Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her &quot;constant strength and guide&quot;.

Philip received a Parliamentary annuity (of £359,000 since 1990) to meet official expenses in carrying out public duties. The annuity was unaffected by the reform of royal finances under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011. Any part of the allowance that was not used to meet official expenditure was liable for tax. In practice, the entire allowance was used to fund his official duties.

=== Supporting the Queen ===
As consort, Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad. As chairman of the Coronation Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony. Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her &quot;liege man of life and limb&quot;. For six months, spanning 1953 and 1954, they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours, the children remained in Britain.

In the early 1950s, Philip&#x27;s sister-in-law, Princess Margaret, considered marrying a divorced older man, Peter Townsend. The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match, to which he replied: &quot;I haven&#x27;t done anything.&quot; Eventually, Margaret and Townsend parted. In 1960 Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; Margaret did not remarry.

In 1956 Philip and Kurt Hahn founded The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award to give young people &quot;a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities&quot;. In the same year, he also established the Commonwealth Study Conferences. From 1956 to 1957, he travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned , during which he opened the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and visited the Antarctic, becoming the first royal to cross the Antarctic Circle. Elizabeth and the children remained in Britain. On the return leg of the journey, Philip&#x27;s private secretary, Mike Parker, was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend, the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal, and eventually, Parker resigned. He later said that Philip was very supportive and &quot;the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as a sadness, not a hanging offence.&quot; In a public show of support, Elizabeth created Parker a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

Further press reports claimed that the royal couple were drifting apart, which enraged Philip and dismayed Elizabeth, who issued a strongly worded denial. She granted him the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by Letters Patent on 22 February 1957; it was gazetted that Philip was to be known as &quot;His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh&quot;. Philip was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on 14 October 1957, taking his Oath of Allegiance before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence, Rideau Hall. Remarks he made two years later to the Canadian Medical Association on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape. This was at first considered &quot;tactless&quot;, but Philip was later admired for his encouragement of physical fitness. While in Canada in 1969, he spoke about his views on republicanism:
In 1960 Philip attended the National Eisteddfod of Wales wearing a long green robe, where he was initiated as an Honorary Ovate by the Archdruid of Wales Edgar Phillips through his bardic name &quot;Philip Meirionnydd&quot;, to reflect his title of Earl of Merioneth. In 1961 he became the first member of the royal family to be interviewed on television, after he appeared on &quot;Panorama&quot; to answer questions by Richard Dimbleby about the Commonwealth Technical Training Week, an initiative of which he was patron. In 1969 he made a similar appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; during a tour of North America.

=== Charities and patronages ===

Philip was patron of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education. His first solo engagement as Duke of Edinburgh was in March 1948, presenting prizes at the boxing finals of the London Federation of Boys&#x27; Clubs at the Royal Albert Hall. He was president of the National Playing Fields Association (now known as Fields in Trust) for 64 years, from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. In 1952, he became patron of The Industrial Society (since renamed The Work Foundation). In the same year, and after his father-in-law&#x27;s death, he took over the role of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, overseeing its protection and maintenance. From 1955 to 1957, Philip was president of The Football Association and also served two terms as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, with his tenures starting in 1949 and 1974, respectively. In the same decade, he became the first patron of Lord&#x27;s Taverners, a youth cricket and disability sports charity, for which he organised fundraising events. Between 1959 and 1965 Philip was the president of BAFTA. He helped found the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1963 and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 and served as the latter&#x27;s UK president from 1961 to 1982, international president from 1981, and president emeritus from 1996. He was also president of the Zoological Society of London for two decades and was appointed an honorary fellow in 1977. Despite his involvement in initiatives for conserving nature, he was also criticised for practices such as fox hunting and shooting of game birds and the killing of a tiger in India in 1961. He was president of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986. In 1980 he became world champion in four-in-hand driving with the British national team. He served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford, and Wales. In 1965, at the suggestion of Harold Wilson, Philip became chair to a scheme set up for awarding industrial innovations, which later became known as The Queen&#x27;s Awards for Enterprise. In the same year, Philip became president of the Council of Engineering Institutions and in that capacity he assisted with the inception of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering), of which he later became the senior fellow. He also commissioned the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the Prince Philip Medal to recognise designers and engineers with exceptional contributions. In 1970 he was involved with the founding of The Maritime Trust for restoring and preserving historic British ships. In 2017 the British Heart Foundation thanked Philip for being its patron for 55 years, during which time, in addition to organising fundraisers, he &quot;supported the creation of nine BHF-funded centres of excellence&quot;. He was an honorary fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

=== Charles and Diana ===
At the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship. Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February. They married five months later. By 1992 the marriage had broken down. Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success. Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at Charles&#x27;s and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other&#x27;s point of view. She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent. Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.

A year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. At the time, Philip was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family. In their grief, Diana&#x27;s sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to attend church, so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning. For five days, the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral, where they could grieve in private. The royal family&#x27;s seclusion caused public dismay, but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by Elizabeth on 5 September. Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind their mother&#x27;s coffin during the funeral procession, William and Harry hesitated. Philip told William: &quot;If you don&#x27;t walk, I think you&#x27;ll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?&quot; On the day of the funeral, Philip, William, Harry, Charles, and Diana&#x27;s brother, Earl Spencer, walked through London behind her gun carriage. Over the next few years, Mohamed Al-Fayed, whose son Dodi Fayed was also killed in the crash, claimed that Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged. The inquest into Diana&#x27;s death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy.

=== Longevity ===

In April 2009, Philip became the longest-serving British royal consort, surpassing Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III. He became the oldest-ever male British royal in February 2013 and the third-longest-lived member of the British royal family (following Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) in April 2019. Personally, he was not enthused about living an extremely long life, remarking in a 2000 interview (when he was 79) that he could not &quot;imagine anything worse&quot; and had &quot;no desire whatsoever&quot; to become a centenarian, saying &quot;bits of me are falling off already&quot;.
In 2008 Philip was admitted to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, London, for a chest infection; he walked into the hospital unaided, recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later. After the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported that Philip had prostate cancer, Buckingham Palace—which usually refuses to comment on health rumours—denied the story and the paper retracted it.

In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday, Philip said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had &quot;done [his] bit&quot;. The Queen gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday. While staying at Sandringham House in December 2011, Philip suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting. He was discharged a few days later.

In June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife&#x27;s diamond jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital suffering from a bladder infection. He was subsequently discharged. After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure. In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital. In May 2014, he appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a &quot;minor procedure&quot; was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day. Tony Abbott&#x27;s surprise 2015 decision to appoint Philip a Knight of the Order of Australia was widely criticised in the country and contributed to Abbott&#x27;s ouster as Australian prime minister. In June 2017, Philip was taken from Windsor to London and admitted to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital after being diagnosed with an infection. He spent two nights in the hospital and was unable to attend the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot.

=== Final years and retirement ===

Philip retired from royal duties on 2 August 2017, meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement, aged 96. Since 1952, he had completed 22,219 solo engagements. British prime minister Theresa May thanked him for &quot;a remarkable lifetime of service&quot;. On 20 November 2017, he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary with Elizabeth, which made her the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.

In April 2018, Philip was admitted to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital for a planned hip replacement. This came after the Duke missed the annual Maundy and Easter Sunday services. Princess Anne spent about 50 minutes in the hospital and afterwards said her father was &quot;on good form&quot;. He was discharged the next day. In May that year, he attended the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and was able to walk with Elizabeth unaided. That October, he also accompanied Elizabeth to the wedding of their granddaughter Princess Eugenie of York with Jack Brooksbank, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reporting that Philip works on a &quot;wake up and see how I feel&quot; basis when deciding whether to attend an event or not.

In January 2019, Philip was involved in a car collision as he drove out onto a main road near the Sandringham Estate. An official statement said he was uninjured. An eyewitness who helped him out of his car said there was &quot;a little bit of blood&quot;. The driver and a passenger of the other car were injured and taken to hospital. Philip attended hospital the next morning as a precaution. He apologised, and three weeks later voluntarily surrendered his driving licence. In February, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that prosecuting Philip would not be in the public interest. Philip was still allowed to drive around private estates, and was seen behind the wheel in the grounds of Windsor Castle in April 2019.

In December 2019, Philip stayed at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital and received treatment for a &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; in a visit described by Buckingham Palace as a &quot;precautionary measure&quot;. He had not been seen in public since attending Lady Gabriella Windsor&#x27;s wedding in May 2019. A photo of the royal couple as they isolated at Windsor Castle during the COVID-19 pandemic was released ahead of his 99th birthday in June 2020. In July 2020, he stepped down as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles, a position he had held since 2007. He was succeeded by his daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

In January 2021, Philip and Elizabeth were vaccinated against COVID-19 by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. In February 2021, Philip was admitted to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital as a &quot;precautionary measure&quot; after feeling unwell; he was visited by Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace confirmed that Philip was &quot;responding to treatment&quot; for an infection. In March, Philip was transferred by ambulance to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital to continue treatment for an infection, and to undergo &quot;testing and observation&quot; relating to a pre-existing heart condition. He underwent a successful procedure for his heart condition and was transferred back to King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital. He was discharged a week later and returned to Windsor Castle.
== Death ==
Philip died of &quot;old age&quot; on the morning of 9 April 2021 at Windsor Castle, at the age of 99. He was the longest-serving royal consort in world history. Elizabeth, who was reportedly at her husband&#x27;s bedside when he died, described his death as &quot;having left a huge void in her life&quot;.

The palace said Philip died peacefully, which was confirmed by his daughter-in-law Sophie, Countess of Wessex, who told the press it was &quot;so gentle. It was just like somebody took him by the hand and off he went.&quot; His death led to the commencement of Operation Forth Bridge, the plan for publicly announcing his death and organising his funeral. The usual public ceremonial could not take place because of the regulations for the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted the number of mourners to thirty; it was later reported in the press that Elizabeth had rejected a government offer to relax the rules. The funeral took place on 17 April 2021 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Philip was temporarily interred alongside 25 other coffins, including that of George III, in the Royal Vault inside St George&#x27;s. Representatives of countries around the world sent condolences to the royal family upon his death.

As with other senior members of the royal family, Philip&#x27;s last will and testament will be sealed for at least 90 years, according to a High Court ruling, which deemed it necessary to protect the Queen&#x27;s &quot;dignity and standing&quot;. This led to speculation that the will might contain material harmful to the reputation of the royal family. The order was made by the President of the Family Division after a private hearing in July 2021, who said that he had neither seen the will nor been informed of any of its contents. In January 2022, &quot;The Guardian&quot; challenged the judge&#x27;s decision to exclude the press from that hearing, arguing that the judge had &quot;erred by failing to consider any lesser interference with open justice than a private hearing&quot;, and the newspaper was granted leave to appeal. In July 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed the newspaper&#x27;s arguments, stating that the press could not have been informed of the hearing &quot;without risking the media storm that was feared&quot;. The court added that &quot;a perceived lack of transparency might be a matter of legitimate public debate, but the (Non-Contentious Probate Rules) allow wills and their values to be concealed from the public gaze in some cases&quot;.

A service of thanksgiving for Philip&#x27;s life took place at Westminster Abbey on 29 March 2022, with Elizabeth, foreign royalty and politicians in attendance. Elizabeth died on 8 September 2022 and the royal couple&#x27;s bodies were interred in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St George&#x27;s on the evening of 19 September after her state funeral.

== Legacy ==
=== Interests ===

Philip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport&#x27;s early rule book was drafted under his supervision. He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes.

Philip&#x27;s first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952, and by his 70th birthday, he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours. He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953, helicopter wings with the Royal Navy in 1956, and his private pilot&#x27;s licence in 1959. After 44 years as a pilot, he retired in August 1997 with 5,986 hours spent in 59 different aircraft. In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathé newsreel film had been discovered of Philip&#x27;s 1962 two-month flying tour of South America. Filmed sitting alongside him at the aircraft&#x27;s controls was his co-pilot Captain Peter Middleton, the grandfather of Philip&#x27;s granddaughter-in-law Catherine. In 1959, Philip flew solo in a Druine Turbulent, becoming the first and, the only member of the royal family to have flown a single-seat aircraft.
Philip painted with oils and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle. Hugh Casson described Philip&#x27;s own artwork as &quot;exactly what you&#x27;d expect ... totally direct, no hanging about. Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes.&quot; He was patron of the Royal Society of Arts from 1952 until 2011. He was &quot;fascinated&quot; by cartoons about the monarchy and the royal family and was a patron of The Cartoon Museum.

=== Personality and image ===
Philip&#x27;s down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler, who recalled that, on a visit in 1976, Philip engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip was noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, politically incorrect, or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In an address to the General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: &quot;Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years.&quot; Later in life, he suggested his comments may have contributed to the perception that he was &quot;a cantankerous old sod&quot;.

In a private conversation with British students from Xi&#x27;an&#x27;s Northwest University during a state visit to China in 1986, Philip joked: &quot;If you stay here much longer, you&#x27;ll go slit-eyed.&quot; The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go &quot;round-eyed&quot;. His comment did not affect Sino-British relations, but it shaped his reputation. Philip also made comments on the eating habits of Cantonese people, stating: &quot;If it has four legs and is not a chair, has wings and is not an airplane, or swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent31/5/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia he asked an Indigenous Australian entrepreneur: &quot;Do you still throw spears at each other?&quot;

In 2011 historian David Starkey described Philip as a kind of &quot;HRH Victor Meldrew&quot;. For example, in May 1999, British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying: &quot;No wonder you are deaf listening to this row.&quot; Later, Philip wrote: &quot;The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it&#x27;s hardly likely that I would do any such thing.&quot; When he and Elizabeth met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by a Real IRA bomb, and Elizabeth enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: &quot;Not a lot, judging by the tie he&#x27;s wearing.&quot; Menary later said: &quot;I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn&#x27;t take any offence.&quot; Philip&#x27;s comparison of prostitutes and wives was also perceived as offensive after he reportedly stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing.&quot;

=== Centenary ===
To mark the centenary of Philip&#x27;s birth in June 2021, the Royal Collection Trust held an exhibition at Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Titled &quot;Prince Philip: A Celebration&quot;, it showcased around 150 personal items related to him, including his wedding card, wedding menu, midshipman&#x27;s logbook from 1940 to 1941, Chair of Estate, and the coronation robes and coronet that he wore for his wife&#x27;s coronation in 1953. George Alexis Weymouth&#x27;s portrait of Philip in the ruins of Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992 formed part of a focus on Philip&#x27;s involvement with the subsequent restoration.

The Royal Horticultural Society also marked Philip&#x27;s centenary by breeding a new rose in his honour, christened &quot;The Duke of Edinburgh Rose&quot;, created by British rose breeder Harkness Roses. Elizabeth, as patron of the society, was given the deep pink commemorative rose in honour of her husband, and she remarked that &quot;It looks lovely&quot;. A Duke of Edinburgh Rose has since been planted in the mixed rose border of Windsor Castle&#x27;s East Terrace Garden. Philip played a major role in the garden&#x27;s design.

In September 2021, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution honoured Philip by naming their new state-of-the-art lifeboat &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot;. The tribute was initially planned to mark his 100th birthday. In the same month, a documentary initially planned for his centenary was broadcast on BBC One under the title &quot;Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers&quot;, with contributions from his children, their spouses, and seven of his grandchildren.

=== Portrayals ===
Philip has been portrayed by several actors, including Stewart Granger (&quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot;, 1982), Christopher Lee (&quot;Charles &amp; Diana: A Royal Love Story&quot;, 1982), David Threlfall (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Sister&quot;, 2005), James Cromwell (&quot;The Queen&quot;, 2006), and Finn Elliot, Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, and Jonathan Pryce (&quot;The Crown&quot;, 2016 onwards). He also appears as a fictional character in Nevil Shute&#x27;s novel &quot;In the Wet&quot; (1952), Paul Gallico&#x27;s novel &quot;Mrs. &#x27;Arris Goes to Moscow&quot; (1974), Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1987), and Sue Townsend&#x27;s novel &quot;The Queen and I&quot; (1992).

== Titles, styles, honours, and arms ==
Philip held many titles throughout his life. Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles before he married and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles. Elizabeth formally issued letters patent in 1957 making him a British prince.

=== Honours and honorary military appointments ===
Philip was awarded medals from Britain, France, and Greece for his service during the Second World War, as well as ones commemorating the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II and the silver, gold and diamond jubilees of Elizabeth. George VI appointed him to the Order of the Garter on the eve of his wedding on 19 November 1947. Since then, Philip received 17 appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth and 48 from foreign states. The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu, worship Philip as a god-like spiritual figure; the islanders possess portraits of him and hold feasts on his birthday.
Upon his wife&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1952, Philip was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, Colonel-in-Chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Air Training Corps. The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia. In 1975 he was appointed colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a position he handed over to his son Andrew in 2017. On 16 December 2015, he relinquished his role as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief and was succeeded by his granddaughter-in-law Catherine, then Duchess of Cambridge, as Honorary Air Commandant.

To celebrate Philip&#x27;s 90th birthday, Elizabeth appointed him Lord High Admiral, as well as to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces. On their 70th wedding anniversary, 20 November 2017, she appointed him Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, making him the first British national since his uncle Lord Mountbatten of Burma to be entitled to wear the breast stars of four orders of chivalry in the United Kingdom.

== Ancestry ==

Both Philip and Elizabeth were great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, Elizabeth by descent from Victoria&#x27;s eldest son, King Edward VII, and Philip by descent from Victoria&#x27;s second daughter, Princess Alice. Both were also descended from King Christian IX of Denmark.
Philip was also related to the House of Romanov through all four of his grandparents. His paternal grandmother was the granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. His paternal grandfather was a brother of Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark), wife of Emperor Alexander III. His maternal grandmother was a sister of Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), wife of Emperor Nicholas II, and Elizabeth Feodorovna (Elisabeth of Hesse), wife of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. His maternal grandfather was the nephew of Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse), who was the wife of Emperor Alexander II.

In 1993 scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of the Romanov family, more than seventy years after their murder in 1918, by comparing their mitochondrial DNA to living matrilineal relatives, including Philip. Philip, Alexandra Feodorovna, and her children were all descended from Princess Alice through a purely female line.

<doc id="62095" wikidata="Q1536746" url="?curid=62095" title="Four Daughters (1938 film)">
<text>Four Daughters is a 1938 American romance film that tells the story of a happy musical family whose lives and loves are disrupted by the arrival of a charming young composer who interjects himself into the daughters&#x27; romantic lives. His cynical, bitter musician friend comes to help orchestrate his latest composition and complicates matters even more. The movie stars the Lane Sisters (Priscilla Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane) and Gale Page, and features Claude Rains, Jeffrey Lynn, John Garfield, and Dick Foran. The three Lanes were sisters and members of a family singing trio.

The film was written by Lenore J. Coffee and Julius J. Epstein, adapted from the 1937 Fannie Hurst story &quot;Sister Act&quot;, and was directed by Michael Curtiz. The movie&#x27;s success led to two sequels with more or less the same cast: &quot;Four Wives&quot; and &quot;Four Mothers&quot;. The same cast—with the addition of Fay Bainter and Donald Crisp—appeared in the film &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot;, which had no connection with the Lemp family trilogy.

==Plot==
The Lemp sisters, Emma (Gale Page), Thea (Lola Lane), Kay (Rosemary Lane), and Ann (Priscilla Lane) are accomplished musicians in a musical family headed by their widowed father, Adam (Claude Rains), who plays the flute. Harpist Emma, the oldest daughter, is the object of a neighbor&#x27;s affection, but she rebuffs Ernest&#x27;s (Dick Foran) attentions. Thea, a pianist and the second eldest, is courted by wealthy Ben Crowley (Frank McHugh), another neighbor, but she is not sure she loves him. Kay, the third daughter, is a talented singer and has a chance at a music school scholarship but doesn&#x27;t want to leave home. The youngest daughter is Ann, a violinist.

One day, Ann&#x27;s violin practice is interrupted by the sound of their front gate squeaking. She instructs the young man making free with it in the finer points of the art, and introduces him to an apparently disapproving passerby, Mrs. Ridgefield, a local gossip. This charmer is young composer Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), come to work at the foundation where Adam is Dean. He has a letter of introduction to Adam, and while they talk, the girls set the dinner table with the very best silver. All four daughters are attracted to Felix, and they soon invite him to room with the family. He also charms Aunt Etta. Felix hopes to win a prize with his latest composition. Enter Felix&#x27;s friend Mickey (John Garfield), a cynical orchestral arranger whose hard life has given him a grim view of existence. He falls for Ann, and is crushed when she announces at Adam&#x27;s birthday party that she and Felix are engaged.

An hour before Ann and Felix are to marry, Mickey tells Ann how he feels—and that Emma is “insane” about Felix. Through a window, Ann observes Emma&#x27;s distress when she ties Felix&#x27;s tie before the ceremony. Everyone is wondering where Ann is when a telegram arrives, addressed to Emma, telling them she has eloped with Mickey. Ernest calmly steps in to tell the guests.

Four months later, Ann and Mickey are living a hard life in New York City, professing love for each other but poor and unhappy. Mickey is invited to form a band and go to South America with some fellow musicians, but cannot afford passage. Ann forbids him to ask Ben for the money and asks Mickey if he would go if she weren&#x27;t hung around his neck.

The family meets at the Lemps&#x27; house for Christmas, except Kay, who is singing on the radio that night. Emma did not get together with Felix; she is now engaged to Ernest. Felix is alone and unhappy, though the composition Mickey helped to orchestrate won a prize: a contract with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. He is to leave that very night. While Kay sings Mendelssohn&#x27;s “On Wings of Song,” the camera passes over the listening family, revealing much. Ann, moved to tears, takes out her handkerchief and drops two pawn tickets. Felix sees them—one is for a bracelet he&#x27;d given her earlier in the year.

Mickey drives Felix to the train station in Ben&#x27;s car, dropping Ben at the drugstore. He apologizes to Felix, who says it is all in the past. Felix offers Mickey a loan, but Mickey refuses, musing that he must be a new man; the old Mickey would have taken it. As the train pulls out, Felix presses an envelope into his hands and tells him to use it for Ann, “any way you think that will make her happy.” Mickey watches the train leave and is suddenly grim. He gets into the car and drives away. It begins to snow. He turns off the windshield wiper and presses the accelerator to the floor.

In the kitchen, doing dishes, Emma tells Ann that she had thought she was in love with Felix and would have kept on thinking so and spoiled her life if Ann had married him, but she was awakened to Ernest&#x27;s qualities when he took charge at the wedding. Ann bursts into tears—and Thea screams. Ben is in the hospital.

Adam emerges from the hospital room to tell them that it isn&#x27;t Ben, it&#x27;s Mickey. He dies with Ann at his bedside.

It is spring; the trees in the yard are heavy with blossom. The girls and Adam are playing the piece that opened the film. Ann hears the sound of the gate squeaking. It is Felix. The family watches from the house as she welcomes him home and they swing together—until Mrs. Ridgefield approaches. “This is where we came in,” Felix cries, and they run inside. Mrs. Ridgefield looks around and steps onto the gate. The camera pulls slowly back as she swings back and forth, a blissful smile on her face.

==Cast==
==Production==
Contemporary sources report that Errol Flynn was originally cast as Felix, but dropped out because of illness. According to TCM, Flynn was actually unhappy with the size of the part. Modern sources indicate that Michael Curtiz wanted Burgess Meredith to play Mickey, but he was unavailable. Garfield modeled his performance on troubled pianist Oscar Levant. Garfield&#x27;s characterization of Mickey in this, his first major film role, defined his screen personality for many future roles.

The classical music that plays a key part in the film is not identified and the composers are not credited on screen. The only onscreen credit is “Music by Max Steiner”. Records credit Franz Schubert and his Serenade, which opens the film and is played again near the end. According to TCM.com, Harry Warren, Al Dubin, Allie Wrubel, Elliot Grennard, Hugo Friedhofer, Heinz Roemheld and Bernard Kaun contributed to the music. Max Rabinowitz composed &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Theme,&quot; and also played the piano off-screen during Garfield&#x27;s performance. Ray Heindorf handled the orchestration.

==Reception==
The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; movie review said: &quot;A charming, at times heartbreakingly human, little comedy about life in a musical family of attractive daughters which occasionally is ruffled by the drama of a masculine world outside, Four Daughters, at the Music Hall, tempts one to agree with Jack Warner&#x27;s recent assertion in the advertisements that it is the climax of his career. Putting aside Mr. Warner&#x27;s career for the nonce, we may assert with equal confidence that Four Daughters is one of the best pictures of anybody&#x27;s career, if only for the sake of the marvelously meaningful character of Mickey Borden as portrayed by John (formerly Jules) Garfield, who bites off his lines with a delivery so eloquent that we still aren&#x27;t sure whether it is the dialogue or Mr. Garfield who is so bitterly brilliant.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; named it one of the year&#x27;s ten best films. The National Board of Review named Garfield as one of the year&#x27;s best actors.

The film has a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews.

==Accolades==
==Film series and remake==
&quot;Four Daughters&quot; is the first in a series of four films by Warner Bros. featuring the Lane Sisters and the other cast members. It was followed by 1939&#x27;s &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot;, also directed by Michael Curtiz and co-starring Claude Rains and John Garfield, though it is a story about a different family. However, the storyline of &quot;Four Daughters&quot; and the Lemp family is continued in the 1940 film, &quot;Four Wives&quot;, and 1941&#x27;s &quot;Four Mothers&quot;.

&quot;Four Daughters&quot; was remade in 1954 as &quot;Young at Heart,&quot; starring Frank Sinatra in the role played by Garfield and Doris Day in Priscilla Lane&#x27;s part. All the characters&#x27; names were changed, the number of daughters was reduced to three, and the young men who vie for the heroine&#x27;s heart compose songs rather than orchestral music. &quot;Young at Heart&quot; also has a very different ending: Frank Sinatra&#x27;s character&#x27;s suicide attempt fails.

==Home media==
Warner Archive released &quot;Four Daughters&quot; on DVD on August 4, 2009. The film was also released by Warner Archive in the &quot;Four Daughters Movie Series Collection&quot; on August 1, 2011.

<text>La Grande Illusion (French for &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;) is a 1937 French war drama film directed by Jean Renoir, who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Spaak. The story concerns class relationships among a small group of French officers who are German prisoners of war during World War I and are plotting an escape. 

The title of the film comes from the 1909 book &quot;The Great Illusion&quot; by British journalist Norman Angell, which argued that war is futile because of the common economic interests of all European nations. The perspective of the film is generously humanistic to its characters of various nationalities.

&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of French cinema and among the greatest films ever made. Orson Welles named &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; as one of the two movies he would take with him &quot;on the ark&quot;. Director and producer Sydney Pollack picked &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; as one of his ten favorite films of all time.

In 1958, the film was voted number 5 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. In 1995, the Vatican included &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; in its list of 45 &quot;great films&quot; under the category of &quot;Art.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked it #35 in &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

==Plot==

During the First World War, two French aviators of the &quot;Service Aéronautique&quot;, the aristocratic Captain de Boëldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Maréchal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German flying ace and aristocrat, &quot;Rittmeister&quot; von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army. Upon returning to the aerodrome, Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Boëldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances—a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.

Boëldieu and Maréchal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Maréchal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. As a result of the disruption, Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Boëldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.

Boëldieu and Maréchal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.

At Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew who generously shares the food parcels he receives. Boëldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Boëldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Maréchal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.

Rauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Boëldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up. Boëldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but misses and accidentally (and fatally) hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Boëldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world.

Maréchal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Maréchal down. They quarrel and part, but then Maréchal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at Verdun, along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as &quot;our greatest victories&quot;. She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Maréchal fall in love, despite not speaking each other&#x27;s language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Maréchal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war.

A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.
==Cast==
==Political and historical themes==
Renoir used the First World War (1914–1918) as a lens through which to examine Europe as it faced the rising spectre of fascism (especially in Nazi Germany) and the impending approach of the Second World War (1939–1945). Renoir&#x27;s critique of contemporary politics and ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends national and racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that mankind&#x27;s common experiences should prevail above political division, and its extension: war.

On the message of &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, Renoir himself said, in a film trailer, dating from the re-release of the film in 1958: &quot;[&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; is] a story about human relationships. I am confident that such a question is so important today that if we don&#x27;t solve it, we will just have to say &#x27;goodbye&#x27; to our beautiful world.&quot; Despite widespread interest in the subject, Renoir found it difficult to find a producer and distributor, having to &quot;shop around&quot; the project for years.

===Class===
&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; examines the relationships between different social classes in Europe. Two of the main characters, Boëldieu and Rauffenstein, are aristocrats. They are represented as cosmopolitan men, educated in many cultures and conversant in several languages. Their level of education and their devotion to social conventions and rituals makes them feel closer to each other than to the lower class of their own nation. They share similar social experiences: dining at Maxim&#x27;s in Paris, courting dalliances with the same woman, and even know of each other through acquaintances. They converse with each other in heavily formal French and German, and in moments of intimate personal conversation, escape into English as if to hide these comments from their lower class counterparts.

Renoir depicts the rule of the aristocracy in &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; as in decline, to be replaced by a new, emerging social order, led by men who were not born to privilege. He emphasizes that their class is no longer an essential component to their respective nation&#x27;s politics. Both Rauffenstein and Boëldieu view their military service as a duty, and see the war as having a purpose; as such, Renoir depicts them as laudable but tragic figures whose world is disappearing and who are trapped in a code of life that is rapidly becoming meaningless. Both are aware that their time is past, but their reaction to this reality diverges: Boëldieu accepts the fate of the aristocracy as a positive improvement, but Rauffenstein does not, lamenting what he sarcastically calls the &quot;charming legacy of the French Revolution&quot;.

In &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, Renoir contrasts the aristocrats with characters such as Maréchal (Gabin), an engineer from Paris. The lower class characters have little in common with each other; they have different interests and are not worldly in their views or education. Nonetheless, they have a kinship too, through common sentiment and experience.

Renoir&#x27;s message is made clear when the aristocratic Boëldieu sacrifices himself by distracting the prison guards by dancing around, singing, and playing a flute, to allow Maréchal and Rosenthal, members of the lower class, to escape. Reluctantly and strictly out of duty, Rauffenstein is forced to shoot Boëldieu, an act that Boëldieu admits he would have been compelled to do were the circumstances reversed. However, in accepting his inevitable death, Boëldieu takes comfort in the idea that &quot;For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy. But for you and me, it&#x27;s a good way out&quot;, and states that he has pity for Rauffenstein who will struggle to find a purpose in the new social order of the world where his traditions, experiences, and background are obsolete.

The critique of the romantic idealization of duty in &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; is comparable to that in the earlier film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque.

===Prejudice===
In &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, Renoir briefly touches on the question of antisemitism through the character of Rosenthal, a son from a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; Jewish banking family (a parallel to the Rothschild banking family of France). His biographers believed that Renoir created this character to counter the rising anti-Jewish campaign enacted by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s government in Nazi Germany. Further, Rosenthal is shown as a symbol of humanity across class lines: though he may be financially wealthy, he shares his food parcels with everyone so that he and his fellow prisoners are well fed — when compared with their German captors. Through the character of Rosenthal, Renoir rebuffs Jewish stereotypes.

There is also a black French officer among the prisoners at Wintersborn who appears to be ignored by the other prisoners, and not accepted as an equal by them. When he speaks to them he is not responded to. For instance, when he shows his artwork, he is shrugged off.

===War===
In &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; Renoir seeks to refute the notion that war accomplishes anything, or that it can be used as a political tool to solve problems and create a better world. &quot;That&#x27;s all an illusion&quot;, says Rosenthal, speaking of the belief that this is the war that will end war forever.

&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; is a war film without any depiction of battle. Instead, the prisoner of war camp setting is used as a space in which soldiers of many nations have a common experience. Renoir portrays war as a futile exercise. For instance, Elsa, the German widow, shows photos to Maréchal and Rosenthal of her husband and her brothers who were killed, respectively, at the battles of Verdun, Liège, Charleroi, and Tannenberg. The last three of these battles were amongst Germany&#x27;s most celebrated victories in World War I. Through this device, Renoir refutes the notion that one common man&#x27;s bravery, honor, or duty can make an impact on a great event. This undermines the idealistic intention of Maréchal and Rosenthal to return to the front, so that by returning to the fight they can help end this war.

== Production ==
Elements of &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; are semi-autobiographical in nature. Jean Renoir was a reconnaissance pilot during World War I, and received a change of post after being wounded in action. Renoir&#x27;s life was saved by a French pilot, Armand Pinsard, when he was under attack by a German Fokker in 1915, during the First World War. In 1935, during the production of &quot;Toni&quot;, Pinsard recounted his WWI history, shot down seven times, captured seven times, and escaping seven times from German POW camps, inspiring Grand Illusion, and Pinsard became the model for Lt. Maréchal.&lt;ref name=&quot;unaffiliatedcritic/grand-illusion-1937&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir used his own uniform as Jean Gabin&#x27;s costume in the film. Several other cast members had also fought in the war, Marcel Dalio won the Croix de Guerre for his actions with the French artillery during the Action at Villers-Cotterêts (1914), and Pierre Fresnay was in the army between 1916 and 1919. Renoir developed the screenplay with Charles Spaak,&lt;ref name=&quot;inlibris/bn33953&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and spent several years trying to finance it. Through Albert Pinkévitch, an assistant to the financier, Frank Rollmer, and the attachment of Jean Gabin, private producers finally supported a small production budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;sensesofcinema/2003/great/renoir/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting of Erich von Stroheim came as Renoir was a great admirer of the director&#x27;s films, and had inspired him to pursue filmmaking. According to Renoir&#x27;s memoirs, Stroheim, despite having been born in Vienna, Austria (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire) did not speak much German as he had been living in the United States since 1909, and struggled with learning the language along with his lines in between filming scenes. Renoir eventually resorted to hiring a dialect coach to help Stroheim with his lines.

&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; was filmed in the winter of 1936-37.&lt;ref name=&quot;bfi.org.uk/grande-illusion-1937-greatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exteriors of &quot;Burg Wintersborn&quot; were filmed at the Upper Koenigsbourg Castle in Alsace. Other exteriors were filmed at the artillery barracks at Colmar (built by Wilhelm II) and at Neuf-Brisach on the Upper Rhine. The interiors were shot at Epinay and Billancourt Studios.

==Soundtrack==
The score was written by the Hungarian composer Joseph Kosma, who also wrote the famous song &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot; The soundtrack also includes many well-known songs of the day from French, English, and German cultures. The uncredited musical director was the film and music critic Émile Vuillermoz, who had been a composer in his early career.

Songs:
* &quot;Frou-Frou&quot; (1897) lyrics written by Montréal and Blondeau, music by Henri Chatau, performed by Lucile Panis.
* &quot;Il était un petit navire&quot; (&quot;There Once was a Little Ship&quot;), played by Boëldieu with his penny whistle to distract the German guards from Rosenthal and Maréchal&#x27;s escape, a traditional French song about a shipwrecked sailor who must cannibalize another sailor to survive. Later in the film, the fugitives Rosenthal and Maréchal shout the song sarcastically at one another as they have a near falling out. The lyrics speak to their own condition of running out of food. As Maréchal realizes this, his singing trails off.
* &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;, a French nursery rhyme
* &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;
* &quot;Si tu veux Marguerite&quot; (1913) by Harry Fragson
* &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the French national anthem

==Reception==
===Europe===
After the film won a prize at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Best Artistic Ensemble&quot; in 1937, and was nominated for the International Jury Cup, the Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels declared &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; &quot;Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1&quot; and ordered the prints to be confiscated and destroyed. Fearing a decline in fighting morale, French authorities banned the film in 1940 &quot;pour la durée des hostilités&quot; (for the duration of hostilities). This ban was renewed by the German Propaganda-Abteilung in October of the same year. When the German Army marched into France in 1940 during World War II, the Nazis seized the prints and negative of the film, chiefly because of its anti-war message, and what were perceived as ideological criticisms pointed towards Germany on the eve of the Second World War.

&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; was a massive hit in France, with an estimated 12 million admissions.

===United States and elsewhere===
&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, released by World Pictures Corporation in the U.S. premiered on 12 September 1938 in New York City; Frank S. Nugent in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; a &quot;strange and interesting film&quot; that &quot;owes much to his cast&quot;, 

&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; won the awards for Best Foreign Film at the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards and at the 1938 National Board of Review Awards it was named the Best Foreign Language Film for that year. At the 11th Academy Awards held on 23 February 1939, &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; became the first foreign language film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

At the time of its release, John Ford, impressed with the film, opted to remake it in English but was urged by studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck not to. &quot;You&#x27;ll never top it,&quot; he told Ford.

Orson Welles, in an interview with Dick Cavett on 27 July 1970, expressed that if he only could save a handful of films that were not his own for future posterity, this would be one of those films.

Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot;

Sixty years after its release, Janet Maslin called it &quot;one of the most haunting of all war films&quot; and an &quot;oasis of subtlety, moral intelligence and deep emotion on the cinematic landscape&quot;; according to Maslin:
Film critic Roger Ebert also reviewed the film after its 1999 re-release, and added it to his list of The Great Movies:
Filmmakers such as Akira Kurosawa and Billy Wilder cited &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; as one of their favorite films. In the 2012 edition of the annual Sight And Sound poll in which directors are asked to select their favourite movies, Woody Allen picked La Grand Illusion as one of his top ten.

==Prints and home media==
For many years, the original nitrate film negative of &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; was thought to have been lost in an Allied air raid in 1942 that destroyed a leading laboratory outside Paris. Prints of the film were rediscovered in 1958 and restored and re-released during the early 1960s. Then, it was revealed that the original negative had been shipped back to Berlin (probably due to the efforts of Frank Hensel) to be stored in the Reichsfilmarchiv vaults. In the Allied occupation of Berlin in 1945, the Reichsfilmarchiv by chance was in the Russian zone and consequently shipped along with many other films back to be the basis of the Soviet Gosfilmofond film archive in Moscow. The negative was returned to France in the 1960s, but sat unidentified in storage in Toulouse Cinémathèque for over 30 years, as no one suspected it had survived. It was rediscovered in the early 1990s as the Cinémathèque&#x27;s nitrate collection was slowly being transferred to the French Film Archives at Bois d&#x27;Arcy.

In August 1999, Rialto Pictures re-released the film in the United States, based on the Cinémathèque negative found in Toulouse; after watching the new print at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Janet Maslin called it &quot;beautifully refurbished&quot; and &quot;especially lucid&quot;. A transfer of this restored print was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection in 1999 as spine number 1, but has been out of print since 2005. &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; was intended to be Criterion&#x27;s first release on the DVD format in 1998, but the discovery of the new negative delayed its release.

In 2012, StudioCanal and Lionsgate released a 1080p Blu-ray version based on a new high-definition scan of the original negative. According to Lee Kline, Technical Director of the Criterion Collection, this release was &quot;night and day of what we didbecause they had better film.&quot;

<doc id="62107" wikidata="Q129143" url="?curid=62107" title="Trafalgar Square">
<text>Trafalgar Square ( ) is a public square in the City of Westminster, Central London, established in the early 19th century around the area formerly known as Charing Cross. The square&#x27;s name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, the British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar.

The site around Trafalgar Square has been a significant landmark since the 1200s. For centuries, distances measured from Charing Cross have served as location markers. The site of the present square formerly contained the elaborately designed, enclosed courtyard, King&#x27;s Mews. After George IV moved the mews to Buckingham Palace, the area was redeveloped by John Nash, but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The Nelson&#x27;s Column at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the Fourth Plinth, left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999. Prominent buildings facing the square include the National Gallery, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Canada House, and South Africa House.

The square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations, including Bloody Sunday in 1887, the culmination of the first Aldermaston March, anti-war protests, and campaigns against climate change. A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It was well known for its feral pigeons until their removal in the early 21st century.

== Name ==
The square is named after the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar, southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.

The name &quot;Trafalgar&quot; is a Spanish word of Arabic origin, derived from either &quot;Taraf al-Ghar&quot; ( &#x27;cape of the cave/laurel&#x27;) or &quot;Taraf al-Gharb&quot; ( &#x27;extremity of the west&#x27;).

== Geography ==
Trafalgar Square is owned by the King in Right of the Crown and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, including the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace. The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4, a major road running west of the City of London. Originally having roadways on all four sides, traffic travelled in both directions around the square until a one-way clockwise gyratory system was introduced on 26 April 1926. Works completed in 2003 reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side to traffic.

Nelson&#x27;s Column is in the centre of the square, flanked by fountains designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens between 1937 and 1939 (replacements for two of Peterhead granite, now in Canada) and guarded by four monumental bronze lions sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer. At the top of the column is a statue of Horatio Nelson, who commanded the British Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar.

Surrounding the square are the National Gallery on the north side and St Martin-in-the-Fields Church to the east. Also on the east is South Africa House, and facing it across the square is Canada House. To the south west is The Mall, which leads towards Buckingham Palace via Admiralty Arch, while Whitehall is to the south and the Strand to the east. Charing Cross Road passes between the National Gallery and the church.

London Underground&#x27;s Charing Cross station on the Northern and Bakerloo lines has an exit in the square. The lines had separate stations, of which the Bakerloo line one was called Trafalgar Square until they were linked and renamed in 1979 as part of the construction of the Jubilee line, which was rerouted to Westminster in 1999. Other nearby tube stations are Embankment connecting the District, Circle, Northern and Bakerloo lines, and Leicester Square on the Northern and Piccadilly lines.

London bus routes 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 23, 24, 29, 53, 87, 88, 91, 139, 159, 176, 453 are only some among the bus routes that pass through Trafalgar Square.

A point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from the capital.


== History ==

Building work on the south side of the square in the late 1950s revealed deposits from the last interglacial period. Among the findings were the remains of cave lions, rhinoceroses, straight-tusked elephants and hippopotami.

The site has been significant since the 13th century. During Edward I&#x27;s reign it hosted the King&#x27;s Mews, running north from the T-junction in the south, Charing Cross, where the Strand from the City meets Whitehall coming north from Westminster. From the reign of Richard II to that of Henry VII, the mews was at the western end of the Strand. The name &quot;Royal Mews&quot; comes from the practice of keeping hawks here for moulting; &quot;mew&quot; is an old word for this. After a fire in 1534, the mews were rebuilt as stables, and remained here until George IV moved them to Buckingham Palace.

=== Clearance and development ===

After 1732, the King&#x27;s Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is occupied by the National Gallery.

In 1826 the Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent&#x27;s stable block, and as far east as St Martin&#x27;s Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy of Arts. The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin&#x27;s Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after. Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named after William IV commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830. Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar as suggested by architect George Ledwell Taylor, commemorating Nelson&#x27;s victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars.
After the clearance, development progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by William Wilkins, and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins&#x27; plan for the laying out of the square, but it was not put into effect. In April 1840, following Wilkins&#x27; death, new plans by Charles Barry were accepted, and construction started within weeks. For Barry, as for Wilkins, a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery, which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur. He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area to the level of the footway between Cockspur Street and the Strand, and constructing a high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level. Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps. All the stonework was of Aberdeen granite. In 1845, four Bude-Lights with octagonal glass lanterns were installed. Two, opposite the National Gallery, are on tall bronze columns, and two, in the south-west and south-east corners of the square, on shorter bronze columns on top of wider granite columns. They were designed by Barry and manufactured by Stevens and Son, of Southwark.

In 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout. The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was £11,000. The earth removed was used to level Green Park. The square was originally surfaced with tarmacadam, which was replaced with stone in the 1920s.

Trafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844.

=== Nelson&#x27;s Column ===
Nelson&#x27;s Column was planned independently of Barry&#x27;s work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government proposing that a monument to the victory of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square. A competition was held and won by the architect William Railton, who proposed a Corinthinan column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, but received widespread objections from the public. Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to . The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843.

The last of the bronze reliefs on the column&#x27;s pedestals was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson&#x27;s Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.

Barry was unhappy about Nelson&#x27;s Column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee that &quot;it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art&quot;.

In 1940 the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson&#x27;s Column to Berlin after an expected German invasion, as related by Norman Longmate in &quot;If Britain Had Fallen&quot; (1972).

The square has been Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens since 1996.

=== Terrorist bombings ===

The square was the target of two suffragette bombings in 1913 and 1914. This was as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign of 1912–1914, in which suffragettes carried out a series of politically-motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide as part of their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage.

The first attack occurred on 15 May 1913. A bomb was planted in the public area outside the National Gallery, but failed to explode. A second attack occurred at St Martin-in-the-Fields church at the north-east corner of the square on 4 April 1914. A bomb exploded inside the church, blowing out the windows and showering passers-by with broken glass. The bomb then started a fire. In the aftermath, a mass of people rushed to the scene, many of whom aggressively expressed their anger towards the suffragettes. Churches were a particular target during the campaign, as it was believed that the Church of England was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage. Between 1913 and 1914, 32 churches were attacked nationwide. In the weeks after the bombing, there were also attacks on Westminster Abbey and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

=== Redevelopment ===
A major 18-month redevelopment of the square led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.

== Statues and monuments ==
=== Plinths ===

Barry&#x27;s scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV was designed by Sir Francis Chantrey and Thomas Earle. It was originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, but instead was installed on the eastern plinth in 1843, while the other plinths remained empty until late in the 20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.

==== Fourth plinth ====

In the 21st century, the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square, the &quot;Fourth Plinth&quot;, has been used to show specially commissioned temporary artworks. The scheme was initiated by the Royal Society of Arts and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the Mayor of London.

=== Other sculptures ===
There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe (by Sir Charles Wheeler) and David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty (by William MacMillan) were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square&#x27;s fountains, which also commemorate them. The third, of the Second World War First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope (by Franta Belsky) was unveiled alongside them on 1967.

On the south side of Trafalgar Square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.

The two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the statue of James II (designed by Peter van Dievoet and Laurens van der Meulen for the studio of Grinling Gibbons) to the west of the portico, and of one George Washington, a replica of a work by Jean-Antoine Houdon, to the east. The latter was a gift from the Commonwealth of Virginia, installed in 1921.

Two statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed. One of Edward Jenner, pioneer of the smallpox vaccine, was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862. The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.

== Fountains ==

In 1841, following suggestions from the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.

In the late-1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The original centrepieces were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa&#x27;s Confederation Park and Regina&#x27;s Wascana Centre.

A programme of restoration was completed by . The pump system was replaced with one capable of sending an jet of water into the air. A LED lighting system that can project different combinations of colours on to the fountains was installed to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance and to coincide with the 2012 Summer Olympics.

== Pigeons ==
The square was once famous for feral pigeons and feeding them was a popular activity. Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era. The desirability of the birds&#x27; presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.

In February 2001, the sale of bird seed in the square was stopped and other measures were introduced to discourage the pigeons including the use of birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson&#x27;s column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of £140,000.

== Events ==

=== New Year ===
For many years, revellers celebrating the New Year have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers. The fireworks display has been cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an event due to take place in the Square to see in 2022. However the event was cancelled during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.

=== Christmas ===

A Christmas ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947. A Norway spruce (or sometimes a fir) is presented by Norway&#x27;s capital city, Oslo as London&#x27;s Christmas tree, a token of gratitude for Britain&#x27;s support during World War II. (Besides war-time support, Norway&#x27;s Prince Olav and the country&#x27;s government lived in exile in London throughout the war.)

The Christmas tree is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity is open to the public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.

The tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo&#x27;s municipal forest and shipped, across the North Sea to the Port of Felixstowe, then by road to Trafalgar Square. The first tree was tall, but more recently has been around . In 1987, protesters chained themselves to the tree. In 1990, a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year&#x27;s Eve party was scheduled to take place. He was arrested and the tree was repaired by tree surgeons who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane.

=== Political demonstrations ===

The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners, developing over its history from &quot;an esplanade peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country&#x27;s foremost &quot;place politique&quot;&quot;, as historian Rodney Mace has written. Since its construction, it has been a venue for political demonstrations. The great Chartist rally in 1848, a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square. A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests. On 1886 (also known as &quot;Black Monday&quot;), protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in Pall Mall. A larger riot (&quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;) occurred in the square on 1887.

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&#x27;s first Aldermaston March, protesting against the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), began in the square in 1958. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. In March 1968, a crowd of 10,000 demonstrated against US involvement in the Vietnam War before marching to the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.
Throughout the 1980s, a continuous anti-apartheid protest was held outside South Africa House. In 1990, the Poll Tax Riots began by a demonstration attended by 200,000 people and ultimately caused rioting in the surrounding area. More recently, there have been anti-war demonstrations opposing the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. A large vigil was held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on Thursday, 2005.

In December 2009, participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks during which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in Copenhagen. It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.

In March 2011, the square was occupied by a crowd protesting against the UK Budget and proposed budget cuts. During the night the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square. In November 2015 a vigil against the terrorist attacks in Paris was held. Crowds sang the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and held banners in support of the city and country.

Every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar (), the Sea Cadet Corps holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar. The Royal British Legion holds a Silence in the Square event on Armistice Day, 11 November, in remembrance of those who died in war. The event includes music and poetry readings, culminating in a bugler playing the Last Post and a two-minute silence at 11 am.

In February 2019, hundreds of students participated in a protest against climate change as a part of the School strike for Climate campaign. The protest started in the nearby Parliament Square, and as the day went on, the demonstrators moved towards Trafalgar Square.

In July 2020, two members of the protest group Animal Rebellion were arrested on suspicion for criminal damage after releasing red dye into the fountains.

In September 2020, anti-lockdown protests opposed to the imposition of regulations relating to the coronavirus outbreak took place in the square.

A police observation box has been in the Square since 1919, originally a wooden freestanding unit, it was replaced by hollowing out a lampstand at the southeastern corner of the Square into a permanent structure in 1928, but decommissioned in the 1970s.

=== Sport ===
In the 21st century, Trafalgar Square has been the location for several sporting events and victory parades. In June 2002, 12,000 people gathered to watch England&#x27;s FIFA World Cup quarter-final against Brazil on giant video screens which had been erected for the occasion. The square was used by England on 2003 to celebrate their victory in the Rugby World Cup, and on 2005 for England&#x27;s victory in the Ashes series.

On 6 July 2005, Trafalgar Square hosted the official watch party for London&#x27;s bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, hosted by Katy Hill and Margherita Taylor. A countdown clock was erected in March 2011, although engineering and weather-related faults caused it to stop a day later. In 2007, it hosted the opening ceremonies of the Tour de France and was part of the course for subsequent races.

=== Other uses ===

The Sea Cadets hold a yearly Battle of Trafalgar victory parade running the north of Whitehall, from Horse Guard&#x27;s Parade to Nelson&#x27;s Column.

As an archetypal London location, Trafalgar Square featured in film and television productions during the Swinging London era of the late 1960s, including &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;. It was used for filming several sketches and a cartoon backdrop in the BBC comedy series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. In May 2007, the square was grassed over with 2,000 square metres of turf for two days in a campaign by London authorities to promote &quot;green spaces&quot; in the city.

In July 2011, due to building works in Leicester Square, the world premiere of the final film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, was held in Trafalgar Square, with a red carpet linking the squares. Fans camped in Trafalgar Square for up to three days before the premiere, despite torrential rain. It was the first film premiere ever to be held there.

The square has seen controversy over busking and street theatre, which have attracted complaints over noise and public safety. In 2012, the Greater London Authority created a bylaw for regulating busking and associated tourism. In 2016, the National Gallery proposed to introduce licensing for such performances.

<text>Elliot McKay See Jr. (July 23, 1927 – February 28, 1966) was an American engineer, naval aviator, test pilot and NASA astronaut.

See received an appointment to the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1945. He graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree in marine engineering and a United States Naval Reserve commission, and joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric as an engineer. He was called to active duty as a naval aviator during the Korean War, and flew Grumman F9F Panther fighters with Fighter Squadron 144 (VF-144) from the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and in the Western Pacific. He married Marilyn Denahy in 1954, and they had three children.

See rejoined General Electric (GE) in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty, and became a group leader and experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, where he flew the latest jet aircraft with GE engines. He also obtained a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from UCLA.

Selected in NASA&#x27;s second group of astronauts in 1962, See was the prime command pilot for what would have been his first space flight, Gemini 9. He was killed along with Charles Bassett, his Gemini 9 crewmate, in a NASA jet crash at the St. Louis McDonnell Aircraft plant, where they were to undergo two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training.

==Early life and education==
Elliot McKay See Jr. was born on July 23, 1927, in Dallas, Texas, to Elliot McKay See Sr. (1888–1968) and Mamie Norton See ( Drummond; 1900–1988). He was the first of two children; his sister Sally Drummond See rounded out the family in 1930. His father was an electrical engineer who worked for General Electric, and his mother worked in jobs ranging from advertising to real estate. See was active in the Boy Scouts of America for five years, and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended Highland Park High School and was on the varsity team in several sports, including boxing. He was also on the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Rifle Team. He graduated from high school in 1945.

The United States entered World War II in December 1941. See had to choose between going to war or going to college, as he would otherwise be drafted at age 18. He decided to apply for aviation cadet training. He failed a physical, and, according to See, &quot;going to college became the most important thing&quot;. He enrolled at the University of Texas, and after a few months pledged to Phi Kappa Psi. While at the University of Texas, he signed up for flying lessons and received his private pilot&#x27;s license.

See applied for military officer training and received an appointment to the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in 1945. As the end of the war drew near, the USMMA changed its curriculum to a four-year college-level program, which was the minimum requirement to be a merchant marine in peacetime. He spent his plebe year at Pass Christian, Mississippi, where the USMMA had a satellite campus, and then transferred to the main campus at Kings Point, New York. He commanded the Third Company as a cadet officer. He was a member of the Propeller Club and head cheerleader. He was on the mile relay running team, played intramural softball, and was a varsity boxer. As co-captain of the rifle team, he won the Captain Tomb Trophy for individual rifle and pistol marksmanship in December 1948. In 1949, Congress authorized the USMMA to award Bachelor of Science degrees to its graduates, so on graduation that year Elliot received his B.S. degree, his marine engineer&#x27;s licenses, and a commission as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve.

==Navy service and General Electric==

After graduation, See took a summer job with Lykes Brothers Steamship Company. On September 1, 1949, he joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric, the firm his father had worked for, in Boston. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when the division was relocated. There he met Marilyn Jane Denahy from Georgetown, Ohio, who worked at General Electric as a secretary. He and his friend Tay Haney pooled their funds to buy a Luscombe Silvaire Sprayer aircraft, which they flew on cross-country trips. In November 1952, while taking Marilyn on a joyride, the Luscombe&#x27;s engine began to fail. See attempted to land the aircraft on a short, unimproved field, but the tail wheel snagged a power line and forced the aircraft into the ground. See suffered deep cuts to his face which required plastic surgery. Marilyn escaped the crash with only minor injuries.

By 1953, See was working as a flight test engineer at General Electric&#x27;s plant in Evendale, Ohio. Like many naval reservists, he was called to active duty due to the Korean War. He was initially stationed at Miramar Naval Air Station near San Diego, California. He married Marilyn on September 30, 1954, before shipping out for a sixteen-month operational tour as a naval aviator, flying the Grumman F9F Panther with Fighter Squadron 144 (VF-144), part of Carrier Air Group 14. He was deployed to the Mediterranean on the aircraft carrier , which returned to the United States in June 1955.

In October, after further training at El Centro Naval Air Station, California, he embarked with VF-144 on an operational cruise on the aircraft carrier , which formed part of Task Force 77. The task force traveled to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippine Islands, and Hong Kong. See primarily focused on line maintenance, but also became proficient at carrier landings. By the end of the tour, he had reached the rank of lieutenant commander. He returned home in February 1956, in time for the birth of his first child, Sally. The couple later had two more children: Carolyn in 1957, and David in 1962.

See rejoined General Electric in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty. He became a group leader and experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where the United States Air Force conducted flight tests. He served as a project pilot for the development of the General Electric J79-8 engine used in the F4H aircraft. He also conducted powerplant flight tests on the J-47, J-73, J-79, CJ805 and CJ805 aft-fan engines, which involved flying in F-86, XF4D, F-104, F11F-1F, RB-66, F4H, and T-38 aircraft. He worked towards his master&#x27;s degree one night a week, starting in 1960, eventually obtaining a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from UCLA in 1962, and continued flying with the Naval Reserve. He was eventually promoted to commander.

==NASA==

In 1962, See applied to become a NASA astronaut. After undergoing preliminary evaluations, medical tests, and interviews during the selection process, See was selected to be in NASA&#x27;s second group of astronauts, known as The New Nine. He was 35 at the time of his selection; the oldest in the group. On his selection, he said &quot;Overwhelmed isn&#x27;t the right word. I was amazed and certainly pleased. It&#x27;s a very great honor.&quot; At the time of his selection, See had logged more than 3,900 hours of flying time, including more than 3,300 in jet aircraft. He drove from Edwards with fellow civilian pilot Neil Armstrong to start his new career in Houston, Texas, where the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was under construction.

Every astronaut was assigned a core competency, a special area in which they had to develop expertise, by the NASA Astronaut Office. The knowledge they gathered could then be shared with the others, and the astronaut-expert was expected to provide astronaut input to the spacecraft designers and engineers. See&#x27;s special area of expertise was the spacecraft electrical and sequential systems, and the coordination of mission planning. See was tasked with determining if the crewed lunar landing should occur in direct sunlight or using light reflected from the Earth. To help make the decision, he flew helicopters and airplanes wearing special welding goggles to simulate different lighting conditions. See also landed helicopters with Jim Lovell on lava flows that simulated the terrain on the Moon.

See was announced as the backup pilot for Gemini 5 on February 8, 1965, with Armstrong serving as the backup command pilot. They were the first civilians selected for a spaceflight. Gemini 5 was launched on August 21, 1965. Early in the flight, a problem was discovered with the fuel cells, and the flight controllers considered ending the mission early. See, who had worked with General Electric in developing the fuel cells, was confident that they could find a solution. Flight Director Chris Kraft gave them 24 hours to fix the problem. After working through the night, they diagnosed the problem and developed procedures that allowed the astronauts to fix the fuel cells, which allowed the mission to continue.

See was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) at MSC in Houston during the Gemini 7/Gemini 6A rendezvous mission in December 1965. Under the crew rotation system devised by chief astronaut Deke Slayton, as the backup for Gemini 5, Armstrong and See were in line for prime crew of Gemini 8. From the spring to the fall of 1965, Armstrong and See trained for the Gemini 5 mission. They spent a significant amount of time training in the spacecraft simulators. They flew back and forth to Kennedy Space Center, from which their spacecraft would be launched; to North Carolina to develop experiments to be conducted during the flight; and to McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, where the Gemini spacecraft was made.

Contrary to Slayton&#x27;s typical crew rotation, David Scott took See&#x27;s place as the pilot of Gemini 8. According to his autobiography, Slayton did not assign See to Gemini 8 because he considered him as too out-of-shape to perform an extravehicular activity. &quot;Life&quot; photographer Ralph Morse asked Armstrong why See was no longer assigned with him on the Gemini 8 mission, and Armstrong replied, &quot;Elliot&#x27;s too good a pilot not to have a command of his own.&quot; In October 1965 See was promoted to command pilot (first seat) of Gemini 9, with Charles Bassett as his pilot. The Gemini 9 mission was similar to the previous mission. An extravehicular activity (EVA) that used the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) was scheduled, and they would rendezvous with an Agena target vehicle. Bassett was scheduled for the EVA and See would stay in the capsule.

==Death==
On February 28, 1966, See and Charles Bassett were flying with their backup crew, Gene Cernan and Thomas Stafford, from Ellington Air Force Base to Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri, for two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training. The prime crew flew in one jet and the backup crew in another. See was the pilot of their T-38 trainer jet, with Bassett in the rear seat.

The weather at Lambert Field that Monday morning was poor and required an instrument approach. Both jets overshot the initial landing attempt; See continued with a visual circling approach and Stafford elected to follow the standard procedure for a missed approach. On his second attempt, See undershot the runway, hit the afterburners and turned to the right.

The jet crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, where the Gemini spacecraft was built. See was found in a parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the accident, within of their spacecraft. See and Bassett were buried near each other in Arlington National Cemetery; their graves are about from Theodore Freeman, another astronaut who had died in a T-38 crash sixteen months earlier.

After a reporter had disclosed to Freeman&#x27;s wife that he had died, NASA enacted new policies to avoid a similar embarrassing situation in the future. In compliance with these policies, astronaut John Young asked Marilyn Lovell and Jane Conrad to go to Marilyn See&#x27;s house and ensure that she did not find out about her husband&#x27;s death from a non-NASA source. They rushed over and made excuses for their early surprise visit. After Young arrived to break the news, the three hugged her for comfort. Marilyn Lovell then went to the school to pick up Marilyn See&#x27;s children, to make sure they did not find out from the press.

A NASA investigative panel later concluded that pilot error, caused by bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low on his second approach, probably due to poor visibility. At the time, See was known as one of the better pilots in the astronaut corps. Slayton later expressed doubts about See&#x27;s flying abilities, claiming that he flew too slowly: &quot;[He] wasn&#x27;t aggressive enough ... he flew too slow—a fatal problem in a plane like the T-38, which will stall easily if you get below .&quot;

Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were promoted to the backup crew as a result of the accident. Stafford and Cernan, the original backup crew, were launched three months later on June 3, 1966, as Gemini 9A. The shuffling of the Gemini crews caused by the deaths of See and Bassett affected crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Project Apollo missions. In particular, Aldrin flew as the pilot of Gemini 12, and later Apollo 11.

On Friday, March 4, 1966, both men were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. During funeral services in Texas two days before, Aldrin, Bill Anders, and Walter Cunningham flew the missing man formation in See&#x27;s honor, while Lovell, Jim McDivitt, and civilian pilot Jere Cobb did the same to honor Bassett.

==Legacy==

See was survived by his wife Marilyn and three children. After his death she continued to live in Houston, where she worked as a court reporter. See&#x27;s name is inscribed on the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; plaque placed on the Moon by Apollo 15 in 1971. He is also listed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, dedicated in 1991. He was honored by Highland Park High School in 2010 as one of the recipients of its Distinguished Alumni Award. A conference room in Wiley Hall at the USMMA is also dedicated to his memory.

See was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

==In media==
See was played by Steve Zahn in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, and by Patrick Fugit in the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;.

<text>Test Pilot is a 1938 American drama film directed by Victor Fleming, starring Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy, and featuring Lionel Barrymore. The Oscar-nominated film tells the story of a daredevil test pilot (Gable), his wife (Loy), and his best friend (Tracy).

&quot;Test Pilot&quot; was written by Howard Hawks, Vincent Lawrence, John Lee Mahin, Frank Wead, and Waldemar Young. The screenplay was largely based on an original story by former naval aviator Wead.
==Plot==

Reckless test pilot Jim Lane is forced to land on a Kansas farm in his aircraft, the &quot;Drake Bullet&quot;, where he meets Ann &quot;Thursday&quot; Barton. They spend the day together and fall in love. Once Jim&#x27;s best friend and mechanic, Gunner Morris, arrives, Jim ignores Ann. To spur him, she gets engaged to her sweetheart. Jim leaves in the morning, but soon comes back for her. They quickly get married.

Jim loses his job at Drake when he clashes with the owner. He gets a job with another outfit, flying a very experimental aircraft. Ann soon finds out how dangerous her husband&#x27;s occupation is, but she promises Gunner that she will stick to her man. Jim wins the race, but Benson, the man Drake sends in Jim&#x27;s place, dies, leaving a wife and three children behind.

Jim tries to reform his ways and begins by taking a job testing aircraft, even conducting dangerous flights as he wants to give Ann a real home. Gunner remains true to his friend.

One day, Gunner accompanies Jim on a test flight of a new bomber (a Y1B-17, a pre-production Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress prototype). Upon reaching , the bomber goes into a spin and sandbags (substituting for the weight of bombs) break loose, pinning Gunner. Unwilling to bail out without his buddy, Jim manages to crash land, and pulls a badly injured Gunner out of the wreckage right before it burst into flames, but it is too late for Gunner. When Jim realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up and joins the United States Army Air Corps.

==Cast==

* Clark Gable as Jim Lane
* Myrna Loy as Ann Barton
* Spencer Tracy as Gunner Morris
* Lionel Barrymore as Drake

==Production==


&quot;Test Pilot&quot; brought together three of the most bankable Hollywood stars of the period, but while Loy and Gable became friends, an uneasy relationship existed between Tracy and Gable. At the climax of a lengthy take where he was cradling his comrade&#x27;s head in his arms, Gable was reported to have said, &quot;Die, goddamn it, Spence! I wish to Christ you would!&quot; and dropped Tracy&#x27;s head with a thud.
Principal photography took place from December 1, 1937, to February 18, 1938, at MGM studios and on location at Van Nuys, California, Lindbergh Field (San Diego), March Field, California, and at the Cleveland National Air Races, with retakes on March 30 to early April 1938. &quot;Test Pilot&quot; utilized authentic United States Army Air Corps airfield settings and was able to obtain rights to film using Boeing&#x27;s new Y1B-17, which was destined to become the progenitor of the wartime B-17 bomber series. The Drake Bullet was actually the SEV-S2 NR70Y, a modified civilian racer version of the U.S. Army Air Corps P-35. The other test aircraft that is flown to its top diving speed is a Northrop A-17 attack bomber. Renowned movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz served as the second unit director in charge of the flying sequences. Although uncredited, real-life test pilot Sammy Wroath did the flying sequences.

==Reception==
Proving to be an &quot;audience-pleaser&quot; and becoming one of MGM&#x27;s top money-makers in 1938, &quot;Test Pilot&quot; also found favor with critics. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a bang-up aviation drama ... It is a generous show by any reckoning, long in its running time, star-studded and spectacular, and Victor Fleming, its director, has paced it wisely.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; raved, &quot;Spectacular romance thriller ... It can&#x27;t miss.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Excellent entertainment ... Other air pictures have been made; but for sheer thrills, this one leads them all because of the realistic way it has been done.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that while aviation films with fine flying scenes had already been done, those in this picture were &quot;superior to the average&quot;.

Today, it is considered a significant aviation film by historians due to the use of contemporary aircraft. Even at the time of its release, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the &quot;story bespeaks authority in detail, obviously explained by the fact that Capt. Frank Wead, who authored the original, has had (a) practical aviation background.&quot;
Both Loy and Tracy (despite his obvious scene-stealing battles with Gable) later claimed &quot;Test Pilot&quot; was their favorite film.

===Box office===
According to MGM records, &quot;Test Pilot&quot; earned $2,431,000 in the U.S. and $1,472,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $967,000.

==Academy Award nominations==
&quot;Test Pilot&quot; was nominated for Best Picture at the 11th Academy Awards, while Wead was nominated for Best Story, and Tom Held for Best Film Editing.

<text>Dark Victory is a 1939 American melodrama film directed by Edmund Goulding, starring Bette Davis, and featuring George Brent, Humphrey Bogart, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Ronald Reagan, Henry Travers, and Cora Witherspoon. The screenplay by Casey Robinson was based on the 1934 play of the same title by George Brewer and Bertram Bloch, starring Tallulah Bankhead.
==Plot==
Judith &quot;Judy&quot; Traherne is a young, carefree, hedonistic Long Island socialite and heiress with a passion for horses, fast cars, and too much smoking and drinking. She initially ignores severe headaches and brief episodes of dizziness and double vision, but when she uncharacteristically takes a spill while riding and then tumbles down a flight of stairs, her secretary and best friend Ann King insists she see the family doctor, who refers her to a specialist.

Dr. Frederick Steele is closing his New York City office in preparation for a move to Brattleboro, Vermont, where he plans to devote his time to brain cell research and scientific study on their growth. He reluctantly agrees to see Judy, who acts coldly and is openly antagonistic towards him. She shows signs of short-term memory loss but dismisses her symptoms. Steele convinces her the ailments she is experiencing are severe and potentially life-threatening and puts his career plans on hold to tend to her.

When diagnostic tests confirm his suspicions, Judy agrees to surgery to remove a malignant glioma brain tumor. Steele discovers the tumor cannot be removed entirely and realizes she has less than a year to live. The end will be painless but swift; shortly after experiencing total blindness, Judy will die.

To allow her a few more months of happiness, Steele opts to lie to Judy and Ann and assures them the surgery was a success. As he is a poor liar, Ann is suspicious and confronts Steele, who admits the truth. Steele tells Ann &quot;she must never know&quot; she will die soon. She agrees to remain silent and continue the lie.
Judy and Steele become involved romantically and eventually engaged. While helping his assistant pack the office before their departure for Vermont, Judy discovers her case history file containing letters from several doctors, all of them confirming Steele&#x27;s prognosis. Assuming Steele was marrying her out of pity, Judy breaks off the engagement and reverts to her former lifestyle. One day, her stable master Michael O&#x27;Leary, who for years has loved her from afar, confronts her about her unruly behavior, and she confesses she is dying. Their conversation convinces her she should spend her final months happy, dignified, and with the man she loves. She apologizes to Steele, and they marry and move to Vermont.

Three months later, Ann comes to visit. Judy and she are in the garden planting bulbs when Judy comments on how odd it is she still feels the sun&#x27;s heat under the rapidly darkening skies. They both immediately realize she is losing her vision and approaching the end. Judy makes Ann stay mum, as Steele leaves that day to present his most recent medical findings—which hold out the long-term prospect of a cure for her type of cancer—in New York. Judy makes an excuse to remain home, helps him pack, and sends him off, telling him, &quot;What we have now can&#x27;t be destroyed. That&#x27;s our victory, our victory over the dark. It&#x27;s a victory because we&#x27;re not afraid.&quot;

Then, after bidding Ann, her housekeeper Martha (who has silently deduced the situation), and her dogs farewell, she goes to her bedroom. Martha follows Judy and, upon entering the room, pauses as she sees Judy kneeling briefly, apparently praying. Judy then lies down on the bed; Martha drapes a blanket over her, withdrawing quietly when Judy asks to be left alone.

==Cast==
Cast notes:
* &quot;Dark Victory&quot; was Irish-born actress Geraldine Fitzgerald&#x27;s first American film, after having appeared in films made in England, and on the Broadway stage.
* This was the eighth, of eleven, on-screen teaming of Bette Davis and George Brent.

==Production==
Tallulah Bankhead originated the role of Judith Traherne in the Broadway production, which ran for 51 performances at the Plymouth Theatre, before being cut short when Bankhead fell ill with a bacterial infection. Davis openly admitted in later years that she had emulated Bankhead in the role. In 1935, David O. Selznick wanted to cast Greta Garbo and Fredric March in the leads, but Garbo chose to play the lead in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; instead. In 1936, he offered the role to Merle Oberon, but contractual problems with Samuel Goldwyn prevented her from doing the film. When Bette Davis discovered the play in 1938, she shopped it to every producer on the Warners lot, and Hal Wallis bought the rights from Selznick for her, for $50,000, when director Edmound Goulding and producer David Lewis showed interest in the project.

Davis had recently ended affairs with William Wyler and Howard Hughes and her husband Ham Nelson had filed for divorce, and after the first few days of filming she begged to be released from her contract, claiming she was too sick to continue. Producer Hal Wallis responded, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the rushes – stay sick!&quot; She found comfort with Brent, who had just divorced Constance Worth, and the two embarked on an affair that continued throughout filming and for a year – and three films – after. Goulding shot the film in sequence, and the arc of Judith&#x27;s relationship with Dr. Steele mirrored Davis&#x27; relationship with Brent. Davis was later to say that she wanted to marry Brent, but thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work out. Still, &quot;Of the men I didn&#x27;t marry, the dearest was George Brent.&quot;

The tune &quot;Oh! Give Me Time for Tenderness&quot;, sung by Judith, was written by Edmund Goulding and Elsie Janis. The voice of Vera Van was dubbed for Davis.

Another scene for the film&#x27;s ending was shot, but ultimately was deemed anticlimactic: after Judith&#x27;s death, her horse was seen winning a race, and her stablehand Michael (Bogart) was shown crying. The scene met with negative response with sneak preview audiences and was cut.

The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall.

==Reception==

Frank S. Nugent, in his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, observed: &quot;A completely cynical appraisal would dismiss it all as emotional flim-flam, a heartless play upon tender hearts by a playwright and company well versed in the dramatic uses of going blind and improvising on &quot;Camille&quot;. But it is impossible to be that cynical about it. The mood is too poignant, the performances too honest, the craftsmanship too expert. Miss Davis, naturally, has dominated—and quite properly—her film, but Miss Fitzgerald has added a sentient and touching portrayal of the friend, and George Brent, as the surgeon, is—dare we say?—surprisingly self-contained and mature. This once we must run the risk of being called a softy: we won&#x27;t dismiss &quot;Dark Victory&quot; with a self-defensive sneer.&quot;

An article in Neurology says the film marked &quot;the beginnings of the depiction of neurologic disease in cinema. Bette Davis&#x27; cinematic portrayal of a young woman dying from a brain tumor is close to the reality of denial, bargaining, a hope for a cure, and final acceptance.&quot; Although the film &quot;shows an implausible clinical course (an abrupt peaceful ending)...the cinematic portrayal of the vicissitudes of living with a brain tumor is often close to reality.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;intense drama&quot; and &quot;a nicely produced offering [with] Bette Davis in a powerful and impressive role.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; critic Tom Milne writes: &quot;[Davis] and [director Edmund] Goulding almost transform the soap into style; a Rolls-Royce of the weepie world.&quot;

On Turner Classic Movies, Margarita Landazuri said: &quot;&quot;Dark Victory&quot; was a three-hanky hit. Filmgoers and critics alike knew their emotions were being manipulated, but so expertly and touchingly that they couldn&#x27;t help but cheer.&quot;

The film is mentioned in the play &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, by Clairee in Act Two, Scene 1. It is also mentioned in the 2015 movie &quot;The Frontier&quot; by the Luanne character as a missed opportunity in her career.

&quot;Dark Victory&quot; currently holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on twenty-three reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Bette Davis does it her way with a tour de force performance in &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, a moving melodrama that snatches triumph from the jaws of mortality.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Bette Davis was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress but lost to Vivien Leigh, star of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Max Steiner, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for both this and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, lost to Herbert Stothart for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The film itself lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; named &quot;Dark Victory&quot; as one of the &quot;10 Best Films of 1939&quot;, as did &quot;Film Daily&quot;, and the &quot;National Board of Review&quot; picked both Bette Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald for Best Acting that year.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #32
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #72

==Adaptations and remakes==
===Radio===
On January 8, 1940, Davis and Spencer Tracy appeared in a 60-minute adaptation of the film on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. Barbara Stanwyck and Melvyn Douglas had previously performed an adaptation, one based on the original Broadway play, on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on April 4, 1938. On March 6, 1952, CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Sound Stage&quot; aired a condensed 30-minute version starring Stanwyck and David Brian.

===Film===

In 1963, the film was remade as &quot;Stolen Hours&quot; with Susan Hayward and Michael Craig, directed by Daniel Petrie. The action took place in then-contemporary England.

===Television===

It was remade in 1953, under its original title, as a TV adaptation for the &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot;, starring Sylvia Sidney, Christopher Plummer, and Ian Keith. In 1976, the story was produced under its original title as an NBC television movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery as television producer Katherine Merrill under the care of Dr. Michael Grant, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins; this version was directed by Robert Butler.

==Music==
Max Steiner&#x27;s original score to &quot;Dark Victory&quot; was released in 2006 by Screen Archives Entertainment and Chelsea Rialto Studios. The album contains the majority of the score as heard in the film in chronological order. It was produced using digital copies of the composer&#x27;s personal reference acetate discs stored at Brigham Young University which were digitally restored by Ray Faiola. This rare limited edition includes a lavishly illustrated 32-page color booklet featuring extensive liner notes by film and music historians Rudy Behlmer, Ray Faiola and James V. D&#x27;Arc (curator of the BYU Film Music Archives) detailing the film&#x27;s production and scoring.

<doc id="62112" wikidata="Q340952" url="?curid=62112" title="Figure-eight loop">
<text>Figure-eight loop (also figure-eight on a bight, figure-eight follow-through, figure-eight retrace, Flemish loop, or Flemish eight) is a type of knot created by a loop on the bight. It is used in climbing and caving.

The double figure eight is used to put a loop in the end of a rope, or around an object. It is relatively easy to tie and is secure, but can become difficult to untie after heavy loading, and can jam badly in any rope type.

==Tying methods==
===On a bight===

A figure-eight loop is created by doubling the rope into a bight, then tying the standard figure-eight knot.

In climbing, this knot is used to save time when repeatedly attaching the rope to climbing harnesses, using locking carabiners, such as when a group of people are climbing on the same top-rope.

=== Follow-through===

Alternatively, to tie the knot directly around an object, the follow-through method must be used. 
* Tie a regular figure eight knot with a significant amount of extra tail.
* Loop the tail around the object.
* Thread the tail back through the figure eight to create a normal looking figure eight on a bight.

==== Climbing ====
This is the standard method for attaching a rope to a climbing harness.

Often an additional strangle knot (which is half of a double fisherman&#x27;s knot) &quot;backup knot&quot; is tied in the tail of the figure 8. This is not required for the knot&#x27;s integrity during climbing, but could prevent ring-loading failure if belaying from the rope loop (instead of a dedicated belay loop). It also ensures that adequate tail length has been included, and gets excess tail out of the way. If the finish knot is not included, the tail should be 4 to 8 inches long. The tail can also be tucked back into the knot, called a &quot;Yosemite finish&quot; or &quot;Yosemite tuck&quot;. This holds the bottom loop open, making the knot easier to untie after falling, but also making it weaker in a ring-loading configuration.

The diameter of the loop should be kept small to avoid being caught on protrusions while falling, or clipped into accidentally while lead climbing. A well-dressed knot has a symmetrical appearance, with the strands parallel through each curve.

<doc id="62113" wikidata="Q3268056" url="?curid=62113" title="Goodbye, Mr. Chips">
<text>Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a novella about the life of a school teacher, Mr. Chipping, written by English writer James Hilton and first published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in October 1934. It has been adapted into two feature films and two television presentations.

== History ==

The story was originally issued in 1933, as a supplement to the &quot;British Weekly&quot;, an evangelical newspaper. It came to prominence when it was reprinted as the lead piece of the April 1934 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The success of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; publication prompted a book deal between the author and the US publisher Little, Brown and Company, who published the story in book form for the first time in June 1934. Published during the Great Depression, Little, Brown cautiously released a small first print run. Public demand for more was immediate and Little, Brown went into an almost immediate reprinting the same month. Public demand remained strong, and Little, Brown continued to reprint the book in cautious lots for many months, with at least two reprintings per month.

The first British edition went to press in October 1934. The publishers were Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who had observed the success of the book in the United States, and they released a much larger first print run. It sold 15,000 copies on the day of publication, and they quickly found themselves going into reprints as the reading public&#x27;s demand for the book proved insatiable. With the huge success of this book, James Hilton became a best-selling author. In 1938, he published a sequel, &quot;To You, Mr Chips&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

The novella tells the story of a beloved school teacher, Mr Chipping, and his long tenure at Brookfield School, a fictional minor British boys&#x27; public boarding school located in the fictional village of Brookfield in the Fenlands. Mr Chips, as the boys call him, is conventional in his beliefs and exercises firm discipline in the classroom. His views broaden, and his pedagogical manner loosens after he marries Katherine, a young woman whom he meets on holiday in the Lake District. Katherine charms the Brookfield teachers and headmaster and quickly wins the favour of Brookfield&#x27;s pupils. Their marriage is brief. She dies in childbirth and he never remarries or has another romantic interest.

One of the themes of the book is that Chipping so outlasts all of his peers that his brief marriage fades into myth and few people know him as anything other than a confirmed and lonely bachelor. Despite Chipping&#x27;s mediocre credentials and his view that classic Greek and Latin (his academic subjects) are dead languages, he is an effective teacher who becomes highly regarded by pupils and the school&#x27;s governors—he has become a well-worn institution. In his later years, he develops an arch sense of humour that pleases everyone. However, he also becomes somewhat of an anachronism, with an antiquated pronunciation, and is pitied for his isolation. On his deathbed, he talks of the fulfillment he felt as a teacher of boys.

== Inspiration ==

The setting for &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; is probably based on The Leys School, Cambridge, where James Hilton was a pupil (1915–18). Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Mr. Chips, came from many sources, including his father, who was the headmaster of Chapel End School. Mr. Chips is also likely to have been based on W. H. Balgarnie, a master at The Leys (1900–30), who was in charge of the &quot;Leys Fortnightly&quot; (in which Hilton&#x27;s first short stories and essays were published.) Over the years, old boys wrote to Geoffery Houghton, a master at The Leys and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chipping and Balgarnie, who eventually died at Porthmadog at the age of 82. Balgarnie had been linked with the school for 51 years and spent his last years in modest lodgings nearby. Like Mr. Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.

Hilton wrote upon Balgarnie&#x27;s death that &quot;Balgarnie was, I suppose, the chief model for my story. When I read so many other stories about public school life, I am struck by the fact that I suffered no such purgatory as their authors apparently did, and much of this miracle was due to Balgarnie.&quot; The mutton chop side whiskers of one of the masters at The Leys earned him the nickname &quot;Chops&quot;, a likely inspiration for Mr Chips&#x27; name.

In Hilton’s final novel, &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; (1953), protagonist Charles Anderson bears clear biographical similarities to Hilton himself. Early in the novel, Anderson briefly reminisces about attending Brookfield and knowing &quot;Chips&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Radio ===

A 50-minute adaptation by James Hilton and Barbara Burnham was broadcast on the BBC National Programme at 20:00 on 23 July 1936, with Richard Goolden in the title part and a cast that included Norman Shelley, Ronald Simpson, Lewis Shaw and Hermione Hannen. There was a repeat broadcast the following evening.

A radio adaptation by the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; starring Laurence Olivier and Edna Best and presented by Cecil B. DeMille was first broadcast on 20 November 1939. 

A radio adaptation by &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; starring Ronald Colman was broadcast on 16 September 1948. Jean Holloway wrote the adaptation, Dee Engelbach was the producer and director, and James Hilton was the host. A second version, told from the point of view of Mrs. Chips as portrayed by Deborah Kerr, was broadcast on 1 February 1951. Whitfield Connor was Mr. Chips, Leonard St. Clair wrote the adaptation, Bill Gay was the producer and director, and James Hilton was again the host. 

A radio adaptation by the &quot;NBC University Theatre&quot; was broadcast on 10 July 1949, starring Herbert Marshall and Alma Lawton. Agnes Eckhardt wrote the adaptation, and Andrew C. Love was the director.

=== Theatre ===

Barbara Burnham adapted the book for a stage production in three acts, which was first performed at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 23 September 1938, with Leslie Banks as Mr. Chips and Constance Cummings as his wife Katherine. It ran for over 100 performances until 14 January 1939.

A stage musical based on the original novel, but using most of the Leslie Bricusse vocal score of the 1969 film, was mounted at the Chichester Festival and opened on 11 August 1982. The book was by Roland Starke and the production was directed by Patrick Garland and Christopher Selbie. Among the Chichester Festival cast were John Mills as Mr. Chips, Colette Gleeson as Kathie, Nigel Stock as Max, Michael Sadler, Paul Hardwick, Simon Butteriss and Robert Meadmore in supporting roles, and 20 local school boys, including Kevin Farrar who was selected by Bricusse to sing the final verse of the iconic &quot;School Song&quot;. The original cast album was recorded on the That&#x27;s Entertainment Records label TER 1025 at Abbey Roads Studios in London on 17/18 August 1982. JAY-jay Records also have a release of it.

=== Film ===

==== 1939 film ====

This version stars Robert Donat, Greer Garson, Terry Kilburn, John Mills, and Paul Henreid. Donat won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lead role, beating Clark Gable, James Stewart, Laurence Olivier, and Mickey Rooney. While some of the incidents depicted in the various screen adaptations do not appear in the book, this film is generally faithful to the original story. The exteriors of the buildings of the fictional Brookfield School were filmed at Repton School, an independent school (at the time of filming, for boys only), located in the village of Repton, in Derbyshire, in the Midlands area of England, whilst the interiors, school courtyards and annexes, including the supposedly exterior shots of the Austrian Tyrol Mountains, were filmed at Denham Film Studios, near the village of Denham in Buckinghamshire. Around 200 boys from Repton School stayed on during the school holidays so that they could appear in the film.

==== 1969 film ====

In 1969 a musical film version appeared, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark, with songs by Leslie Bricusse and an underscore by John Williams. In this version the character of Katherine is greatly expanded, and the time setting of the story is moved forward several decades, with Chips&#x27; career beginning in the early 20th century and his later career covering World War II, rather than World War I. O&#x27;Toole and Clark&#x27;s performances were widely praised. At the 42nd Academy Awards, O&#x27;Toole was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.

=== Television ===

==== 1984 serial ====

In 1984 it was adapted as a television serial by the BBC. It starred Roy Marsden and Jill Meager and ran for six half-hour episodes. Many scenes were filmed at Repton School, Derbyshire, in an effort to remain faithful to the original film.

==== 2002 serial ====

A television film adaptation was produced by STV Studios (then known as &quot;SMG TV Productions&quot;) in 2002. It aired on the ITV Network in Britain and on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; in the United States. It starred Martin Clunes and Victoria Hamilton with Henry Cavill, William Moseley, Oliver Rokison and Harry Lloyd.

=== Parodies ===

&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was parodied in the British sketch comedy programmes &quot;Hale and Pace&quot; (as &quot;Piss Off, Mr. Chips&quot;) and &quot;Big Train&quot;.

Vince Gilligan created the television show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; with the premise that the show&#x27;s protagonist Walter White would turn &quot;From Mr. Chips to &quot;Scarface&quot;&quot; through the series&#x27; course.

In the Marx Brothers film &quot;At the Circus&quot;, as Groucho Marx is about to walk out of a scene, he shakes hands with a nearby caged monkey and says, &quot;Goodbye, Mister Chimps.&quot;

In 2009, the short-running ABC sitcom &quot;Better Off Ted&quot; titles its 6th episode &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; wherein the computer system misidentifies then completely deletes the account of Ted Crisp, the main character.

<doc id="62114" wikidata="Q7750" url="?curid=62114" title="Louis XVIII">
<text>Louis XVIII (Louis Stanislas Xavier; 17 November 1755 – 16 September 1824), known as the Desired (), was King of France from 1814 to 1824, except for a brief interruption during the Hundred Days in 1815. Before his reign, he spent 23 years in exile from France beginning in 1791, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire.

Until his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI, the last king of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence claimed the throne as Louis XVIII.

Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, Great Britain, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition first defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored the Napoleonic Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne.

Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. His Bourbon Restoration government was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the absolutist &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; in France before the Revolution. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII&#x27;s royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France&#x27;s new constitution. His return in 1815 led to a second wave of White Terror headed by the Ultra-royalist faction. The following year, Louis dissolved the unpopular parliament (the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot;), giving rise to the liberal Doctrinaires. His reign was further marked by the formation of the Quintuple Alliance and a military intervention in Spain. Louis had no children, and upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last king or emperor of France to die a reigning monarch: his successor, Charles X ( 1824–1830) abdicated; and both Louis Philippe I ( 1830–1848) and Napoleon III ( 1852–1870) were deposed.

==Youth==
Louis Stanislas Xavier, styled Count of Provence from birth, was born on 17 November 1755 in the Palace of Versailles, a younger son of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France, and his wife Maria Josepha of Saxony. He was the grandson of the reigning King Louis XV. As a son of the Dauphin, he was a &quot;Fils de France&quot;. He was christened Louis Stanislas Xavier six months after his birth, in accordance with Bourbon family tradition, being nameless before his baptism. By this act, he also became a Knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit.
The name of &quot;Louis&quot; was bestowed because it was typical of a prince of France; Stanislas was chosen to honour his great-grandfather King Stanislaus I of Poland who was still alive at the time; and Xavier was chosen for Saint Francis Xavier, whom his mother&#x27;s family held as one of their patron saints.
At the time of his birth, Louis Stanislas was fourth in line to the throne of France, behind his father and his two elder brothers: Louis Joseph Xavier, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry. The former died in 1761, leaving Louis Auguste as heir to their father until the Dauphin&#x27;s own premature death in 1765. The two deaths elevated Louis Stanislas to second in the line of succession, while his brother Louis Auguste acquired the title of Dauphin.

Louis Stanislas found comfort in his governess, Madame de Marsan, Governess of the Children of France, as he was her favourite among his siblings. Louis Stanislas was taken away from his governess when he turned seven, the age at which the education of boys of royal blood and of the nobility was turned over to men. , a friend of his father, was named as his governor.

Louis Stanislas was an intelligent boy, excelling in the classics. His education was of the same quality and consistency as that of his older brother, Louis Auguste, despite the fact that Louis Auguste was heir and Louis Stanislas was not. Louis Stanislas&#x27;s education was quite religious in nature; several of his teachers were priests, such as Jean-Gilles du Coëtlosquet, Bishop of Limoges; the Abbé Jean-Antoine Nollet; and the Jesuit Guillaume-François Berthier. La Vauguyon drilled into young Louis Stanislas and his brothers the way he thought princes should &quot;know how to withdraw themselves, to like to work,&quot; and &quot;to know how to reason correctly&quot;.

In April 1771, when he was 15, Louis Stanislas&#x27;s education was formally concluded, and his own independent household was established, which astounded contemporaries with its extravagance: in 1773, the number of his servants reached 390 In the same month his household was founded, Louis was granted several titles by his grandfather, Louis XV: Duke of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Perche, and Count of Senoches. During this period of his life he was often known by the title Count of Provence.

On 17 December 1773, he was inaugurated as a Grand Master of the Order of St. Lazarus.

==Marriage==
On 16 April 1771, Louis Stanislas was married by proxy to Princess Maria Giuseppina of Savoy. The in-person ceremony was conducted on 14 May at the Palace of Versailles. Marie Joséphine (as she was known in France) was a daughter of Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy (later King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia), and his wife Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain.

A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and ignorant of the customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas&#x27; alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At the time of his marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.

Despite the fact that Louis Stanislas was not infatuated with his wife, he boasted that the two enjoyed vigorous conjugal relations – but such declarations were held in low esteem by courtiers at Versailles. He also proclaimed his wife to be pregnant merely to spite Louis Auguste and his wife Marie Antoinette, who had not yet consummated their marriage. The Dauphin and Louis Stanislas did not enjoy a harmonious relationship and often quarrelled, as did their wives. Louis Stanislas did impregnate his wife in 1774, having conquered his aversion. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. A second pregnancy in 1781 also miscarried, and the marriage remained childless.

==At his brother&#x27;s court==

On 27 April 1774, Louis XV fell ill after contracting smallpox and died a few days later on 10 May, aged 64. Louis Stanislas&#x27; elder brother, the Dauphin Louis Auguste, succeeded their grandfather as King Louis XVI. As eldest brother of the King, Louis Stanislas received the title Monsieur. Louis Stanislas longed for political influence. He attempted to gain admittance to the King&#x27;s council in 1774, but failed. Louis Stanislas was left in a political limbo that he called &quot;a gap of 12 years in my political life&quot;. Louis XVI granted Louis Stanislas revenues from the Duchy of Alençon in December 1774. The duchy was given to enhance Louis Stanislas&#x27;s prestige. However, the appanage generated only 300,000 livres a year, an amount much lower than it had been at its peak in the fourteenth century.

Louis Stanislas travelled about France more than other members of the Royal Family, who rarely left the Île-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while they were taking the waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.

On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s private physician, confirmed her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. That the baby was a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette gave birth to the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the Queen&#x27;s brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.

In 1780, Anne Nompar de Caumont, Countess of Balbi, entered the service of Marie Joséphine. Louis Stanislas soon fell in love with his wife&#x27;s new lady-in-waiting and installed her as his mistress, which resulted in the couple&#x27;s already limited affection for each other cooling entirely. Louis Stanislas commissioned a pavilion for his mistress on a parcel of land at Versailles which became known as the &quot;Parc Balbi&quot;.

Louis Stanislas lived a quiet and sedentary lifestyle at this point, not having a great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi&#x27;s pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10 million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.

An Assembly of Notables (the members consisted of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 to ratify the financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, his long-awaiting opportunity to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies which would have a say in local taxation. Calonne&#x27;s proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne&#x27;s ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne&#x27;s reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.

Brienne&#x27;s reforms were then submitted to the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris in the hopes that they would be approved. (A &quot;parlement&quot; was responsible for ratifying the King&#x27;s edicts; each province had its own &quot;parlement&quot;, but the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris was the most significant of all.) The &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris refused to accept Brienne&#x27;s proposals and declared that any new taxation would have to be approved by an Estates-General (the nominal parliament of France). Louis XVI and Brienne took a hostile stance against this rejection, and Louis XVI had to implement a &quot;bed of justice&quot; (&quot;Lit de justice&quot;), which automatically registered an edict in the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris, to ratify the desired reforms. On 8 May, two of the leading members of the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris were arrested. There was rioting in Brittany, Provence, Burgundy and Béarn in reaction to their arrest. This unrest was engineered by local magistrates and nobles, who enticed the people to revolt against the &quot;Lit de Justice&quot;, which was quite unfavourable to the nobles and magistrates. The clergy also joined the provincial cause, and condemned Brienne&#x27;s tax reforms. Brienne conceded defeat in July and agreed to a convocation of the Estates-General to meet in 1789. He resigned from his post in August and was replaced by the Swiss magnate Jacques Necker.

In November 1788, a second Assembly of Notables was convened by Jacques Necker, to consider the makeup of the next Estates-General. The &quot;Parlement of Paris&quot; recommended that the Estates should be the same as they were at the last assembly, in 1614 (this would mean that the clergy and nobility would have more representation than the Third Estate). The notables rejected the &quot;dual representation&quot; proposal. Louis Stanislas was the only notable to vote to increase the size of the Third Estate. Necker disregarded the notables&#x27; judgment, and convinced Louis XVI to grant the extra representation. The king duly obliged on 27 December.

===Outbreak of the French Revolution===
The Estates-General were convened in May 1789 to ratify financial reforms. The Count of Provence favoured a stalwart position against the Third Estate and its demands for tax reform. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly, an Assembly not of the Estates, but of the people.

The Count of Provence urged the King to act strongly against the declaration, while the King&#x27;s popular minister Jacques Necker aimed at reaching a compromise with the new assembly. Louis XVI was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a National Constituent Assembly that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, Louis XVI dismissed Necker, which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the &quot;Régiment Royal–Allemand Cavalerie&quot; &quot;(Royal German Cavalry Regiment)&quot; of Charles-Eugène de Lorraine, Prince de Lambesc, against a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, sparked the Storming of the Bastille two days later.

On 16 July, the King&#x27;s brother, Charles, Comte d&#x27;Artois, left France with his wife and children, along with many other courtiers. Artois and his family took up residence in Turin, the capital city of his father-in-law&#x27;s (Carlo Emanuele IV) Kingdom of Sardinia, with the family of Louis Joseph, &quot;Prince de Condé&quot;.

The Count of Provence decided to remain at Versailles. When the Royal Family plotted to abscond from Versailles to Metz, Provence advised the King not to leave, a suggestion he accepted.

The Royal Family was forced to leave the palace at Versailles on the day after the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles, 5 October 1789. They were taken to Paris. There, the Count of Provence and his wife lodged in the Luxembourg Palace, while the rest of the Royal Family stayed in the Tuileries Palace. In March 1791, the National Assembly created a law outlining the regency of Louis Charles in case his father died while he was still too young to reign. This law awarded the regency to Louis Charles&#x27; nearest male relative in France (at that time the Count of Provence), and after him, the Duke of Orleans, thus bypassing the Count of Artois. If Orleans were unavailable, the regency would be submitted to election.

The Count of Provence and his wife fled to the Austrian Netherlands in conjunction with the royal family&#x27;s failed Flight to Varennes in June 1791.

==Exile==

===Early years===
When the Count of Provence arrived in the Low Countries, he proclaimed himself regent of France. He exploited a document that he and Louis XVI had written before the latter&#x27;s failed escape to Varennes-en-Argonne. The document gave him the regency in the event of his brother&#x27;s death or inability to perform his role as king. He would join the other princes-in-exile at Coblenz soon after his escape. It was there that he, the Count of Artois, and the Condé princes proclaimed that their objective was to invade France. Louis XVI was greatly annoyed by his brothers&#x27; behaviour. Provence sent emissaries to various European courts asking for financial aid, soldiers, and munition. Artois secured a castle for the court in exile in the Electorate of Trier (or &quot;Treves&quot;), where their maternal uncle, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, was the Archbishop-Elector. The activities of the &quot;émigrés&quot; bore fruit when the rulers of Prussia and the Holy Roman Empire gathered at Dresden. They released the Declaration of Pillnitz in August 1791, which urged Europe to intervene in France if Louis XVI or his family were threatened. Provence&#x27;s endorsement of the declaration was not well received in France, either by the ordinary citizens or by Louis XVI himself.

In January 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared that all of the were traitors to France. Their property and titles were confiscated. The monarchy of France was abolished by the National Convention on 21 September 1792.

Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. This left his young son, Louis Charles, as the titular King. The princes-in-exile proclaimed Louis Charles &quot;King Louis XVII&quot;. The Count of Provence now unilaterally declared himself regent for his nephew, who was too young to be head of the House of Bourbon.

Louis XVII, still a minor, died in prison in June 1795. His only surviving sibling was his sister Marie-Thérèse, who was not considered a candidate for the throne because of France&#x27;s traditional adherence to Salic law. Thus on 16 June, the princes-in-exile declared the Count of Provence &quot;King Louis XVIII&quot;. The new king accepted their declaration soon after and busied himself drafting a manifesto in response to Louis XVII&#x27;s death. The manifesto, known as the &quot;Declaration of Verona&quot;, was Louis XVIII&#x27;s attempt to introduce the French people to his politics. The Declaration of Verona beckoned France back into the arms of the monarchy, &quot;which for fourteen centuries was the glory of France&quot;.

Louis XVIII negotiated the release of Marie-Thérèse from her Paris prison in 1795. He desperately wanted her to marry her first cousin, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, the son of the Count of Artois. Louis XVIII deceived his niece by telling her that her parents&#x27; last wishes were for her to marry Louis-Antoine, and she duly agreed to Louis XVIII&#x27;s wishes.

Louis XVIII was forced to abandon Verona when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Republic of Venice in 1796.

===1796–1807===
Louis XVIII had been vying for the custody of his niece Marie-Thérèse since her release from the Temple Tower in December 1795. He succeeded when Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to relinquish his custody of her in 1796. She had been staying in Vienna with her Habsburg relatives since January 1796. Louis XVIII moved to Blankenburg in the Duchy of Brunswick after his departure from Verona. He lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment over a shop. Louis XVIII was forced to leave Blankenburg when King Frederick William II of Prussia died. In light of this, Marie-Thérèse decided to wait a while longer before reuniting with her uncle.

In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis the use of Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). The Tsar also guaranteed Louis&#x27; safety and bestowed on him a generous pension, though later discontinued payment. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled . Moreover, being surrounded at Jelgava with many old courtiers, he attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles, re-establishing various of the former court ceremonies, including the and (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).

On 9 June 1799, Marie-Thérèse married her cousin Louis-Antoine at the Jelgava Palace. Desperate to display to the world a united family, Louis XVIII ordered his wife Queen Marie Joséphine, who at the time was living apart from her husband in Schleswig-Holstein, to attend the wedding. Furthermore, she was to come without her long-time friend (and rumoured lover) Marguerite de Gourbillon. The Queen refused to leave her friend behind, creating an unpleasant situation that rivalled the wedding in notoriety. Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis-Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Thérèse. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.

In 1800, Louis XVIII attempted to strike up a correspondence with Napoleon Bonaparte (by then First Consul of France), urging him to restore the Bourbons to their throne, but the future emperor was impervious to this idea and continued to consolidate his own position as ruler of France.

Louis XVIII encouraged his niece to write her memoirs, as he wished them to be used as Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI&#x27;s final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Thérèse even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.

Marie-Thérèse persuaded Queen Louise of Prussia to give her family refuge on Prussian territory. Though Louise consented, the Bourbons were forced to assume pseudonyms. With Louis XVIII using the title , named after his estate in Languedoc and at times spelt as Comte de Lille. After an arduous journey from Jelgava, he and his family took up residence in the years 1801–1804 at the Łazienki Palace in Warsaw, which after the partitions of Poland became part of the province of South Prussia. According to Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary living there at the time, the Prussian local authorities, wishing to honour the arrivals, had music played, but trying to give this a national and patriotic character, unwittingly chose La Marseillaise, the hymn of the French Republic with unflattering allusions to both Louis XVI and Louis XVIII. They later apologised for their mistake.

It was very soon after their arrival that Louis and Marie-Thérèse learned of the death of Tsar Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul&#x27;s successor, Alexander I, would repudiate his father&#x27;s banishment of the Bourbons, which he later did. Louis then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis-Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but the King did not do so at that time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and he sent some money to Louis, whose court-in-exile was not only being spied on by Napoleonic agents but was also being forced to make significant economies, financed as it was mainly from interest owed by the Emperor Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France.

In 1803, Napoleon tried to force Louis XVIII to renounce his right to the throne of France, but Louis refused. In May the following year, 1804, Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French. In July, Louis XVIII and his nephew departed for Sweden for a Bourbon family conference, where Louis XVIII, the Count of Artois, and the Duke of Angoulême issued a statement condemning Napoleon&#x27;s move. When the King of Prussia decreed that Louis XVIII would have to leave Prussian territory, and hence Warsaw, Tsar Alexander I invited Louis XVIII to resume residence in Jelgava, which he did. However, having to live under less generous conditions than those enjoyed under Paul I, Louis XVIII decided to embark for England as soon as possible.

As time went on, Louis XVIII realised that France would never accept an attempt to return to the . Accordingly, in 1805 he reformulated his public policies with a view to reclaiming his throne, issuing a declaration that was far more liberal than his earlier pronouncements. This repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain the Napoleonic administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of Antoine de Bésiade, Count of Avaray, Louis&#x27;s closest advisor in exile.

Louis XVIII was forced once again to leave Jelgava when Tsar Alexander informed him that his safety could not be guaranteed in continental Europe. In July 1807, Louis boarded a Swedish frigate bound for Stockholm, bringing with him only the Duke of Angoulême. This stay in Sweden was short-lived since in November 1807 he disembarked at Great Yarmouth, on the Eastern coast of England. He then took up residence in Gosfield Hall in Essex, leased to him by the Marquess of Buckingham.

===England, 1807–1814===

In 1808, Louis brought his wife and queen, Marie Joséphine, to join him in England. His stay at Gosfield Hall did not last long; he soon moved to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where over one hundred courtiers were housed. The King paid £500 in rent each year to the owner of the estate, Sir George Lee. The Prince of Wales (the future George IV) was very charitable to the exiled Bourbons. As Prince Regent, he granted them permanent right of asylum and extremely generous allowances.

The Count of Artois did not join the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to continue his frivolous life in London. Louis&#x27;s friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis had a particularly severe attack of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, and he had to take to a wheelchair.

In 1812, Napoleon I embarked on an invasion of Russia, initiating a war which would prove to be the turning point in his fortunes. The expedition failed miserably, and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.

In 1813, Louis XVIII issued another declaration from Hartwell. The Declaration of Hartwell was even more liberal than his Declaration of 1805, asserting that those who had served Napoleon or the Republic would not suffer repercussions for their acts, and that the original owners of the (lands confiscated from the nobility and clergy during the Revolution) would be compensated for their losses.

Allied troops entered Paris on 31 March 1814. Louis, unable to walk, had sent the Count of Artois to France in January 1814 and issued letters patent appointing Artois Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom in the event of his being restored as king. On 11 April, five days after the French Senate had invited Louis to resume the throne of France, Napoleon I abdicated.

==Bourbon Restoration==

===First Restoration (1814–1815)===
The Count of Artois ruled as Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom until his brother&#x27;s arrival in Paris on 3 May. Upon his return, the King displayed himself to his subjects by staging a procession through the city. He took up residence in the Tuileries Palace the same day. His niece, the Duchess of Angoulême, fainted at the sight of the Tuileries, where she had been imprisoned during the time of the French Revolution.

Napoleon&#x27;s senate called Louis XVIII to the throne on the condition that he would accept a constitution that entailed recognition of the Republic and the Empire, a bicameral parliament elected every year, and the tri-colour flag of the aforementioned regimes. Louis XVIII opposed the senate&#x27;s constitution and stated that he was &quot;disbanding the current senate in all the crimes of Bonaparte, and appealing to the French people&quot;. The senatorial constitution was burned in a theatre in royalist Bordeaux, and the Municipal Council of Lyon voted for a speech that defamed the senate.

The Great Powers occupying Paris demanded that Louis XVIII implement a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature composed of a lower house styled the Chamber of Deputies and an upper house, styled the Chamber of Peers. The press would enjoy a degree of freedom, and there would be a provision that the former owners of the &quot;Biens nationaux&quot;, confiscated during the Revolution, would be compensated. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The King would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.

Louis XVIII signed the Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which extended east of the Rhine. She had to pay no war indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew immediately from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon&#x27;s return to France in 1815).

It did not take Louis XVIII long to go back on one of his many promises. He and his Comptroller-General of Finance Baron Louis were determined not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75 million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditure on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget – in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.
Louis XVIII admitted the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoulême and of Berry to the Royal Council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large interest in the goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon&#x27;s demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia&#x27;s intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, to which he was attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parma branch of the Bourbons, and not to the former Empress Marie-Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested at the Allies&#x27; inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.

On behalf of the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it was learned that Murat corresponded with Napoleon, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty. In fact, Murat never did actually write to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, had taken care to have such a correspondence forged, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25 million francs.

Louis XVIII succeeded in getting the Neapolitan Bourbons restored immediately. Parma, however, was bestowed upon Empress Marie-Louise for life, and the Parma Bourbons were given the Duchy of Lucca until the death of Marie-Louise.

===Hundred Days===

On 26 February 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped his island prison of Elba and embarked for France. He arrived with about 1,000 troops near Cannes on 1 March. Louis XVIII was not particularly worried by Bonaparte&#x27;s excursion, as such small numbers of troops could be easily overcome. There was, however, a major underlying problem for the Bourbons: Louis XVIII had failed to purge the military of its Bonapartist troops. This led to mass desertions from the Bourbon armies to Bonaparte&#x27;s. Furthermore, Louis XVIII could not join the campaign against Napoleon in Southern France, because he was having another case of gout. Minister of War Marshal Soult dispatched Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans (later King Louis Philippe I), the Count of Artois, and Marshal MacDonald to apprehend Napoleon.

Louis XVIII&#x27;s underestimation of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, the army stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital with a small escort at midnight, first travelling to Lille, and then crossing the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, halting in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Tsar Alexander I, debated whether in the case of a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orleans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.

However, Napoleon did not rule France again for very long, suffering a decisive defeat at the hands of the armies of the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Blücher at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. The Allies came to the consensus that Louis XVIII should be restored to the throne of France.

===Second Restoration (from 1815)===
Louis returned to France promptly after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat to ensure his second restoration &quot;in the baggage train of the enemy&quot;, i.e. with Wellington&#x27;s troops. The Duke of Wellington used King Louis&#x27; person to open up the route to Paris, as some fortresses refused to surrender to the Allies, but agreed to do so for their king. King Louis arrived at Cambrai on 26 June, where he released stating that those who served the Emperor in the Hundred Days would not be persecuted, except for the &quot;instigators&quot;. It was also acknowledged that Louis&#x27;s government might have made mistakes during the First Restoration. King Louis was worried that the counter-revolutionary element sought revenge. He promised to grant a constitution that would guarantee the public debt, freedom of the press and of religion, and equality before the law. It would guarantee the full property rights of those who had purchased national lands during the revolution. He kept his promises.

On 29 June, a deputation of five from among the members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers approached Wellington about putting a foreign prince on the throne of France. Wellington rejected their pleas outright, declaring that &quot;[Louis is] the best way to preserve the integrity of France&quot; and ordered the delegation to espouse King Louis&#x27; cause. The King entered Paris on 8 July to a boisterous reception: the Tuileries Palace gardens were thronged with bystanders, and, according to the Duke of Wellington, the acclamation of the crowds there were so loud during that evening that he could not converse with the King.

Although the Ultra faction of returning exiles wanted revenge and were eager to punish the usurpers and restore the old regime, the new king rejected that advice. He instead called for continuity and reconciliation, and a search for peace and prosperity. The exiles were not given back their lands and property, although they eventually received repayment in the form of bonds. The Catholic Church was favoured. The electorate was limited to the richest men in France, most of whom had supported Napoleon. In foreign policy he removed Talleyrand, and continued most of Napoleon&#x27;s policies in peaceful fashion. He kept to the policy of minimizing Austria&#x27;s role but reversed Napoleon&#x27;s friendly overtures to Spain and the Ottomans.

The King&#x27;s role in politics was voluntarily diminished; he assigned most of his duties to his council. During the summer of 1815, he and his ministry embarked on a series of reforms. The Royal Council, an informal group of ministers that advised Louis, was dissolved and replaced by a tighter knit privy council, the &quot;Ministère du Roi&quot;. Artois, Berry and Angoulême were purged from the new &quot;ministère&quot;, and Talleyrand was appointed as the first &quot;Président du Conseil&quot;, i.e. Prime Minister of France. On 14 July, the ministry dissolved the units of the army deemed &quot;rebellious&quot;. Hereditary peerage was re-established by the ministry at Louis&#x27; behest.

In August, elections for the Chamber of Deputies returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry hoped for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in what King Louis called the &quot;Chambre introuvable.&quot; The Duchess of Angoulême and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was acceptable to Louis&#x27; family and to the reactionary Chamber of Deputies. Louis dissolved the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot; on 5 September 1816, after a rise in anti-monarchical sentiments.

Anti-Napoleonic sentiment was high in Southern France, and this was prominently displayed in the White Terror, which saw the purge of all important Napoleonic officials from government, along with the execution or assassination of others. Popular vengeance led to barbarous acts against some of these officials. Guillaume Marie Anne Brune (a Napoleonic marshal) was savagely assassinated, and his remains thrown into the Rhône River. Louis publicly deplored such illegal acts, but vehemently supported the prosecution of those marshals of the army who had helped Napoleon in the Hundred Days. Louis&#x27;s government executed Napoleon&#x27;s Marshal Ney in December 1815 for treason. The King&#x27;s confidants Charles François, Marquis de Bonnay, and the Duke de La Chatre advised him to inflict firm punishments on the &quot;traitors&quot;.

The King was reluctant to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the &quot;traitors&quot; in January 1816, but such trials as had already begun took their course. That same declaration also banned any member of the House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France. It is estimated that between 50,000 – 80,000 officials were purged from the government during what was known as the Second White Terror.

In November 1815, Louis&#x27;s government had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France&#x27;s borders were now less extensive, being drawn back to their 1790 extent. France had to pay for an army to occupy her, for at least five years, at a cost of 150 million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700 million francs to the Allies.

In 1818, the Chambers passed a military law that increased the size of the army by over 100,000. In October of the same year, Louis&#x27;s foreign minister, the Duke of Richelieu, succeeded in convincing the Allied Powers to withdraw their armies early in exchange for a sum of over 200 million francs.

Louis chose many centrist cabinets, as he wanted to appease the populace, much to the dismay of his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist government for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.

King Louis disliked the &quot;premier prince du sang&quot;, Louis-Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, and took every opportunity to snub him, denying him the title of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, partly out of resentment for the Duke&#x27;s father&#x27;s role in voting for Louis XVI&#x27;s execution. Louis XVIII&#x27;s nephew, the Duke of Berry, was assassinated at the Paris Opera on 14 February 1820. The royal family was grief-stricken and Louis broke an ancient tradition by attending his nephew&#x27;s funeral, whereas previous kings of France could not have any association with death. The death of the Duke of Berry meant that the House of Orleans was more likely to succeed to the throne.

Berry was the only member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed &quot;Dieudonné&quot; (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon succession was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of Angoulême to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the &quot;law of the two votes&quot;, Louis began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of &quot;tabatière&quot; (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, in a campaign headed by the Duke of Angoulême.

===Death===
Louis XVIII&#x27;s health began to fail in the spring of 1824. He was experiencing obesity, gout and gangrene, both dry and wet, in his legs and spine. Louis died on 16 September 1824 surrounded by the extended royal family and some government officials. He was succeeded by his youngest brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X. As a historical footnote, the young science of disinfection had advanced in the early 1820s to the point where it was recognized that chlorides of lime could be used to both eliminate smells and slow decomposition. The body of Louis XVIII was washed with chlorides by a French scientist, Antoine Germain Labarraque, permitting his corpse to be &quot;presented to the public &quot;without any odour&quot;&quot; (emphasis in the original) in 1824.

==Film and television==

Louis XVIII is portrayed by Orson Welles in the 1970 film Waterloo.

<doc id="62115" wikidata="Q1620069" url="?curid=62115" title="Love Affair (1939 film)">
<text>Love Affair is a 1939 American romance film, co-starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, and featuring Maria Ouspenskaya. It was directed by Leo McCarey and written by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart, based on a story by McCarey and Mildred Cram. Controversial on concept, the official screenplay was re-tooled and rewritten to appease Hollywood censorship and relied on actor input and improvisation, causing long delays and budget extensions.

The movie became a surprise hit of 1939, showing McCarey&#x27;s versatility after a long career of comedic films, and launching the surprising team-up of Dunne and Boyer. Academy Award nominations include Best Actress for Dunne, Best Supporting Actress for Ouspenskaya, Best Original Song, Best Writing (Original), and Best Picture. Its popularity was later dwarfed by McCarey&#x27;s 1957 remake &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;, which spawned its own remakes with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Love Affair&quot; and a few Indian adaptations.

==Plot==
One December, French painter (and famed womanizer) Michel Marnet meets American singer Terry McKay aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke, she to Kenneth Bradley. They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his worldwide reputation makes them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel&#x27;s grandmother Janou, who bonds with Terry and admits wanting Michel to settle down.
As the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet in the new year, six months later on top of the Empire State Building, giving Michel enough time to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry. His paintings fail to sell, so he finds work designing advertising billboards around the city, while Terry breaks off her engagement to Kenneth and successfully negotiates a contract with a Philadelphia nightclub to perform through to June.

When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building. However, Terry is struck by a car on a nearby street and is told by doctors she may be paralyzed for the rest of her life, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Michel, who waits until closing time, travels to Madeira to discover his grandmother has recently died, and continues working in New York City. Terry is overheard singing in the garden of her physiotherapy by the owner of a children&#x27;s orphanage, who hires her as a music teacher.

Six months pass by, and during Terry&#x27;s first outing since the accident, she and Michel meet by accident at a theater on Christmas Eve, though since she is already seated, Terry is able to conceal her disability. The next morning on Christmas Day, after the children visit Terry at her apartment, Michel makes a surprise visit and finally learns the truth. Terry, delighted Michel proved he had changed his ways, tells him it is her turn to prove she can change hers, but Michel assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis is.

== Development ==
Despite the popularity of his romantic and screwball comedies, Leo McCarey had become tired of directing them. His wife suggested they should go on a cruising vacation around Europe to combat his writer&#x27;s block, and when they returned to the United States, they watched the Statue of Liberty pass. McCarey immediately told her his idea about two passengers who fall in love on a cruise, but realize they are both &quot;obligated to somebody else.&quot; With the premise created, Mildred Cram
co-developed the rest of the story under the working title &quot;Memory of Love&quot;, then later &quot;Love Match&quot;, as Delmer Daves created the screenplay and Donald Ogden Stewart helped McCarey with the comedy. James Anderson stood as assistant director, Edward Dmytryk and George Hively were the movie&#x27;s editors, and Roy Webb composed the film score. Filming took place in the fall of 1938. The rough cut was screened in January 1939.

Actresses such as Helen Hayes and Greta Garbo developed interest in starring, but the McCarey couple preferred Irene Dunne, who had previously appeared in McCarey&#x27;s &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; and was a close family friend; Terry&#x27;s occupation as nightclub singer intended to display Dunne&#x27;s singing talents. Charles Boyer&#x27;s reputation as a romantic actor (from starring in &quot;History is Made at Night&quot; and &quot;Algiers&quot;) made him McCarey&#x27;s first choice. Concurrently, Boyer rejected Harry Cohn&#x27;s offer of the leading role in &quot;Good Girls Go to Paris&quot; to do &quot;Love Affair&quot;, instead. He and McCarey were acquaintances and Boyer believed McCarey was an underestimated director, so he canceled many acting plans for the rest of 1938 to work with McCarey and Dunne. &quot;Any picture that Leo McCarey directs is its own guarantee[;] he can&#x27;t make a bad picture,&quot; he later explained.

Irene Dunne later noted that the dialog changed frequently, and the cast received pieces of paper between filming; McCarey&#x27;s common directing tactic of improvisation also continued throughout. Both he and Boyer were unimpressed with the final draft, despite Boyer being used to memorizing his dialog very quickly. News columnists visiting the set observed the actors waiting around for their dialog as scenes would be rewritten moments before shooting: &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ve been here doing nothing since 8 o&#x27;clock this morning,&#x27; [Boyer tells] me (it is now 4 in the afternoon),&quot; reported Sheilah Graham. Delays and rewrites caused the film to go over its budget of $800,000 by about $600,000.

McCarey reused and retooled the line &quot;According to you, everything I like to do is either illegal, immoral or fattening,&quot; from his 1934 movie &quot;Six of a Kind&quot;, and gave it to Terry; W. C. Fields (who ad-libbed the retort in the original film) approved but critics hated the reference, McCarey later revealed. Boyer was allowed input in Michel&#x27;s characterization; he suggested that Michel visiting his grandmother should have a prominent appearance so Terry&#x27;s accident would not create a tonal shift. The champagne industry used the film to promote pink champagne to the audience, which caused a sales boost.

McCarey gave Dunne the opportunity to choose the signature song for the movie: she decided upon &quot;Wishing&quot;, which became one of the most popular songs of 1939; the orphans were dubbed by Robert Mitchell&#x27;s Boys Choir. Other songs performed are &quot;Sing My Heart&quot; and &quot;Plaisir d&#x27;Amour&quot;, performed by Terry in a Philadelphian night-club and at Michel&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s home, respectively.

Maria Ouspenskaya described working on the film as &quot;an atmosphere of work that is inspirational. [...] Actor, electricians, and cameramen loved their work and did not want to break away from that atmosphere.&quot; Boyer would later praise McCarey&#x27;s filmmaking for the movie&#x27;s success; he was described in an interview years later as &quot;still speak[ing] of Mr. McCarey with sincere awe.&quot;

== Controversy ==
The initial screenplay was rejected by the Production Code Administration, accusing the story of endorsing adultery. Another related argument believed Terry had not been punished for her kept behavior, while Michel had been given redemption, so this led to Terry&#x27;s paralysis. &quot;You dissolved to her in a hospital with her realizing that God hadn&#x27;t wanted her to meet [Michel] until she was sorry for what she had done before,&quot; explained Donald Ogden Stewart.

Initially a period piece set in the 1850s about the tragic romance of a French ambassador, the final draft of the script was complete and filming was announced to begin September 15, but it was later pushed back a month. Due to concerns of a potential war in Europe, the French embassy wanted stronger allyship with the United States and had concerns about a movie about a French diplomat and an American woman having an affair. McCarey and Daves reworked the story as a modern tale, with Terry&#x27;s characterization now based on a woman Daves met on a cruise who was rumored to be returning to the United States after hiding in Europe for being caught as the mistress of a small-town government official.

== Release ==
&quot;Film Daily&quot; reported that &quot;Love Affair&quot;″s release had the potential to be premiered in late January or early February 1939 at Radio City Music Hall; later issues would give the initial release date as February 17 and March 10. The film premiered March 16 at the Music Hall with a pink champagne-themed cocktail party for Dunne, emceed by W. G. Van Schmus; McCarey was on vacation in Santa Monica and could not attend.

== Reception ==

The praise for &quot;Love Affair&quot; among film critics was reflected in Clark Wales&#x27; quip: &quot;Recommending a Leo McCarey production is something like recommending a million dollars or beauty or a long and happy life. Any of these is a very fine thing to have and the only trouble is that there are not enough of them.&quot; &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine wrote &quot;a pleasant little ,&quot; &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; called the film &quot;the most absorbing and delightful entertainment of its kind [in] a long time&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called the film &quot;tender, poignant [and] sentimental without being gooey&quot;. &quot;Put this one down among the contenders of the Academy Awards of 1939,&quot; declared &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;and [one] of the most satisfactory movie endings.&quot;

&quot;The screenplay is an exceptionally intelligent effort,&quot; wrote the &quot;Box Office Digest&quot;, &quot;[and] McCarey&#x27;s skill in handling individual scenes with the old [Hal] Roach technique carries through this tough spot and on to a grand climax,&quot; but the review added: &quot;It must be unfortunately recorded that there is a let down in interest for a half reel when [Michel and Terry] are separated.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; found the movie refreshing, describing it as &quot;outdoing&quot; other romances that are &quot;slap-happy wherein boy spanks girl or shoves her into the fish pond by way of displaying his affections.&quot; Pare Lorentz described the film as &quot;a mood, rather than a story&quot; as McCarey effortlessly balanced the conflicting tones of comedy and melodrama, &quot;[keeping] it alive by expert interpolations.&quot; &quot;Stage&quot; also praised the direction: &quot;McCarey is the man responsible for shifting, with no detectable trickery, from the brittle comedy of the early sequences to the genuine emotionalism of the later. It is superior entertainment all the way through.&quot;

On characterization, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked on &quot;the facility with which [Boyer and Dunne] have matched the changes of their script—playing it lightly now, soberly next, but always credibly, always in character, always with a superb utilization of the material at hand.&quot; Leo Mishkin added: &quot;Certainly, this Terry McKay of Miss Dunne&#x27;s is one of the greatest things she has ever done on the screen[.]&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described Boyer&#x27;s performance of Michel as &quot;a particularly effective presentation of the modern Casanova;&quot; &quot;Under no circumstances miss it,&quot; said Jesse Zunser, &quot;Mr. Boyer proves beyond the shadow of a cinematic doubt that there are few better players on the American dream[.]&quot; &quot;Box Office Digest&quot; wrote, &quot;[Boyer and Dunne have] never done more delightful work, and to say that they step along in stride — step for step, is a tribute to either one in red hot competition.&quot; &quot;The Film Daily&quot; described the performances as &quot;gorgeously acted&quot; and &quot;stand[s] out as the best of many months&quot;, and &quot;Photoplay&quot; remarked that Maria Ouspenskaya&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary&quot; performance &quot;stole&quot; the scenes in Madeira. The only notable criticism of characters came from Dunne herself, who told &quot;Silver Screen&quot; years later: &quot;If I had been in that girl&#x27;s place, far from hiding, I would&#x27;ve trundled my wheelchair up and down the sidewalks of New York looking for [Michel].&quot;

&quot;Love Affair&quot; was RKO Pictures&#x27; second-most popular film, after &quot;Gunga Din&quot;. It was colloquially classified as &quot;Mature.&quot;

==Legacy==
Years after its release, &quot;Love Affair&quot; would continue to receive high praise. Tom Flannery&#x27;s filmography book &quot;1939: The Year in Movies&quot; wrote that Dunne and Boyer &quot;generated [the most] chemistry, charisma [and] sensuality&quot; in Hollywood, despite 1939 producing the best couples in &quot;Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh [in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;], Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon [in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;], Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman [in &quot;Intermezzo&quot;].&quot; William K. Everson joined the critics of the past that praised McCarey balancing the comedy and drama perfectly, and noted Terry saying goodbye to Grandma Janou was realistically &quot;tender and poignant[;] such moments all too rarely are in film.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes gave it a critics&#x27; score of 86% based on 7 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a critics&#x27; score of 91 on 8 reviews.

However, the release of its remake, &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;, spawned comparisons. &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; became better-known in popular culture, later placed at number 5 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Passions list, and was frequently parodied, referenced, and alluded to in other media, causing &quot;Love Affair&quot; to become lost in time. Screenwriter Nora Ephron, first introduced to the movie when she was a child, referenced it heavily in &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, allegedly causing rentals of the film to increase. Irene Dunne and Deborah Kerr&#x27;s Terry performances did not receive as much comparison as Charles Boyer&#x27;s Michel and Cary Grant&#x27;s Nicky, whose characters divided critics and analysts per review. Larry Swindell called Boyer&#x27;s portrayal/performance chaste which overshadows the dialog&#x27;s frequent references to Michel&#x27;s womanizing, whereas Megan McGurk argued Grant was too self-conscious and refused to make Nicky appropriately vulnerable, particularly in Nicky and Terry&#x27;s reunion.

=== Boyer and Dunne ===

The partnership of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne would be called the most romantic in Hollywood. With a positive reaction to the pairing, Hollywood developed them as the newest team-up, so the duo starred together twice more in &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; (1939) and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944). Critics judged the rest of the &quot;trilogy&quot; with the praised qualities of &quot;Love Affair&quot;, with &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; receiving the least positive reception.

The two actors remained family friends after performing together. To promote &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot;, they were asked by &quot;Photoplay&quot; to describe each other in the style of a parlor game where a player who briefly left the room guesses the secret noun other contestants chose by asking questions like &quot;If I were that person, what kind of car would I be?&quot; Their essays appeared in the October issue under the names &quot;Irene: As Seen by Charles Boyer&quot; and &quot;Charles: As Seen by Irene Dunne&quot; with the editor noting: &quot;Surely, working together as they do and have done, and being analytical, intelligent people, each would give a clear-limned portrait of the other; unbiased, colorful, exciting.&quot; Boyer described Dunne in prose, while Dunne described Boyer under topical subtitles, but Wes D. Gehring pointed out both essays&#x27; frequent references to fine art, as well as Dunne personifying Boyer through French impressionism.

Dunne called Boyer one of her favorite screen partners, along with Cary Grant, and referred to him as the &quot;perfect gentleman&quot; at the American Film Institute&#x27;s retrospective screening.

=== Film remakes and adaptations ===
&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; aired two versions of &quot;Love Affair&quot; radio adaptations on April 1, 1940 and July 6, 1942. Irene Dunne reprised her role in both, whereas Charles Boyer co-starred in the 1942 version; William Powell starred alongside Dunne in the 1940 version.

Plans for a &quot;Love Affair&quot; remake were first reported in 1952, which had Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl attached to the project. Eventually, McCarey remade it in 1957 as &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles, using a very similar screenplay. Despite agreeing to remake it in response to Hollywood&#x27;s current romantic offerings, McCarey would still prefer his original work. Glenn Gordon Caron also remade the film in 1994 as &quot;Love Affair&quot;, starring Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, and in her last feature film, Katharine Hepburn. Bollywood cinema made two versions: 1965&#x27;s &quot;Bheegi Raat&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Mann&quot;, which were both adaptations of &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;.

==Accolades==

===12th Academy Awards===
==Availability==
In 1967, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Because of this, the film is widely available on home video and online. The film can be downloaded legally for free on the Internet Archive.
However, since the only film prints available were in lower-resolution 16mm (along with poor quality web video) in 2020 the Museum of Modern Art and Lobster Films (Paris) worked on a new 4K version created from film elements that MoMA had in its archives.

The Criterion Collection released this newly restored version on Blu-ray and DVD in February 2022.

<doc id="62116" wikidata="Q7723" url="?curid=62116" title="Napoleon II">
<text>Napoleon II (Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte; 20 March 181122 July 1832) was the disputed Emperor of the French for a few weeks in 1815. He was the son of Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Marie Louise, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. 

Napoleon II had been Prince Imperial of France and King of Rome since birth. After the fall of his father, he lived the rest of his life in Vienna and was known in the Austrian court as Franz, Duke of Reichstadt for his adult life (from the German version of his second given name, along with a title his grandfather granted him in 1818). He was posthumously given the nickname L&#x27;Aiglon (&quot;the Eaglet&quot;).

When Napoleon I tried to abdicate on 4 April 1814, he said that his son would rule as emperor. However, the coalition victors refused to acknowledge his son as successor, and Napoleon I was forced to abdicate unconditionally some days later. Although Napoleon II never actually ruled France, he was briefly the titular Emperor of the French after the second fall of his father. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 21.

His cousin, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, founded the Second French Empire in 1852 and ruled as Emperor Napoleon III. He was also the maternal great-great-grandson of Empress Maria Theresa, Empress of Habsburg Dominions and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and great-grandson of Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily.

==Biography==
===Birth===
Napoleon ll was born on 20 March 1811, at the Tuileries Palace, the son of Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Marie Louise. On the same day he underwent &quot;ondoiement&quot; (a traditional French ceremony which is a simple baptism unaccompanied by the usual additional ceremonies) by Joseph Fesch with his full name of &quot;Napoleon François Charles Joseph&quot;.
The baptism, inspired by the baptismal ceremony of Louis, Grand Dauphin of France, was held on 9 June 1811 in Notre Dame de Paris. Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, Austrian ambassador to France, wrote of the baptism:

He was put in the care of Louise Charlotte Françoise de Montesquiou, a descendant of François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, who was named Governess of the Children of France. Affectionate and intelligent, the governess assembled a considerable collection of books intended to give the infant a strong grounding in religion, philosophy, and military matters.

===Succession rights===
As the only legitimate son of Napoleon I, he was already constitutionally the Prince Imperial and heir apparent, but the Emperor also gave his son the title of King of Rome. Three years later, the First French Empire collapsed. Napoleon I saw his second wife and their son for the last time on 24 January 1814. On 4 April 1814, he abdicated in favour of his three-year-old son after the Six Days&#x27; Campaign and the Battle of Paris. The child became Emperor of the French under the regnal name of Napoleon II. However, on 6 April 1814, Napoleon I fully abdicated and renounced not only his own rights to the French throne, but also those of his descendants. The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814 gave the child the right to use the title of Prince of Parma, of Piacenza, and of Guastalla, and his mother was styled the Duchess of Parma, of Piacenza, and of Guastalla.

===Reign===
On 29 March 1814, Marie Louise, accompanied by her entourage, left the Tuileries Palace with her son. Their first stop was the Château de Rambouillet; then, fearing the advancing enemy troops, they continued on to the Château de Blois. On 13 April, with her entourage much diminished, Marie Louise and her three-year-old son were back in Rambouillet, where they met her father, Emperor Francis I of Austria, and Emperor Alexander I of Russia. On 23 April, escorted by an Austrian regiment, mother and son left Rambouillet and France forever, for their exile in Austria.

In 1815, after his resurgence and his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon I abdicated for the second time in favour of his four-year-old son, whom he had not seen since his exile to Elba. The day after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, a Commission of Government of five members took the rule of France, awaiting the return of the Bourbon King Louis XVIII, who was in Le Cateau-Cambrésis. The Commission held power for two weeks, but never formally summoned Napoleon II as Emperor or appointed a regent. The entrance of the Allies into Paris on 7 July brought a rapid end to his supporters&#x27; wishes. Napoleon II was residing in Austria with his mother.

The next Bonaparte to ascend the throne of France, in 1852, would be Louis-Napoleon, the son of Napoleon&#x27;s brother Louis I, King of Holland. He took the regnal name of Napoleon III.

===Life in Austria===
From the spring of 1814 onwards, the young Napoleon lived in Austria and was known as &quot;Franz&quot;, a German language cognate of his second given name, François. In 1818, he was awarded the title of Duke of Reichstadt by his maternal grandfather, Emperor Francis. He was educated by a staff of military tutors and developed a passion for soldiering, dressing in a miniature uniform like his father&#x27;s and performing maneuvers in the palace. At the age of 8, it was apparent to his tutors that he had chosen his career.

By 1820, Napoleon had completed his elementary studies and begun his military training, learning German, Italian and mathematics as well as receiving advanced physical training. His official army career began at age 12, in 1823, when he was made a cadet in the Austrian Army. Accounts from his tutors describe Napoleon as intelligent, serious, and focused. Additionally, he was very tall, having grown to nearly 6 feet (1.8m) by the time he was 17.

In 1822 the Four Sergeants of La Rochelle were put to death for attempting to return Napoleon II to the throne, although it is unclear to what extent they were committed Bonapartists. There is no evidence that Napoleon II endorsed the insurrection.

His budding military career gave some concern and fascination to the monarchies of Europe and French leaders over his possible return to France. However, he was allowed to play no political role and instead was used by Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich in bargaining with France to gain advantage for Austria. Fearful of anyone in the Bonaparte family regaining political power, Metternich even rejected a request for Franz to move to a warmer climate in Italy. He received another rejection when his grandfather refused to allow him to join the army traveling to Italy to put down a rebellion.

Upon the death of his stepfather, Adam Albert von Neipperg, and the revelation that his mother had borne two illegitimate children to Neipperg prior to their marriage, Franz grew distant from his mother and felt that his Austrian family were holding him back to avoid political controversy. He said to his friend, Anton von Prokesch-Osten, &quot;If Joséphine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried at Saint Helena, and I should not be at Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved&quot;.

==Death==

In 1831, Franz was given command of an Austrian battalion, but he never got the chance to serve in any meaningful capacity. In 1832, he caught pneumonia and was bedridden for several months. His poor health eventually overtook him and on 22 July 1832 Franz died of tuberculosis at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. He had no children; thus the Napoleonic claim to the throne of France passed to his uncle Joseph Bonaparte and later to his cousin, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who later founded and reigned over the Second French Empire, styling himself Napoleon III. His last words were, &quot;My story is my birth and death. Between my cradle and my grave, there is a big zero&quot;.

===Disposition of his remains===

On 15 December 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the remains of Napoleon II to be transferred from Vienna to the dome of Les Invalides in Paris. The remains of Napoleon I had been returned to France in December 1840, at the time of the July Monarchy. In December 1969, the remains of Napoleon II were moved underground to the &quot;cella&quot; of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb.

While most of his remains were transferred to Paris in 1940, his heart and intestines remained in Vienna, which is traditional for members of the Habsburg family. His heart is in Urn 42 of the &quot;Herzgruft&quot; (&#x27;Heart Crypt&#x27;), and his viscera are in Urn 76 of the Ducal Crypt.

==Legacy==
* In 1900, Edmond Rostand wrote a play, &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, about his life. 
* Serbian composer Petar Stojanović composed the operetta &quot;Napoleon II: Herzog von Reichstadt&quot;, which premiered in Vienna in the 1920s. 
* Victor Tourjansky directed a French-language film titled &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; in 1931, and he also directed a separate German-language version.
* Arthur Honegger and Jacques Ibert collaborated on an opera, &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, which premiered in 1937. 
* The journalist Henri Rochefort joked that Napoleon II, having never really governed, was France&#x27;s best leader, since he brought no war, taxes or tyranny.
He was noted for his friendship with Sophie, a Bavarian princess of the House of Wittelsbach. Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband Franz Karl, the brother of Napoleon II&#x27;s mother, Empress Marie Louise. There were rumors of a love affair between Sophie and Napoleon II, as well as the possibility that Sophie&#x27;s second son, Maximilian I of Mexico, born in 1832, was the result issue of the affair.

==Honours==
* : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen, 1811
* First French Empire: Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour
* Kingdom of Italy: Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown, 1st Class
* : Knight Grand Cross of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George

<doc id="62117" wikidata="Q866120" url="?curid=62117" title="Mr. Smith Goes to Washington">
<text>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a 1939 American political comedy-drama film directed by Frank Capra, starring Jean Arthur and James Stewart, and featuring Claude Rains and Edward Arnold. The film is about a naive, newly appointed United States senator who fights against government corruption, and was written by Sidney Buchman, based on Lewis R. Foster&#x27;s unpublished story &quot;The Gentleman from Montana&quot;. It was loosely based on the life of Montana US Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who underwent a similar experience when he was investigating the Warren Harding administration.

The film was controversial in the US when it was first released, with attacks from many politicians claiming that it brought Washington into disrepute, but it was very successful at both the domestic and international box offices, and it made Stewart a major star.

&quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, winning Best Original Story. Considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, the film was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1989, for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert &quot;Happy&quot; Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governor&#x27;s children. Corrupt political boss Jim Taylor sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics was expected to make him easy to manipulate.

Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith&#x27;s late father&#x27;s friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator&#x27;s daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine&#x27;s home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith&#x27;s naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith&#x27;s reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin.

To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith&#x27;s predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys&#x27; camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine.

Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor&#x27;s influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state — through Paine — accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine&#x27;s betrayal to defend himself and runs away.

Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme&#x27;s true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced.

The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor&#x27;s machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith&#x27;s home state, on Taylor&#x27;s orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers&#x27; effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor&#x27;s gangsters.

Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith&#x27;s home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate. Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith&#x27;s innocence to Clarissa&#x27;s delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.

==Cast==

In addition, uncredited appearances include: Dick Jones as Dickie, the Senate Page Boy who helps Smith; CBS radio commentator H. V. Kaltenborn, shown broadcasting live from the press room of the Senate; Milton Kibbee, who has a bit as a reporter; Lafe McKee; and Matt McHugh of the McHugh acting family.

==Production==
Columbia Pictures originally purchased Lewis R. Foster&#x27;s unpublished story, variously called &quot;The Gentleman from Montana&quot; and &quot;The Gentleman from Wyoming&quot;, as a vehicle for Ralph Bellamy, but once Frank Capra came on board as director – after Rouben Mamoulian had expressed interest – the film was to be a sequel to his &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, called &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington&quot;, with Gary Cooper reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds. Because Cooper was unavailable, Capra then &quot;saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur&quot;, and Stewart was borrowed from MGM. Capra said of Stewart: &quot;I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith ... He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him.&quot;

Although a youth group is featured in the story, the Boy Scouts of America refused to allow their name to be used in the film and instead the fanciful &quot;Boy Rangers&quot; was used.

In January 1938, both Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures submitted Foster&#x27;s story to the censors at the Hays Office, likely indicating that both studios had an interest in the project before Columbia purchased it. Joseph Breen, the head of that office, warned the studios: &quot;[W]e would urge most earnestly that you take serious counsel before embarking on the production of any motion picture based on this story. It looks to us like one that might well be loaded with dynamite, both for the motion picture industry, and for the country at large.&quot; Breen specifically objected to &quot;the generally unflattering portrayal of our system of Government, which might well lead to such a picture being considered, both here, and more particularly abroad, as a covert attack on the Democratic form of government&quot;, and warned that the film should make clear that &quot;the Senate is made up of a group of fine, upstanding citizens, who labor long and tirelessly for the best interests of the nation.&quot;

Later, after the screenplay had been written and submitted, Breen reversed course, saying of the film, &quot;It is a grand yarn that will do a great deal of good for all those who see it and, in my judgment, it is particularly fortunate that this kind of story is to be made at this time. Out of all Senator Jeff&#x27;s difficulties there has been evolved the importance of a democracy and there is splendidly emphasized the rich and glorious heritage which is ours and which comes when you have a government &#x27;of the people, by the people, and for the people.

The film was in production from April 3, 1939, to July 7 of that year. Some location shooting took place in Washington, D.C., at Washington Union Station, the United States Capitol, and other locations for background use.

Following Capra&#x27;s usual habits, working with people he knew well, he brought together again three of the leading actors from his previous film production for Columbia Pictures, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; of 1938, with Arthur, Stewart, and Arnold in lead roles again.

In the studio, to ensure authenticity, an elaborate set was created, consisting of Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms, and hotel suites, as well as specific Washington, D.C., monuments, all based on a trip Capra and his crew made to the capital. Even the Press Club of Washington was reproduced in minute detail, but the major effort went into a faithful reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. James D. Preston, a former superintendent of the Senate gallery, acted as technical director for the Senate set, as well as advising on political protocol. The production also utilized the &quot;New York street set&quot; on the Warner Bros. lot, using 1,000 extras when that scene was shot.

The ending of the film was apparently changed at some point, as the original program describes Stewart and Arthur returning to Smith&#x27;s hometown, where they are met by a big parade, with the implication that they are married and starting a family. In addition, the Taylor political machine is shown being crushed; Smith, riding a motorcycle, visits Senator Paine and forgives him; and a visit to Smith&#x27;s mother is included. Some of this footage can be seen in the film&#x27;s trailer.

==Impact==
The film premiered in Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., on October 17, 1939, sponsored by the National Press Club, an event to which 4,000 guests were invited, including 45 senators. &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; was attacked by the Washington press, and politicians in the U.S. Congress, as anti-American and pro-Communist/Socialist for its portrayal of corruption in the American government. Frederic William Wile of &quot;The Washington Star&quot; wrote that the film showed &quot;the democratic system and our vaunted free press in exactly the colors Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin like to paint them.&quot; While Capra claims in his autobiography that some senators walked out of the premiere, contemporary press accounts are unclear about whether this occurred or not, or whether senators yelled back at the screen during the film.

However, it is known that Alben W. Barkley, a Democrat and the Senate Majority Leader, called the film &quot;silly and stupid&quot;, and said it &quot;makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks&quot;. He also remarked that the film was &quot;a grotesque distortion&quot; of the Senate, &quot;as grotesque as anything ever seen! Imagine the Vice President of the United States winking at a pretty girl in the gallery in order to encourage a filibuster!&quot; Barkley thought the film &quot;showed the Senate as the biggest aggregation of nincompoops on record!&quot;

Pete Harrison, a respected journalist and publisher of the motion picture trade journal &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, suggested that the Senate pass a bill allowing theater owners to refuse to show films that &quot;were not in the best interest of our country&quot;. That did not happen, but one of the ways that some senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the Neely Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which put forward the film&#x27;s patriotism and support of democracy and publicized the film&#x27;s many positive reviews.

Other objections were also voiced. Joseph P. Kennedy, the American Ambassador to Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head Harry Cohn to say that he feared the film would damage &quot;America&#x27;s prestige in Europe&quot;, and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release. Capra and Cohn responded, citing the film&#x27;s review, which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he never followed up, although he privately still had doubts about the film.

The film was banned in Hitler&#x27;s Germany, Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, and in Franco&#x27;s Spain. In the Soviet Union, the film was released to cinemas in December 1950 as &quot;The Senator&quot;. According to Capra, the film was also dubbed in certain European countries to alter the message of the film so it conformed with official ideology.

When a ban on American films was imposed in German occupied France in 1942, some theaters chose to show &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; as the last movie before the ban went into effect. One theater owner in Paris reportedly screened the film nonstop for 30 days after the ban was announced.

The critical response to the film was more measured than the reaction by politicians, domestic and foreign. When it premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, the critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for instance, Frank S. Nugent, wrote that &quot;[Capra] is operating, of course, under the protection of that unwritten clause in the Bill of Rights entitling every voting citizen to at least one free swing at the Senate. Mr. Capra&#x27;s swing is from the floor and in the best of humor; if it fails to rock the august body to its heels – from laughter as much as from injured dignity – it won&#x27;t be his fault but the Senate&#x27;s, and we should really begin to worry about the upper house.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; has been called one of the quintessential whistleblower films in American history. Dr. James Murtagh and Dr. Jeffrey Wigand cited this film as a seminal event in U.S. history at the first &quot;Whistleblower Week in Washington&quot; ( May 13–19, 2007). Others have highlighted the film&#x27;s vigorous support for free speech as a check of tyranny, and have pointed to the parallels between the strong-armed tactics of the Taylor Machine depicted in the film and those which had recently been deployed by Mayor Frank Hague against protestors in Jersey City, New Jersey.

&quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; has often been listed as among Capra&#x27;s best, but it has been noted that it &quot;marked a turning point in Capra&#x27;s vision of the world, from nervous optimism to a darker, more pessimistic tone. Beginning with &quot;American Madness&quot; (1932), such Capra films as &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933), &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936), and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; (1938) had trumpeted their belief in the decency of the common man. In &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, however, the decent common man is surrounded by a venal, petty and thuggish group of crooks. Everyone in the film – except for Jefferson Smith and his tiny cadre of believers – is either in the pay of the political machine run by Edward Arnold&#x27;s James Taylor or complicit in Taylor&#x27;s corruption through their silence, and they all sit by as innocent people, including children, are brutalized and intimidated, rights are violated, and the government is brought to a halt.&quot;
Nevertheless, Smith&#x27;s filibuster and the tacit encouragement of the Senate President are both emblematic of the director&#x27;s belief in the difference that one individual can make. This theme would be expanded further in Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and other films.

==Box office==
&quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; was a box office success upon its release, earning theatrical rentals of $3.5 million in the United States alone. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1939 and was also the third highest-grossing film of the 1930s, behind only &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937).

<doc id="62118" wikidata="Q589894" url="?curid=62118" title="Ninotchka">
<text>Ninotchka is a 1939 American romantic comedy film made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by producer and director Ernst Lubitsch and starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas. It was written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and Walter Reisch, based on a story by Melchior Lengyel. &quot;Ninotchka&quot; marked the first comedy role for Garbo, and her penultimate film; she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

In 1990, &quot;Ninotchka&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It has been listed as one of the greatest films of all time by &quot;Empire&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Time&quot; in 2011.

==Plot==
Iranoff (Sig Ruman), Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), and Kopalski (Alexander Granach), three agents from the Russian Board of Trade, arrive in Paris to sell jewelry confiscated from the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Count Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a White Russian nobleman reduced to employment as a waiter in the hotel where the trio are staying, overhears details of their mission and informs the former Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) that her court jewels are to be sold by the three men. Swana&#x27;s debonair paramour, Count Léon d&#x27;Algout (Melvyn Douglas) offers to help retrieve the jewelry before it is sold.

In their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski negotiate with Mercier (Edwin Maxwell) a prominent Parisian jeweler, when Léon interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels were seized illegally by the Soviet government and a petition has been filed preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewelry until the lawsuit is settled.

The amiable, charming and cunning Léon treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their friendship and confidence. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise.

Moscow, angered by the telegram, then sends Nina Ivanovna &quot;Ninotchka&quot; Yakushova (Greta Garbo), a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewelry sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission.

Ninotchka and Léon first meet on the street near the hotel, their identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, Léon follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Ninotchka tells him he might be an interesting subject of study and suggests they go to his apartment. Léon, fascinated by Ninotchka, continues to flirt and he soon falls in love with her. They kiss, but are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Both then realize they are each other&#x27;s adversaries over the jewelry and Ninotchka promptly leaves Léon&#x27;s apartment, despite his protestations.

The next day, Léon follows Ninotchka to a bistro where she again rebuffs him; but after valiant attempts at making her laugh, Léon finally breaks down her resistance and she falls in love with him. 
While attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the west. At a dinner date with Léon where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewelry and for Léon&#x27;s affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakened by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewelry during the night. Swana tells Ninotchka that she will return the jewels and drop the litigation if Ninotchka returns to Moscow immediately so that Swana can have Léon to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees to Swana&#x27;s proposal and after completing the sale of the jewelry to Mercier, she and Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski fly back to Moscow.
Later that evening, Léon visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs Léon that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility.

Sometime later in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to dinner at her communal apartment and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. After dinner, Ninotchka finally receives a letter from Léon, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated.

More time passes; while in Constantinople to sell furs, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski once again run afoul of their superiors. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is again sent by Commissar Razinin (Bela Lugosi) to investigate the situation and retrieve the trio.

After Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to the Soviet Union. When Ninotchka asks them who is responsible for this idea, Buljanoff points to the balcony where Léon is standing. Léon explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and the three Russians conspired to get her to leave the country. He asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees.

The final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant.

==Cast==

==Release==
The film was released in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, where it became a great success. It was, however, banned in the Soviet Union and its satellites. Despite that, it went on to make $2,279,000 worldwide. USA: $1,187,000. International: $1,092,000. Profit: $138,000.

In a play on the famous &quot;Garbo Talks!&quot; ad campaign used for her &quot;talkie&quot; debut in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (1930), &quot;Ninotchka&quot; was marketed with the catchphrase &quot;Garbo Laughs!&quot;, commenting on Garbo&#x27;s largely somber and melancholy image (though Garbo laughs several times in many of her previous pictures).

==Reception==
===Critical response===
When the film was shown at the Radio City Music Hall, &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Frank S. Nugent praised it:

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Ninotchka&quot; is recognized as well by the American Film Institute in the AFI 100 Years... series in the following lists:

* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #52
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #40

===Origins===
&quot;Ninotchka&quot; is based on a three-sentence story idea by Melchior Lengyel that made its debut at a poolside conference in 1937, when a suitable comedy vehicle for Garbo was being sought by MGM: “Russian girl saturated with Bolshevist ideals goes to fearful, capitalistic, monopolistic Paris. She meets romance and has an uproarious good time. Capitalism not so bad, after all.”

===Revival===
An attempt by MGM to release &quot;Ninotchka&quot; later during World War II was suppressed on the grounds that the Soviets were then allies of the West. The film was released after the war ended.

===Legacy===
In 1955, the musical &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, based on &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, opened on Broadway. Written by Cole Porter, the stage production was based on &quot;Ninotchka&#x27;s&quot; story and script and starred Hildegard Neff and Don Ameche. MGM then produced a 1957 film version of the musical directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Actor George Tobias, who appeared uncredited in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; as the Soviet visa official, is featured in &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; as Commissar Markovitch. Rolfe Sedan, who portrayed the hotel manager in &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, appears uncredited as a stage manager in &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;. The MGM films &quot;Comrade X&quot; (1940), starring Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr, and &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot; (1956), starring Bob Hope and Katharine Hepburn, both borrow heavily from &quot;Ninotchka&quot;.

MGM had scheduled &quot;Madame Curie&quot; as Garbo&#x27;s next film, but pleased with the success of &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, the studio quickly decided to team Garbo and Douglas in another romantic comedy. &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941) was the result and Garbo received the worst reviews of her entire career. It turned out to be her final film and Greer Garson eventually starred in &quot;Madame Curie&quot;.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Ninotchka&quot; as one of his favorite films.

Filipino writer and activist Ninotchka Rosca revealed during a 1966 Philippine congressional hearing that her pen name was inspired by the film.

Nazi German Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels remarked in his meeting notes on June 9, 1940 that &quot;The German press should go and see the excellent American anti-Soviet film &quot;Ninotchka&quot;.&quot; He would later tell multiple German actors that he thought it was one of the best films he had ever seen. During the 1948 Italian general election the US State Department encouraged film distributors to show the film as a means of countering the increasingly popular Italian Communist Party.

===Cultural influences===
&quot;Colonel Ninotchka&quot; was a character in the 1980s women&#x27;s professional wrestling promotion, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

<doc id="62119" wikidata="Q896984" url="?curid=62119" title="Bradford's law">
<text>Bradford&#x27;s law is a pattern first described by Samuel C. Bradford in 1934 that estimates the exponentially diminishing returns of searching for references in science journals. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n2. There are a number of related formulations of the principle.

In many disciplines, this pattern is called a Pareto distribution. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core scientific journals for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher&#x27;s Bradford multiplier &quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in &quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.

Different researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like Zipf&#x27;s law, to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty, it is sufficient to identify the &quot;core publications&quot; for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.

However, its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by Vannevar Bush&#x27;s famous article &quot;As We May Think&quot;, Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His Science Citation Index (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;, were core for all of hard science. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

The result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of &quot;core journals&quot; may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.

==Scattering==
Bradford&#x27;s law is also known as Bradford&#x27;s law of scattering or the Bradford distribution, as it describes how the articles on a particular subject are scattered throughout the mass of periodicals. Another more general term that has come into use since 2006 is information scattering, an often observed phenomenon related to information collections where there are a few sources that have many items of relevant information about a topic, while most sources have only a few. This law of distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the World Wide Web as well.

Hjørland and Nicolaisen identified three kinds of scattering:
#Lexical scattering. The scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts.
#Semantic scattering. The scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts.
#Subject scattering. The scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

They found that the literature of Bradford&#x27;s law (including Bradford&#x27;s own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.

== Law&#x27;s interpretations ==

The interpretation of Bradford&#x27;s law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko, who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals. V. Yatsko&#x27;s interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).

<text>Of Mice and Men is a 1937 novella written by American author John Steinbeck. It describes the experiences of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers, as they move from place to place in California, searching for jobs during the Great Depression.

Steinbeck based the novella on his own experiences as a teenager working alongside migrant farm workers in the 1910s, before the arrival of the Okies whom he would describe in his novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. The title is taken from Robert Burns&#x27; poem &quot;To a Mouse&quot;: &quot;The best laid schemes o&#x27; mice an&#x27; men / Gang aft agley&quot; (&quot;The best-laid plans of mice and men / Often go awry&quot;).

Although the book is taught in many schools, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; has been a frequent target of censorship and book bans for vulgarity and for what some consider offensive and racist language. Consequently, it appears on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the &quot;Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century&quot;.

==Plot==
During the Great Depression in California, two migrant field workers – George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a bulky, strong but mentally disabled man – are on their way from Soledad to another part of the state. They share a dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie&#x27;s part of the dream is merely to care for and pet rabbits. He loves touching soft animals, although he always accidentally kills them by petting them too hard. George constantly retells the dream, which is one of Lennie&#x27;s favorite stories. They fled from Weed after Lennie grabbed a young woman&#x27;s skirt because he thought it was pretty. He would not let go, because he holds on tighter when stressed. This led to an accusation of rape and a mob forming to find and lynch Lennie. Throughout the introduction, it becomes clear that Lennie relies on George because he is unable to function independently.

After they are hired at a farm, Curley, the Boss&#x27;s small, aggressive son, confronts the pair. Curley, who has a Napoleon complex, dislikes larger men, and targets Lennie. Lennie is instantly attracted to Curley&#x27;s flirtatious and provocative wife, which also poses a problem. In contrast, the pair meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle jerkline-skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives puppies to Lennie and to Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was put down by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.

In spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 toward the purchase of a farm, in return for permission to live with them. They will be able to buy a farm at the end of the month. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley&#x27;s fist while urged on by George.

Nevertheless, George feels more relaxed. He even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable hand, who is isolated from the other workers because he is black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm, even though he scorns the possibility of the dream coming true. Curley&#x27;s wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, she shows her spiteful side when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks lynched. They hear the ranch hands returning, and she leaves.

The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley&#x27;s wife enters the barn and tries to speak to him, admitting that she is lonely. Her dreams of becoming a movie star have been crushed. She finds out about Lennie&#x27;s love of soft things and offers to let him stroke her hair, but when she feels his strength, she panics and begins to scream. Lennie becomes frightened and unintentionally breaks her neck. He runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, they form a lynch mob intent on killing him, sending for the police before beginning the search. George quickly realizes that their dream is at an end and hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.

George finds Lennie at the meeting spot, and the two sit together while George retells the beloved story of the dream, although he now knows it will never happen. George hears the lynch mob coming and shoots Lennie, giving him a more merciful death than the one he would receive at the hands of the mob. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds later. Only Slim understands what has happened. He leads George away, trying to console him. Curley and Carlson look on, neither understanding why Slim and George are feeling the way they are.

==Characters==

* George Milton: A quick-witted man who is Lennie&#x27;s guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He has been friends with Lennie since they were children. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as &quot;small and quick&quot;, every part of him being &quot;defined&quot;, with small strong hands on slender arms. He has a dark face and &quot;restless eyes&quot; and &quot;sharp, strong features&quot; including a &quot;thin, bony nose&quot;.
* Lennie Small: A gigantic, physically strong imbecile who travels with George and is his constant companion. He dreams of &quot;living off the fatta&#x27; the lan and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things is a weakness, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George&#x27;s &quot;opposite&quot;, writing that he is a &quot;huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes&quot; and &quot;wide, sloping shoulders&quot;. Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, &quot;the way a bear drags his paws&quot;, adding that his arms do not swing at his sides, but hang loosely.
* Candy: An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George&#x27;s description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life&#x27;s savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.
* Slim: A &quot;jerkline skinner&quot;, the main driver of a mule team and the &quot;prince of the ranch&quot;. Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him, and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie. Slim is considered the &quot;&quot; of this story by the god-like descriptions of Slim that he is the one that knows best out of the novel’s characters.
* Curley: The Boss&#x27;s son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as &quot;handy&quot;, partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with vaseline on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie. At one point, Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him, and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him.
* Curley&#x27;s wife: A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as &quot;Curley&#x27;s wife&quot;. Steinbeck explained that she is &quot;not a person, she&#x27;s a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil – and a danger to Lennie.&quot; Curley&#x27;s wife&#x27;s preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death: She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence, only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him &quot;mussing it&quot;. Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually kills her accidentally by breaking her neck.
* Crooks: Crooks, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden. Crooks is a more relatable individual who sees things from a more rational and human perspective.
* Candy&#x27;s dog: A blind dog who is described as &quot;old&quot;, &quot;stinky&quot;, and &quot;crippled&quot;, and is killed by Carlson.
* Carlson: A &quot;thick bodied&quot; ranch hand, he kills Candy&#x27;s dog with little sympathy.
* The Boss: Curley&#x27;s father, the superintendent of the ranch. The ranch is owned by &quot;a big land company&quot; according to Candy.
* Whit: A young ranch hand.

==Themes==
Steinbeck emphasizes aspirations throughout the book. George aspires to become independent, to be his own boss, to have a homestead, and, most important, to be &quot;somebody&quot;. Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead, and to quench his fixation on soft objects. Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age—on George&#x27;s homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley&#x27;s wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.

Loneliness is a significant factor in several characters&#x27; lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley&#x27;s wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for—she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as &quot;A guy goes nuts if he ain&#x27;t got anybody. Don&#x27;t make any difference who the guy is, long&#x27;s he&#x27;s with you.&quot; The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of Soledad, which means &quot;solitude&quot; in Spanish.

Despite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley&#x27;s wife is upheld by Curley&#x27;s jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks&#x27;s barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the stable; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie&#x27;s ignorance.

Steinbeck&#x27;s characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action-oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to earn enough money to fulfill their dream. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie&#x27;s mental handicap comes to the fore.

Regarding human interaction, the evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley&#x27;s wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father&#x27;s farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley&#x27;s Napoleon complex is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley&#x27;s wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the Penguin Teacher&#x27;s Guide for &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, Curley and Curley&#x27;s wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.

Fate is felt most heavily as the characters&#x27; aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger). Steinbeck presents this as &quot;something that happened&quot; or as his friend coined for him &quot;non-teleological thinking&quot; or &quot;is thinking&quot;, which postulates a non-judgmental point of view.

&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; can be associated with the idea that inherent limitations exist and despite all the squirming and struggling, sometimes the circumstances of one&#x27;s existence limits their capacity to live the fairy tale lives they wish to. Even the title of the novel itself references this &quot;the title is, of course, a fragment from the poem lay Robert Burns, which gives emphasis to the idea of the futility of human endeavor or the vanity of human wishes&quot;.

Animals play a role in the story as well; the heron shifts from a beautiful part of the scenery from the beginning of the novel to a predator near the end. The ending chapter has the heron return, preying upon snakes that get too curious in a repetitive nature, symbolic of the dreams of men constantly being snatched away.

==Development==
&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was Steinbeck&#x27;s first attempt at writing in the form of novel-play termed a &quot;play-novelette&quot; by one critic. Structured in three acts of two chapters each, it is intended to be both a novella and a script for a play. It is only 30,000 words in length. Steinbeck wanted to write a novel that could be played from its lines, or a play that could be read like a novel.

Steinbeck originally titled it &quot;Something That Happened&quot; (referring to the events of the book as &quot;something that happened&quot; because nobody can be really blamed for the tragedy that unfolds in the story). However, he changed the title after reading Robert Burns&#x27;s poem &quot;To a Mouse&quot;. Burns&#x27;s poem tells of the regret the narrator feels for having destroyed the home of a mouse while plowing his field.

Steinbeck wrote this book and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; in what is now Monte Sereno, California. An early draft of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was eaten by Steinbeck&#x27;s dog. As he explained in a 1936 letter:My setter pup [Toby], left alone one night, made confetti of about half of my [manuscript] book. Two months [sic] work to do over again. It sets me back. There was no other draft. I was pretty mad, but the poor little fellow may have been acting critically.

In the introduction to Penguin&#x27;s 1994 edition of the book, Susan Shillinglaw writes that Steinbeck, after dropping out of Stanford University, spent almost two years roaming California, finding work on ranches for Spreckels Sugar where he harvested wheat and sugar beets. Steinbeck told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1937:I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell. I worked in the same country that the story is laid in. The characters are composites to a certain extent. Lennie was a real person. He&#x27;s in an insane asylum in California right now. I worked alongside him for many weeks. He didn&#x27;t kill a girl. He killed a ranch foreman. Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach. I hate to tell you how many times. I saw him do it. We couldn&#x27;t stop him until it was too late.

==Reception==
Attaining the greatest positive response of any of his works up to that time, Steinbeck&#x27;s novella was chosen as a Book of the Month Club selection before it was published. Praise for the work came from many notable critics, including Maxine Garrard (&quot;Enquirer-Sun&quot;), Christopher Morley, and Harry Thornton Moore (&quot;New Republic&quot;). &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ralph Thompson described the novella as a &quot;grand little book, for all its ultimate melodrama&quot;. In the UK, it was listed at number 52 of the &quot;nation&#x27;s best loved novels&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s 2003 survey The Big Read.

The novella has been banned from various US public and school libraries or curricula for allegedly &quot;promoting euthanasia&quot;, &quot;condoning racial slurs&quot;, being &quot;anti-business&quot;, containing profanity, and generally containing &quot;vulgar&quot;, &quot;offensive language&quot;, and containing racial stereotypes, as well as the negative impact of these stereotypes on students. Many of the bans and restrictions have been lifted and it remains required reading in many other American, Australian, Irish, British, New Zealand and Canadian high schools.

As a result of being a frequent target of censors, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; appears on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000–2009 (number five) and Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2010–2019 (number 28). &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; has been proposed for censorship 54 times since it was published in 1936. However, scholars including Thomas Scarseth have fought to protect the book by arguing its literary value. According to Scarseth &quot;in true great literature the pain of Life is transmuted into the beauty of Art&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===

As a &quot;playable novel&quot;, it was performed by the Theater Union of San Francisco as written. This version opened on May 21, 1937 – less than three months after the novel&#x27;s publication – and ran for about two months.

To create a Broadway production, Steinbeck adapted and slightly revised his original text and this version, produced by Sam H. Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman, opened on November 23, 1937, in the Music Box Theatre on Broadway and ran for 207 performances. It starred Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as Lennie. The role of Crooks was performed by Leigh Whipper, the first African-American member of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association. (Whipper repeated this role in the 1939 film version.) The production was chosen as Best Play in 1938 by the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle.

In 1939 the production was moved to Los Angeles, still with Wallace Ford in the role of George, but with Lon Chaney, Jr., taking on the role of Lennie. Chaney&#x27;s performance in the role resulted in his casting in the movie.

In 1958, a musical theater adaptation by Ira Bilowit (1925–2016) was produced Off-Broadway in New York City. The cast included several in-demand performers of their day, including Art Lund and Jo Sullivan, re-teamed after performing together in the hit musical &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;, as well as Leo Penn. However, a newspaper strike negatively affected the production and it closed after six weeks. A revival of the work was mounted at the Western Stage in Salinas, California in 2019.

The play was revived in a 1974 Broadway production in the Brooks Atkinson Theatre starring Kevin Conway as George and James Earl Jones as Lennie. Noted stage actress Pamela Blair played Curley&#x27;s Wife in this production.

In 1970 Carlisle Floyd wrote an opera based on this novella. One departure between Steinbeck&#x27;s book and Floyd&#x27;s opera is that the opera features The Ballad Singer, a character not found in the book.

A new version of the play opened on Broadway at The Longacre Theater on March 19, 2014 for a limited 18-week engagement, starring James Franco, Chris O&#x27;Dowd, Leighton Meester and Jim Norton.

A ballet adaptation was created by Cathy Marston with original music by Thomas Newman. It debuted on April 27, 2022 at the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago.

===Film===
The first film adaptation was released in 1939, two years after the publication of the novella, and starred Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie, with Burgess Meredith as George, and was directed by Lewis Milestone. It was nominated for four Academy Awards.

A TV version, produced by David Susskind in 1968, starred George Segal as George, Nicol Williamson as Lennie, Will Geer as Candy, Moses Gunn as Crooks, and Don Gordon and Joey Heatherton as Curley and his wife, respectively.

In 1981, a TV movie version was released, starring Randy Quaid as Lennie, and Robert Blake as George, and directed by Reza Badiyi.

Another theatrical film version was made in 1992, directed by Gary Sinise, who was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes. Sinise played George, and the role of Lennie was played by John Malkovich, both reprising their roles from the 1980 Steppenwolf Theatre Company stage production.

The 1992 Malayalam film &quot;Soorya Manasam&quot; directed by Viji Thampi is also based on the novel.

===Radio===
&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was adapted by Donna Franceschild as a radio play directed by Kirsty Williams starring David Tennant and Liam Brennan broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 7 March 2010. Earlier BBC productions were aired in 1966 and 1992.

<doc id="62121" wikidata="Q1620093" url="?curid=62121" title="Of Mice and Men (1939 film)">
<text>Of Mice and Men is a 1939 American drama film based on the 1937 play of the same name, which itself was based on the novella of the same name by author John Steinbeck. The film stars Burgess Meredith, Betty Field, and Lon Chaney Jr., and features Charles Bickford, Roman Bohnen, Bob Steele, and Noah Beery Jr. The film tells the story of two men, George and his intellectually disabled partner Lennie, trying to survive during the dustbowl of the 1930s and pursuing a dream of owning their own ranch instead of always working for others. Starring in the lead roles were relative Hollywood newcomer Burgess Meredith as George and veteran actor Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of famed silent film actor Lon Chaney) as Lennie. Chaney had appeared in more than 50 films by that point in his career, but &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was his first major role. Betty Field&#x27;s role as Mae was her breakthrough role in film.

The film, produced by the Hal Roach Studios, was adapted by Eugene Solow and directed by Lewis Milestone. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The musical score was by American composer Aaron Copland. Released in 1939, it appeared in the 1980s and 1990s in revival theater houses, video and cable, and it earned a following of fans (both audience members and film critics) who praised the movie for its interpretation of the Steinbeck novella.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of two migrant field workers in California during the Great Depression, George Milton and the mentally-challenged Lennie Small, who hope to one day attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land.

They arrive at a ranch near Soledad and meet Candy, the aged, one-handed ranch-hand. After meeting with the ranch boss, Jackson, the pair are confronted by Curley, the violent son of the ranch owner. To make matters worse, Curley&#x27;s seductive and conniving wife, Mae, flirts with the other ranch hands. George orders Lennie not to talk to, or even look at her, as he senses the troubles that Mae could bring to them.

Candy offers to join with George and Lennie so they can buy the farm and the dream appears to move closer to reality. Curley appears and makes a scene in the bunkhouse as the workers mock him after he accused Slim of keeping company with his wife. Curley catches Lennie laughing, grabs him from his bunk, and starts punching him in the face. When George tells him to fight back, Lennie crushes Curley&#x27;s hand. Slim gives Curley an ultimatum: if Curley tells his father, Slim will tell everyone what happened. Curley is told to say that he got his hand caught in a piece of machinery.

Despite Slim&#x27;s efforts, Mae discovers the truth. When Mae tries to be kind to Lennie, George tells her to return to the house. Mae refuses to do so, saying that she has the right to talk to and flirt with whoever she likes.

The next morning, Mae confronts Curley, calling him &quot;a punk with a crippled hand!&quot; Curley tells her that their marriage is over, and that she is going to be kicked off the ranch due to her carnal behavior with the ranch hands. Before she can leave, Mae enters the barn to pet a few of Slim&#x27;s puppies, when she spots Lennie sobbing. Lennie says he killed his puppy when it tried to bite him. Mae explains to Lennie what she wanted to be before Curley shattered her dream. When Lennie tells Mae that he loves to stroke soft things, Mae allows him to stroke her hair. Mae starts to resist and scream when Lennie strokes her hair too hard. When Lennie tries to silence Mae, he accidentally kills her by breaking her neck.

When Candy and George find Mae&#x27;s body, they tell the others and a lynch mob gathers to kill Lennie. George finds Lennie and, wanting to spare Lennie a painful death, shoots him in the back of the head before the mob can find him.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was first released, Frank S. Nugent, the film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the film and the acting, writing &quot;...New York, unless we have miscalculated again, will endorse its film version, at the Roxy, as heartily as it has endorsed the film of the Joads. The pictures have little in common as narrative, but they have much in common as art; the same deft handling of their material, the same understanding of people, the same ability to focus interest sharply and reward it with honest craftsmanship and skill... No small share of that credit belongs to the men and the one young woman Hal Roach has recruited for his production. Miss Field has added stature to the role of the foreman&#x27;s wife by relieving her of the play&#x27;s box-office-conscious order that she behave like a hoyden.&quot;

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also reviewed the film favorably, writing &quot;Under skillful directorial guidance of Lewis Milestone, the picture retains all of the forceful and poignant drama of John Steinbeck&#x27;s original play and novel, in presenting the strange palship and eventual tragedy of the two California ranch itinerants. In transferring the story to the screen, the scripter Eugene Solow eliminated the strong language and forthright profanity. Despite this requirement for the Hays whitewash squad, Solow and Milestone retain all of the virility of the piece in its original form.&quot;

The film received positive reviews, earning a 100% score on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews.

===Accolades===
It was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Sound Recording (Elmer A. Raguse), Best Musical Scoring and Best Original Score.
It was on a preliminary list of submissions from the studios for an Academy Award for Cinematography (Black-and-White) but was not nominated.
