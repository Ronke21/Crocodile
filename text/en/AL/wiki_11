<text>Dida is a dialect cluster of the Kru family spoken in Ivory Coast.

ISO divides Dida into three groups, Yocoboué (Yokubwe) Dida (101,600 speakers in 1993), Lakota Dida (93,800 speakers in 1993), and Gaɓogbo (Guébié/Gebye) which are only marginally mutually intelligible and best considered separate languages. Yocoboué consists of the Lozoua (Lozwa) and Divo dialects (7,100 and 94,500 speakers), and Lakota the Lakota (Lákota), Abou (Abu), and Vata dialects. The prestige dialect is the Lozoua speech of the town of Guitry.

==Phonology==
The Dida lects have consonant and vowel inventories typical of the Eastern Kru languages. However, tone varies significantly between dialects, or at least between their descriptions. The following phonology is that of Abu Dida, from Miller (2005), and of Yocoboué Dida, from Masson (1992).

===Vowels===

==== Abu ====
Abu Dida has a ten-vowel system: nine vowels distinguished by &quot;tenseness&quot;, likely either pharyngealization or supra-glottal phonation (contraction of the larynx) of the type described as retracted tongue root, plus an uncommon mid-central vowel .

The non-contracted vowels are , and the contracted vowels . (These could be analyzed as , but here are transcribed with lower vowels to reflect their phonetic realization. There is no tense contrast with the low vowel.) The formants of the tense vowels show them to be lower than their non-tense counterparts: the formants of the highest tense vowels overlap the formants of the non-tense mid vowels, but there is visible tension in the lips and throat when these are enunciated carefully.

Abu Dida has a number of diphthongs, which have the same number of tonal distinctions as simple vowels. All start with the higher vowels, , and except for , both elements are either contracted or non-contracted, so the pharyngealization is here transcribed after the second element of the vowel. Examples are &quot;bottle&quot; (from English), &quot;get stuck&quot;, and &quot;little bone&quot;.

Dida also has nasal vowels, but they are not common and it is not clear how many. Examples are &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;chin&quot;, &quot;25 cents&quot; (from English &quot;pound&quot;). In diphthongs, nasalization shows up primarily on the second element of the vowel.

Vowel length is not distinctive, apart from phonesthesia (as in &quot;nothing&quot;), morphemic contractions, and shortened grammatical words, such as the modal &quot;will&quot; (compare its likely lexical source &quot;get&quot;).

==== Yocoboué ====
Yocoboué Dida has a nine vowel system: four vowels being standard, and five vowels being a retracted series, plus a realization.

The four regular vowels are /i e o u/, and the retracted vowels are /ɪ ɛ a ɔ ʊ/. /a/ may also be realized as [ʌ].

All vowels do have nasal realizations, but the nasalization of vowels is not phonemic.

===Consonants===
The consonants in Abu Dida are typical for Eastern Kru:

Syllables may be vowel only, consonant-vowel, or consonant--vowel. is a lateral approximant initially, a lateral flap between vowels and after most consonants ( &quot;country&quot;), but a central tap after alveolars ( &quot;blood&quot;). After a nasal (), it is itself nasalized, and sounds like a short &quot;n.&quot; There is a short epenthetic vowel between the initial consonant and the flap, which takes the quality of the syllabic vowel that follows ( &quot;country&quot;). Flap clusters occur with all consonants, even the approximants ( &quot;top&quot;), apart from the alveolar sonorants and the marginal consonant , which is only attested in the syllable .

 is implosive in the sense that the airstream is powered by the glottis moving downward, but there is no rush of air into the mouth. occurs in few words, but one of these, &quot;appear&quot;, occurs in numerous common idioms, so overall it&#x27;s not an uncommon sound. It is a true fricative and may devoice to word initially. and plus a vowel are distinct from or plus and another vowel. They may also be followed by a flap, as in &quot;face&quot;.

When emphasized, zero-onset words may take an initial , and initial approximants may become fricated , . becomes palatalized before high front vowels, or when emphasized.

The following consonants are for Yocoboué Dida:

/l/ can be realized as when after alveolar stops, and as when after nasals.

===Tones===
Dida uses tone as a grammatical device. Morpho-tonology plays a greater role in verb and pronominal paradigms than it does in nouns, and perhaps because of this, Dida verbs utilize a simpler tone system than nouns do: Noun roots have four lexically contrastive tones, subject pronouns have three, and verb roots have just two word tones.

There are three level tones in Abou Dida: , , and , with about twice as common as the other two. Speaker intuition hears six contour tones: rising and falling . (The falling tones only reach register at the end of a prosodic unit; otherwise the low falling tone is realized as a simple low tone.) However, some of these only occur in morphologically complex words, such as perfective verbs.

Monosyllabic nouns contrast four tones: and : &quot;egg&quot;, &quot;leopard&quot;, &quot;buffalo&quot;, &quot;arrow&quot;, with and being the most frequent.

<text>Jerónimo (or Gerónimo) de Zurita y Castro or simply Jerónimo (or Gerónimo) de Zurita (1512 – 3 November 1580) was a Spanish historian of the sixteenth century who founded the modern tradition of historical scholarship in Spain.

Born at Zaragoza, Kingdom of Aragon, he studied at Alcalá de Henares under the Hellenist Hernán Nuñez. Through the influence of his father, Miguel de Zurita, physician to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he entered the public service as magistrate at Barbastro, and in 1537 was appointed assistant-secretary of the Inquisition. In 1548 Zurita was nominated official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon, and in 1566 Philip II of Spain attached him as secretary to the council of the Inquisition, delegating to him the conduct of all matters sufficiently important to require the king&#x27;s signature. Zurita resigned these posts on the January 21, 1571, obtained a sinecure at Zaragoza, and dedicated himself wholly to the composition of his &quot;Anales de la Corona de Aragón&quot;, the first part of which had appeared in 1562; he lived to see the last volume printed at Zaragoza on the April 22, 1580, and died on the November 3 following.

Zurita&#x27;s style is somewhat crabbed and dry, but his authority is unquestionable; he displayed a new conception of an historian&#x27;s duties, and, not content with the ample materials stored in the Archives of Aragon, continued his researches in the libraries of Rome, Naples and Sicily.

<doc id="58642" wikidata="Q223810" url="?curid=58642" title="James Bay">
<text>James Bay (, ; ) is a large body of water located on the southern end of Hudson Bay in Canada. It borders the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is politically part of Nunavut. Its largest island is Akimiski Island.

Numerous waterways of the James Bay watershed have been modified with dams or diversion for several major hydroelectric projects. These waterways are also destinations for river-based recreation. Several communities are located near or alongside James Bay, including a number of Aboriginal Canadian communities, such as the Kashechewan First Nation and nine communities affiliated with the Cree of northern Quebec.

As with the rest of Hudson Bay, the waters of James Bay routinely freeze over in winter. It is the last part of Hudson Bay to freeze over in winter, and the first to thaw in summer.

==History==
Human presence along the shores of the bay began after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age, around 8,150 years ago. A variety of indigenous cultures have lived in this area. At the time of contact with Europeans, the indigenous peoples along both shores of the bay were ethnically Cree peoples.

Henry Hudson is believed to have been the first European to enter the bay, when he explored it in 1610 as part of his exploration of the larger bay that was named for him. This southerly bay was named in honour of Thomas James, a Welsh captain who explored the area more thoroughly in 1630 and 1631.

James Bay is important in the history of Canada as one of the most hospitable parts of the Hudson Bay region, although it has had a low human population. It was an area of importance to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and British expansion into Canada. The fur-trapping duo of explorers Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers convinced the English Crown, primarily Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a favoured nephew of Charles I and cousin to Charles II, that a colonial enterprise in the north would yield wealth in minerals and fur. Des Groseilliers accompanied Captain Zachariah Gillam on the ketch &quot;Nonsuch&quot; and they jointly founded Charles Fort, the first European fur-trading post on James Bay.

Their success was such that the company was chartered by Charles II on their return, although they did not bring any minerals. This charter granted a complete trading monopoly to the company of the whole Hudson Bay basin (including James Bay). At the same time, the first English colony on what is now mainland Canada, Rupert&#x27;s Land, was formed, with the first &quot;capital&quot; designated at Charles Fort. The first colonial governor, Charles Baley (various spellings exist, including but not limited to &quot;Bailey&quot;), was a Quaker, and this is believed to have been a factor in his respectful relations with the company&#x27;s trading partners, the First Nations.

Significant fur trapping has continued in the region. In general, the east coast or East Main of James Bay was too easily accessed by French and independent traders from the south. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company emphasised from an early period trading relations with tribes in interior trapping grounds, reached from the west coasts of James and Hudson bays. East Main was, nevertheless, the gateway to British settlements in what would become Manitoba (Winnipeg, for example) and as far west as the Rocky Mountains.

==Geography==

James Bay represents the southern extent of the Arctic Archipelago Marine ecozone. While the coastal areas are primarily in the Hudson Plains, the northeastern coast bordering Quebec is in the Taiga Shield ecozone. This rocky and hilly eastern shore forms the western edge of the Canadian Shield in Quebec and as such, the main habitat is boreal forest of the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga ecoregion. The western shore, however, is characterised by broad tundra lowlands that are an extension of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the vegetation is mostly muskeg bog. A large portion of this area is part of the Polar Bear Provincial Park. Ringed seals are common elsewhere along James Bay and polar bears can be seen hunting the seals as prey. Beluga whales within James Bay basin could be distinct from those found in Hudson Bay.

Hundreds of rivers flow into James Bay. The geography of the region gives many of them similar characteristics. They tend to be wide and shallow near the Bay (in the James Bay Lowlands), whereas they are steeper and narrower farther upstream (as they pour off the Canadian Shield). For a larger list of waterways in the region, see list of Hudson Bay rivers.

===Hannah Bay===
Hannah Bay is the southernmost bay of James Bay. Here the Kesagami and Harricana Rivers flow into James Bay. About 238 km2 is protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act of Canada as the Hannah Bay Bird Sanctuary. This sanctuary has also been designated as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention since May 1987.

The shores in this area are a mixture of intertidal mud, sand, and salt flats, estuarine waters, intertidal marshes, freshwater ponds, swamps, and forested peatlands. These elements make an abundance of wildlife.

===Islands===
James Bay contains numerous islands. The largest of the islands is Akimiski Island, which covers .

All of northern Ontario and northern Quebec were part of the Hudson Bay Company&#x27;s proprietary colony of Rupert&#x27;s Land, and after Rupert&#x27;s Land was purchased by Canada in 1869, the area became part of the North-West Territories (NWT). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Canada transferred much of the NWT to Ontario and Quebec, thus forming modern northern Ontario and northern Quebec. However, all of the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay remained part of the NWT. Following the partition of the NWT in 1999, the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay were transferred to the new territory of Nunavut.

==Human development==
===Coastal communities===
The shores of James Bay are sparsely populated. On the eastern shore in Quebec there are four coastal communities belonging to the Cree, the indigenous people of the region (from south to north):
* Waskaganish
* Eastmain
* Wemindji
* Chisasibi

On the western shore in Ontario there are five coastal communities (from south to north):
* Moose Factory
* Moosonee
* Fort Albany
* Kashechewan
* Attawapiskat

===Economic development===
Since 1971, the government of Quebec has built hydroelectric dams on rivers in the James Bay watershed, notably La Grande and Eastmain rivers. Built between 1974 and 1996, the James Bay Project now has a combined generating capacity of 16,021 MW and produces about 83 billion kWh of electricity each year, about half of Quebec&#x27;s consumption. Power is also exported to the United States via a direct transmission high voltage line. The James Bay Project continues to expand, with work that began in 2010 on a new phase that involves the diversion of the Rupert River.

A proposed development project, the Great Recycling and Northern Development Canal (GRAND Canal), centred on constructing a large dike to separate southern James Bay from Hudson Bay. This would turn the bay into a freshwater lake, due to the numerous rivers that empty into it. The main benefit expected from this would be to redirect this freshwater for human use. Water would be pumped south from the newly formed James Lake into the Harricana River, crossing into the Great Lakes watershed near Amos, into Lake Timiskaming and the Ottawa River, crossing near Mattawa into Lake Nipissing and the French River to Lake Huron (Georgian Bay).

==Recreation==

===Canoeing===
Many of the rivers flowing into James Bay are popular destinations for wilderness canoe-trippers. Among the more popular rivers are:
*Albany River (Ontario)
*Moose River (Ontario)
*Missinaibi River (Ontario)—recognised as a Canadian Heritage River
*Broadback River (Quebec)
*Rupert River (Quebec)—diverted in 2009 for hydroelectric development and no longer a popular destination

Two less-travelled rivers are the Groundhog River and the Harricana. The Groundhog is less travelled in modern times due to a series of seven dams that are about a day or two up-river from the Moose. Canoeists can contact the dam company and arrange to be portaged around the dams on company trucks, but they must make arrangements specific to the hour, and they cannot be late. The Groundhog flows into the Mattagami. The Mattagami then flows into the Moose; it is at the meeting of the Missinaibi and Mattagami rivers that the Moose river begins, marked by an island known as Portage Island. This point is about two or three days travel by canoe to Moosonee. Though the Missinaibi and the Groundhog are both fairly high in the summer, the Moose is often quite low. Depending on the tides, groups have had to walk long stretches of the river. Rapids on the Groundhog tend to be bigger and more technical than those on the Missinaibi, but the campsites are few and poor, because the volume of travel is so much less.

The Harricana River is wild, powerful, dangerous river that flows into James Bay east of Moosonee after two infamous sections of river known as 1-mile and 7-mile island. Consistent whitewater and waterfalls make these sections of river extremely dangerous. Anyone wishing to take this route must allow about two days to cross the bay, an extremely dangerous proposition if the tides and the weather are unfavourable.

The most common access point for paddlers to this area is Moosonee, at the southern end of James Bay. A campsite at Tidewater Provincial Park provides large campgrounds with firepits and outhouses on an island across the river from the town. Water taxis will ferry people back and forth for about C$20 each. Many of these rivers finish near Moosonee, and paddlers can take the Polar Bear Express train south to Cochrane at the end of a trip. This train regularly features a &#x27;canoe car&#x27; enabling paddlers to travel with their canoes.

Waskaganish, Quebec, is a town farther to the north and east on James Bay. It is accessible via the James Bay Road, and is the most common end point for trips on the Broadback, Pontax, and Rupert rivers (the town itself is situated at the mouth of the Rupert).

<text>The Nazgûl (from Black Speech , &quot;ring&quot;, and , &quot;wraith, spirit&quot;), introduced as Black Riders and also called Ringwraiths, Dark Riders, the Nine Riders, or simply the Nine, are fictional characters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. They were nine Men who had succumbed to Sauron&#x27;s power through wearing Rings of Power, which gave them immortality but reduced them to invisible s, servants bound to the power of the One Ring and completely under Sauron&#x27;s control.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; calls them Sauron&#x27;s &quot;most terrible servants&quot;. Their leader, known as the Witch-king of Angmar, the Lord of the Nazgûl, or the Black Captain, was Sauron&#x27;s chief agent for most of the Third Age. At the end of the Third Age, their main stronghold was the city of Minas Morgul at the entrance to Sauron&#x27;s realm, Mordor. They dress entirely in black. In their early forays, they ride on black horses; later they ride flying monsters, which Tolkien described as &quot;pterodactylic&quot;. Their main weapon is terror, though in their pursuit of the Ring-bearer Frodo Baggins, their leader uses a Morgul-knife which would reduce its victim to a wraith, and they carry ordinary swords. In his final battle, the Lord of the Nazgûl attacks Éowyn with a mace. The hobbit Merry Brandybuck stabs him with an ancient enchanted Númenórean blade, allowing Éowyn to kill him with her sword. 

Commentators have written that the Nazgûl serve on the ordinary level of story as dangerous opponents of the Company of the Ring; at the romantic level as the enemies of the heroic protagonists; and finally at the mythic level. Tolkien knew the &quot;Lacnunga&quot;, the Old English book of spells; it may have suggested multiple features of the Nazgûl, the Witch-King, and the Morgul-knife.

The Nazgûl appear in numerous adaptations of Tolkien&#x27;s writings, including animated and live-action films and computer games.

== Fictional history ==

=== Second Age ===

The Nazgûl or Ringwraiths (Quenya plural: &quot;Úlairi&quot;) first appeared in the Second Age. The Dark Lord Sauron gave nine Rings of Power to powerful mortal men, including three lords of the once-powerful island realm of Númenor, along with kings of countries in Middle-earth. The rings enslaved their bearers to the power of Sauron&#x27;s One Ring, into which he had put much of his own power. The corrupting effect of the Rings greatly extended the bearers&#x27; lives. 

The Nazgûl had a sharp sense of smell. Their sight worked differently, too: &quot;They themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are most to be feared.&quot; Their chief weapon was terror; it was so powerful that Sauron faced one disadvantage when using them: they could not easily travel in secret. The terror they spread was greater when they were unclad and invisible; and when they were gathered together.

Only two of the Nazgûl are named or identified individually in Tolkien&#x27;s works. Their chief, also known as the Lord of the Nazgûl and the Black Captain, appears as the Witch-king of Angmar during the Third Age, instrumental in the destruction of the North-kingdom of Arnor. In &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, his second-in-command is named as , the &quot;Black Easterling&quot; or the &quot;Shadow of the East&quot;. Three of the Nazgûl were great Númenórean lords; in his notes for translators, Tolkien speculated that the Witch-king of Angmar, ruler of a northern kingdom with its capital at Carn Dûm, was of Númenórean origin.

The Nine soon became Sauron&#x27;s principal servants. They were dispersed after the first overthrow of Sauron late in the Second Age at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, but their survival was assured by the power of the One Ring.

=== Third Age ===

The Nazgûl re-emerge over a thousand years later in the Third Age, when the Lord of the Nazgûl leads Sauron&#x27;s forces against the successor kingdoms of Arnor: Rhudaur, Cardolan, and Arthedain. He destroys all three but is defeated by the armies of Gondor and the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who prophesies that &quot;not by the hand of man will he fall&quot;. He escapes, and returns to Mordor. There, he gathers the other Nazgûl to prepare for the return of Sauron.
The Nazgûl besiege Minas Ithil, a Gondorian fortress in the Ephel Duath, capture it, and acquire its &quot;palantír&quot; for Sauron. The city becomes Minas Morgul, the Nazgûl&#x27;s stronghold, and the valley is known as Morgul Vale (Imlad Morgul). Sauron returns from Dol Guldur to Mordor and declares himself openly. He sent two or three of the Nazgûl, led by Khamul, to garrison Dol Guldur.

Sauron learns from Gollum that a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins of the Shire, has acquired the One Ring. Sauron entrusts its recovery to the Nazgûl. They reappear &quot;west of the River&quot;, riding black horses that were bred or trained in Mordor to endure their terror. They learn that the Ring has passed to Bilbo&#x27;s heir, Frodo, and hunt him and his companions across the Shire; the hobbits hear snuffling, and sometimes see them crawling. The hobbits escape, via Tom Bombadil&#x27;s realm where they are not pursued, to Bree. A Ranger of the North, Aragorn, arrives ahead of them and for some days leads them on paths not closely followed by the Ringwraiths.
Five of the Nazgûl corner Frodo and his company at Weathertop, where the Witch-king stabs Frodo in the shoulder with the Morgul-knife, breaking off a piece of it in the Hobbit&#x27;s flesh. During their assault, they mentally command Frodo to put on the One Ring; while wearing it, he sees them as pale figures robed in white, with &quot;haggard hands&quot;, helmets and swords. The Witch-king was taller than the others, with &quot;long and gleaming&quot; hair and a crown on his helmet.

When all Nine are swept away by the waters of the river Bruinen, their horses are drowned, and the Ringwraiths are forced to return to Mordor to regroup. 
The nine members of the Company of the Ring, tasked with the destruction of the Ring, leave Rivendell as the &quot;Nine Walkers&quot;, in opposition to the Nazgûl, the &quot;Nine Riders&quot;.

The Nazgûl reappear mounted on hideous flying beasts. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Lord of the Nazgûl uses magic, including Grond, a battering-ram engraved with evil spells, to break the gates of Minas Tirith. He is faced by Éowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan; and not far away, Merry, a hobbit of the Company. Éowyn boldly calls the Nazgûl a &quot;dwimmerlaik&quot;, telling him to go if he is not deathless. He casts back his hood to reveal a crown, but the head that wears it is invisible. Merry&#x27;s surreptitious stroke with an enchanted Barrow-blade brings the Nazgûl to his knees, allowing Éowyn, the niece of Théoden, to drive her sword between his crown and mantle. Thus is the Witch-king destroyed by a woman and a Hobbit, fulfilling Glorfindel&#x27;s prophecy. Both weapons that pierced him disintegrate, and both assailants are stricken with the Black Breath.

After the fall of the Lord of the Nazgûl, command of Mordor&#x27;s army in the field falls to Gothmog, the &quot;lieutenant of Morgul&quot;, of unspecified race.

The remaining eight Ringwraiths attack the Army of the West during the Battle of the Morannon. When Frodo claims the Ring for his own in Mount Doom, Sauron, finally realizing his peril, orders the remaining eight Nazgûl to fly to intercept him. They arrive too late: Gollum seizes the Ring and falls into the Cracks of Doom, destroying the Ring. That ends Sauron&#x27;s power and everything he had brought into being using it, including the Nazgûl.

== Steeds ==

The flying steeds of the Nazgûl are given various descriptions but no name. The soldier of Gondor Beregond calls them &quot;Hell Hawks&quot;. Tolkien describes them as &quot; beasts&quot;, though he also applies the adjective &quot;fell&quot; (&quot;fierce, cruel&quot;) to other creatures throughout &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; – even at one point to the wizard Gandalf. In a letter, he calls the winged mounts &quot;Nazgûl-birds&quot;. In the absence of a proper name, derivative works sometimes press &quot;fellbeast&quot; or &quot;fell-beast&quot; into service.

In the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where the Lord of the Nazgûl rode one of the flying beasts against King Théoden of Rohan, his mount is described as: 

It is said to attack with &quot;beak and claw&quot;. Tolkien wrote that he &quot;did not intend the steed of the Witch-king to be what is now called a &#x27;pterodactyl&#x27;&quot;, while acknowledging &quot;obviously it is &quot;pterodactylic&quot;&quot; and owed much to the &quot;new ... mythology&quot; [of the &quot;Prehistoric&quot;], and might even be &quot;a last survivor of older geological eras.&quot;

The medievalist Marjorie Burns compares the fell beast to the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;″s flying steed Sleipnir, &quot;Odin&#x27;s eight-legged otherworldly horse&quot;. She writes that whereas Gandalf&#x27;s horse Shadowfax resembles Sleipnir in his miraculous speed and in almost seeming to fly, the Nazgûl&#x27;s mount actually flies but is a &quot;negative image&quot; of Odin&#x27;s steed; and, she notes, both Odin and the Nazgûl can cause blindness.&#x27;

== Inspiration ==

=== Development ===

Tolkien began writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; with no conception of Black Riders at all. The horseman in dark clothes in the early chapter &quot;Three is Company&quot; was originally Gandalf; in 1938, Tolkien called the figure&#x27;s transformation into a Black Rider &quot;an unpremeditated turn&quot;. Frodo&#x27;s ring, too, was simply a magic ring conferring invisibility, both in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and early drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with no link to Sauron. However, Tolkien was at the time starting to consider the true nature of the Ring, and the idea that it had been made by the Necromancer, and drew itself or its bearer back to him. The Black Riders became Ringwraiths when the hobbit, at that time called Bingo rather than Frodo, discussed the Riders with the Elf Gildor, later in the same chapter. Over the next three years, Tolkien gradually developed the connections between the Nazgûl, the One Ring, Sauron, and all the other Rings of Power. The pieces finally all came together when Tolkien wrote &quot;The Mirror of Galadriel&quot;, some hundreds of pages later, around the autumn of 1941.

=== &quot;Lacnunga&quot; ===

The number of the Nazgûl, nine, may be derived from medieval folklore. Edward Pettit, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, states that nine is &quot;the commonest &#x27;mystic&#x27; number in Germanic lore&quot;. He quotes the &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot; from the &quot;Lacnunga&quot;, an Old English book of spells:

Pettit further proposes that Tolkien may have made multiple uses of another &quot;Lacnunga&quot; charm, &quot;Against a sudden stabbing pain&quot;, to derive multiple attributes of the Nazgûl. He states that Tolkien certainly knew the charm. In Henry Sweet&#x27;s translation:

Pettit writes that Tolkien may have used the &quot;loud&quot; riders to come up with the &quot;thundering hooves&quot; and &quot;piercing cry&quot; of the Nine Riders. The supernatural beings mentioned in the charm – gods, elves, witches – may naturally have suggested the Nazgûl&#x27;s magical power; in particular, the &quot;work of a witch&quot; may have resulted in the Witch-King of Angmar. Finally, the Morgul-knife that breaks off in the victim&#x27;s body, and which Elrond has to destroy by melting, matches the &quot;piece of iron ... in here... heat shall melt it!&quot;

=== Etymological connotations ===

Tolkien was a philologist. Jason Fisher, writing that &quot;all stories begin with words&quot;, takes up Edmund Wilson&#x27;s &quot;denigrating dismissal&quot; of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;a philological curiosity&quot;, replying that to him this is &quot;precisely one of its greatest strengths&quot;. Fisher explores in detail the connotations of Tolkien&#x27;s use of &quot;Ringwraith&quot; and its Black Speech translation &quot;Nazgûl&quot;, both in languages that Tolkien knew and those that he invented. &quot;Wraith&quot; in modern English means &#x27;spectre&#x27;. Fisher notes that the word has a history in folktale and fantasy including usage by the Brothers Grimm, William Morris, and George MacDonald. The word &quot;wraith&quot; can be connected, Fisher writes, to English &quot;&quot;, Old English &quot;wrīþan&quot;, to bend or twist, and in turn to Gothic &quot;wraiqs&quot;, curved, crooked, or winding, and &quot;wraks&quot;, a persecutor. There is also English &quot;wreath&quot;, from Old English &quot;wrida&quot;, meaning a band, a thing wound around something, and indeed a ring. Another cognate is Old Saxon &quot;wred&quot;, meaning cruel; Fisher comments that all of these stem from Indo-European &quot;*wreit&quot;, to turn, bend, or wind.

&quot;Nazgûl&quot; has the Black Speech roots &quot;nazg&quot;, ring, and &quot;gûl&quot;, wraith. Fisher writes that the former may well be connected, unconsciously on Tolkien&#x27;s part, to Gaelic &quot;nasc&quot;, a ring. &quot;Gûl&quot; has the meaning &quot;magic&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Sindarin. Fisher comments that this has an English homophone in &quot;&quot;, a wraith, which derives from Arabic غُول‎ &quot;ḡūl&quot;, a demon that feeds on corpses. The Sindarin word is related to &quot;ñgol&quot;, wise, wisdom, and to Noldor, Fëanor&#x27;s elves who became in Fisher&#x27;s words &quot;bent and twisted&quot; by the desire for the Silmarils.

The only one of the nine Ringwraiths to be named is Khamûl. Fisher suggests a link to Welsh &quot;kam&quot;, crooked, and &quot;kamy&quot;, to bend. &quot;Kam&quot; made its way into English usage, including by Shakespeare, as is recorded in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1755 &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. Fisher writes that this may have come to Tolkien by way of his time with the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War, with Lancashire dialect words like &quot;caimt&quot;, crooked or bad-tempered. In short, Tolkien may have felt many philological associations between his &quot;Nazgûl&quot; and &quot;Ringwraith&quot; with the meanings of being bent and twisted as well as ghoulish.

== Significance ==

=== Literary modes ===

Shippey writes that the Nazgûl function at different stylistic levels or modes (as categorised by Northrop Frye in his &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot;) in the story. At one level, they serve simply as story elements, dangerous opponents. But, Shippey notes, the level rises from the romantic, with heroes taking on the Black Riders, to the mythic, giving as example the assault of Minas Tirith. The leader of the Nazgûl directs the attack on the Great Gate; he bursts the gate using both the battering-ram Grond, written with &quot;spells of ruin&quot;, and with &quot;words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone&quot;.

=== Invisible, but corporeal ===

Despite his shadowiness and invisibility, Shippey writes, the Nazgûl on the Pelennor Fields also comes as close as he ever does to seeming human, having human form inside his black robes, carrying a sword, and laughing to reveal his power when he throws back his hood, revealing a king&#x27;s crown on his invisible head.

Yvette Kisor, a scholar of literature, writes that while the Ringwraiths and others (like Frodo) who wear Rings of Power become invisible, they do not lose any of their corporeality, being present as physical bodies. They require, she writes, physical steeds to carry them about, and they can wield swords. She notes that only a person in a body can wield the One Ring, so the invisibility is just &quot;a trick of sight&quot;. When Frodo, wearing the Ring, saw the Nazgûl in the &quot;twilight world&quot;, they appeared solid, not shadowy. He also saw Glorfindel in that world, as a figure of white flame; and Gandalf explains later that the Ringwraiths were &quot;dismayed&quot; to see &quot;an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath&quot;. Frodo is in danger of &quot;fading&quot; permanently into invisibility and the twilight world, as the Ringwraiths have done, living &quot;in another mode of reality&quot;. She writes, too, that Merry&#x27;s sword, with the special power to sever the Witch-king&#x27;s &quot;undead flesh&quot; and in particular to overcome the &quot;spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will&quot;, has in fact to cut through real, but invisible, sinews and flesh.

=== Gradual incarnation ===

Steve Walker, a Tolkien scholar, writes that the story gives the Ringwraiths credibility through a &quot;gradual incarnation of bodiless presence&quot;. Little by little, in his view, Tolkien increases the reader&#x27;s insight into their nature, starting with Black Riders who are &quot;spies more human than diabolical&quot;, rather than developing their character. Walker sees this as appropriate: the Nazgûl&#x27;s main weapons are psychological, namely fear and despair. He writes that the progressive revelation of their capabilities, and their &quot;escalation of steeds&quot; from horses to fell beasts, builds up in the reader&#x27;s mind an &quot;increasingly infernal vision&quot;.

=== The Black Breath ===

The Nazgûl spread terror and despair among their enemies, and discomfit those on their own side. The Black Breath is stated to have afflicted many during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Dr Jennifer Urquart, writing in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, describes its normal course as &quot;progressive loss of consciousness and hypothermia, leading to death&quot;. She comments that the Black Breath, contracted by &quot;excessive proximity&quot; to a Nazgûl, seems to be a &quot;spiritual malady&quot; combined with &quot;fear, confusion, reduced levels of consciousness, hypothermia, weakness and death.&quot; Faramir, on the other hand, who was thought to be suffering from the Black Breath, she diagnoses as most likely exhaustion with heat stroke, combined with &quot;psychological distress&quot; and pain, as his symptoms were quite different. Judy Ann Ford and Robin Anne Reid note that Aragorn&#x27;s use of the herb &quot;athelas&quot; to heal Faramir and others of the Black Breath, a condition &quot;which harms the spirit more than the body&quot;, identifies him to his people as the true King.

Michael and Victoria Wodzak discuss how the hobbit Merry Brandybuck can be affected by the Black Breath when the Witch-King has not noticed him, pointing out that Tolkien nowhere says that the Nazgûl breathes on him or on Éowyn. Instead Éowyn &quot;raised her shield against the horror of her enemy&#x27;s eye&quot;, and the Wodzaks comment that the Nazgûl uses his eyes &quot;to overwhelm&quot;. In their view, the seeming inconsistency is resolved by identifying the Black Breath with his &quot;pneuma&quot;, his evil spirit, and assuming that it is this which causes the harm all around him. 

Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth finds Christopher Gilson&#x27;s &quot;Words, Phrases and Passages in Various Tongues in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot; especially interesting for its rendering of two of the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s epithets, &quot;Thû&quot; meaning &quot;horrible darkness, black mist&quot; and &quot;Gorthu&quot; meaning &quot;mist of fear&quot;. Garth comments that these names &quot;anchor him in the primal night&quot; of Tolkien&#x27;s giant spiders, the Black Breath, the fog on the Barrow-downs, and the terror of the Paths of the Dead. He adds that this fog of terror may ultimately derive from Tolkien&#x27;s First World War experience &quot;of smoke barrages, gas attacks and &#x27;animal horror&#x27; on the Somme.&quot; Earlier, in his 2003 book &quot;Tolkien and the Great War&quot;, on the other hand, Garth merely notes the &quot;Black Breath of despair that brings down even the bravest&quot; as one of several elements of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; which &quot;suggest[s] the influence of 1914–18&quot;.

In her Tolkienesque 1961 short story &quot;The Jewel of Arwen&quot;, the fantasy and science fiction writer Marion Zimmer Bradley provides &quot;Translator&#x27;s Notes&quot; which assert as part of her frame story that the Nazgûl were contaminated and enslaved by a monstrous form of radioactivity which transformed &quot;the very cells of their protoplasm&quot;. They thereby became radioactive and &quot;immune to radiation poisoning, as is shown by their dwelling in the blasted tower of Minas Ithil [which glowed in the dark].&quot; Further, Bradley writes, the Nazgûl gave off &quot;radioactive contamination&quot;, causing the Black Breath.

=== Opposed to the Nine Walkers ===

The Inklings scholar Ariel Little writes that Tolkien explicitly opposes the enslaved Nine Riders with the Nine Walkers, the free Company of the Ring. In &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot;, Elrond announces that &quot;The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil&quot;. Little describes the Nazgûl as &quot;homogeneous, discordant, intensely individualistic&quot;, a group bound and trapped by Sauron, noting also Gandalf&#x27;s description of them in &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; as &quot;Mortal Men, proud and great [who] fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants&quot;. They had thus, Little writes, lost their identities as humans, even losing their substance and becoming what Tolkien calls &quot;nothingness&quot; under their black clothing. He adds that the evil characters in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are characterised by infighting, as among the Orcs, lack of harmony, and &quot;hate-filled discord&quot;, forming an &quot;anti-community&quot;. 

Little contrasts this disharmony with the Company of the Ring, which is &quot;diverse, bound by friendship, relying on each other&#x27;s strengths&quot;. The Company is joined by its common purpose, and by &quot;devoted love&quot;. There are strong bonds of friendship, seen initially between all the Hobbits. Further friendships develop throughout the Company as they travel together; Little notes that Frodo says that &quot;Strider&quot; (Aragorn), viewed initially with suspicion, is &quot;dear to me&quot;. He comments that &quot;the deep affection of the Fellowship breaks down racial and cultural barriers&quot; as all its members drop their initial reserve and come to an &quot;appreciation for the cultural distinctiveness&quot; of their companions. A case in point is the strong friendship between the Dwarf Gimli and the Elf Legolas, members of two races with radically dissimilar cultures, and which had often clashed in the past; Little notes that even the other members of the Company, in Tolkien&#x27;s words, &quot;wonder ... at this change&quot;. He writes that even when the Company splits up into smaller groups, it is not destroyed: far from it, Frodo and Sam sustain each other through their arduous journey, their friendship deepening with time; Merry and Pippin supporting each other; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli acting as a team, all continuing to function as communities. Little adds that the Company functions as a true team, every member being essential to the success of its mission. The Christian commentator Ralph C. Wood writes that &quot;the greatness of the Nine Walkers lies in the modesty of both their abilities and accomplishments. Their strength lies in their weakness, in their solidarity as a company unwilling to wield controlling power over others.&quot; Rebecca Munro notes that in the Company, &quot;no one acts alone without dependence on the deeds of others&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===

The Nazgûl are featured in adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; on radio, film, and stage. In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Nazgûl &quot;shamble and limp like zombies&quot;. They hack and slash the Hobbits&#x27; beds at &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; inn, whereas Tolkien does not identify the assailants.

In the Rankin-Bass adaptation of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the Nazgûl are robed skeletons with white hair. They ride winged horses, although the Witch-king rides a creature more in line with the book when he confronts Éowyn. The 1981 BBC Radio serial of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has the Nazgûl chant the Ring-inscription in the Black Speech of Mordor. The 1991 Russian television play &quot;Khraniteli&quot; features a group of Nazgûl galloping through a snowy pine forest; they wear black cloaks, with glimpses of red equipment.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001–2003) by Peter Jackson, the Nazgûl are almost always concealed by cloaks; they attack the inn at Bree themselves. During the siege of Minas Tirith, the Witch-king wears a distinctive helmet over his hood resembling a mask and a crown, rather than the crown worn underneath his hood in the book. Their shrieks are distorted recordings of producer and screenwriter Fran Walsh&#x27;s scream.

Minas Morgul is shown first in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, when the Nazgûl leave the city and ride towards the Shire to pursue the One Ring. It features again when Frodo and Sam make their way towards Cirith Ungol. These sets were designed by the illustrator John Howe. All nine Nazgûl are shown riding winged monsters. Jackson&#x27;s monsters explicitly differ from Tolkien&#x27;s description in that they have teeth instead of beaks. The Nazgûl use them in battle more extensively than in the book. In the film the Witch-king&#x27;s mount is largely responsible for the death of Théoden and his horse Snowmane, a departure from the book. As confirmed in the films&#x27; audio commentary, the design of the monsters was based largely on illustrations by John Howe. 

The fan-made 2009 film &quot;The Hunt for Gollum&quot; features Aragorn fighting a Ringwraith on the borders of Mirkwood.

In Jackson&#x27;s 2012–2014 &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy, the men who became the Nazgûl are said to have been buried and sealed within the invented High Fells of Rhudaur. In the first film, Radagast briefly encounters the Witch-king while investigating Dol Guldur, and gives the Nazgûl&#x27;s Morgul dagger to Gandalf to present at the White Council as proof of their return. In the second film, at Galadriel&#x27;s behest, Gandalf heads to the High Fells and finds that all the Nazgûl have left the tomb. This confirms the Necromancer&#x27;s identity as Sauron, as the Nazgûl appear alongside their master in the third film in spectral forms wearing Morgul armour and fight Elrond and Saruman before being driven away by Galadriel.

=== Games ===

The Nazgûl are featured in the video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; and its sequel &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;. In the latter, Isildur is revealed to be one of the Nazgûl before he is killed by the game&#x27;s protagonist, Talion. Talion takes Isildur&#x27;s ring to prolong his life and eventually becomes Isildur&#x27;s replacement until the demise of the Nazgûl in the &quot;Return of the King&quot;.
For the expansion to its real-time strategy game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot;, &quot;The Rise of the Witch-king&quot;, Electronic Arts invented the name &quot;Morgomir&quot; for one of the Nazgûl.

== Influence ==

The fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Armageddon Rag&quot; tells the tale of a rock promoter who had managed a band named the Nazgûl, and was found ritually murdered on the 10th anniversary of the band&#x27;s breakup.

Gothic rock band Trivalia released several of their albums through their own independent record label Black Rider and for a period of time issued a fanzine titled &quot;Black Rider&quot;, inspired by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<text>Hudson Strait () in Nunavut links the Atlantic Ocean and the Labrador Sea to Hudson Bay in Canada. This strait lies between Baffin Island and Nunavik, with its eastern entrance marked by Cape Chidley in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut and Resolution Island, off Baffin Island. The strait is about long with an average width of , varying from at the eastern entrance to at Deception Bay.

English navigator Sir Martin Frobisher was the first European to report entering the strait, in 1578. He named a tidal rip at the entrance the Furious Overfall and called the strait &quot;Mistaken Strait&quot;, since he felt it held less promise as an entrance to the Northwest Passage than the body of water that was later named Frobisher Bay. Later in his 1587 voyage, explorer John Davis sailed by the entrance to the strait. The first European to explore the strait was George Weymouth who sailed beyond the Furious Overfall in 1602.

The strait was named after Henry Hudson who explored it in 1610 in the ship &quot;Discovery&quot;, the same ship previously used by George Weymouth in 1602. Hudson was followed by Thomas Button in 1612, and a more detailed mapping expedition led by Robert Bylot and William Baffin in 1616.

The Hudson Strait links the northern seaports of Manitoba and Ontario with the Atlantic Ocean. The Strait could serve as an eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage if it were not for ice in the Fury and Hecla Strait south of western Baffin Island.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Hudson Strait as follows:

::&quot;On the West.&quot; A line from Nuvuk Point () to Leyson Point, thence by the Eastern shore of Southampton Island to Seahorse Point, its Eastern extreme, thence a line to Lloyd Point () Baffin Island.

::&quot;On the North.&quot; The South coast of Baffin Island between Lloyd Point and East Bluff.

::&quot;On the East.&quot; A line from East Bluff, the Southeast extreme of Baffin Island (), to Point Meridian, the Western extreme of Lower Savage Islands, along the coast to its Southwestern extreme and thence a line across to the Western extreme of Resolution Island, through its Southwestern shore to Hatton Headland, its Southern point, thence a line to Cape Chidley, Labrador ().

::&quot;On the South.&quot; The mainland between Cape Chidley and Nuvuk Point.

<text>A strait is a water body connecting two seas or two water basins. While the landform generally constricts the flow, the surface water still flows, for the most part, at the same elevation on both sides and through the strait in both directions. In some straits there may be a dominant directional current through the strait. Most commonly, it is a narrowing channel that lies between two land masses. Some straits are not navigable, for example because they are either too narrow or too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago. Straits are also known to be loci for sediment accumulation. Usually, sand-size deposits occur on both the two opposite strait exits, forming subaqueous fans or deltas.

==Terminology==

The terms &quot;channel&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, or &quot;passage&quot; can be synonymous and used interchangeably with &quot;strait&quot;, although each is sometimes differentiated with varying senses. In Scotland, &quot;firth&quot; or &quot;Kyle&quot; are also sometimes used as synonyms for strait.

Many straits are economically important. Straits can be important shipping routes and wars have been fought for control of them.

Numerous artificial channels, called &quot;canals&quot;, have been constructed to connect two oceans or seas over land, such as the Suez Canal. Although rivers and canals often provide passage between two large lakes, and these seem to suit the formal definition of strait, they are not usually referred to as such. Rivers and often canals, generally have a directional flow tied to changes in elevation, whereas straits often are free flowing in either direction or switch direction, maintaining the same elevation. The term &quot;strait&quot; is typically reserved for much larger, wider features of the marine environment. There are exceptions, with straits being called canals; Pearse Canal, for example.

==Comparisons==
Straits are the converse of isthmuses. That is, while a strait lies between two land masses and connects two large areas of ocean, an isthmus lies between two areas of ocean and connects two large land masses.

Some straits have the potential to generate significant tidal power using tidal stream turbines. Tides are more predictable than wave power or wind power. The Pentland Firth (a strait) may be capable of generating 10 GW. Cook Strait in New Zealand may be capable of generating 5.6 GW even though the total energy available in the flow is 15 GW.

==Navigational (legal) regime==
Straits used for international navigation through the territorial sea between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone are subject to the legal regime of transit passage (Strait of Gibraltar, Dover Strait, Strait of Hormuz). The regime of innocent passage applies in straits used for international navigation (1) that connect a part of high seas or an exclusive economic zone with the territorial sea of a coastal nation (Straits of Tiran, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Strait of Baltiysk) and (2) in straits formed by an island of a state bordering the strait and its mainland if there exists seaward of the island a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics (Strait of Messina, Pentland Firth). There may be no suspension of innocent passage through such straits.

<text>Labrador () is a geographic and cultural region within the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is the primarily continental portion of the province and constitutes 71% of the province&#x27;s area but is home to only 6% of its population. It is separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in the four Atlantic provinces.

Labrador occupies most of the eastern part of the Labrador Peninsula. It is bordered to the west and south by the province of Quebec. Labrador also shares a small land border with the territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island.

The indigenous peoples of Labrador include the Northern Inuit of Nunatsiavut, the Southern Métis of NunatuKavut, and the Innu of Nitassinan.

==Etymology==
Labrador is named after João Fernandes Lavrador, a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the Labrador Peninsula in 1498–99.

Labrador&#x27;s name in the Inuttitut/Inuktitut language (spoken in Nunatsiavut) is (), meaning &quot;the big land&quot; (a common English nickname for Labrador).

==Geography==
Labrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the Canadian Shield, a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the Atlantic Ocean are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into Hudson Bay are part of Quebec. Labrador&#x27;s extreme northern tip, at 60°22′N, shares a short border with Nunavut on Killiniq Island. Labrador also has a maritime border with Greenland. Northern Labrador&#x27;s climate is classified as polar, while Southern Labrador&#x27;s climate is classified as subarctic.

Labrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.

===North Coast===
From Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the Torngat Mountains, named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to Cape Chidley, the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to Mount Caubvick, the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, Natuashish. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with snowmobiles, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is Nain.

====Nunatsiavut====
Nunatsiavut is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2005. The settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador&#x27;s North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.
===Central Labrador===
Central Labrador extends from the shores of Lake Melville into the interior. It contains the Churchill River, the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by Hydro-Québec under a long-term contract. The Lower Churchill Project will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as &quot;the heart of the Big Land&quot;, the area&#x27;s population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.

Central Labrador is also home to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during World War II, CFB Goose Bay is now operated as a NATO tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States&#x27; Space Shuttle. Other major communities in the area are North West River and the large Innu reserve known as Sheshatshiu.

===Western Labrador===

The highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the Innu First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the Smallwood Reservoir has flooded much of the old hunting land—submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.

Western Labrador is also home to the Iron Ore Company of Canada, which operates a large iron ore mine in Labrador City. Together with the small community of Wabush, the two towns are known as &quot;Labrador West&quot;.

===South Coast===
====NunatuKavut====
From Hamilton Inlet to Cape St. Charles/St. Lewis, NunatuKavut is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador Métis). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which Cartwright is the largest.

====The Labrador Straits====
From Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the Labrador Current.

Red Bay is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century Basque whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The lighthouse at Point Amour is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. MV Kamutik, a passenger ferry between the mainland and St. Barbe on the island of Newfoundland, is based in Blanc Sablon, Quebec, near the Labrador border. L&#x27;Anse-au-Loup is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. L&#x27;Anse-au-Clair is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.

===Time zones of Labrador===
Most of Labrador (from Cartwright north and west) uses Atlantic Time (UTC−4 in winter, UTC−3 in summer). The south eastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses Newfoundland Time (UTC−3:30 in winter, UTC−2:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.

===Climate of Labrador===

Most of Labrador has a subarctic climate (Dfc), but northern Labrador has a tundra climate (ET) and Happy Valley - Goose Bay has a humid continental (Dfb) microclimate. Summers are typically cool to mild across Labrador and very rainy, and usually last from late June to the end of August. Autumn is generally short, lasting only a couple of weeks and is typically cool and cloudy. Winters are long, cold, and extremely snowy, due to the Icelandic Low. Springtime most years does not arrive until late April, with the last snow fall usually falling during early June. Labrador is a very cloudy place, with sunshine levels staying relatively low during spring and summer due to the amount of rain and clouds, before sharply dropping off during September as winter draws nearer.

===Natural features===
Labrador is home to a number of flora and fauna species. Most of the Upper Canadian and Lower Hudsonian mammalian species are found in Labrador. Notably the Polar bear () reaches the southeast of Labrador on its seasonal movements.

==History==
===Early history===

Early settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the Innu (formerly called Montagnais) and Inuit, although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.

It is believed that the Norsemen were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD. The area was known as &quot;Markland&quot; in Greenlandic Norse and its inhabitants were known as the &quot;Skrælings&quot;.In 1499 and 1500, the Portuguese explorers João Fernandes Lavrador and Pero de Barcelos reached what was probably now Labrador, which is believed to be the origin of its name. Maggiolo&#x27;s World Map, 1511, shows a solid Eurasian continent running from Scandinavia around the North Pole, including Asia&#x27;s arctic coast, to Newfoundland-Labrador and Greenland. On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place names include &quot;Terra de los Ingres&quot; (Land of the English), and &quot;Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall&quot; (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Farther south are the phrases &quot;Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall&quot; (Land of the Royal Court and of the King of Portugal) and &quot;Terra de pescaria&quot; (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenbüttel map, believed to be the work of Diogo Ribeiro, along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: &quot;As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.&quot; This is believed to be João Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what is now known as Greenland. Labrador (&quot;lavrador&quot; in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from &quot;labor&quot; in Latin) – the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada&#x27;s oldest European settlements.

In 1542, Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this &quot;new land&quot; its Latin name &quot;Terranova&quot;. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called &quot;Butus&quot; and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the &quot;San Juan&quot;, sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.

The Moravian Brethren of Herrnhut, Saxony, first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the Grenfell Mission (see Wilfred Grenfell). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the Newfoundland Railway and later Canadian National Railway/CN Marine/Marine Atlantic became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.

Labrador was part of New France until the French and Indian War. By the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the war, New France (including Labrador, though excluding the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon southwest of Newfoundland) was transferred to the British, who administered the northern portion of it as the Province of Quebec until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in Lower Canada. However, in 1809, the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing Newfoundland Colony.

===20th century===

As part of Newfoundland since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by Quebec until the British Privy Council resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, Newfoundland entered into confederation, becoming part of Canada (see above articles for full information).

Labrador played strategic roles during both World War II and the Cold War. In October 1943, a German U-boat crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named Weather Station Kurt; the installation of the equipment was the only-known armed German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until 1977 when a historian, working with the Canadian Coast Guard, identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the Canadian War Museum.

The Canadian government built a major air force base at Goose Bay, at the head of Lake Melville during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate CFB Goose Bay is one of the largest employers for the community of Happy Valley-Goose Bay.

Additionally, both the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air Force built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the Pinetree Line, Mid-Canada Line and DEW Line systems. Today, the remaining stations are automated as part of the North Warning System; however, the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.

During the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest iron ore deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at Mont Wright, Schefferville, Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.

The present community of Labrador West is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway to transport ore concentrate south to the port of Sept-Îles, Quebec, for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.

During the 1960s, the Churchill River (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area – today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador as well as a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.

Construction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45 km (30 miles) west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that delivers power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the Strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.

From the 1970s to early 2000s, the Trans-Labrador Highway was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at Mont Wright, Quebec (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from Baie-Comeau, Quebec). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These &quot;highways&quot; are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and were not completely paved until July 2022.

A study on a fixed link to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the Strait of Belle Isle, being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from Nova Scotia to Port aux Basques across the Cabot Strait.

Although a highway link has, as of December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed Quebec North Shore highway that presently does not exist. Part of the &quot;highway&quot;, Route 389, starting approximately from Baie-Comeau to , is of an inferior alignment, and from there to , the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.

Route 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada&#x27;s National Highway System in September 2005.

Labrador constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the House of Commons of Canada. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly.

==Boundary dispute==
In 1809, Labrador was transferred from Lower Canada to the Newfoundland Colony, but the inland boundary of Labrador had never been precisely stated. Newfoundland argued it extended to the height of land, while Canada, stressing the historical use of the term &quot;Coasts of Labrador&quot;, argued the boundary was inland from the high-tide mark. As Canada and Newfoundland were separate Dominions, but both within the British Empire, the matter was referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (in London). Their decision set the Labrador boundary mostly along the coastal watershed, with part being defined by the 52nd parallel north. One of Newfoundland&#x27;s conditions for joining Confederation in 1949 was that this boundary be entrenched in the Canadian constitution. While this border has not been formally accepted by the Quebec government, the Henri Dorion Commission () concluded in the early 1970s that Quebec no longer has a legal claim to Labrador.

In 2001, Parti Québécois cabinet ministers Jacques Brassard and Joseph Facal erroneously reasserted that Quebec has never recognized the 1927 border:
==Self-government==
A Royal Commission in 2002 determined that there is some public pressure from Labradorians to break from Newfoundland and become a separate province or territory.

===Indigenous self-government===
After decades of negotiation with the provincial and federal governments, the Nunatsiavut region of northern and northeastern Labrador was created in 2005 as an autonomous region with its own elected Assembly and executive drawn from members of the region&#x27;s Assembly. Some of the Innu nation would have the entirety of Labrador become a homeland for them, much as Nunavut and Nunatsiavut is for the Inuit, as a good portion of Nitassinan falls within Labrador&#x27;s borders; a 1999 resolution of the Assembly of First Nations claimed Labrador as a homeland for the Innu and demanded recognition in any further constitutional negotiations regarding the region.

Labrador&#x27;s Innu became status Indians under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 2002. Natuashish became a federal Indian reserve in 2003. Sheshatshiu became a federal reserve in 2006.

The Labrador Inuit Association had filed a land claim for portions of Labradorian land in 1977. In 1988, the Labrador Inuit Association, the government of the province of Newfoundland, and the government of Canada began negotiations based on the land claim. An agreement-in-principle was achieved in 2001, and on May 26, 2004, the agreement was ratified by over 75% of eligible voters subject to the land claim. On January 22, 2005, the Inuit of Nunatsiavut signed the Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement with the federal and provincial governments covering of land, including the entire northern salient of Labrador north of Nain as well as a portion of the Atlantic coast south of there. The agreement also includes of sea rights. Although the Inuit will not own the whole area, they were granted special rights related to traditional land use, and they will own designated Labrador Inuit Lands. The agreement also establishes the Torngat Mountains National Park in the northern area of the land claim. The agreement was ratified by the Labrador Inuit, the General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Parliament of Canada, where it received Royal Assent on June 23, 2005, whereafter elections would be held for the Nunatsiavut Assembly and self-government would begin.

In the late 1970s, the Labrador Metis Association was created by the inhabitants of Labrador&#x27;s southern coast to gain recognition as a distinct ethnocultural group, as at the time despite a pre-existing treaty protected under the constitution, the &quot;Inuit-Metis&quot; were considered to be merely the descendants of Inuit who had joined Western society. Little was known about the history of the &quot;Inuit-Metis&quot; of the time. In 2006, the Labrador Metis Association initiated a project with Memorial University of Newfoundland to better understand their past through the Community-University Research Association (CURA). Following research by CURA, the &quot;Labrador Metis&quot; were understood to be a continuation of the Inuit of southern Labrador. In 2010, the Labrador Metis Association changed its name to reflect their newly discovered heritage, and became the NunatuKavut Community Council. The Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut, who are also seeking self-government, have their land claim before the Government of Canada. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador refuses to recognise or negotiate with the Inuit of NunatuKavut until their claim has been accepted by the Government of Canada.

==Demographics==

The Labrador region, with its 26,655 population, is lower than any of the Northern Canada territories, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Newfoundland Island contains the majority of the population of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

===Communities===
The municipalities of Labrador are mainly under 1,000 in population.
===Composition===
According to the 2011 Census, Labrador was 55.1% White, 18.5% Inuit, 15.6% Metis, and 8.6% First Nations (Innu).

<text>In physical chemistry, the Faraday constant (symbol , sometimes stylized as ℱ) is a physical constant defined as the quotient of the total electric charge (&quot;q&quot;) by the amount (&quot;n&quot;) of elementary charge carriers in any given sample of matter: it is expressed in units of coulombs per mole (C/mol). 
As such, it represents the &quot;molar elementary charge&quot;, that is, the electric charge of one mole of elementary carriers (e.g., protons). It is named after the English scientist Michael Faraday. Since the 2019 revision of the SI, the Faraday constant has an exactly defined value, the product of the elementary charge (&quot;e&quot;, in coulombs) and the Avogadro constant (&quot;N&quot;A, in reciprocal moles):
: 

== Derivation ==
The Faraday constant can be thought of as the conversion factor between the mole (used in chemistry) and the coulomb (used in physics and in practical electrical measurements), and is therefore of particular use in electrochemistry. Because there are exactly &quot;N&quot;A = entities per mole, and there are exactly elementary charges per coulomb, the Faraday constant is given by the quotient of these two quantities:

One common use of the Faraday constant is in electrolysis calculations. One can divide the amount of charge (the current integrated over time) by the Faraday constant in order to find the chemical amount of a substance (in moles) that has been electrolyzed.

The value of was first determined in the 1800s by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction, in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday&#x27;s law of electrolysis. Until about 1970, the most reliable value of the Faraday constant was determined by a related method of electro-dissolving silver metal in perchloric acid.

== Other common units ==
* 96.485 kJ per volt–gram-equivalent
* 23.061 kcal per volt–gram-equivalent
* 26.801 A·h/mol

== Faraday – a unit of charge ==

Related to the Faraday constant is the &quot;faraday&quot;, a unit of electrical charge. Its use is much less common than of the coulomb, but is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the charge of one mole of elementary charges (or of negative one mole of electrons), that is,
: 1 faraday = &quot;F&quot; × 1 mol = .

Conversely, the Faraday constant &quot;F&quot; equals 1 faraday per mole.

The faraday is not to be confused with the farad, an unrelated unit of capacitance ().

<text>The GE 645 mainframe computer was a development of the GE 635 for use in the Multics project. This was the first computer that implemented a configurable hardware protected memory system. It was designed to satisfy the requirements of Project MAC to develop a platform that would host their proposed next generation time-sharing operating system (Multics) and to meet the requirements of a theorized computer utility. The system was the first truly symmetric multiprocessing machine to use virtual memory, it was also among the first machines to implement what is now known as a translation lookaside buffer, the foundational patent for which was granted to John Couleur and Edward Glaser. 

General Electric initially publicly announced the GE 645 at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in November 1965. At a subsequent press conference in December of that year it was announced that they would be working towards &quot;broad commercial availability&quot; of the system. However they would subsequently withdraw it from active marketing at the end of 1966. In total at least 6 sites ran GE 645 systems in the period from 1967 to 1975.

==System configuration==
The basic system configuration consisted of a combination of 4 basic modules these were:
* Processor
* System Controller
* Generalized I/O Controller (GIOC)
* Extended Memory Unit (EMU)
The System Controller Modules (SCM) effectively acted as the heart of the system. These were passive devices which was connected to each active device (Processor, GIOC, EMU) and provided the following:
* Core Memory - 1 microsecond memory in size capacities of 32K, 64K or 128K of 36-bit words. 
* Centralized point for forwarding control signals from one active module to another
* System Clock and the ability to issue interrupts to the processors.

Compared to the rest of the 600 series the 645 did not use the standard IOC&#x27;s (input/output controllers) for I/O. Nor did it use the DATANET-30 front end processor for communications. Instead both sets of functionality was combined into one unit called a GIOC (Generalized I/O Controller) which provided dedicated channels for both Peripheral (Disc/Tape) and Terminal I/O. The GIOC acted as an Active Device and was directly connected to memory via dedicated links to each System Controller that was present in a specific configuration.

The Extended Memory Unit, though termed a drum, was in reality a large fixed-head hard disk with one head per track, this was a OEM product from Librascope. The EMU consisted of 4,096 tracks providing 4MW (megawords) of storage (equivalent to 16MB). Each track had a dedicated read/write head, these were organised into groups of 16 &quot;track sets&quot; which are used to read/write a sector. A sector is the default unit of data allocation in the EMU and is made up of 80 words, of which 64 words are data and the remaining 16 were used as a guard band. The average transfer rate between the EMU and memory was 470,000 words per second, all transfers were 72-bits (two words) wide, with it taking 6.7μs to transfer 4 words. The unit had a rotational speed of 1,725 rpm, which ensured an average latency of 17.4 milliseconds.

==Architecture==
=== Processor Modes ===
The GE-645 has two modes of Instruction Execution (Master and Slave) inherited from the GE-635, however it also adds another dimension by having two modes of memory addressing (Absolute and Appending). When the process is executing in Absolute Mode addressing is limited to 218 words of memory and any instructions are executed in Master mode. In comparison Append Mode calculates the address using &quot;Appending Words&quot; with an address space of 224 words and with instruction execution occurring in either Master or Slave modes. 
==== Slave Mode ====
By default this is normal mode that the processor should be executing in at any point in time. Nearly all instructions will run in this mode aside from a small set of privileged instructions which cannot execute in this mode. Execution of such instructions will trigger an illegal procedure fault, also the ability to inhibit interrupts (bit 28 of instruction word) is forbidden. Format of instruction addresses is via the Appending Process.
==== Master Mode ====
In this mode the processor can execute all instructions and is able to inhibit interrupts while doing so. Like in Slave mode the default form of address formation is via the Appending Process.
==== Absolute Mode ====
All instructions can be executed in this mode and full access is given to any privileged features of the hardware. Interrupts can be inhibited and instruction fetching is limited to a 218 (18-bit) absolute address thus restricting the processor to only been able to access the lower 256 KW of physical core memory. The processor will switch to this mode in the event of a fault or interrupt and will remain in it until it executes transfer instruction whose operand address has been obtained via the appending process.

==== Appending Mode ====
By default this is normal mode of Memory addressing, both Master and Slave modes normally operate in this mode. Indirect words and operands are accessed via Appending Mechanism via the process of placing a 1 in bit 29 of the executed instruction. Effective addresses are thus either added to a base address, or the offset is linked to the base address. 


=== Functional Units ===
The 645 processor was divided into four major functional units these were:

* Appending Unit: 
** Controls data I/O from memory
** Controls memory selection and interleave
** Carries out Memory appending
** Control fault recognition
** Does power on/off sequencing
* Associative Memory Unit:
** Consists of Associative Memory made up of 16 x 60-bit Registers
** Registers point to most recently used segment (Segment Descriptor Word) or most recently used Page (Page Table)
** Performs the function of what would now be classed as a TLB.
* Control Unit:
** Performs all control functions
** Performs Address modification
** Controls the processor mode (master, slave, absolute)
** Interrupt recognition/handling
** Opcode decoding
* Operations Unit:
** Performs fractional and integer divisions and multiplications.
** Performs automatic alignment of floating-point numbers for addition and subtraction.
** Performs inverted divisions on floating-point numbers.
** Performs automatic normalization of floating-point resultants.
** Performs shifts.
** Performs indicator register loading and storing.
** Performs timer register loading and decrementing.

One of the key differences from the GE 635 was the addition of &quot;appending unit&quot; (APU) which was used to implement a hybrid &quot;Paged Segmentation&quot; model of virtual memory. The APU was also used to implement a single-level store which is one of the fundamental abstraction that Multics is built around. The instruction format was also extended with the previously unused bit 29 controlling whether the operand address of an instruction used an 18-bit format (bit 29 = 0) or one that was made up of a 3-bit Base Register address with a 15-bit offset (bit 29 = 1).

The instruction format with bit 29 set to 1 is:

* B is the base register field
* Y is the address field (15 bits), addressing 32KW
* OP is the opcode (9 bits), the additional bit 27 is the &quot;opcode extension bit&quot;.
* I is the interrupt inhibit bit.
* Tag indicates the type of address modification to be performed; some additional tags are supported by the GE 645.

The GE 645 had 8 Address Base Registers (abr&#x27;s), these could operate in either &quot;paired&quot; or &quot;unpaired&quot; modes. The later Honeywell 6180 changed these to 8 pointer registers. Each abr was 24-bits wide consisting of 18 bits for an address and 6 bits for control functions.

One bit of the control functions field indicates where an abr is &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;external&quot;. If an abr is internal, another 3-bit subfield of the control functions field specifies another abr with which this abr is paired; that other abr is external, with the external abr containing a segment number in the address field and the internal abr containing an offset within the segment specified by the external abr. If an instruction or an indirect word refers to an external abr, the address field in the instruction or indirect word is used as an offset in the segment specified by the external abr. If it refers to an internal abr, the address field in the instruction or indirect word is added to the offset in the abr, and the resulting value is used as an offset in the segment specified by the external abr with which the internal abr is paired.

The registers have the following formats depending on how bit 21 is set.

Format as an &quot;external&quot; base, with bit 21 set:

Format as a component to the effective &quot;internal&quot; address with a pointer to an &quot;external&quot; base, with bit 21 clear:
* PDW is the Pointer to a descriptor word 
* PY is the component P of the effective internal address &#x27;Y&#x27;
* PB is pointer to another base register whose bit 21 = 1
In Multics, an even-numbered abr and the following odd-numbered abr were paired. When writing in Assembly (EPLBSA/ALM) the standard Multics practice was to label these registers as follows:
* ap for abr 0
* ab for abr 1
* bp for abr 2
* bb for abr 3
* lp for abr 4
* lb for abr 5
* sp for abr 6
* sb for abr 7

The naming scheme is based around the following:
* a for argument-list pointer
* b for general base
* l for linkage-segment pointer
* s for stack-segment pointer

The 8 pointer registers in the Honeywell 6180 and its successors served the same purpose as the 4 paired base registers in the GE-645, referring to an offset within a segment.

==History==
CTSS had originated in the MIT Computation Center using a IBM 709 and was first demonstrated in November 1961, it was subsequently upgraded to a 7090 in 1962, and finally to a 7094 in 1963. This required modification to these standard systems via the addition of a number of RPQ&#x27;s which among others added two banks of memory and bank-switching between user and supervisor mode, i.e. programs running in the A-core memory bank had access to instructions that programs running in the B-core bank did not.

Project MAC formally began with signing of contract with ARPA on the 1st of July 1963. By October 1963 they had received a dedicated 7094 to run CTSS under, this was termed the &quot;Red Machine&quot; due to it having red side panels. This would provide a time-sharing environment for Project MAC, and would subsequently be heavily used for the development of Multics. During this period exploratory work was carried out into what a replacement for CTSS would look like and what type of hardware it would require to run on. A committee was formed consisting of Fernando J. Corbató, Ted Glaser, Jack Dennis and Robert Graham with responsibility to visit computer manufacturers to gauge level of interest in the industry to tender for the hardware platform. It was made clear that Project MAC was looking for a development partner given the considerable hardware modifications that would be required to meet their requirements, which were specified as:
# User Programs having read/write protection.
# That privileged instructions would not be accessible to end user programs
# At least the ability to address 256KW of memory directly.
# Native multiprocessing capability with all processors been of equivalent functional level
# Effective support for telecommunications which could handle both conventional telephone lines as well as high speed data links that could run graphic display terminals such as the MIT-developed Kludge graphical terminal.
# Mass storage units, including a fast drum that could be used as a paging device.
# Hardware support for both segmentation and paging with support for a content addressable memory (CAM) so as to reduce virtual memory overhead.

They proceeded to visit among others Burroughs, CDC, DEC, General Electric, IBM and Sperry Univac. Of these GE and IBM showed the strongest interest. By the summer of 1964 proposals was received from DEC, IBM and GE, after evaluations by the Technical Committee a unanimous decision was made to accept the GE proposal for the GE 645 which was a design based on the GE 635 but modified to meet the requirements outlined above.

While the GE 645 hardware was being designed and debugged in Phoenix, a system was put in place where a GE 635 could be used to run a simulator known as the 6.36, so that development and checkout of Multics could occur in parallel. This process involved creating a tape on the CTSS system which would be inputted to GECOS on the 635 system in MIT so that it would run under the 6.36 simulator; the resulting output would be carried back via tape to CTSS for debugging/analysis. This simulated environment was replaced by the first 645 hardware in 1967. The GECOS operating system was fully replaced by Multics in 1969 with the Multics supervisor separated by protection rings with &quot;gates&quot; allowing access from user mode.

A later generation in the form of the 645F (F for follow-on) wasn&#x27;t completed by the time the division was sold to Honeywell, and became known as the Honeywell 6180. The original access control mechanism of the GE/Honeywell 645 were found inadequate for high speed trapping of access instructions and the re-implementation in the 6180 solved those problems. The bulk of these computers running time-sharing on Multics were installed at the NSA and similar governmental sites. Their usage was limited by the extreme security measures and had limited impact on subsequent systems, other than the protection ring.

The hardware protection introduced on this computer and modified on the 6180 was later implemented in the Intel 286 computer processor as a four-layer protection ring, but four rings was found to be too cumbersome to program and too slow to operate. Protection ring architecture is now used only to protect kernel mode from user mode code just as it was in the original use of the 645.

<text>A base unit of measurement (also referred to as a base unit or fundamental unit) is a unit of measurement adopted for a &quot;base quantity&quot;. A base quantity is one of a conventionally chosen subset of physical quantities, where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the others. The SI base units, or &quot;Systéme International d&#x27;unités&quot;, consists of the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela.

A unit multiple (or multiple of a unit) is an integer multiple of a given unit; likewise a unit submultiple (or submultiple of a unit) is a submultiple or a unit fraction of a given unit. 
&quot;Unit prefixes&quot; are common base-10 or base-2 powers multiples and submultiples of units.

While a base unit is one that has been explicitly so designated, 
a derived unit is unit for a &quot;derived quantity&quot;, involving the combination of quantities with different units; several &quot;SI derived units&quot; are specially named.
A &quot;coherent derived unit&quot; involves no conversion factors.

== Background ==
In the language of measurement, &quot;physical quantities&quot; are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, temperature, energy, and weight, and &quot;units&quot; are used to describe their magnitude or quantity. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of a quantities can be generally be expressed as a product of powers of other units; for example, momentum is mass multiplied by velocity, while velocity is distance divided by time. These relationships are discussed in dimensional analysis. Those that can be expressed in this fashion in terms of the base units are called derived units.

== International System of Units ==

In the International System of Units (SI), there are seven base units: kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole.
Several derived units have been defined, many with special names and symbols.

In 2019 the seven SI base units were redefined in terms of seven defining constants. Therefore the SI base units are no longer necessary but were retained because for historical and practical reasons. See &quot;2019 revision of the SI&quot;.

== Natural units ==

A set of base dimensions of quantity is a minimal set of units such that every physical quantity can be expressed in terms of this set. The traditional base dimensions are mass, length, time, charge, and temperature, but in principle, other base quantities could be used. Electric current could be used instead of charge or speed could be used instead of length. Some physicists have not recognized temperature as a base dimension since it simply expresses the energy per particle per degree of freedom which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Duff argues that only dimensionless values have physical meaning and all dimensional units are human constructs.

There are other relationships between physical quantities that can be expressed by means of fundamental constants, and to some extent it is an arbitrary decision whether to retain the fundamental constant as a quantity with dimensions or simply to define it as unity or a fixed dimensionless number, and reduce the number of explicit base quantities by one. The ontological issue is whether these fundamental constants really exist as dimensional or dimensionless quantities. This is equivalent to treating length as the same as time or understanding electric charge as a combination of quantities of mass, length, and time which may seem less natural than thinking of temperature as measuring the same material as energy (which is expressible in terms of mass, length, and time).

For instance, time and distance are related to each other by the speed of light, &quot;c&quot;, which is a fundamental constant. It is possible to use this relationship to eliminate either the base unit of time or that of distance. Similar considerations apply to the Planck constant, &quot;h&quot;, which relates energy (with dimension expressible in terms of mass, length and time) to frequency (with dimension expressible in terms of time). In theoretical physics it is customary to use such units (natural units) in which and . A similar choice can be applied to the vacuum permittivity, &quot;ε&quot;0.
* One could eliminate either the metre or the second by setting &quot;c&quot; to unity (or to any other fixed dimensionless number).
* One could then eliminate the kilogram by setting &quot;ħ&quot; to a dimensionless number.
* One could eliminate the ampere by setting either the vacuum permittivity &quot;ε&quot;0 or the elementary charge &quot;e&quot; to a dimensionless number.
* One could eliminate the mole as a base unit by setting the Avogadro constant &quot;N&quot; to 1. This is natural as it is a technical scaling constant.
* One could eliminate the kelvin as it can be argued that temperature simply expresses the energy per particle per degree of freedom, which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Another way of saying this is that the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;B is a technical scaling constant and could be set to a fixed dimensionless number.
* Similarly, one could eliminate the candela, as that is defined in terms of other physical quantities via a technical scaling constant, &quot;K&quot;.
* That leaves one base dimension and an associated base unit, but there are several fundamental constants left to eliminate that too – for instance, one could use &quot;G&quot;, the gravitational constant, &quot;m&quot;e, the electron rest mass, or Λ, the cosmological constant.

The preferred choices vary by the field in physics. Using natural units leaves every physical quantity expressed as a dimensionless number, which is noted by physicists disputing the existence of incompatible base quantities.

<text>Monarchianism is a doctrine that emphasizes God as one indivisible being, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism, which defines the Godhead as three co-eternal, consubstantial, co-immanent, and equally divine hypostases.

==History==
During the patristic period, Christian theologians attempted to clarify the relationship between the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Monarchianism developed in the 2nd century and persisted further into the 3rd century. &quot;Monarchianism&quot; (from the Greek &quot;monarkhia&quot;, meaning &quot;ruling of one,&quot; and &quot;-ismos&quot;, meaning &quot;practice or teaching&quot;) stresses the absolute, uncompromising unity of God in contrast to the doctrine of the Trinity, which is often lambasted as veiled tritheism by nontrinitarian Christians and other monotheists. 

Monarchians were opposed by Logos theologians (Tertullian, Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen of Alexandria). The Trinitarian view gained prominence and was adopted at the First Council of Constantinople in 381. Monarchianism was considered a heresy after the 4th century.

==Types==

Two types of monarchianism were propounded. Adoptionism (or &quot;dynamic monarchianism&quot; or &quot;Dynamism&quot;) holds that God is one being, above all else, wholly indivisible, and of one nature. It holds that the Son was not co-eternal with the Father and that Jesus Christ was essentially granted godhood (adopted) for the plans of God and for his own perfect life and works. Different variations of Dynamism hold that Jesus was &quot;adopted&quot; either at the time of his baptism or his ascension. Notable adherents included Artemon, Beryllus of Bostra, a third-century bishop who debated with Origen, Paul of Samosata, a bishop of Antioch, and Theodotus of Byzantium.

Modalistic monarchianism (or Modalism) considers God to be one, who appears and works through the different &quot;modes&quot; of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Following this view, all of the Godhead is understood to dwell in the person of Jesus from the incarnation. The terms &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; are then used to describe the distinction between the &quot;transcendence&quot; of God and the incarnation. Lastly, since God is understood as a Spirit in the context of the Gospel of John, it is held that the Holy Spirit should not be understood as a separate entity but rather as a mere descriptor of God&#x27;s action. Notable adherents included Noetus, Praxeas, and Sabellius, hence why the view is commonly called Sabellianism. Nevertheless, Sabellius&#x27;s writings did not survive and so the little that is known about his beliefs is from secondary sources.

The name &quot;Monarchian&quot; properly does not strictly apply to the Adoptionists, or Dynamists, as they (the latter) &quot;did not start from the monarchy of God, and their doctrine is strictly Christological&quot;.

<text>The Honeywell 6000 series computers were rebadged versions of General Electric&#x27;s 600-series mainframes manufactured by Honeywell International, Inc. from 1970 to 1989. Honeywell acquired the line when it purchased GE&#x27;s computer division in 1970 and continued to develop them under a variety of names for many years. In 1989, Honeywell sold its computer division to the French company Groupe Bull who continued to market compatible machines.

==Models==
The high-end model was the 6080, with performance approximately 1 MIPS. Smaller models were the 6070, 6060, 6050, 6040, and 6030. In 1973, a low-end 6025 was introduced. The models with an even number as the next-to-last digit of the model number included an &quot;Enhanced Instruction Set&quot; feature (EIS), which added decimal arithmetic and storage-to-storage operations to the original word-oriented architecture.

In 1973, Honeywell introduced the 6180, a 6000-series machine with addressing modifications to support the Multics operating system. In 1974, Honeywell released the 68/80 which added cache memory in each processor and support for a large (2-8 million word) directly addressable memory. In 1975, the 6000-series systems were renamed as &quot;Level 66&quot;, which were slightly faster (to 1.2 MIPS) and offered larger memories. In 1977, the line was again renamed 66/DPS, and in 1979 to DPS-8, again with a small performance improvement to 1.7 MIPS. The Multics model was the DPS-8/M.

==Hardware==
6000-series systems were said to be &quot;memory oriented&quot; — a &quot;system controller&quot; in each memory module arbitrated requests from other system components (processors, etc.). Memory modules contained 128 K words of 1.2 μs 36-bit words; a system could support one or two memory modules for a maximum of 256 K words (1 MB of 9-bit bytes). Each module provided two-way interleaved memory.

Devices called &quot;Input/Output Multiplexers (IOMs)&quot; served as intelligent I/O controllers for communication with most peripherals. The IOM supported two different types of peripheral channels: &quot;Common Peripheral Channels&quot; could handle data transfer rates up to 650,000 cps; &quot;Peripheral Subsystem Interface Channels&quot; allowed transfers up to 1.3 million cps.

The 6000 supported multiple processors and IOMs. Each processor and IOM had four ports for connection to memory; each memory module had eight ports for communication with other system components, with an interrupt cell for each port.

Memory protection and relocation was accomplished using a base and bounds register in the processor, the &quot;Base Address Register (BAR)&quot;. The IOM was passed the contents of the BAR for each I/O request, allowing it to use virtual rather than physical addresses.

A variety of communications controllers could also be used with the system. The older DATANET-30 and the DATANET 305— intended for smaller systems with up to twelve terminals attached to an IOM. The DATANET 355 processor attached directly to the system controller in a memory module and was capable of supporting up to 200 terminals.

==CPU==
The CPU operates on 36-bit words, and addresses are 18 bits. The &quot;Accumulator Register&quot; (AQ) was 72 bits, or could be accessed separately as two 36-bit registers (A and Q) or four 18-bit registers (AU, AL, QU, QL). An eight-bit &quot;Exponent Register&quot; contained the exponent for floating point operations (the mantissa was in AQ). There were eight eighteen-bit index registers X0 through X7.

The 18-bit &quot;Base Address Register&quot; (BAR) contains the base address and number of 1024-word blocks assigned to the program (the 6180 used segmentation rather than the BAR). The system also includes several special-purpose registers: an 18-bit &quot;Instruction Counter&quot; (IC) and a 27-bit &quot;Timer Register&quot; (TR) with a resolution of 2 μs. Sets of special registers are used for fault detection and debugging.

The EIS instruction set adds eight additional 24-bit registers AR0 through AR7. These registers contain an 18-bit word address, a 2-bit address of a character within the word, and a 4-bit address of a bit within the character.
===Instruction formats===
The 6000-series machine&#x27;s basic instruction set has more than 185 single-address one-word instructions. The basic instructions are one word; the instruction format is an extension of that of the GE-600 series, with the opcode field extended to 10 bits by adding bit 27 as the low-order bit; that bit is zero in all GE-600 series instructions.

The format for basic and one-word EIS instructions is:
* Y is the address field (18 bits).
* OP is the opcode (10 bits).
* I is the interrupt inhibit bit.
* Tag indicates the type of address modification to be performed (6 bits); some tags not supported in the GE-600 series are supported by the 6000 series.

EIS instructions longer than one word are two-word to four-word instructions depending on the specific instruction. The addresses point either to operands or to &quot;operand descriptors&quot;, which contain the actual operand address and additional information. The format of those instructions is:

* Variable field contains information relating to the specific instruction (18 bits).
* OP is the EIS opcode (10 bits).
* I is the interrupt inhibit bit.
* MF1 describes the address modification to be performed for descriptor 1 (6 bits). If operands 2 and 3 are present the variable field contains MF2 and MF3.

===Data formats===
Data is stored in big-endian format. Bits are numbered starting from 0 (most-significant) to 35 or 71 (least-significant).

*Binary fixed-point data is stored in twos-complement. Half-word (18-bits), word (36-bits) and double-word (72-bits) operands are supported. Multiply and divide instructions are provided which treat the operand as a binary fraction rather than an integer.
*Binary floating-point data can be single precision (36 bits) or double precision (72 bits). In either case the exponent is eight bits, twos-complement binary. The mantissa is either 28 or 64 bits, twos-complement binary.
*Character data is either 6-bit BCD or 9-bit ASCII.

==Peripherals==
The following peripherals were available for the 6000-Series machines in 1971.

* Control console, attached to the IOM, was a printer-keyboard that operated at 15 characters per second (cps).
* DSS180 removable disk storage subsystem provided up to 18 drives using disks physically compatible with IBM 2316 disks used in the 2314. The disks were formatted to provide 384 six-bit characters per sector and 27,648,000 characters per pack. The average seek time was 34 milliseconds (ms) and data transfer rate was 416,000 cps.
* DSS190 removable disk storage subsystem provided up to 16 drives using disks compatible with the IBM 3336-11 disk packs used in 3330-11 drives. The disks were formatted with variable-length sectors in multiples of 384 characters. One pack could hold up to 133,320,000 characters. The average access time was 30 ms and data transfer rate was 1,074,000 cps.
* DSS270 disk storage subsystem provided up to 20 modules of head-per-track disk. Capacity per module was 15.3 million characters. Average access time was 26 ms, and maximum transfer rate was 333,000 cps.
* DSS167 disk storage subsystem allowed up to eight online disk drives plus an offline spare. Per disk capacity was 15 million characters; average access time was 87.5 ms and data transfer rate was 208,000 cps.
* DSS170 removable disk storage subsystem allowed up to eight online disk drives plus an offline spare. Per disk capacity was 27.5 million characters; average access time was 72.5 ms and data transfer rate was 416,000 cps.
* Magnetic tape was available in a variety of models, all using open-reel ½ inch magnetic tape. Various models could read and write seven-track or nine-track tape with densities from 200 bits per inch (bpi) to 1600 bpi at rates of 37.5 inches per second (ips) to 150 ips. The maximum transfer rate was 266 characters per second (cps). All models connected to the system through the IOM.
* Line printers were the PRT300 train printer capable of printing at 1150 lines per minute (lpm) and the PRT201 at 1200 lpm.
* Punched card equipment consisted of the CRZ201 card reader capable of reading up to 900 80-column cards per minute (cpm) and the CPZ201 card punch which could punch up to 300 80-column cards per minute.

==Software==
The primary operating system for the line was the General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS), which Honeywell originally inherited from General Electric&#x27;s GECOS. In 1978 Honeywell introduced a rewritten version GCOS 8, which supported virtual memory. The Multics OS also ran on selected CPU models.

In 1974, Honeywell purchased Xerox Data Systems (XDS), and developed a work-alike of the Xerox operating system CP-V as CP-6 to run on DPS-8 systems in order to retain Xerox&#x27; loyal customer base.

<text>The GE-600 series is a family of 36-bit mainframe computers originating in the 1960s, built by General Electric (GE). When GE left the mainframe business, the line was sold to Honeywell, which built similar systems into the 1990s as the division moved to Groupe Bull and then NEC.

The system is perhaps best known as the hardware used by the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) and the Multics operating system. Multics was supported by virtual memory additions made in the GE 645.

==Architecture==
The 600-series CPU operates on 36-bit words, and addresses are 18 bits. The &quot;accumulator Register&quot; (AQ) is a 72-bit register that can also be accessed separately as two 36-bit registers (A and Q) or four 18-bit registers (AU,AL,QU,QL). An eight-bit &quot;Exponent Register&quot; contain the exponent for floating-point operations (the mantissa is in AQ). There are eight eighteen-bit index registers X0 through X7.

The 18-bit &quot;Base Address Register&quot; (BAR) contains the base address and number of 1024-word blocks assigned to the program. The system also includes several special-purpose registers: an 18-bit &quot;Instruction Counter&quot; (IC) and a 24-bit &quot;Timer Register&quot; (TR) with a resolution of 15.625 μs.

===Instruction formats===
The 600-series machine instructions are one word long. Operand addresses point either to operands or to &quot;indirect words&quot;, which contain the actual operand address and additional information.

Most instructions have the following format:

* Y is the address field (18 bits).
* OP is the opcode (9 bits).
* I is the interrupt inhibit bit.
* Tag indicates the type of address modification to be performed.

The Repeat, Repeat Double, and Repeat Link instructions have a different format.

===Addressing modes===
The 600 series has an elaborate set of addressing modes, many of which use indirect words, some of which are auto-incrementing or auto-decrementing. Multiple levels of indirect addressing are supported. Indirect addresses have the same format as instructions, and the address modification indicated by the tag field of the indirect address are performed at each level.

The tag field of the instruction consist of a 2-bit &quot;tag modifier&quot; (tm) and a 4-bit &quot;tag designator&quot; (td). The tag modifier indicates the type of modification to be performed on the instruction address:
* Register (R): Add the address field (Y) to the contents of the register indicated by the tag designator. 
* Register then indirect (RI): Perform the address modification as in Register modification, use the word at the effective address as an indirect address of the operand.
* Indirect then register (IR): Obtain the indirect word from the address specified by Y, and perform the modification requested by the tag field of the indirect word. This may result in multiple levels of indirection. Perform the address modification specified by the instruction on the last indirect word encountered.
* Indirect then tally (IT): Obtain the indirect word from the address specified by Y, then use the address in the indirect word as the effective address. Bits 30-35 of the indirect word contained a &quot;tally&quot; field which could be used for addressing characters within a word.

For modification types R, RI, and IR the tag designator contains a register to be used for indexing (X0-X7,AU,AL,QU,QL,IC). Other TD values indicate that Y should be used as an immediate operand. Direct addressing is a special case where Y is used as the operand address with no modification.

For modification type IT, the indirect word contains an 18-bit address, a 12-bit tally, and a 6-bit tag. The tag designator indicates the operation to be performed, some of which increment the address and decrement the tally of the indirect word or decrement the address and increment the tally of the indirect word. The Character from Indirect and Sequence Character operations can be used to address 6-bit and 9-bit bytes; this supports extracting specific bytes, and incrementing the byte pointer, but not random access to bytes.

===Data formats===
Data was stored in big-endian format. Bits were numbered starting from 0 (most-significant) to 35 or 71 (least-significant).

*Binary fixed-point data was stored in twos-complement. Half-word (18-bits), word (36-bits) and double-word (72-bits) operands were supported. Multiply and divide instructions were provided which would treat the operand as a binary fraction rather than an integer.
*Binary floating-point data could be single precision (36 bits) or double precision (72 bits). In either case the exponent was eight bits, twos-complement binary. The mantissa was either 28 or 64 bits, twos-complement binary. Operands and results in the AQ and E registers have up to 72 bis of mantissa.
*Character data was either 6-bit BCD or 9-bit ASCII.

===I/O===
The 600-series also included a number of channel controllers for handling I/O. The CPU could hand off short programs written in the channel controller&#x27;s own machine language, which would then process the data, move it to or from the memory, and raise an interrupt when they completed. This allowed the main CPU to move on to other tasks while waiting for the slow I/O to complete, a primary feature of time sharing systems.

==Operating systems==
Originally the operating system for the 600-series computers was GECOS, developed by GE beginning in 1962. GECOS was initially a batch processing system, but later added many features seen on more modern systems, including multitasking and multi-user support.

Between 1963 and 1964, GE worked with Dartmouth College on their Dartmouth BASIC project, which also led to the development of a new timesharing system to support it on the GE-235. This was a great success and led to a late 1967 proposal for an improved version of the system running on the 635. The first version, known to Dartmouth as &quot;Phase I&quot; and GE as &quot;Mark II&quot;, the original on the GE-235 becoming &quot;Mark I&quot;, was a similar success. &quot;Phase II&quot; at Dartmouth was released as the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), while GE further developed Mark II into the improved Mark III.

The Computer History Museum&#x27;s Corporate Histories Collection describes GE&#x27;s Mark I history this way:
:The precursor of General Electric Information Services began as a business unit within General Electric formed to sell excess computer time on the computers used to give customer demos. In 1965, Warner Sinback recommended that they begin to sell time-sharing services using the time-sharing system (Mark 1) developed at Dartmouth on a General Electric 265 computer. The service was an instant success and by 1968, GEIS had 40% of the $ 70 million time-sharing market. The service continued to grow, and over time migrated to the GE developed Mark II and Mark III operating systems running on large mainframe computers.

The GE Mark II operating system (later Mark III) was used by GE Information Services as the basis for its timesharing and networked computing business. Although Mark II / Mark III was originally based on the Dartmouth system, the systems quickly diverged. Mark II/III incorporated many features normally associated with on-line transaction-processing systems, such as journalization and granular file locking. In the early-to-mid-1970s, Mark III adopted a high-reliability cluster technology, in which up to eight processing systems (each with its own copy of the operating system) had access to multiple file systems.

The Multics operating system was begun in 1964 as an advanced new operating system for the 600 series, though it was not production-ready until 1969. GE supplied the hardware to the project and was one of the development partners (the others were Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bell Labs). GE saw this project as an opportunity to clearly separate themselves from other vendors by offering this advanced OS which would run best only on their machines. Multics required a number of additional features in the CPU to be truly effective, and John Couleur was joined by Edward Glaser at MIT to make the required modifications. The result was the GE 645, which included support for virtual memory. Addressing was modified to use an 18-bit &quot;segment&quot; in addition to the 18-bit address, dramatically increasing the theoretical memory size and making virtual memory much easier to support.

==History==
The GE-600 line of computers was developed by a team led by John Couleur out of work they had done for the military MISTRAM project in 1959. MISTRAM was a radar tracking system that was used on a number of projects, including Project Apollo. The Air Force required a data-collection computer to be installed in a tracking station downrange from Cape Canaveral. The data would eventually be shared with the 36-bit IBM 7094 machine at the Cape, so the computer would likely have to be 36-bits as well. GE built a machine called the M236 for the task, and as a result of the 36-bit needs, it ended up acting much like the 7094.

GE originally had not intended to enter the commercial computer market with their own machine. However, by the early 1960s GE was the largest user of IBM mainframes, and producing their own machines seemed like an excellent way to lower the costs of their computing department. In one estimate, the cost of development would be paid for in a single year free of IBM rental fees. Many remained skeptical, but after a year of internal wrangling, the project to commercialize the M236 eventually got the go-ahead in February 1963.

The machine was originally offered as the main GE-635, and the slower but compatible GE-625 and GE-615. While most were single-processor systems, the 635 could be configured with four CPUs and up to four input/output controllers (IOC&#x27;s) each with up to 16 Common Peripheral Interface Channels. The 635 was likely the first example of a general purpose SMP system, though the GECOS/GCOS software treated the processors as a master and up to three slaves.

In August 1964, IBM considered the GE 600 series to be &quot;severe competition in the medium and large-scale scientific areas&quot;. In May 1965 the first GE-625 computer was delivered to the GE Schenectady plant to replace five other computers of various sizes and makes. A number of GE 635&#x27;s were shipped during 1965 including two to Martin Marietta in November.

The 600 line consisted of six models: the 605, 615, 625, 635, 645, and 655. GE offered a box to connect to the 635 called a 9SA that allowed the 635 to run 7094 programs.

The 615 was a 635 with Control Unit (CU) and Operations Unit (OU) overlap disabled, and a 36-bit-wide memory path. The 625 was a 635 with Control Unit and Operations Unit overlap disabled and 72-bit-wide memory path. The 635 had a 72-bit-wide memory path and CU/OU overlap enabled. The difference between these models was fewer than 10 wires on the backplane. Field service could convert a 615 to a 635 or 625 or vice versa in a couple of hours if necessary; other than those few wires, the 615, 625 and 635 were identical. The 605 was used in some realtime/military applications and was essentially a 615 without the floating point hardware. Programs coded for a 605 would run without any modification on any other 600 line processor. The 645 was a modified 635 processor that provided hardware support for the Multics operating system developed at MIT. 

The 605/615/625/635 and 645 were essentially second generation computers with discrete transistor TTL logic and a handful of integrated circuits. Memory consisted of a two-microsecond ferrite core, which could be interleaved. GE bought core memory from Fabri-Tek, Ampex and Lockheed. The Lockheed memory tended to be the most reliable.

Continuing problems with the reliability of the magnetic tape systems used with the system cast a pall over the entire project. In 1966 GE withdrew the 600 series from active marketing, there was also widespread redundancies in the Phoenix operation, the issues with the 600 series damaged GE&#x27;s reputation in the computer industry and resulted in the outright cancellations of a number of orders placed for it. By 1967 these problems were cleared up, and the machines were re-launched along with an upgraded version of the GECOS operating system.

A follow-on project to create a next-generation 635 started in 1967. The new GE-655 replaced the individual transistors from the earlier models with integrated circuits, which doubled the performance of the machine while also greatly reducing assembly costs. However, the machine was still in development in 1969, and was announced but probably never delivered under that name.

By that time the Multics project had finally produced an operating system usable by end-users. Besides MIT, Bell Labs, and GE, GE-645 systems running Multics were installed at the US Air Force Rome Development Center, Honeywell Billerica, and Machines Bull in Paris. These last two systems were used as a &quot;software factory&quot; by a Honeywell/Bull project to design the Honeywell Level 64 computer.

GE sold its computer division to Honeywell in 1970, who renamed the GE-600 series as the Honeywell 6000 series. The 655 was officially released in 1973 as the Honeywell 6070 (with reduced performance versions, the 6030 and 6050). An optional Decimal/Business instruction set was added to improve COBOL performance. This was the Extended Instruction Set, also known as EIS, and the Decimal Unit or DU. The machines with EIS were the &#x27;even&#x27; series, the 6040, 6060, 6080 and later the 6025. Several hundred of these processors were sold. Memory was initially 600 ns ferrite core made by Lockheed. Later versions used 750 ns MOS memory. The two could co-exist within a system, but not within a memory controller.

A version of the 6080 with the various Multics-related changes similar to the 645 was released as the 6180. A few dozen 6180-architecture CPUs were shipped. Later members of the 6000 series were released under various names, including Level 66, Level 68, DPS-8, DPS-88, DPS-90, DPS-9000 by Honeywell, Groupe Bull, and NEC.

<text>Year 401 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Potitus, Cossus, Camillus, Ambustus, Mamercinus and Iullus (or, less frequently, year 353 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 401 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian empire ====
* Cyrus the Younger uses a quarrel with Tissaphernes over the Ionian cities as a pretext for gathering a large army and also pretends to prepare an expedition to Pisidia, in the Taurus Mountains. Cyrus starts out with about 15,220 men, of whom 10,400 are Greek mercenaries. When he reaches the Euphrates River at Thapsacus, he announces that he is marching against Artaxerxes II. He advances unopposed into Babylonia; but Artaxerxes, warned at the last moment by Tissaphernes, hastily gathers an army. The two forces meet in the Battle of Cunaxa, north of Babylon, where Cyrus is slain.

==== Greece ====
* The Greek mercenaries fighting for Cyrus are left stranded after Cyrus&#x27; defeat. They fight their way north through hostile Persians, Armenians, and Kurds to Trapezus on the coast of the Black Sea under Xenophon, who becomes their leader when the satrap of Lydia, Tissaphernes, has Clearchus of Sparta and the other senior Greek captains captured and executed.
* Agesilaus II becomes king of Sparta on the death of his stepbrother Agis II.

==== China ====
* Zhou an wang becomes king of the Zhou dynasty of China.

=== By topic ===

==== Literature ====
* Sophocles&#x27; tragic play &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; is performed posthumously. It is produced by his grandson (also called Sophocles) at the Festival of Dionysus in Athens.

<text>The CDC 6600 was the flagship of the 6000 series of mainframe computer systems manufactured by Control Data Corporation. Generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, it outperformed the industry&#x27;s prior recordholder, the IBM 7030 Stretch, by a factor of three. With performance of up to three megaFLOPS, the CDC 6600 was the world&#x27;s fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600.

The first CDC 6600s were delivered in 1965 to Livermore and Los Alamos. They quickly became a must-have system in high-end scientific and mathematical computing, with systems being delivered to Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, CERN, the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, and many others. At least 100 were delivered in total.

A CDC 6600 is on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The only running CDC 6000 series machine has been restored by Living Computers: Museum + Labs.

==History and impact==

CDC&#x27;s first products were based on the machines designed at Engineering Research Associates (ERA), which Seymour Cray had been asked to update after moving to CDC. After an experimental machine known as the &quot;Little Character&quot;, in 1960 they delivered the CDC 1604, one of the first commercial transistor-based computers, and one of the fastest machines on the market. Management was delighted, and made plans for a new series of machines that were more tailored to business use; they would include instructions for character handling and record keeping for instance. Cray was not interested in such a project and set himself the goal of producing a new machine that would be 50 times faster than the 1604. When asked to complete a detailed report on plans at one and five years into the future, he wrote back that his five-year goal was &quot;to produce the largest computer in the world&quot;, &quot;largest&quot; at that time being synonymous with &quot;fastest&quot;, and that his one-year plan was &quot;to be one-fifth of the way&quot;.

Taking his core team to new offices near the original CDC headquarters, they started to experiment with higher quality versions of the &quot;cheap&quot; transistors Cray had used in the 1604. After much experimentation, they found that there was simply no way the germanium-based transistors could be run much faster than those used in the 1604. The &quot;business machine&quot; that management had originally wanted, now forming as the CDC 3000 series, pushed them about as far as they could go. Cray then decided the solution was to work with the then-new silicon-based transistors from Fairchild Semiconductor, which were just coming onto the market and offered dramatically improved switching performance.

During this period, CDC grew from a startup to a large company and Cray became increasingly frustrated with what he saw as ridiculous management requirements. Things became considerably more tense in 1962 when the new CDC 3600 started to near production quality, and appeared to be exactly what management wanted, when they wanted it. Cray eventually told CDC&#x27;s CEO, William Norris that something had to change, or he would leave the company. Norris felt he was too important to lose, and gave Cray the green light to set up a new laboratory wherever he wanted.

After a short search, Cray decided to return to his home town of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where he purchased a block of land and started up a new laboratory.

Although this process introduced a fairly lengthy delay in the design of his new machine, once in the new laboratory, without management interference, things started to progress quickly. By this time, the new transistors were becoming quite reliable, and modules built with them tended to work properly on the first try. The 6600 began to take form, with Cray working alongside Jim Thornton, system architect and &quot;hidden genius&quot; of the 6600.

More than 100 CDC 6600s were sold over the machine&#x27;s lifetime (1964 to 1969). Many of these went to various nuclear weapon-related laboratories, and quite a few found their way into university computing laboratories. A CDC 6600 was used to disprove Euler&#x27;s sum of powers conjecture in an early example of direct numerical search.

Cray immediately turned his attention to its replacement, this time setting a goal of ten times the performance of the 6600, delivered as the CDC 7600. The later CDC Cyber 70 and 170 computers were very similar to the CDC 6600 in overall design and were nearly completely backwards compatible.

The 6600 was three times faster than the previous record-holder, the IBM 7030 Stretch; this alarmed IBM. Then-CEO Thomas Watson Jr. wrote a memo to his employees on August 28, 1963: &quot;Last week, Control Data ... announced the 6600 system. I understand that in the laboratory developing the system there are only 34 people including the janitor. Of these, 14 are engineers and 4 are programmers ... Contrasting this modest effort with our vast development activities, I fail to understand why we have lost our industry leadership position by letting someone else offer the world&#x27;s most powerful computer.&quot; Cray&#x27;s reply was sardonic: &quot;It seems like Mr. Watson has answered his own question.&quot;

==Description==
Typical machines of the 1950s and 1960s used a single central processing unit (CPU) to drive the entire system. A typical program would first load data into memory (often using pre-rolled library code), process it, and then write it back out. This required the CPUs to be fairly complex in order to handle the complete set of instructions they would be called on to perform. A complex CPU implied a large CPU, introducing signalling delays while information flowed between the individual modules making it up. These delays set a maximum upper limit on performance, as the machine could only operate at a cycle speed that allowed the signals time to arrive at the next module.

Cray took another approach. In the 1960s, CPUs generally ran slower than the main memory to which they were attached. For instance, a processor might take 15 cycles to multiply two numbers, while each memory access took only one or two cycles. This meant there was a significant time where the main memory was idle. It was this idle time that the 6600 exploited.

The CDC 6600 used a simplified central processor (CP) that was designed to run mathematical and logic operations as rapidly as possible, which demanded it be built as small as possible to reduce the length of wiring and the associated signalling delays. This led to the machine&#x27;s (typically) cross-shaped main chassis with the circuit boards for the CPU arranged close to the center, and resulted in a much smaller CPU. Combined with the faster switching speeds of the silicon transistors, the new CPU ran at 10 MHz (100 ns cycle time), about ten times faster than other machines on the market. In addition to the clock being faster, the simple processor executed instructions in fewer clock cycles; for instance, the CPU could complete a multiplication in ten cycles.

Supporting the CPU were ten 12-bit 4 KiB peripheral processors (PPs), each with access to a common pool of 12 input/output (I/O) channels, that handled input and output, as well as controlling what data were sent into central memory for processing by the CP. The PPs were designed to access memory during the times when the CPU was busy performing operations. This allowed them to perform input/output essentially for free in terms of central processing time, keeping the CPU busy as much as possible.

The 6600&#x27;s CP used a 60-bit word and a ones&#x27; complement representation of integers, something that later CDC machines would use into the late 1980s, making them the last systems besides some digital signal processors to use this architecture.

Later, CDC offered options as to the number and type of CPs, PPs and channels, e.g., the CDC 6700 had two central processors, a 6400 CP and a 6600 CP.

While other machines of its day had elaborate front panels to control them, the 6600 has only a &quot;dead start panel&quot;. There is a dual CRT system console, but it is controlled by the operating system and neither controls nor displays the hardware directly.

The entire 6600 machine contained approximately 400,000 transistors.

==Peripheral processors ==
The CPU could only execute a limited number of simple instructions. A typical CPU of the era had a complex instruction set, which included instructions to handle all the normal &quot;housekeeping&quot; tasks, such as memory access and input/output. Cray instead implemented these instructions in separate, simpler processors dedicated solely to these tasks, leaving the CPU with a much smaller instruction set. This was the first of what later came to be called reduced instruction set computer (RISC) design.

By allowing the CPU, peripheral processors (PPs) and I/O to operate in parallel, the design considerably improved the performance of the machine. Under normal conditions a machine with several processors would also cost a great deal more. Key to the 6600&#x27;s design was to make the I/O processors, known as &quot;peripheral processors&quot; (PPs), as simple as possible. The PPs were based on the simple 12-bit CDC 160-A, which ran much slower than the CPU, gathering up data and transmitting it as bursts into main memory at high speed via dedicated hardware.

The 10 PPs were implemented virtually; there was CPU hardware only for a single PP. This CPU hardware was shared and operated on 10 PP register sets which represented each of the 10 PP &quot;states&quot; (similar to modern multithreading processors). The PP &quot;register barrel&quot; would &quot;rotate&quot;, with each PP register set presented to the &quot;slot&quot; which the actual PP CPU occupied. The shared CPU would execute all or some portion of a PP&#x27;s instruction whereupon the barrel would &quot;rotate&quot; again, presenting the next PP&#x27;s register set (state). Multiple &quot;rotations&quot; of the barrel were needed to complete an instruction. A complete barrel &quot;rotation&quot; occurred in 1000 nanoseconds (100 nanoseconds per PP), and an instruction could take from one to five &quot;rotations&quot; of the barrel to be completed, or more if it was a data transfer instruction.

==Instruction-set architecture of CP==
The basis for the 6600 CPU is what would later be called a RISC system, one in which the processor is tuned to do instructions that are comparatively simple and have limited and well-defined access to memory. The philosophy of many other machines was toward using instructions which were complicated — for example, a single instruction which would fetch an operand from memory and add it to a value in a register. In the 6600, loading the value from memory would require one instruction, and adding it would require a second one. While slower in theory due to the additional memory accesses, the fact that in well-scheduled code, multiple instructions could be processing in parallel offloaded this expense. This simplification also forced programmers to be very aware of their memory accesses, and therefore code deliberately to reduce them as much as possible. The CDC 6600 CP, being a three-address machine, allows for the specification of all three operands.

===Models===
The CDC 6000 series included four basic models, the CDC 6400, the CDC 6500, the CDC 6600, and the CDC 6700. The models of the 6000 series differed only in their CPUs, which were of two kinds, the 6400 CPU and the 6600 CPU. The 6400 CPU had a unified arithmetic unit, rather than discrete &quot;functional units&quot;. As such, it could not overlap instructions&#x27; execution times. For example, in a 6400 CPU, if an add instruction immediately followed a multiply instruction, the add instruction could not be started until the multiply instruction finished, so the net execution time of the two instructions would be the sum of their individual execution times. The 6600 CPU had multiple functional units which could operate simultaneously, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;in parallel&quot;, allowing the CPU to overlap instructions&#x27; execution times. For example, a 6600 CPU could begin executing an add instruction in the next CPU cycle following the beginning of a multiply instruction (assuming, of course, that the result of the multiply instruction was not an operand of the add instruction), so the net execution time of the two instructions would simply be the (longer) execution time of the multiply instruction. The 6600 CPU also had an &quot;instruction stack&quot;, a kind of &quot;instruction cache&quot;, which helped increase CPU throughput by reducing the amount of CPU idle time caused by waiting for memory to respond to instruction fetch requests. The two kinds of CPUs were instruction compatible, so that a program that ran on either of the kinds of CPUs would run the same way on the other kind but would run faster on the 6600 CPU. Indeed, all models of the 6000 series were fully inter-compatible. The CDC 6400 had one CPU (a 6400 CPU), the CDC 6500 had two CPUs (both 6400 CPUs), the CDC 6600 had one CPU (a 6600 CPU), and the CDC 6700 had two CPUs (one 6600 CPU and one 6400 CPU).

===Central Processor (CP)===

The Central Processor (CP) and main memory of the 6400, 6500, and 6600 machines had a 60-bit word length. The Central Processor had eight general purpose 60-bit registers X0 through X7, eight 18-bit address registers A0 through A7, and eight 18-bit &quot;increment&quot; registers B0 through B7. B0 was held at zero permanently by the hardware. Many programmers found it useful to set B1 to 1, and similarly treat it as inviolate.

The CP had no instructions for input and output, which are accomplished through Peripheral Processors (below). No opcodes were specifically dedicated to loading or storing memory; this occurred as a side effect of assignment to certain A registers. Setting A1 through A5 loaded the word at that address into X1 through X5 respectively; setting A6 or A7 stored a word from X6 or X7. No side effects were associated with A0. A separate hardware load/store unit, called the &quot;stunt box&quot;, handled the actual data movement independently of the operation of the instruction stream, allowing other operations to complete while memory was being accessed, which required eight cycles, in the best case.

The 6600 CP included ten parallel functional units, allowing multiple instructions to be worked on at the same time. Today, this is known as a superscalar processor design, but it was unique for its time. Unlike most modern CPU designs, functional units were not pipelined; the functional unit would become busy when an instruction was &quot;issued&quot; to it and would remain busy for the entire time required to execute that instruction. (By contrast, the CDC 7600 introduced pipelining into its functional units.) In the best case, an instruction could be issued to a functional unit every 100 ns clock cycle. The system read and decoded instructions from memory as fast as possible, generally faster than they could be completed, and fed them off to the units for processing. The units were:
* floating point multiply (two copies)
* floating point divide
* floating point add
* &quot;long&quot; integer add
* incrementers (two copies; performed memory load/store)
* shift
* Boolean logic
* branch

Floating-point operations were given pride of place in this architecture: the CDC 6600 (and kin) stand virtually alone in being able to execute a 60-bit floating point multiplication in time comparable to that for a program branch.
A recent analysis by Mitch Alsup of James Thornton&#x27;s book, &quot;Design of a Computer&quot;,
revealed that the 6600&#x27;s Floating Point unit is a 2 stage pipelined design.

Fixed point addition and subtraction of 60-bit numbers were handled in the Long Add Unit, using ones&#x27; complement for negative numbers. Fixed point multiply was done as a special case in the floating-point multiply unit—if the exponent was zero, the FP unit would do a single-precision 48-bit floating-point multiply and clear the high exponent part, resulting in a 48-bit integer result. Integer divide was performed by a macro, converting to and from floating point.

Previously executed instructions were saved in an eight-word cache, called the &quot;stack&quot;. In-stack jumps were quicker than out-of-stack jumps because no memory fetch was required. The stack was flushed by an unconditional jump instruction, so unconditional jumps at the ends of loops were conventionally written as conditional jumps that would always succeed.

The system used a 10 MHz clock, with a four-phase signal. A floating-point multiplication took ten cycles, a division took 29, and the overall performance, taking into account memory delays and other issues, was about 3 MFLOPS. Using the best available compilers, late in the machine&#x27;s history, FORTRAN programs could expect to maintain about 0.5 MFLOPS.

===Memory organization===
User programs are restricted to use only a contiguous area of main memory. The portion of memory to which an executing program has access is controlled by the &quot;RA&quot; (Relative Address) and &quot;FL&quot; (Field Length) registers which are not accessible to the user program. When a user program tries to read or write a word in central memory at address &quot;a&quot;, the processor will first verify that a is between 0 and FL-1. If it is, the processor accesses the word in central memory at address RA+a. This process is known as base-bound relocation; each user program sees core memory as a contiguous block words with length FL, starting with address 0; in fact the program may be anywhere in the physical memory. Using this technique, each user program can be moved (&quot;relocated&quot;) in main memory by the operating system, as long as the RA register reflects its position in memory. A user program which attempts to access memory outside the allowed range (that is, with an address which is not less than FL) will trigger an interrupt, and will be terminated by the operating system. When this happens, the operating system may create a core dump which records the contents of the program&#x27;s memory and registers in a file, allowing the developer of the program a means to know what happened. Note the distinction with virtual memory systems; in this case, the entirety of a process&#x27;s addressable space must be in core memory, must be contiguous, and its size cannot be larger than the real memory capacity.

All but the first seven CDC 6000 series machines could be configured with an optional Extended Core Storage (ECS) system. ECS was built from a different variety of core memory than was used in the central memory. This memory was slower, but cheap enough that it could be much larger. The primary reason was that ECS memory was wired with only two wires per core (contrast with five for central memory). Because it performed very wide transfers, its sequential transfer rate was the same as that of the small core memory. A 6000 CPU could directly perform block memory transfers between a user&#x27;s program (or operating system) and the ECS unit. Wide data paths were used, so this was a very fast operation. Memory bounds were maintained in a similar manner as central memory, with an RA/FL mechanism maintained by the operating system. ECS could be used for a variety of purposes, including containing user data arrays that were too large for central memory, holding often-used files, swapping, and even as a communication path in a multi-mainframe complex.

===Peripheral Processors (PPs)===
To handle the &quot;housekeeping&quot; tasks, which in other designs were assigned to the CPU, Cray included ten other processors, based partly on his earlier computer, the CDC 160-A. These machines, called Peripheral Processors, or PPs, were full computers in their own right, but were tuned to performing I/O tasks and running the operating system. (Substantial parts of the operating system ran on the PP&#x27;s; thus leaving most of the power of the Central Processor available for user programs.) Only the PPs had access to the I/O channels. One of the PPs (PP0) was in overall control of the machine, including control of the program running on the main CPU, while the others would be dedicated to various I/O tasks; PP9 was dedicated to the system console. When the CP program needed to perform an operating system function, it would put a request in a known location (&quot;Reference Address&quot; + 1) monitored by PP0. If necessary, PP0 would assign another PP to load any necessary code and to handle the request. The PP would then clear RA+1 to inform the CP program that the task was complete.

The unique role of PP0 in controlling the machine was a potential single point of failure, in that a malfunction here could shut down the whole machine, even if the nine other PPs and the CPU were still functioning properly. Cray fixed this in the design of the successor 7600, when any of the PPs could be the controller, and the CPU could reassign any one to this role.

Each PP included its own memory of 4096 12-bit words. This memory served for both for I/O buffering and program storage, but the execution units were shared by ten PPs, in a configuration called the Barrel and slot. This meant that the execution units (the &quot;slot&quot;) would execute one instruction cycle from the first PP, then one instruction cycle from the second PP, etc. in a round robin fashion. This was done both to reduce costs, and because access to CP memory required 10 PP clock cycles: when a PP accesses CP memory, the data is available next time the PP receives its slot time.

====Central Processor access====
In addition to a conventional instruction set, the PPs have several instructions specifically intended to communicate with the central processor.
* codice_1 - transfers one 60-bit word from central memory at the address specified by the PPs &quot;A&quot; register to five consecutive PP words beginning at address &quot;d&quot;.
* codice_2 - similar to CRD, but transfers a block of words whose length was previously stored at location &quot;d&quot; into PP memory starting at PP address &quot;m&quot;.
* codice_3 - assembles five consecutive PP words beginning at location &quot;d&quot;, and transfers them to the central memory location specified by register &quot;A&quot;.
* codice_4 - transfers a block starting at PP memory address &quot;m&quot; to central memory. The central memory address was stored in register &quot;A&quot;, and the length was stored at location &quot;d&quot; prior to execution.
* codice_5 - transfers the contents of the central processor&#x27;s program address register to the PP&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; register.
* codice_6 - &quot;Exchange Jump&quot; transmits an address from the &quot;A&quot; register and tells the processor to perform an &quot;Exchange Jump&quot; using the address specified. The CP Exchange Jump interrupts the processor, loads its registers from the specified location and stores the previous contents at the same location. This performs a task switch.

===Wordlengths, characters===
The central processor has 60-bit words, while the peripheral processors have 12-bit words. CDC used the term &quot;byte&quot; to refer to 12-bit entities used by peripheral processors; characters are 6-bit, and central processor instructions are either 15 bits, or 30 bits with a signed 18-bit address field, the latter allowing for a directly addressable memory space of 128K words of central memory (converted to modern terms, with 8-bit bytes, this just under 1 MB). The signed nature of the address registers limits an individual program to 128K words. (Later CDC 6000-compatible machines could have 256K or more words of central memory, budget permitting, but individual user programs were still limited to 128K words of CM.) Central processor instructions start on a word boundary when they are the target of a jump statement or subroutine return jump instruction, so no-op instructions are sometimes required to fill out the last 15, 30 or 45 bits of a word. Experienced assembler programmers could fine-tune their programs by filling these &quot;no-op&quot; spaces with misc instructions that would be needed later in the program.

The 6-bit characters, in an encoding called CDC display code, could be used to store up to 10 characters in a word. They permitted a character set of 64 characters, which is enough for all upper case letters, digits, and some punctuation. It was certainly enough to write FORTRAN, or print financial or scientific reports. There were actually two variations of the CDC display code character sets in use — 64-character and 63-character. The 64-character set had the disadvantage that the &quot;:&quot; (colon) character would be ignored (interpreted as zero fill) if it were the last character in a word. A complementary variant, called 6/12 display code, was also used in the Kronos and NOS timesharing systems to allow full use of the ASCII character set in a manner somewhat compatible with older software.

With no byte addressing instructions at all, code had to be written to pack and shift characters into words. The very large words, and comparatively small amount of memory, meant that programmers would frequently economize on memory by packing data into words at the bit level.

Due to the large word size, and with 10 characters per word, it was often faster to process a word&#x27;s worth of characters at a time, rather than unpacking/processing/repacking them. For example, the CDC COBOL compiler was actually quite good at processing decimal fields using this technique. These sorts of techniques are now commonly used in the &quot;multi-media&quot; instructions of current processors.

===Physical design===
The machine was built in a plus-sign-shaped cabinet with a pump and heat exchanger in the outermost of each of the four arms. Cooling was done with Freon circulating within the machine and exchanging heat to an external chilled water supply. Each arm could hold four chassis, each about thick, hinged near the center, and opening a bit like a book. The intersection of the &quot;plus&quot; was filled with cables that interconnected the chassis. The chassis were numbered from 1 (containing all 10 PPUs and their memories, as well as the 12 rather minimal I/O channels) to 16. The main memory for the CPU was spread over many of the chassis. In a system with only 64K words of main memory, one of the arms of the &quot;plus&quot; was omitted.

The logic of the machine was packaged into modules about square and about thick. Each module had a connector (30 pins, two vertical rows of 15) on one edge, and six test points on the opposite edge. The module was placed between two aluminum cold plates to remove heat. The module consisted of two parallel printed circuit boards, with components mounted either on one of the boards or between the two boards. This provided a very dense package; generally impossible to repair, but with good heat transfer characteristics. It was known as cordwood construction.

==Operating system and programming==
There was a sore point with the 6600 operating system support — slipping timelines. The machines originally ran a very simple job-control system known as COS (Chippewa Operating System), which was quickly &quot;thrown together&quot; based on the earlier CDC 3000 operating system in order to have something running to test the systems for delivery. However the machines were intended to be delivered with a much more powerful system known as SIPROS (for Simultaneous Processing Operating System), which was being developed at the company&#x27;s System Sciences Division in Los Angeles. Customers were impressed with SIPROS&#x27; feature list, and many had SIPROS written into their delivery contracts.

SIPROS turned out to be a major fiasco. Development timelines continued to slip, costing CDC major amounts of profit in the form of delivery delay penalties. After several months of waiting with the machines ready to be shipped, the project was eventually cancelled. The programmers who had worked on COS had little faith in SIPROS and had continued working on improving COS.

Operating system development then split into two camps. The CDC-sanctioned evolution of COS was undertaken at the Sunnyvale, California software development laboratory. Many customers eventually took delivery of their systems with this software, then known as SCOPE (Supervisory Control Of Program Execution). SCOPE version 1 was, essentially, dis-assembled COS; SCOPE version 2 included new device and file system support; SCOPE version 3 included permanent file support, EI/200 remote batch support, and INTERCOM time-sharing support. SCOPE always had significant reliability and maintainability issues. 

The underground evolution of COS took place at the Arden Hills, Minnesota assembly plant. MACE ([Greg] Mansfield And [Dave] Cahlander Executive) was written largely by a single programmer in the off-hours when machines were available. Its feature set was essentially the same as COS and SCOPE 1. It retained the earlier COS file system, but made significant advances in code modularity to improve system reliability and adaptiveness to new storage devices. MACE was never an official product, although many customers were able to wrangle a copy from CDC.

The unofficial MACE software was later chosen over the official SCOPE product as the basis of the next CDC operating system, Kronos, named after the Greek god of time. The main marketing reason for its adoption was the development of its TELEX time-sharing feature and its BATCHIO remote batch feature. Kronos continued to use the COS/SCOPE 1 file system with the addition of a permanent file feature.

An attempt to unify the SCOPE and Kronos operating system products produced NOS, (Network Operating System). NOS was intended to be the sole operating system for all CDC machines, a fact CDC promoted heavily. Many SCOPE customers remained software-dependent on the SCOPE architecture, so CDC simply renamed it NOS/BE (Batch Environment), and were able to claim that everyone was thus running NOS. In practice, it was far easier to modify the Kronos code base to add SCOPE features than the reverse.

The assembly plant environment also produced other operating systems which were never intended for customer use. These included the engineering tools SMM for hardware testing, and KALEIDOSCOPE, for software smoke testing. Another commonly used tool for CDC Field Engineers during testing was MALET (Maintenance Application Language for Equipment Testing), which was used to stress test components and devices after repairs or servicing by engineers. Testing conditions often used hard disk packs and magnetic tapes which were deliberately marked with errors to determine if the errors would be detected by MALET and the engineer.

The names SCOPE and COMPASS were used by CDC for both the CDC 6000 series, including the 6600, and the CDC 3000 series:
* The name COMPASS was used by CDC for the Assembly languages on both families.
* The name SCOPE was used for its implementations on the 3000 and 6000 series.

==CDC 7600==

The CDC 7600 was originally intended to be fully compatible with the existing 6000-series machines as well; it started life known as the CDC 6800. But during its design, the designers determined that maintaining complete compatibility with the existing 6000-series machines would limit how much performance improvement they could attain and decided to sacrifice compatibility for performance. While the CDC 7600&#x27;s CPU was basically instruction compatible with the 6400 and 6600 CPUs, allowing code portability at the high-level language source code level, the CDC 7600&#x27;s hardware, especially that of its Peripheral Processor Units (PPUs), was quite different, and the CDC 7600 required a different operating system. This turned out to be somewhat serendipitous because it allowed the designers to improve on some of the characteristics of the 6000-series design, such as the latter&#x27;s complete dependence on Peripheral Processors (PPs), particularly the first (called PP0), to control operation of the entire computer system, including the CPU(s). Unlike the 6600 CPU, the CDC 7600&#x27;s CPU could control its own operation via a Central Exchange jump (XJ) instruction that swapped all register contents with core memory. In fact, the 6000-series machines were retrofitted with this capability.

<text>A gas turbine or gas turbine engine is a type of continuous flow internal combustion engine. The main parts common to all gas turbine engines form the power-producing part (known as the gas generator or core) and are, in the direction of flow:
* a rotating gas compressor
* a combustor
* a compressor-driving turbine.

Additional components have to be added to the gas generator to suit its application. Common to all is an air inlet but with different configurations to suit the requirements of marine use, land use or flight at speeds varying from stationary to supersonic. A propelling nozzle is added to produce thrust for flight. An extra turbine is added to drive a propeller (turboprop) or ducted fan (turbofan) to reduce fuel consumption (by increasing propulsive efficiency) at subsonic flight speeds. An extra turbine is also required to drive a helicopter rotor or land-vehicle transmission (turboshaft), marine propeller or electrical generator (power turbine). Greater thrust-to-weight ratio for flight is achieved with the addition of an afterburner.

The basic operation of the gas turbine is a Brayton cycle with air as the working fluid: atmospheric air flows through the compressor that brings it to higher pressure; energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so that the combustion generates a high-temperature flow; this high-temperature pressurized gas enters a turbine, producing a shaft work output in the process, used to drive the compressor; the unused energy comes out in the exhaust gases that can be repurposed for external work, such as directly producing thrust in a turbojet engine, or rotating a second, independent turbine (known as a &quot;power turbine&quot;) that can be connected to a fan, propeller, or electrical generator. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable split of energy between the thrust and the shaft work is achieved. The fourth step of the Brayton cycle (cooling of the working fluid) is omitted, as gas turbines are open systems that do not reuse the same air.

Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, pumps, gas compressors, and tanks.

==Timeline of development==
*50: Earliest records of Hero&#x27;s engine (&quot;aeolipile&quot;). It most likely served no practical purpose, and was rather more of a curiosity; nonetheless, it demonstrated an important principle of physics that all modern turbine engines rely on.
*1000: The &quot;Trotting Horse Lamp&quot; (, &quot;zŏumădēng&quot;) was used by the Chinese at lantern fairs as early as the Northern Song dynasty. When the lamp is lit, the heated airflow rises and drives an impeller with horse-riding figures attached on it, whose shadows are then projected onto the outer screen of the lantern.
*1500: The &quot;Smoke jack&quot; was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci: Hot air from a fire rises through a single-stage axial turbine rotor mounted in the exhaust duct of the fireplace and turns the roasting spit by gear-chain connection.
*1791: A patent was given to John Barber, an Englishman, for the first true gas turbine. His invention had most of the elements present in the modern day gas turbines. The turbine was designed to power a horseless carriage.
*1894: Sir Charles Parsons patented the idea of propelling a ship with a steam turbine, and built a demonstration vessel, the &quot;Turbinia&quot;, easily the fastest vessel afloat at the time.
*1899: Charles Gordon Curtis patented the first gas turbine engine in the US.
*1900: Sanford Alexander Moss submitted a thesis on gas turbines. In 1903, Moss became an engineer for General Electric&#x27;s Steam Turbine Department in Lynn, Massachusetts. While there, he applied some of his concepts in the development of the turbocharger.
*1903: A Norwegian, Ægidius Elling, built the first gas turbine that was able to produce more power than needed to run its own components, which was considered an achievement in a time when knowledge about aerodynamics was limited. Using rotary compressors and turbines it produced .
*1904: A gas turbine engine designed by Franz Stolze, based on his earlier 1873 patent application, is built and tested in Berlin. The Stolze gas turbine was too inefficient to sustain its own operation.
*1906: The Armengaud-Lemale gas turbine tested in France. This was a relatively large machine which included a 25-stage centrifugal compressor designed by Auguste Rateau and built by the Brown Boveri Company. The gas turbine could sustain its own air compression but was too inefficient to produce useful work.
*1910: The first operational Holzwarth gas turbine (pulse combustion) achieves an output of . Planned output of the machine was and its efficiency is below that of contemporary reciprocating engines.
*1920s The practical theory of gas flow through passages was developed into the more formal (and applicable to turbines) theory of gas flow past airfoils by A. A. Griffith resulting in the publishing in 1926 of &quot;An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design&quot;. Working testbed designs of axial turbines suitable for driving a propeller were developed by the Royal Aeronautical Establishment.
*1930: Having found no interest from the RAF for his idea, Frank Whittle patented the design for a centrifugal gas turbine for jet propulsion. The first successful test run of his engine occurred in England in April 1937.
*1932: The Brown Boveri Company of Switzerland starts selling axial compressor and turbine turbosets as part of the turbocharged steam generating Velox boiler. Following the gas turbine principle, the steam evaporation tubes are arranged within the gas turbine combustion chamber; the first Velox plant is erected at a French Steel mill in Mondeville, Calvados.
*1936: The first constant flow industrial gas turbine is commissioned by the Brown Boveri Company and goes into service at Sun Oil&#x27;s Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania, US. 
*1937: Working proof-of-concept prototype turbojet engine runs in UK (Frank Whittle&#x27;s) and Germany (Hans von Ohain&#x27;s Heinkel HeS 1). Henry Tizard secures UK government funding for further development of &quot;Power Jets&quot; engine.
*1939: The First 4 MW utility power generation gas turbine is built by the Brown Boveri Company for an emergency power station in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. The turbojet powered Heinkel He 178, the world&#x27;s first jet aircraft, makes its first flight.
*1940: Jendrassik Cs-1, a turboprop engine, made its first bench run. The Cs-1 was designed by Hungarian engineer György Jendrassik, and was intended to power a Hungarian twin-engine heavy fighter, the RMI-1. Work on the Cs-1 stopped in 1941 without the type having powered any aircraft. 
*1944: The Junkers Jumo 004 engine enters full production, powering the first German military jets such as the Messerschmitt Me 262. This marks the beginning of the reign of gas turbines in the sky.
*1946: National Gas Turbine Establishment formed from Power Jets and the RAE turbine division to bring together Whittle and Hayne Constant&#x27;s work. In Beznau, Switzerland the first commercial reheated/recuperated unit generating 27 MW was commissioned.
*1947: A Metropolitan Vickers G1 (Gatric) becomes the first marine gas turbine when it completes sea trials on the Royal Navy&#x27;s M.G.B 2009 vessel. The Gatric was an aeroderivative gas turbine based on the Metropolitan Vickers F2 jet engine. 
*1995: Siemens becomes the first manufacturer of large electricity producing gas turbines to incorporate single crystal turbine blade technology into their production models, allowing higher operating temperatures and greater efficiency.
*2011: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries tests the first &gt;60% efficiency combined cycle gas turbine (the M501J) at its Takasago, Hyōgo, works.
*2019: Doosan Enerbility began developing a large gas turbine for power generation in 2013 and completed development in 2019. A model was installed at a Gimpo Combined Heat and Power Plant in 2023 and began commercial operation.

==Theory of operation==
In an ideal gas turbine, gases undergo four thermodynamic processes: an isentropic compression, an isobaric (constant pressure) combustion, an isentropic expansion and isobaric heat rejection. Together, these make up the Brayton cycle, also known as the &quot;constant pressure cycle&quot;. It is distinguished from the Otto cycle, in that all the processes (compression, ignition combustion, exhaust), occur at the same time, continuously.

In a real gas turbine, mechanical energy is changed irreversibly (due to internal friction and turbulence) into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed (in either a centrifugal or axial compressor). Heat is added in the combustion chamber and the specific volume of the gas increases, accompanied by a slight loss in pressure. During expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine, irreversible energy transformation once again occurs. Fresh air is taken in, in place of the heat rejection.

Air is taken in by a compressor, called a gas generator, with either an axial or centrifugal design, or a combination of the two. This air is then ducted into the combustor section which can be of a annular, can, or can-annular design. In the combustor section, roughly 70% of the air from the compressor is ducted around the combustor itself for cooling purposes. The remaining roughly 30% the air is mixed with fuel and ignited by the already burning air-fuel mixture, which then expands producing power across the turbine. This expansion of the mixture then leaves the combustor section and has its velocity increased across the turbine section to strike the turbine blades, spinning the disc they are attached to, thus creating useful power. Of the power produced, 60-70% is solely used to power the gas generator. The remaining power is used to power what the engine is being used for, typically an aviation application, being thrust in a turbojet, driving the fan of a turbofan, rotor or accessory of a turboshaft, and gear reduction and propeller of a turboprop.

If the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor, the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust. For a turboprop engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation. In a turbojet engine only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components. The remaining high-pressure gases are accelerated through a nozzle to provide a jet to propel an aircraft.

The smaller the engine, the higher the rotation rate of the shaft must be to attain the required blade tip speed. Blade-tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor. This, in turn, limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine. In order for tip speed to remain constant, if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half, the rotational speed must double. For example, large jet engines operate around 10,000–25,000 rpm, while micro turbines spin as fast as 500,000 rpm.

Mechanically, gas turbines &quot;can&quot; be considerably less complex than Reciprocating engines. Simple turbines might have one main moving part, the compressor/shaft/turbine rotor assembly, with other moving parts in the fuel system. This, in turn, can translate into price. For instance, costing for materials, the Jumo 004 proved cheaper than the Junkers 213 piston engine, which was , and needed only 375 hours of lower-skill labor to complete (including manufacture, assembly, and shipping), compared to 1,400 for the BMW 801. This, however, also translated into poor efficiency and reliability. More advanced gas turbines (such as those found in modern jet engines or combined cycle power plants) may have 2 or 3 shafts (spools), hundreds of compressor and turbine blades, movable stator blades, and extensive external tubing for fuel, oil and air systems; they use temperature resistant alloys, and are made with tight specifications requiring precision manufacture. All this often makes the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine.

Moreover, to reach optimum performance in modern gas turbine power plants the gas needs to be prepared to exact fuel specifications. Fuel gas conditioning systems treat the natural gas to reach the exact fuel specification prior to entering the turbine in terms of pressure, temperature, gas composition, and the related Wobbe index.

The primary advantage of a gas turbine engine is its power to weight ratio. 
Since significant useful work can be generated by a relatively lightweight engine, gas turbines are perfectly suited for aircraft propulsion.

Thrust bearings and journal bearings are a critical part of a design. They are hydrodynamic oil bearings or oil-cooled rolling-element bearings. Foil bearings are used in some small machines such as micro turbines and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines/auxiliary power units

===Creep===
A major challenge facing turbine design, especially turbine blades, is reducing the creep that is induced by the high temperatures and stresses that are experienced during operation. Higher operating temperatures are continuously sought in order to increase efficiency, but come at the cost of higher creep rates. Several methods have therefore been employed in an attempt to achieve optimal performance while limiting creep, with the most successful ones being high performance coatings and single crystal superalloys. These technologies work by limiting deformation that occurs by mechanisms that can be broadly classified as dislocation glide, dislocation climb and diffusional flow.

Protective coatings provide thermal insulation of the blade and offer oxidation and corrosion resistance. Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics and oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings (bond coats) typically consist of aluminides or MCrAlY (where M is typically Fe and/or Cr) alloys. Using TBCs limits the temperature exposure of the superalloy substrate, thereby decreasing the diffusivity of the active species (typically vacancies) within the alloy and reducing dislocation and vacancy creep. It has been found that a coating of 1–200 μm can decrease blade temperatures by up to . 
Bond coats are directly applied onto the surface of the substrate using pack carburization and serve the dual purpose of providing improved adherence for the TBC and oxidation resistance for the substrate. The Al from the bond coats forms Al2O3 on the TBC-bond coat interface which provides the oxidation resistance, but also results in the formation of an undesirable interdiffusion (ID) zone between itself and the substrate. The oxidation resistance outweighs the drawbacks associated with the ID zone as it increases the lifetime of the blade and limits the efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades.

Nickel-based superalloys boast improved strength and creep resistance due to their composition and resultant microstructure. The gamma (γ) FCC nickel is alloyed with aluminum and titanium in order to precipitate a uniform dispersion of the coherent gamma-prime (γ&#x27;) phases. The finely dispersed γ&#x27; precipitates impede dislocation motion and introduce a threshold stress, increasing the stress required for the onset of creep. Furthermore, γ&#x27; is an ordered L12 phase that makes it harder for dislocations to shear past it. Further Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added in solid solution to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance. The development of single crystal superalloys has led to significant improvements in creep resistance as well. Due to the lack of grain boundaries, single crystals eliminate Coble creep and consequently deform by fewer modes – decreasing the creep rate. Although single crystals have lower creep at high temperatures, they have significantly lower yield stresses at room temperature where strength is determined by the Hall-Petch relationship. Care needs to be taken in order to optimize the design parameters to limit high temperature creep while not decreasing low temperature yield strength.

==Types==

===Jet engines===
Airbreathing jet engines are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases, or from ducted fans connected to the gas turbines. Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets. While still in service with many militaries and civilian operators, turbojets have mostly been phased out in favor of the turbofan engine due to the turbojet&#x27;s low fuel efficiency, and high noise. Those that generate thrust with the addition of a ducted fan are called turbofans or (rarely) fan-jets. These engines produce nearly 80% of their thrust by the ducted fan, which can be seen from the front of the engine. They come in two types, low-bypass turbofan and high bypass, the difference being the amount of air moved by the fan, called &quot;bypass air&quot;. These engines offer the benefit of more thrust without extra fuel consumption.

Gas turbines are also used in many liquid-fuel rockets, where gas turbines are used to power a turbopump to permit the use of lightweight, low-pressure tanks, reducing the empty weight of the rocket.

===Turboprop engines===
A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller using a reduction gear to translate high turbine section operating speed (often in the 10s of thousands) into low thousands necessary for efficient propeller operation. The benefit of using the turboprop engine is to take advantage of the turbine engines high power-to-weight ratio to drive a propeller, thus allowing a more powerful, but also smaller engine to be used. Turboprop engines are used on a wide range of business aircraft such as the Pilatus PC-12, commuter aircraft such as the Beechcraft 1900, and small cargo aircraft such as the Cessna 208 Caravan or De Havilland Canada Dash 8, and large aircraft (typically military) such as the Airbus A400M transport, Lockheed AC-130 and the 60-year-old Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber. While military turboprop engines can vary, in the civilian market there are two primary engines to be found: the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, a free-turbine turboshaft engine, and the Honeywell TPE331, a fixed turbine engine (formerly designated as the Garrett AiResearch 331).

===Aeroderivative gas turbines===
Aeroderivative gas turbines are generally based on existing aircraft gas turbine engines and are smaller and lighter than industrial gas turbines.

Aeroderivatives are used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines. They are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight. Common types include the General Electric LM2500, General Electric LM6000, and aeroderivative versions of the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, Pratt &amp; Whitney FT4 and Rolls-Royce RB211.

===Amateur gas turbines===
Increasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs.

In its most straightforward form, these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales, then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting. In its most extreme form, amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the land speed record.

The simplest form of self-constructed gas turbine employs an automotive turbocharger as the core component. A combustion chamber is fabricated and plumbed between the compressor and turbine sections.

More sophisticated turbojets are also built, where their thrust and light weight are sufficient to power large model aircraft. The Schreckling design constructs the entire engine from raw materials, including the fabrication of a centrifugal compressor wheel from plywood, epoxy and wrapped carbon fibre strands.

Several small companies now manufacture small turbines and parts for the amateur. Most turbojet-powered model aircraft are now using these commercial and semi-commercial microturbines, rather than a Schreckling-like home-build.

===Auxiliary power units===
Small gas turbines are used as auxiliary power units (APUs) to supply auxiliary power to larger, mobile, machines such as an aircraft, and are a turboshaft design. They supply:
* compressed air for air cycle machine style air conditioning and ventilation,
* compressed air start-up power for larger jet engines,
* mechanical (shaft) power to a gearbox to drive shafted accessories, and
* electrical, hydraulic and other power-transmission sources to consuming devices remote from the APU.

===Industrial gas turbines for power generation===
Industrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of heavier construction. They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power—often an electric generator—and the secondary-energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy (largely heat).

They range in size from portable mobile plants to large, complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose-built buildings. When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power, its thermal efficiency is about 30%. However, it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it. Therefore, many engines are used in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable container configurations.

Gas turbines can be particularly efficient when waste heat from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) to power a conventional steam turbine in a combined cycle configuration. The 605 MW General Electric 9HA achieved a 62.22% efficiency rate with temperatures as high as .
For 2018, GE offers its 826 MW HA at over 64% efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in additive manufacturing and combustion breakthroughs, up from 63.7% in 2017 orders and on track to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.
In March 2018, GE Power achieved a 63.08% gross efficiency for its 7HA turbine.

Aeroderivative gas turbines can also be used in combined cycles, leading to a higher efficiency, but it will not be as high as a specifically designed industrial gas turbine. They can also be run in a cogeneration configuration: the exhaust is used for space or water heating, or drives an absorption chiller for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output, technology known as turbine inlet air cooling.

Another significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes, supplying power during peak, or unscheduled, demand. Since single cycle (gas turbine only) power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants, they are usually used as peaking power plants, which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per year—depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region. In areas with a shortage of base-load and load following power plant capacity or with low fuel costs, a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day. A large single-cycle gas turbine typically produces 100 to 400 megawatts of electric power and has 35–40% thermodynamic efficiency.

===Industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive===
Industrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to a single shaft. The power range varies from 1 megawatt up to 50 megawatts. These engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly. The majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries. Mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around 2%.

Oil and gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore, or to compress the gas for transportation. They are also often used to provide power for the platform. These platforms do not need to use the engine in collaboration with a CHP system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost (often free from burn off gas). The same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals.

====Compressed air energy storage====
One modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way, by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store. In a conventional turbine, up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor. In a compressed air energy storage configuration, power is used to drive the compressor, and the compressed air is released to operate the turbine when required.

===Turboshaft engines===

Turboshaft engines are used to drive compressors in gas pumping stations and natural gas liquefaction plants. They are also used in aviation to power all but the smallest modern helicopters, and function as an auxiliary power unit in large commercial aircraft. A primary shaft carries the compressor and its turbine which, together with a combustor, is called a &quot;Gas Generator&quot;. A separately spinning power-turbine is usually used to drive the rotor on helicopters. Allowing the gas generator and power turbine/rotor to spin at their own speeds allows more flexibility in their design.

===Radial gas turbines===
===Scale jet engines===
Also known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets.

With this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro-Jets, Kurt Schreckling, produced one of the world&#x27;s first Micro-Turbines, the FD3/67. This engine can produce up to 22 newtons of thrust, and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools, such as a metal lathe.

===Microturbines===
Evolved from piston engine turbochargers, aircraft APUs or small jet engines, microturbines are 25 to 500 kilowatt turbines the size of a refrigerator.
Microturbines have around 15% efficiencies without a recuperator, 20 to 30% with one and they can reach 85% combined thermal-electrical efficiency in cogeneration.

==External combustion==
Most gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is, effectively, a turbine version of a hot air engine.
Those systems are usually indicated as EFGT (Externally Fired Gas Turbine) or IFGT (Indirectly Fired Gas Turbine).

External combustion has been used for the purpose of using pulverized coal or finely ground biomass (such as sawdust) as a fuel. In the indirect system, a heat exchanger is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine. The thermal efficiency is lower in the indirect type of external combustion; however, the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality (and therefore cheaper) fuels are able to be used.

When external combustion is used, it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air. This effectively reduces global heat losses, although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable.

Closed-cycle gas turbines based on helium or supercritical carbon dioxide also hold promise for use with future high temperature solar and nuclear power generation.

==In surface vehicles==
Gas turbines are often used on ships, locomotives, helicopters, tanks, and to a lesser extent, on cars, buses, and motorcycles.

A key advantage of jets and turboprops for airplane propulsion – their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines, particularly naturally aspirated ones – is irrelevant in most automobile applications. Their power-to-weight advantage, though less critical than for aircraft, is still important.

Gas turbines offer a high-powered engine in a very small and light package. However, they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of RPMs and powers needed in vehicle applications. In series hybrid vehicles, as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine, the responsiveness, poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important. The turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output, and batteries and ultracapacitors can supply power as needed, with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency. The emergence of the continuously variable transmission may also alleviate the responsiveness problem.

Turbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines, though this is partly because piston engines have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the turbocharger.

The turbocharger is basically a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which is driven by the piston engine&#x27;s exhaust gas. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a centrifugal compressor wheel through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a wastegate or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing&#x27;s geometry (as in a variable geometry turbocharger).
It mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine boost.

Turbo-compound engines (actually employed on some semi-trailer trucks) are fitted with blow down turbines which are similar in design and appearance to a turbocharger except for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor, thus providing additional power instead of boost. While the turbocharger is a pressure turbine, a power recovery turbine is a velocity one.

===Passenger road vehicles (cars, bikes, and buses)===
A number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered automobiles, the largest by Chrysler. More recently, there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars. For instance, a consortium led by micro gas turbine company Bladon Jets has secured investment from the Technology Strategy Board to develop an Ultra Lightweight Range Extender (ULRE) for next-generation electric vehicles. The objective of the consortium, which includes luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover and leading electrical machine company SR Drives, is to produce the world&#x27;s first commercially viable – and environmentally friendly – gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications.

The common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative.

====Concept cars====
The first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in 1946 when two engineers, Robert Kafka and Robert Engerstein of Carney Associates, a New York engineering firm, came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car. After an article appeared in &quot;Popular Science&quot;, there was no further work, beyond the paper stage.

;Early concepts (1950s/60s)
In 1950, designer F.R. Bell and Chief Engineer Maurice Wilks from British car manufacturers Rover unveiled the first car powered with a gas turbine engine. The two-seater JET1 had the engine positioned behind the seats, air intake grilles on either side of the car, and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail. During tests, the car reached top speeds of , at a turbine speed of 50,000 rpm. After being shown in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1950, JET1 was further developed, and was subjected to speed trials on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium in June 1952, where it exceeded . The car ran on petrol, paraffin (kerosene) or diesel oil, but fuel consumption problems proved insurmountable for a production car. JET1 is on display at the London Science Museum.

A French turbine-powered car, the SOCEMA-Grégoire, was displayed at the October 1952 Paris Auto Show. It was designed by the French engineer Jean-Albert Grégoire.

The first turbine-powered car built in the US was the GM Firebird I which began evaluations in 1953. While photos of the Firebird I may suggest that the jet turbine&#x27;s thrust propelled the car like an aircraft, the turbine actually drove the rear wheels. The Firebird I was never meant as a commercial passenger car and was built solely for testing &amp; evaluation as well as public relation purposes. Additional Firebird concept cars, each powered by gas turbines, were developed for the 1953, 1956 and 1959 Motorama auto shows. The GM Research gas turbine engine also was fitted to a series of transit buses, starting with the Turbo-Cruiser I of 1953.

Starting in 1954 with a modified Plymouth, the American car manufacturer Chrysler demonstrated several prototype gas turbine-powered cars from the early 1950s through the early 1980s. Chrysler built fifty Chrysler Turbine Cars in 1963 and conducted the only consumer trial of gas turbine-powered cars. Each of their turbines employed a unique rotating recuperator, referred to as a regenerator that increased efficiency.

In 1954, Fiat unveiled a concept car with a turbine engine, called Fiat Turbina. This vehicle, looking like an aircraft with wheels, used a unique combination of both jet thrust and the engine driving the wheels. Speeds of were claimed.

In the 1960s, Ford and GM also were developing gas turbine semi-trucks. Ford displayed the Big Red at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. With the trailer, it was long, high, and painted crimson red. It contained the Ford-developed gas turbine engine, with output power and torque of and . The cab boasted a highway map of the continental U.S., a mini-kitchen, bathroom, and a TV for the co-driver. The fate of the truck was unknown for several decades, but it was rediscovered in early 2021 in private hands, having been restored to running order. The Chevrolet division of GM built the &quot;Turbo Titan&quot; series of concept trucks with turbine motors as analogs of the Firebird concepts, including Turbo Titan I (, shares GT-304 engine with Firebird II), Turbo Titan II (, shares GT-305 engine with Firebird III), and Turbo Titan III (1965, GT-309 engine); in addition, the GM Bison gas turbine truck was shown at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair.

;Emissions and fuel economy (1970s/80s)
As a result of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, research was funded into developing automotive gas turbine technology. Design concepts and vehicles were conducted by Chrysler, General Motors, Ford (in collaboration with AiResearch), and American Motors (in conjunction with Williams Research). Long-term tests were conducted to evaluate comparable cost efficiency. Several AMC Hornets were powered by a small Williams regenerative gas turbine weighing and producing at 4450 rpm.

In 1982, General Motors used an Oldsmobile Delta 88 powered by a gas turbine using pulverised coal dust. This was considered for the United States and the western world to reduce dependence on middle east oil at the time

Toyota demonstrated several gas turbine powered concept cars, such as the Century gas turbine hybrid in 1975, the Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid in 1979 and the GTV in 1985. No production vehicles were made. The GT24 engine was exhibited in 1977 without a vehicle.

;Later development
In the early 1990s, Volvo introduced the Volvo ECC which was a gas turbine powered hybrid electric vehicle.

In 1993, General Motors developed a gas turbine powered EV1 series hybrid—as a prototype of the General Motors EV1. A Williams International 40 kW turbine drove an alternator which powered the battery–electric powertrain. The turbine design included a recuperator. In 2006, GM went into the EcoJet concept car project with Jay Leno.

At the 2010 Paris Motor Show Jaguar demonstrated its Jaguar C-X75 concept car. This electrically powered supercar has a top speed of and can go from in 3.4 seconds. It uses lithium-ion batteries to power four electric motors which combine to produce 780 bhp. It will travel on a single charge of the batteries, and uses a pair of Bladon Micro Gas Turbines to re-charge the batteries extending the range to .

====Racing cars====

The first race car (in concept only) fitted with a turbine was in 1955 by a US Air Force group as a hobby project with a turbine loaned them by Boeing and a race car owned by Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber company. The first race car fitted with a turbine for the goal of actual racing was by Rover and the BRM Formula One team joined forces to produce the Rover-BRM, a gas turbine powered coupe, which entered the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Graham Hill and Richie Ginther. It averaged and had a top speed of . American Ray Heppenstall joined Howmet Corporation and McKee Engineering together to develop their own gas turbine sports car in 1968, the Howmet TX, which ran several American and European events, including two wins, and also participated in the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans. The cars used Continental gas turbines, which eventually set six FIA land speed records for turbine-powered cars.

For open wheel racing, 1967&#x27;s revolutionary STP-Paxton Turbocar fielded by racing and entrepreneurial legend Andy Granatelli and driven by Parnelli Jones nearly won the Indianapolis 500; the Pratt &amp; Whitney ST6B-62 powered turbine car was almost a lap ahead of the second place car when a gearbox bearing failed just three laps from the finish line. The next year the STP Lotus 56 turbine car won the Indianapolis 500 pole position even though new rules restricted the air intake dramatically. In 1971 Team Lotus principal Colin Chapman introduced the Lotus 56B F1 car, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney STN 6/76 gas turbine. Chapman had a reputation of building radical championship-winning cars, but had to abandon the project because there were too many problems with turbo lag.

====Buses====
General Motors fitted the GT-30x series of gas turbines (branded &quot;Whirlfire&quot;) to several prototype buses in the 1950s and 1960s, including Turbo-Cruiser I (1953, GT-300); Turbo-Cruiser II (1964, GT-309); Turbo-Cruiser III (1968, GT-309); RTX (1968, GT-309); and RTS 3T (1972).

The arrival of the Capstone Turbine has led to several hybrid bus designs, starting with HEV-1 by AVS of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1999, and closely followed by Ebus and ISE Research in California, and DesignLine Corporation in New Zealand (and later the United States). AVS turbine hybrids were plagued with reliability and quality control problems, resulting in liquidation of AVS in 2003. The most successful design by Designline is now operated in 5 cities in 6 countries, with over 30 buses in operation worldwide, and order for several hundred being delivered to Baltimore, and New York City.

Brescia Italy is using serial hybrid buses powered by microturbines on routes through the historical sections of the city.

====Motorcycles====
The MTT Turbine Superbike appeared in 2000 (hence the designation of Y2K Superbike by MTT) and is the first production motorcycle powered by a turbine engine – specifically, a Rolls-Royce Allison model 250 turboshaft engine, producing about 283 kW (380 bhp). Speed-tested to 365 km/h or 227 mph (according to some stories, the testing team ran out of road during the test), it holds the Guinness World Record for most powerful production motorcycle and most expensive production motorcycle, with a price tag of US$185,000.

===Trains===
Several locomotive classes have been powered by gas turbines, the most recent incarnation being Bombardier&#x27;s JetTrain.

===Tanks===
The Third Reich &quot;Wehrmacht Heer&quot;&#x27;s development division, the Heereswaffenamt (Army Ordnance Board), studied a number of gas turbine engine designs for use in tanks starting in mid-1944. The first gas turbine engine design intended for use in armored fighting vehicle propulsion, the BMW 003-based GT 101, was meant for installation in the Panther tank. Towards the end of the war, a Jagdtiger was fitted with one of the aforementioned gas turbines.

The second use of a gas turbine in an armored fighting vehicle was in 1954 when a unit, PU2979, specifically developed for tanks by C. A. Parsons and Company, was installed and trialed in a British Conqueror tank. The Stridsvagn 103 was developed in the 1950s and was the first mass-produced main battle tank to use a turbine engine, the Boeing T50. Since then, gas turbine engines have been used as auxiliary power units in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet/Russian T-80s and U.S. M1 Abrams tanks, among others. They are lighter and smaller than diesel engines at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel, especially at idle, requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range. Successive models of M1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank&#x27;s systems while stationary, saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine. T-80s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range. Russia has stopped production of the T-80 in favor of the diesel-powered T-90 (based on the T-72), while Ukraine has developed the diesel-powered T-80UD and T-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank. The French Leclerc tank&#x27;s diesel powerplant features the &quot;Hyperbar&quot; hybrid supercharging system, where the engine&#x27;s turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger, enabling engine RPM-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached (than with ordinary turbochargers). This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank&#x27;s power plant and effectively removes turbo lag. This special gas turbine/turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU.

A turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts, but in practice, turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds. The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily. An improperly fitted filter, or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter, can damage the engine. Piston engines (especially if turbocharged) also need well-maintained filters, but they are more resilient if the filter does fail.

Like most modern diesel engines used in tanks, gas turbines are usually multi-fuel engines.

==Marine applications==
===Naval===
Gas turbines are used in many naval vessels, where they are valued for their high power-to-weight ratio and their ships&#x27; resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly.

The first gas-turbine-powered naval vessel was the Royal Navy&#x27;s motor gunboat &quot;MGB 2009&quot; (formerly &quot;MGB 509&quot;) converted in 1947. Metropolitan-Vickers fitted their F2/3 jet engine with a power turbine. The Steam Gun Boat &quot;Grey Goose&quot; was converted to Rolls-Royce gas turbines in 1952 and operated as such from 1953. The Bold class Fast Patrol Boats &quot;Bold Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Bold Pathfinder&quot; built in 1953 were the first ships created specifically for gas turbine propulsion.

The first large-scale, partially gas-turbine powered ships were the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 81 (Tribal class) frigates with combined steam and gas powerplants. The first, was commissioned in 1961.

The German Navy launched the first in 1961 with 2 Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie gas turbines in the world&#x27;s first combined diesel and gas propulsion system.

The Soviet Navy commissioned in 1962 the first of 25 with 4 gas turbines in combined gas and gas propulsion system. Those vessels used 4 M8E gas turbines, which generated . Those ships were the first large ships in the world to be powered solely by gas turbines.

The Danish Navy had 6 &quot;Søløven&quot;-class torpedo boats (the export version of the British Brave class fast patrol boat) in service from 1965 to 1990, which had 3 Bristol Proteus (later RR Proteus) Marine Gas Turbines rated at combined, plus two General Motors Diesel engines, rated at , for better fuel economy at slower speeds. And they also produced 10 Willemoes Class Torpedo / Guided Missile boats (in service from 1974 to 2000) which had 3 Rolls-Royce Marine Proteus Gas Turbines also rated at , same as the Søløven-class boats, and 2 General Motors Diesel Engines, rated at , also for improved fuel economy at slow speeds.

The Swedish Navy produced 6 Spica-class torpedo boats between 1966 and 1967 powered by 3 Bristol Siddeley Proteus 1282 turbines, each delivering . They were later joined by 12 upgraded Norrköping class ships, still with the same engines. With their aft torpedo tubes replaced by antishipping missiles they served as missile boats until the last was retired in 2005.

The Finnish Navy commissioned two corvettes, &quot;Turunmaa&quot; and &quot;Karjala&quot;, in 1968. They were equipped with one Rolls-Royce Olympus TM1 gas turbine and three Wärtsilä marine diesels for slower speeds. They were the fastest vessels in the Finnish Navy; they regularly achieved speeds of 35 knots, and 37.3 knots during sea trials. The &quot;Turunmaa&quot;s were decommissioned in 2002. &quot;Karjala&quot; is today a museum ship in Turku, and &quot;Turunmaa&quot; serves as a floating machine shop and training ship for Satakunta Polytechnical College.

The next series of major naval vessels were the four Canadian helicopter carrying destroyers first commissioned in 1972. They used 2 ft-4 main propulsion engines, 2 ft-12 cruise engines and 3 Solar Saturn 750 kW generators.
The first U.S. gas-turbine powered ship was the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s , a cutter commissioned in 1961 that was powered by two turbines utilizing controllable-pitch propellers. The larger High Endurance Cutters, was the first class of larger cutters to utilize gas turbines, the first of which () was commissioned in 1967. Since then, they have powered the U.S. Navy&#x27;s s, and s, and guided missile cruisers. , a modified , is to be the Navy&#x27;s first amphibious assault ship powered by gas turbines.
The marine gas turbine operates in a more corrosive atmosphere due to the presence of sea salt in air and fuel and use of cheaper fuels.

===Civilian maritime===
Up to the late 1940s, much of the progress on marine gas turbines all over the world took place in design offices and engine builder&#x27;s workshops and development work was led by the British Royal Navy and other Navies. While interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes, both naval and mercantile, continued to increase, the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon.

In 1951, the diesel–electric oil tanker &quot;Auris&quot;, 12,290 deadweight tonnage (DWT) was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean-going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine. Built by Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn-on-Tyne, UK, in accordance with plans and specifications drawn up by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and launched on the UK&#x27;s Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s 21st birthday in 1947, the ship was designed with an engine room layout that would allow for the experimental use of heavy fuel in one of its high-speed engines, as well as the future substitution of one of its diesel engines by a gas turbine. The &quot;Auris&quot; operated commercially as a tanker for three-and-a-half years with a diesel–electric propulsion unit as originally commissioned, but in 1951 one of its four diesel engines – which were known as &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot; and &quot;Prudence&quot; – was replaced by the world&#x27;s first marine gas turbine engine, a open-cycle gas turbo-alternator built by British Thompson-Houston Company in Rugby. Following successful sea trials off the Northumbrian coast, the &quot;Auris&quot; set sail from Hebburn-on-Tyne in October 1951 bound for Port Arthur in the US and then Curaçao in the southern Caribbean returning to Avonmouth after 44 days at sea, successfully completing her historic trans-Atlantic crossing. During this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind. She subsequently visited Swansea, Hull, Rotterdam, Oslo and Southampton covering a total of 13,211 nautical miles. The &quot;Auris&quot; then had all of its power plants replaced with a directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power.

Despite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine did not replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships. At constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy. The gas turbine did have more success in Royal Navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action.

The United States Maritime Commission were looking for options to update WWII Liberty ships, and heavy-duty gas turbines were one of those selected. In 1956 the &quot;John Sergeant&quot; was lengthened and equipped with a General Electric HD gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration, reduction gearing and a variable-pitch propeller. It operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel (Bunker C) for 7,000 hours. Fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at per hour, and power output was higher than expected at due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine. This gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots, up from 11 knots with the original power plant, and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted. The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots, in spite of some rough weather along the way. Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature. The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time. Ultimately, the variable-pitch propeller, which was of a new and untested design, ended the trial, as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress-cracking. This did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though, and the trial was a success overall. The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels. The &quot;John Sergeant&quot; was scrapped in 1972 at Portsmouth PA.
Boeing launched its first passenger-carrying waterjet-propelled hydrofoil Boeing 929, in April 1974. Those ships were powered by two Allison 501-KF gas turbines.

Between 1971 and 1981, Seatrain Lines operated a scheduled container service between ports on the eastern seaboard of the United States and ports in northwest Europe across the North Atlantic with four container ships of 26,000 tonnes DWT. Those ships were powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney gas turbines of the FT 4 series. The four ships in the class were named &quot;Euroliner&quot;, &quot;Eurofreighter&quot;, &quot;Asialiner&quot; and &quot;Asiafreighter&quot;. Following the dramatic Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) price increases of the mid-1970s, operations were constrained by rising fuel costs. Some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel (i.e., marine diesel). Reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change. After 1981 the ships were sold and refitted with, what at the time, was more economical diesel-fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space.

The first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the GTS &quot;Finnjet&quot;, built in 1977 and powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney FT 4C-1 DLF turbines, generating and propelling the ship to a speed of 31 knots. However, the Finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft, as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable. After four years of service, additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off-season. The Finnjet was also the first ship with a combined diesel–electric and gas propulsion. Another example of commercial use of gas turbines in a passenger ship is Stena Line&#x27;s HSS class fastcraft ferries. HSS 1500-class &quot;Stena Explorer&quot;, &quot;Stena Voyager&quot; and &quot;Stena Discovery&quot; vessels use combined gas and gas setups of twin GE LM2500 plus GE LM1600 power for a total of . The slightly smaller HSS 900-class &quot;Stena Carisma&quot;, uses twin ABB–STAL GT35 turbines rated at gross. The &quot;Stena Discovery&quot; was withdrawn from service in 2007, another victim of too high fuel costs.

In July 2000, the &quot;Millennium&quot; became the first cruise ship to be powered by both gas and steam turbines. The ship featured two General Electric LM2500 gas turbine generators whose exhaust heat was used to operate a steam turbine generator in a COGES (combined gas electric and steam) configuration. Propulsion was provided by two electrically driven Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth pods. The liner uses a combined diesel and gas configuration.

In marine racing applications the 2010 C5000 Mystic catamaran Miss GEICO uses two Lycoming T-55 turbines for its power system.

==Advances in technology==
Gas turbine technology has steadily advanced since its inception and continues to evolve. Development is actively producing both smaller gas turbines and more powerful and efficient engines. Aiding in these advances are computer-based design (specifically computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis) and the development of advanced materials: Base materials with superior high-temperature strength (e.g., single-crystal superalloys that exhibit yield strength anomaly) or thermal barrier coatings that protect the structural material from ever-higher temperatures. These advances allow higher compression ratios and turbine inlet temperatures, more efficient combustion and better cooling of engine parts.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has contributed to substantial improvements in the performance and efficiency of gas turbine engine components through enhanced understanding of the complex viscous flow and heat transfer phenomena involved. For this reason, CFD is one of the key computational tools used in design and development of gas turbine engines.

The simple-cycle efficiencies of early gas turbines were practically doubled by incorporating inter-cooling, regeneration (or recuperation), and reheating. These improvements, of course, come at the expense of increased initial and operation costs, and they cannot be justified unless the decrease in fuel costs offsets the increase in other costs. The relatively low fuel prices, the general desire in the industry to minimize installation costs, and the tremendous increase in the simple-cycle efficiency to about 40 percent left little desire for opting for these modifications.

On the emissions side, the challenge is to increase turbine inlet temperatures while at the same time reducing peak flame temperature in order to achieve lower NOx emissions and meet the latest emission regulations. In May 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries achieved a turbine inlet temperature of on a 320 megawatt gas turbine, and 460 MW in gas turbine combined-cycle power generation applications in which gross thermal efficiency exceeds 60%.

Compliant foil bearings were commercially introduced to gas turbines in the 1990s. These can withstand over a hundred thousand start/stop cycles and have eliminated the need for an oil system. The application of microelectronics and power switching technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by microturbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion.

In 2013, General Electric started the development of the GE9X with a compression ratio of 61:1.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The following are advantages and disadvantages of gas-turbine engines:

Advantages include:

* Very high power-to-weight ratio compared to reciprocating engines.
* Smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating.
* Smooth rotation of the main shaft produces far less vibration than a reciprocating engine.
* Fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines results in lower maintenance cost and higher reliability/availability over its service life.
* Greater reliability, particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required.
* Waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust. This results in a high-temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a combined cycle, or for cogeneration.
* Lower peak combustion pressures than reciprocating engines in general.
* High shaft speeds in smaller &quot;free turbine units&quot;, although larger gas turbines employed in power generation operate at synchronous speeds.
* Low lubricating oil cost and consumption.
* Can run on a wide variety of fuels.
* Very low toxic emissions of CO and HC due to excess air, complete combustion and no &quot;quench&quot; of the flame on cold surfaces.

Disadvantages include:

* Core engine costs can be high due to the use of exotic materials, especially in applications where high reliability is required (e.g. aircraft propulsion)
* Less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed.
* Longer startup than reciprocating engines.
* Less responsive to changes in power demand compared with reciprocating engines.
* Characteristic whine can be hard to suppress. The exhaust (particularly on turbojets) can also produce a distinctive roaring sound.

==Testing==
British, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, ASME has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines. This includes ASME PTC 22–2014. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 22, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.

<text>Inversions is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 1998. Banks has said &quot;&quot;Inversions&quot; was an attempt to write a Culture novel that wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Plot==
The book takes place on a fictional planet resembling Europe during the Late Middle Ages. A large empire broke up in the decade or so preceding the action, apparently from meteor or asteroid strikes that severely affected farming across much of the globe. The remnants of the empire still war with one another.

The narrative alternates chapter-by-chapter between two concurrent story-lines, with alternating chapter headings of The Doctor and The Bodyguard.

===&quot;The Doctor&quot;===
The first storyline is presented as a written account from Oelph, publicly a doctor&#x27;s assistant, but privately a spy for an individual identified only as &quot;Master&quot;, to whom much of the account is addressed. Oelph is the assistant to Vosill, the personal doctor to King Quience of Haspidus—and a woman. The latter is unheard of in the patriarchal kingdom, and is tolerated only because Vosill claims citizenship in the far-off country of Drezen. The King himself is appreciative of her and her talents, but nonetheless her elevated position in defiance of the kingdom&#x27;s social mores inspires hostility among others of the court.

Oelph&#x27;s account follows Vosill as she attends to the King regularly, as well as more charitable ministrations to the impoverished and those in need. Her methods are unconventional by kingdom standards, for example forgoing the use of leeches and instead using alcohol to &quot;kill the ill humours which can infect a wound,&quot; but are more often than not successful. This only serves to inspire more distrust amongst her detractors, notably including a number of Dukes as well as the King&#x27;s Guard Commander, Adlain. On this topic, Oelph includes a transcript he claims to have found in Vosill&#x27;s journal, purported to be an exchange between Duke Walen and Adlain in which they make an agreement, &quot;should it become necessary&quot;, to covertly kidnap the lady doctor and have Nolieti, the King&#x27;s chief torturer, &quot;put her to the question.&quot; Oelph notes that while the transcript appears to have been obtained under impossible circumstances, he somehow does not doubt its veracity.

While Vosill attends to the King, Nolieti is murdered, nearly decapitated, presumably by his assistant Unoure. Vosill examines the body and determines that Unoure could not have killed his master, but her explanation is disregarded. Unoure is captured, but before he can be questioned he is found in his cell dead from a cut throat, apparently self-inflicted. Following this account Oelph includes another found transcript, this time between Walen and Duke Quettil, though Walen is unable to obtain Quettil&#x27;s agreement for the use of Ralinge, his own chief torturer, in Walen&#x27;s kidnapping plan. Some days later at a masked ball Walen is found murdered, this time by a stab to the heart. The Duke&#x27;s murder disquiets much of the royal house, as it occurred in a room no one entered or left.

Resentment towards Vosill continues to build, particularly after King Quience begins implementing somewhat radical reforms, such as permitting commoners to own farmland without the oversight of a noble and the creation of city councils, reforms which Vosill has discussed with the King publicly and at length. Following these reforms Vosill confesses to the King that she loves him, a sentiment he rebuffs, and further informs her that he prefers &quot;pretty, dainty, delicate women who [have] no brains.&quot; Oelph finds her after this, drunk, and hints at his own feelings of love towards her; she rebuffs him as well, in what might be considered a more gentle way.

Some days later Vosill receives a note from Adlain, asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle. She leaves alone, but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; after catching a glimpse of someone fleeing, he arrives in time to be arrested by the guard, who proceed to discover Vosill standing over the body of a murdered Duke, stabbed with one of her scalpels. Vosill and Oelph are almost immediately delivered to Ralinge, who binds the two separately and then strips, intending to rape Vosill. The woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands, albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially. Oelph&#x27;s eyes are closed at this point, and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next, other than an impression of wind and metal. When he opens his eyes he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead, dispatched bloodily, and Vosill free and in the process of removing her bindings, no indication of how she was freed. Later, she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first, though she indicates to him that this is what he &quot;should&quot; remember.

The two are taken from the torturer&#x27;s chamber shortly thereafter, as the King has abruptly taken ill and appears to be dying. Vosill is able to cure King Quience&#x27;s condition, and is there to witness as the conspiracy against her is revealed to the King, inadvertently, when news of Ralinge&#x27;s death reaches the conspirators: Commander Adlain and Dukes Quettil and Ulresile. Ultimately the blame is publicly taken by Ulresile, who escapes with being exiled for several months; the King makes it clear that further plots against the doctor will not be tolerated. Because Oelph is not present for these events, his account comes second-hand from servants present; during this scene he reveals his master to be Guard Commander Adlain.

Vosill requests the King release her from her duties, which he does. She leaves just a few days later on a ship for Drezen, and is seen off at the dock by Oelph. Oelph tries to suppress the urge to ask to accompany Vosill, since he knows that her answer will be in the negative, but in the end he does so anyway. The ship leaves sometime later, and Vosill vanishes some days later.

===&quot;The Bodyguard&quot;===
The second, interleaved storyline is told by an initially unnamed narrator, remaining unnamed so as to provide a neutral context for the narrative. The story focuses on DeWar, bodyguard to General UrLeyn, the Prime Protector of the Protectorate of Tassasen. Protector UrLeyn is the leader of Tassasen, having killed the previous monarch in a revolt; subsequently he eliminated official terms such as &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; within Tassasen. At the beginning of the story the Protectorate is fast approaching a war with the neighbouring land of Ladenscion, led by barons who initially supported UrLeyn&#x27;s revolution but now intend to establish themselves as independent.

DeWar is the sometimes-confidant of UrLeyn, but the bodyguard also maintains a friendly, conversational relationship with Perrund, a member of the Tassasen harem. Perrund was once the Protector&#x27;s prized concubine, which changed following an assassination attempt on UrLeyn; Perrund shielded the Protector with her body, saving his life at the cost of crippling her left arm. Though no longer as prized as a concubine, Perrund is highly regarded by UrLeyn, DeWar, and most of Tassasen society. DeWar in particular finds her easy to confide in, and spends much of his off-time playing board games with her while the two tell each other stories.

DeWar is on high alert as the conflict with Ladenscion approaches, believing that someone within the court may be a traitor. An attempt is made on UrLeyn&#x27;s life by an assassin disguised as an ambassador, though DeWar anticipates the threat and kills the man before he can succeed. Nonetheless, this act only reinforces DeWar&#x27;s fears of a traitor.

A surprising, unwelcome turn comes when UrLeyn&#x27;s young son, Lattens, has a seizure and subsequently falls ill. While the boy slowly recovers, DeWar tells him stories of a &quot;magical land&quot; called Lavishia, a place where &quot;every man was a king, every woman a queen&quot;. Eventually the boy recovers, and UrLeyn and his bodyguard depart for the front lines, where the war with Ladenscion is flagging. However, no sooner are they there than word arrives that Lattens has fallen ill again, prompting a distraught UrLeyn to rush back to the castle.

While DeWar is gone, Perrund tells Lattens a story about a girl named Dawn, who spent most of her life locked in a basement by her cruel family and was eventually rescued by a travelling circus. When he returns, Perrund tells DeWar about the story, then tells him it was a shadow of the real story: her story. Rather than her parents locking her in the basement to be cruel, they locked her in to hide her from Imperial soldiers—high-ranking men of the former King&#x27;s regime. Rather than being rescued, the soldiers found her, raped her, her mother and her sisters, and then forced her to watch as they murdered her father and brothers. The soldiers were eventually killed, but Perrund still feels she is now dead inside. DeWar attempts to in some way comfort her, but she quickly demands he return her to the harem.

Lattens&#x27; condition continues to worsen, causing UrLeyn to act more and more erratically, spending less time focusing on the war and more time at his son&#x27;s bedside. The Protector goes so far as to bar all visitors to his chambers, and even prohibits DeWar from speaking to him unless he is spoken to. His only real contact is with Perrund, who spends most nights holding UrLeyn as he cries himself to sleep. DeWar enlists Perrund&#x27;s help in focusing UrLeyn on the war, but to no success.

An epiphany strikes DeWar when he finds he has drooled on his pillow in his sleep, and he proceeds to Lattens&#x27; room. A guard restrains the boy&#x27;s nurse while DeWar examines his security blanket, finding it has been soaked in an unknown fluid, presumably poison. Under threat of death the nurse reveals who has been orchestrating the poisoning: Perrund. DeWar storms into the harem chambers, intent on revealing the conspiracy to UrLeyn, but arrives too late; Perrund has already killed the Protector, and calmly waits for the bodyguard. Holding her at sword-point, DeWar tearfully demands to know why she conspired against the Protector. Perrund replies that she did it for revenge, for killing her and her family. The soldiers who raped her were not the former King&#x27;s men at all, not even men allied to UrLeyn, but the man himself, as well as his current, closest advisers. Afterwards she was taken in by men from Haspidus, and recruited as a spy by King Quience directly. Saving UrLeyn from the assassin was simply to prevent him from dying while he was a strong leader; instead, her orders were to ensure he died in &quot;utter ruin&quot; to put his citizens off the idea of states without a monarch, as UrLeyn had envisaged Tassasen being.

After her confession, Perrund demands DeWar kill her. He silently refuses, lowering his sword. Perrund grabs his knife and brings it to her own throat, but it is quickly knocked away by DeWar&#x27;s blade, which he lowers once more.

===Epilogue===
Oelph gives a brief, personal epilogue for both stories. The three conspirators who attempted to kill Vosill died of various diseases, only Adlain lasting longer than a few years. King Quience reigned for forty years before his death, and was succeeded by one of his many daughters, giving the kingdom its first ruling Queen. Vosill disappeared from the ship she departed on; her disappearance was only discovered after a sudden burst of wind and chain-fire struck the ship, then vanished as quickly. Attempts to notify Vosill&#x27;s family in Drezen were unsuccessful: nobody in the island country could be found who had ever met her. Oelph himself became a doctor, eventually taking Vosill&#x27;s post as the royal physician. Tassasen endured a civil war after the death of Protector UrLeyn; eventually King Lattens took control of the Empire, ruling it quietly.

Oelph explains that he stopped DeWar&#x27;s story as he did because that is where versions of the story differ dramatically. The more popular version has DeWar personally execute Perrund, followed by a return to the Half-Hidden Kingdoms where he reclaims his hidden title as Prince, and eventually King. A second version, supposedly written by Perrund herself, instead has DeWar telling the waiting guards and staff that UrLeyn is fine but sleeping, this and other distractions providing enough time for him and the former concubine to flee Tassasen before the Protector&#x27;s body is discovered. The two elude capture and arrive in the Half-Hidden Kingdoms, eventually marry, have several children, and die many years later in an avalanche in the mountains.

Finally, Oelph ends his epilogue by revealing that he expects his wife, whom he loves dearly, to return soon, quite possibly with his grandchildren accompanying her.

==References to the Culture==
The initial hardback printing of the book contained the following &quot;Note on the Text&quot;, which was omitted from subsequent paperback editions:

Some reviewers noted the joking reference to &quot;Culture&quot; in this.

DeWar&#x27;s tales of Lavishia clearly parallel The Culture as it is described in Banks&#x27; other novels. He also tells of a pair of close friends who disagree about how their advanced society should manage contact with more primitive cultures:

It is evident that Vosill and DeWar are these two alien friends, now no longer in contact with each other, who have both come to the medieval planet and are independently attempting to do the &quot;right thing&quot; in their own differing ways, with Vosill being active and DeWar reactive.

Doctor Vosill also habitually carried with her a dagger that came to be peripherally involved in circumstances suggestive of a disguised Culture knife missile, to which dagger she referred as having been useful in &quot;uncultured places&quot;. This dagger is also described as being encrusted with small gems, the number of which decreases over time—each gem probably one of the many different kinds of ammunition drone missiles are seen to be capable of firing throughout the Culture series.

The Epilogue contains this passage:

Special Circumstances is the euphemistic name given to the &quot;black ops&quot; division of the Culture&#x27;s Contact unit.

The epilogue also relates two different accounts of the fate of DeWar and Perrund. The second of these, where DeWar and Perrund hastily leave after she had killed UrLeyn, tells that the couple became merchants with their company symbol being &quot;a simple torus, a ring, which might be cut from the end of a hollow pipe.&quot; Oelph then goes on to speculate that there is some connection between this symbol and facets of his own and the Doctor&#x27;s story, though is of course unaware of the resemblance between the company&#x27;s symbol and a Culture orbital.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;Atmospheric, ironic, resourceful, and all the parts add up—yet something sets the teeth on edge.&quot;

<text>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent agency of the United States government tasked with environmental protection matters. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA on July 9, 1970; it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate.

The agency is led by its administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The current administrator is Lee Zeldin. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank. The EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. There are regional offices for each of the agency&#x27;s ten regions, as well as 27 laboratories around the country.

The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures.

It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.

The agency&#x27;s budgeted employee level in 2023 was 16,204.1 full-time equivalent (FTE). More than half of EPA&#x27;s employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists.

==History==
===Background===
Beginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator James E. Murray introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act (RCA) of 1959, in the 86th Congress. The bill would have established a Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive Office of the President, declared a national environmental policy, and required the preparation of an annual environmental report. The conservation movement was weak at the time and the bill did not pass Congress.

The 1962 publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, a best-selling book by Rachel Carson, alerted the public about the detrimental effects on animals and humans of the indiscriminate use of pesticide chemicals.

In the years following, Congress discussed possible solutions. In 1968, a joint House–Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative George P. Miller, to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. Congress enacted the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the law was based on ideas that had been discussed in the 1959 and subsequent hearings.

The Richard Nixon administration made the environment a policy priority in 1969-1971 and created two new agencies, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and EPA. Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970. The law established the CEQ in the Executive Office of the President. NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The &quot;detailed statement&quot; would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement (EIS).

===Establishment===

On July 9, 1970, Nixon proposed an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency. This proposal included merging pollution control programs from a number of departments, such as the combination of pesticide programs from the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of the Interior. After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The EPA was created 90 days before it had to operate, and officially opened its doors on December 2, 1970. The agency&#x27;s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.

EPA&#x27;s primary predecessor was the former Environmental Health Divisions of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), and its creation caused one of a series of reorganizations of PHS that occurred during 1966–1973. From PHS, EPA absorbed the entire National Air Pollution Control Administration, as well as the Environmental Control Administration&#x27;s Bureau of Solid Waste Management, Bureau of Water Hygiene, and part of its Bureau of Radiological Health. It also absorbed the Federal Water Quality Administration, which had previously been transferred from PHS to the Department of the Interior in 1966. A few functions from other agencies were also incorporated into EPA: the formerly independent Federal Radiation Council was merged into it; pesticides programs were transferred from the Department of the Interior, Food and Drug Administration, and Agricultural Research Service; and some functions were transferred from the Council on Environmental Quality and Atomic Energy Commission.

Upon its creation, EPA inherited 84 sites spread across 26 states, of which 42 sites were laboratories. The EPA consolidated these laboratories into 22 sites.

===1970s===
In its first year, the EPA had a budget of $1.4 billion and 5,800 employees. At its start, the EPA was primarily a technical assistance agency that set goals and standards. Soon, new acts and amendments passed by Congress gave the agency its regulatory authority. A major expansion of the Clean Air Act was approved in December 1970.

EPA staff recall that in the early days there was &quot;an enormous sense of purpose and excitement&quot; and the expectation that &quot;there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country,&quot; leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America&#x27;s environment.

When EPA first began operation, members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad. Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government&#x27;s effectiveness, that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution.

The burning Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1969 led to a national outcry and criminal charges against major steel companies. The US Justice Department in late 1970 began pollution control litigation in cooperation with the new EPA. Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, better known as the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA established a national framework for addressing water quality, including mandatory pollution control standards, to be implemented by the agency in partnership with the states. Congress amended the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in 1972, requiring EPA to measure every pesticide&#x27;s risks against its potential benefits.

In 1973 President Nixon appointed Russell E. Train, to be the next EPA administrator. In 1974 Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, requiring EPA to develop mandatory federal standards for all public water systems, which serve 90% of the US population. The law required EPA to enforce the standards with the cooperation of state agencies.

In October 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) which, like FIFRA, related to the manufacture, labeling and usage of commercial products rather than pollution. This act gave the EPA the authority to gather information on chemicals and require producers to test them, gave it the ability to regulate chemical production and use (with specific mention of PCBs), and required the agency to create the National Inventory listing of chemicals.

Congress also enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, significantly amending the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. It tasked the EPA with setting national goals for waste disposal, conserving energy and natural resources, reducing waste, and ensuring environmentally sound management of waste. Accordingly, the agency developed regulations for solid and hazardous waste that were to be implemented in collaboration with states.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Douglas M. Costle as EPA administrator in 1977. To manage the agency&#x27;s expanding legal mandates and workload, by the end of 1979 the budget grew to $5.4 billion and the workforce size increased to 13,000.

===1980s===
In 1980, following the discovery of many abandoned or mismanaged hazardous waste sites such as Love Canal, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, nicknamed &quot;Superfund.&quot; The new law authorized EPA to cast a wider net for parties responsible for sites contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal and established a funding mechanism for assessment and cleanup.

In a dramatic move to the right, President Ronald Reagan in 1981 appointed Anne Gorsuch as EPA administrator. Gorsuch based her administration of EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states. She believed that EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating. Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.

Assistant Administrator Rita Lavelle was fired by Reagan in February 1983 because of her mismanagement of the Superfund program. Gorsuch had increasing confrontations with Congress over Superfund and other programs, including her refusal to submit subpoenaed documents. Gorsuch was cited for contempt of Congress and the White House directed EPA to submit the documents to Congress. Gorsuch and most of her senior staff resigned in March 1983. Reagan then appointed William Ruckelshaus as EPA administrator for a second term. As a condition for accepting his appointment, Ruckleshaus obtained autonomy from the White House in appointing his senior management team. He then appointed experienced competent professionals to the top management positions, and worked to restore public confidence in the agency.

Lee M. Thomas succeeded Ruckelshaus as administrator in 1985. In 1986 Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which authorized the EPA to gather data on toxic chemicals and share this information with the public. EPA also researched the implications of stratospheric ozone depletion. Under Administrator Thomas, EPA joined with several international organizations to perform a risk assessment of stratospheric ozone, which helped provide motivation for the Montreal Protocol, which was agreed to in August 1987.

In 1988, during his first presidential campaign, George H. W. Bush was vocal about environmental issues. Following his election victory, he appointed William K. Reilly, an environmentalist, as EPA administrator in 1989. Under Reilly&#x27;s leadership, the EPA implemented voluntary programs and initiated the development of a &quot;cluster rule&quot; for multimedia regulation of the pulp and paper industry. At the time, there was increasing awareness that some environmental issues were regional or localized in nature, and were more appropriately addressed with sub-national approaches and solutions. This understanding was reflected in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act and in new approaches by the agency, such as a greater emphasis on watershed-based approaches in Clean Water Act programs.

===1990s===
In 1992 EPA and the Department of Energy launched the Energy Star program, a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency.

Carol Browner was appointed EPA administrator by President Bill Clinton and served from 1993 to 2001. Major projects during Browner&#x27;s term included:
* Initiation of the Brownfields pilot program in 1995
* Initial hazardous air pollution standards for petroleum refineries in 1995
* Initial lead paint abatement regulations under TSCA in 1996
* Update of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone in 1997.

Since the passage of the Superfund law in 1980, an excise tax had been levied on the chemical and petroleum industries, to support the cleanup trust fund. Congressional authorization of the tax was due to expire in 1995. Although Browner and the Clinton Administration supported continuation of the tax, Congress declined to reauthorize it. Subsequently, the Superfund program was supported only by annual appropriations, greatly reducing the number of waste sites that are remediated in a given year. (In 2021 Congress reauthorized an excise tax on chemical manufacturers.)

Major legislative updates during the Clinton Administration were the Food Quality Protection Act and the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act.

===2000s===
President George W. Bush appointed Christine Todd Whitman as EPA administrator in 2001. Whitman was succeeded by Mike Leavitt in 2003 and Stephen L. Johnson in 2005.

In March 2005 nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA&#x27;s inspector general had determined that the EPA&#x27;s regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees. The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by Harvard University which contradicted its position on mercury controls. The suit alleged that the EPA&#x27;s rule exempting coal-fired power plants from &quot;maximum available control technology&quot; was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA&#x27;s system of cap-and-trade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined. Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois&#x27;s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90% by 2009. In 2008—by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act. In response, EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule, and did so on March 16, 2011.

In July 2005 there was a delay in the issuance of an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars. The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it, but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute.

EPA initiated its voluntary WaterSense program in 2006 to encourage water efficiency through the use of a special label on consumer products.

In 2007 the state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson claimed that the EPA was working on its own standards, but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level, which would then preempt state laws. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with governors from 13 other states, stated that the EPA&#x27;s actions ignored federal law, and that existing California standards (adopted by many states in addition to California) were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards. It was reported that Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision.

In 2007 it was reported that EPA research was suppressed by career managers. Supervisors at EPA&#x27;s National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA&#x27;s integrated risk information system, which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA &quot;because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing&quot;. The 2007 report stated that EPA subjected employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint, even if those papers are written on personal time.

In December 2007 EPA administrator Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson&#x27;s finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.

In April 2008, the Union of Concerned Scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years.

President Barack Obama appointed Lisa P. Jackson as EPA administrator in 2009.

===2010s===
In 2010 it was reported that a $3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama administrations, and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps.

Between 2011 and 2012, some EPA employees reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure, and were concerned about the censorship of environmental reports.

President Obama appointed Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator in 2013.

In 2014, the EPA published its &quot;Tier 3&quot; standards for cars, trucks and other motor vehicles, which tightened air pollution emission requirements and lowered the sulfur content in gasoline.

In 2015, the EPA discovered extensive violations by Volkswagen Group in its manufacture of Volkswagen and Audi diesel engine cars, for the 2009 through 2016 model years. Following notice of violations and potential criminal sanctions, Volkswagen later agreed to a legal settlement and paid billions of US dollars in criminal penalties, and was required to initiate a vehicle buyback program and modify the engines of the vehicles to reduce illegal air emissions.

In August 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan to regulate emissions from power plants, projecting a 15-year cut of 32%, or 789 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. In 2019 it was voided and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy rule under the Trump administration, and in 2022 its constitutionality was ruled out by the Supreme Court.

In August 2015, the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill occurred when EPA contractors examined the level of pollutants such as lead and arsenic in a Colorado mine, and accidentally released over three million gallons of waste water into Cement Creek and the Animas River.
In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a branch of the World Health Organization, cited research linking glyphosate, an ingredient of the weed killer Roundup manufactured by the chemical company Monsanto, to non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. In March 2017, the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate-related non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma opened Monsanto emails and other documents related to the case, including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup&#x27;s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.&quot; The records show that Monsanto was able to prepare &quot;a public relations assault&quot; on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by Jess Rowland, the head of the EPA&#x27;s cancer assessment review committee at that time, months in advance. Emails also showed that Rowland &quot;had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review.&quot;

On February 17, 2017, President Donald Trump appointed Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator. The Democratic Party saw the appointment as a controversial move, as Pruitt had spent most of his career challenging environmental regulations and policies. He did not have previous experience in the environmental protection field and had received financial support from the fossil fuel industry. In 2017, the Presidency of Donald Trump proposed a 31% cut to the EPA&#x27;s budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs. However, this cut was not approved by Congress. Pruitt resigned from the position on July 5, 2018, citing &quot;unrelenting attacks&quot; due to ongoing ethics controversies.

President Trump appointed Andrew R. Wheeler as EPA administrator in 2019. Trump promised to eliminate EPA &quot;in almost every form&quot; leaving &quot;only tidbits&quot; intact.

On July 17, 2019, EPA management prohibited the agency&#x27;s Scientific Integrity Official, Francesca Grifo, from testifying at a House committee hearing. EPA offered to send a different representative in place of Grifo and accused the committee of &quot;dictating to the agency who they believe was qualified to speak.&quot; The hearing was to discuss the importance of allowing federal scientists and other employees to speak freely when and to whom they want to about their research without having to worry about any political consequences.

In September 2019 air pollution standards in California were once again under attack, as the Trump administration attempted to revoke a waiver issued to the state which allowed more stringent standards for auto and truck emissions than the federal standards.

=== 2020-2024 ===
President Joe Biden appointed Michael S. Regan to be administrator in 2021. Regan began serving on March 11, 2021.

In October 2021 EPA announced its &quot;PFAS Strategic Roadmap.&quot; PFASs are organofluorine chemical compounds referred to as &quot;forever chemicals&quot;. The roadmap is a &quot;whole-of-EPA&quot; strategy and the agency will consider the full life cycle of PFAS, including preventing PFAS from entering the environment, holding polluters accountable, and remediation of contaminated sites. It also will include drinking water monitoring and risk assessment for PFOA and PFOS in biosolids (processed sewage sludge used as fertilizer).

In December 2021 EPA issued new greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks. The standards, which will reduce climate pollution and improve public health, became effective for the 2023 vehicle model year.

In March 2022 the Biden administration allowed California to again set stricter auto emissions standards.

In August 2022 the EPA was allotted a listed ~$53.216 billion in funding pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The EPA listed 24 total initiatives, the most notable among them being greenhouse gas reduction and monitoring, a superfund petroleum tax, replacing current heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emission vehicles, and a methane incentive program.

On February 3, 2023, more than 100 train cars were derailed in East Palestine, and around half of those cars containing chemicals like butyl acrylate, vinyl chloride, and ethylhexyl acrylate. Subsequently, the chemicals combusted into a flame being seen from miles around and the fumes filled the air with residents reporting animals falling ill and a burning sensation in their eyes and nose. The EPA is monitoring the situation and experts recommend that local residents take part in the EPA&#x27;s at-home air screening.

On April 12, 2023, EPA proposed new federal vehicle tailpipe emissions standards that would accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The standards would require at least two-thirds of all new cars sold in the United States to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2032. The rules seek to reduce air pollution and climate change. The EPA sought public comment by July 25, 2023. If the rules were approved it would have a significant impact on the transportation sector and public health. In March 2024, EPA finalized the new rules and projected they would cut emissions by 7 billion metric tons, or 56% of 2026 levels, by 2032.

In April 2024, EPA finalized new standards for power plant carbon emissions, projecting cuts of 65,000 tons by 2028 and 1.38 billion tons by 2047. The agency also issued final drinking water standards for six PFAS compounds.

In December, 2024 the EPA announced it approved California&#x27;s plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. EPA Administrator Michael Regan granted a waiver under the Clean Air Act to California to implement the plan which was first announced in 2020. It required that by 2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20% plug-in hybrid models. California&#x27;s rules were adopted by 11 other states including New York, Massachusetts and Oregon.

===2025===
On February 27, 2025, EPA received a White House memo issues by Russell Vought to prepare for mass layoffs. Hours earlier Donald Trump said that there would be a 65 percent reduction in its roughly 17,000 personnel, which was later corrected to 65 percent overall agency budget cuts.

Each regional office also implements programs on Indian Tribal lands, except those programs delegated to tribal authorities.

==Legal authority==
The Environmental Protection Agency can only act pursuant to statutes—the laws passed by Congress. Appropriations statutes authorize how much money the agency can spend each year to carry out the approved statutes. The agency has the power to issue regulations. A regulation interprets a statute, and EPA applies its regulations to various environmental situations and enforces the requirements. The agency must include a rationale of why a regulation is needed. (&quot;See&quot; Administrative Procedure Act.) Regulations can be challenged in federal courts, either district court or appellate court, depending on the particular statutory provision.

===Related legislation===
EPA has principal implementation authority for the following federal environmental laws:
* Clean Air Act
* Clean Water Act
* Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&quot;Superfund&quot;)
* Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
* Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
* Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
* Safe Drinking Water Act
* Toxic Substances Control Act
* Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act
There are additional laws where EPA has a contributing role or provides assistance to other agencies. Among these laws are:
* Endangered Species Act
* Energy Independence and Security Act
* Energy Policy Act
* Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
* Food Quality Protection Act
* National Environmental Policy Act
* Oil Pollution Act
* Pollution Prevention Act

== Programs ==

EPA established its major programs pursuant to the primary missions originally articulated in the laws passed by Congress. Additional programs have been developed to interpret the primary missions. Some of the newer programs have been specifically authorized by Congress. Former administrator William Ruckelshaus observed in 2016 that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in &quot;silos&quot;, a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.

===Core programs===
====Air quality and radiation protection====
The Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) describes itself as the official authority in charge of &quot;developing national programs, policies, and regulations for controlling air pollution and radiation exposure.&quot; The OAR is responsible for enforcing the Clean Air Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act, and other applicable laws. The OAR is in charge of the Offices of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Atmospheric Protection, Transportation and Air Quality, and the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air.

=====Ambient standards=====
* National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
* State Implementation Plans (SIPs)

=====Stationary air pollution source standards=====
* New Source Performance Standards
* National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)
* Permits for industrial and commercial sources

=====Mobile source standards=====

* On-road vehicles regulation
* Non-road vehicle regulation (including aircraft, locomotives, marine transport, stationary engines)
* Transportation fuel controls
* National Vehicle Fuel and Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL)

=====Radiation protection=====
The Radiation Protection Program comprises seven project groups.
# Radioactive Waste
# Emergency Preparedness and Response Programs Protective Action Guides And Planning Guidance for Radiological Incidents: EPA developed a manual as guideline for local and state governments to protect the public from a nuclear accident, the 2017 version being a 15-year update.
# EPA&#x27;s Role in Emergency Response – Special Teams
# Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM) Program
# Radiation Standards for Air and Drinking Water Programs
# Federal Guidance for Radiation Protection
====Water quality====
=====Science and regulatory standards=====
* The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources which discharge to US waters. Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects. , the EPA has approved 47 states to administer all or portions of the permit program. EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country. The Water Quality Act of 1987 extended NPDES permit coverage to industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems. In 2016, there were 6,700 major point source NPDES permits in place and 109,000 municipal and industrial point sources with general or individual permits.

* Effluent guidelines (technology based standards) for industrial point sources and Water quality standards (risk-based standards) for water bodies, under Title III of the CWA
* Nonpoint source pollution programs
* The CWA Section 404 Program regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Permits are issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and reviewed by EPA, and may be denied if they would cause unacceptable degradation or if an alternative does not exist that does not also have adverse impacts on waters. Permit holders are typically required to restore or create wetlands or other waters to offset losses that cannot be avoided.
* EPA ensures safe drinking water for the public, by setting standards for more than 148,000 public water systems nationwide. EPA oversees states, local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The program includes regulation of injection wells to protect underground sources of drinking water.

=====Infrastructure financing=====
* The Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides grants to states which, along with matching state funds, are loaned to municipalities for wastewater and &quot;green&quot; infrastructure at below-market interest rates. These loans are expected to be paid back, creating revolving loan funds. Cumulative assistance from the revolving fund has surpassed US$172 billion . The revolving fund replaced the Construction Grants Program, which was phased out in 1990.
* The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provides financial assistance to local drinking water utilities. The total appropriation of DWSRF funds available to states, which allocate funds to individual utilities, is US$3.5 billion in 2024.

====Land, waste and cleanup====
* Regulation of solid waste (non-hazardous) and hazardous waste under RCRA. To implement the 1976 law, EPA published standards in 1979 for &quot;sanitary&quot; landfills that receive municipal solid waste. The agency published national hazardous waste regulations and established a nationwide permit and tracking system for managing hazardous waste. The system is largely managed by state agencies under EPA authorization. Standards were issued for waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs), and ocean dumping of waste was prohibited. In 1984 Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) which expanded several aspects of the RCRA program:
** The Land Disposal Restrictions Program sets treatment requirements for hazardous waste before it may be disposed on land. EPA began issuing treatment methods and levels of requirements in 1986 and these are continually adapted to new hazardous wastes and treatment technologies. The stringent requirements it sets and its emphasis on waste minimization practices encourage businesses to plan to minimize waste generation and prioritize reuse and recycling. From the start of the program in 1984 to 2004, the volume of hazardous waste disposed in landfills had decreased 94% and the volume of hazardous waste disposed of by underground injection had decreased 70%.
** The RCRA Corrective Action Program requires TSDFs to investigate and clean up hazardous releases at their own expense. In the 1980s, EPA estimated that the number of sites needing cleanup was three times more than the number of sites on the national Superfund list. The program is largely implemented through permits and orders. , the program has led to the cleanup of 18 million acres of land, of which facilities were primarily responsible for cleanup costs. The goal of EPA and states is to complete final remedies by 2020 at 3,779 priority facilities out of 6,000 that need to be cleaned up, according to EPA.
** Beginning in the mid-1980s EPA developed standards for small quantity generators of hazardous waste, pursuant to HSWA.
** EPA was mandated to conduct a review of landfill conditions nationwide. The agency reported in 1988 that the effectiveness of environmental controls at landfills varied nationwide, which could lead to serious contamination of groundwater and surface waters. EPA published a national plan in 1989 calling for state and local governments to better integrate their municipal solid waste management practices with source reduction and recycling programs.
** Regulation of Underground Storage Tanks. The Underground Storage Tank (UST) Program was launched in 1985 and covers about 553,000 active USTs containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals. Since 1984, 1.8 million USTs have been closed in compliance with regulations. 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico manage UST programs with EPA authorization. When the program began, EPA had only 90 staff to develop a system to regulate more than 2 million tanks and work with 750,000 owners and operators. The program relies more on local operations and enforcement than other EPA programs. Today, the program supports the inspection of all federally regulated tanks, cleans up old and new leaks, minimizes potential leaks, and encourages sustainable reuse of abandoned gas stations.
* Hazardous site cleanup. In the late 1970s, the need to clean up sites such as Love Canal that had been highly contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal became apparent. However the existing regulatory environment depended on owners or operators to perform environmental control. While the EPA attempted to use RCRA&#x27;s section 7003 to perform this cleanup, it was clear a new law was needed. In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as &quot;Superfund&quot;. This law enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for responsible parties, including past or present generators and transporters as well as current and past owners of the site to find funding. The act also established some funding and a tax mechanism on certain industries to help fund such cleanup. Congress did not renew the Superfund tax in the 1990s, and subsequently funding for cleanup actions was supported only by general appropriations. Congress restored an excise tax on chemical manufacturers in 2021, which will eventually increase the available budget for site cleanups. Today, due to restricted funding, most cleanup activities are performed by responsible parties under the oversight of the EPA and states. , more than 1,700 sites had been put on the cleanup list since the creation of the program. Of these, 370 sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list, cleanup is underway at 535, cleanup facilities have been constructed at 790 but need to be operated in the future, and 54 are not yet in cleanup stage.
* EPA&#x27;s oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and the Facility Response Plan (FRP) rules. The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store, handle, process, gather, transfer, refine, distribute, use or consume oil or oil products. Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to navigable waters (as defined in the Clean Water Act) or adjoining shorelines. Secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites.

====Chemical approval, manufacture and usage====
* EPA regulates pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act. The agency assesses, registers, regulates, and regularly reevaluates all pesticides legally sold in the United States. A few challenges this program faces are transforming toxicity testing, screening pesticides for endocrine disruptors, and regulating biotechnology and nanotechnology.
* EPA approves and regulates new chemicals issuing &quot;safety reviews&quot;.
* TSCA required EPA to create and maintain a national inventory of all existing chemicals in U.S. commerce. When the act was passed in 1976, there were more than 60,000 chemicals on the market that had never been comprehensively cataloged. To do so, the EPA developed and implemented procedures that have served as a model for Canada, Japan, and the European Union. For the inventory, the EPA also established a baseline for new chemicals that the agency should be notified about before being commercially manufactured. Today, this rule keeps the EPA updated on volumes, uses, and exposures of around 7,000 of the highest-volume chemicals via industry reporting.
* The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a resource established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act specifically for the public to learn about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities. TRI data support informed decision-making by communities, government agencies, companies, and others. Annually, the agency collects data from more than 20,000 facilities. The EPA has generated a range of tools to support the use of this inventory, including interactive maps and online databases such as ChemView.

====Enforcement====

* Civil enforcement and criminal enforcement programs. EPA develops and prosecutes administrative civil and judicial cases and provides legal support for cases and investigations initiated in its regional offices. Federal judicial actions (formal lawsuits) are filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of EPA.
* Compliance assistance. EPA identifies, prevents, and reduces noncompliance and environmental risks by establishing enforcement initiatives and ensuring effective monitoring and assessment of compliance.
* Federal facilities enforcement
* Environmental Justice program
In 2019 the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative, &quot;a network of academics, developers, and non-profit professionals&quot;, published a report which compared EPA enforcement statistics over time. The number of civil cases filed by EPA have gradually decreased, and in 2018 the criminal and civil penalties from EPA claims dropped over four times their amounts in 2013, 2016, and 2017. In 2016 EPA issued $6,307,833,117 in penalties due to violations of agency requirements, and in 2018 the agency issued $184,768,000 in penalties. EPA&#x27;s inspections and evaluations have steadily decreased from 2015 to 2018. Enforcement activity has decreased partially due to budget cuts within the agency.

===Additional programs===
* The EPA Safer Choice label, previously known as the &quot;Design for the Environment&quot; (DfE) label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance. When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.
* Through the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative, EPA&#x27;s Design for the Environment (DfE) recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants. Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water. Nonylphenol ethoxylates, commonly referred to as NPEs, are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant. The Safer Choice program identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates. These alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available. The CleanGredients website is an information source about safer surfactants.
* The Energy Star program, initiated in 1992, motivated major companies to retrofit millions of square feet of building space with more efficient lighting. , more than 40,000 Energy Star products were available including major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. In addition, the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings. In 2006, about 12 percent of new housing in the US displayed an Energy Star label. EPA estimates that the program saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone. The program has helped spread the use of LED traffic lights, efficient fluorescent lighting, power management systems for office equipment, and low standby energy use.
* EPA&#x27;s Smart Growth Program began in 1998 and was created to help communities improve their land development practices and get the type of development they want. Together with local, state, and national experts, EPA encourages development strategies that protect human health and the environment, create economic opportunities, and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels.
* The Brownfields Program started as a pilot program in the 1990s and was authorized by law in 2002. The program provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment, cleanup, and revitalization of brownfields. , the EPA estimates that program grants have resulted in 56,442 acres of land readied for reuse and leveraged 116,963 jobs and $24.2 billion to do so. Agency studies also found that property values around assessed or cleaned-up brownfields have increased 5.1 to 12.8 percent.
* EPA&#x27;s Indoor air quality Tools for Schools Program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants. It helps school personnel identify, solve, and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment. Through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building, schools can lower their students&#x27; and staff&#x27;s risk of exposure to asthma triggers.
* The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 requires EPA to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy. EPA established the Office of Environmental Education to implement this program.
* Clean School Bus USA is a national partnership to reduce children&#x27;s exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling, installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones. Its goal is to reduce both children&#x27;s exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses.
* The Green Chemistry Program encourages the development of products and processes that follow green chemistry principles. It has recognized more than 100 winning technologies. These reduce the use or creation of hazardous chemicals, save water, and reduce greenhouse gas release.
* The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, was authorized in a 2000 amendment to the Clean Water Act. The program focus is on coastal recreational waters, and requires EPA to develop criteria to test and monitor waters and notify public users of any concerns. The program involves states, local beach resource managers, and the agency in assessing risks of stormwater and wastewater overflows and enables better sampling, analytical methods, and communication with the public.
* The EPA has also established specific geographic programs for particular water resources such as the Chesapeake Bay Program, the National Estuary Program, and the Gulf of Mexico Program.
* Advance identification, or ADID, is a planning process used by the EPA to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material. The EPA conducts the process in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local states or Native American Tribes. , 38 ADID projects had been completed, and 33 were ongoing.
* EPA&#x27;s &quot;One Cleanup Program&quot; initiative was designed to improve coordination across different agency programs that have a role in cleanup at a particular site. The coordination efforts apply to the brownfields, federal facilities, USTs, RCRA and Superfund programs.
* EPA reviews environmental impact statements prepared by other agencies and maintains a national EIS filing system.

===Past programs===
* The former Construction Grants Program distributed federal grants for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment works from 1972 to 1990. While such grants existed before the 1972, the 1972 CWA expanded these grants dramatically. They were distributed through 1990, when the program and funding were replaced with the State Revolving Loan Fund Program.
* In 1991 under Administrator William Reilly, the EPA implemented its voluntary 33/50 program. This was designed to encourage, recognize, and celebrate companies that voluntarily found ways to prevent and reduce pollution in their operations. Specifically, it challenged industry to reduce Toxic Release Inventory emissions of 17 priority chemicals by 33% in one year and 50% in four years. These results were achieved before the commitment deadlines.
* Launched in 2006, the voluntary 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program worked with eight major companies to voluntarily reduce their global emissions of certain types of perfluorinated chemicals by 95% by 2010 and eliminate these emissions by 2015.

* In March 2004, the U.S. Navy transferred USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12), a &quot;Stalwart&quot; class ocean surveillance ship, to the EPA. The ship had been used in anti-submarine operations during the Cold War, was equipped with sidescan sonar, underwater video, water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline. One of the major missions of the &quot;Bold&quot; was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports. In 2013, the General Services Administration sold the &quot;Bold&quot; to Seattle Central Community College (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.

==Controversies==
===Scope and fulfillment of agency&#x27;s authority===
Congress enacted laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA with the intent of preventing and reconciling environmental damages. Beginning in 2018 under Administrator Andrew Wheeler, EPA revised some pollution standards that resulted in less overall regulation.
Furthermore, the CAA&#x27;s discretionary application has caused a varied application of the law among states. In 1970, Louisiana deployed its Comprehensive Toxic Air Pollutant Emission Control Program to comply with federal law. This program does not require pollution monitoring that is equivalent to programs in other states.

===Environmental justice===
The EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice. Administrator Christine Todd Whitman was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Executive Order 12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order. In a March 2004 report, the inspector general of the agency concluded that the EPA &quot;has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements&quot; for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies, and activities toward environmental justice. Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA&#x27;s Superfund program, and that this situation was worsening.
In August 2022 the EPA was allotted a listed ~42.8 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) towards what the EPA classifies as &quot;Advancing Environmental Justice&quot;, and published the statement &quot;Through the Inflation Reduction Act, EPA will improve the lives of millions of Americans by reducing pollution in neighborhoods where people live, work, play, and go to school; accelerating environmental justice efforts in communities overburdened by pollution for far too long; and tackling our biggest climate challenges while creating jobs and delivering energy security.&quot;
In September 2022 EPA announced the creation of a new Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights that reports directly to the EPA administrator. The new office has an expanded budget and staff with broader responsibilities than under the previous organizational arrangement.

===Freedom of Information Act processing performance===
In the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the EPA earned a D by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade.

===Pebble Mine===
Pebble Mine is a copper and gold mining project located in the southwest region of Alaska in the Bristol Bay region organized by Northern Dynasty Minerals. In 2014 the EPA released its statement on the impacts that mining would have on Bristol Bay and its tributaries. Among many things, the statement assesses geological, topographic, ecological, hydrological, and economic data and determined that mining could negatively impact the salmon population. Seeing as Bristol Bay and its watershed provides around 46% of the world&#x27;s sockeye salmon, the EPA did not want to risk an ecological disaster. In July 2014, before Northern Dynasty Minerals had submitted its EIS, EPA&#x27;s Region 10 office proposed restrictions pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, restrictions that would effectively prohibit the project. Northern Dynasty Minerals protested this decision and on July 18, 2014, in a published statement, Pebble Partnership CEO Tom Collier said that the project would continue its litigation against EPA; noted that the EPA&#x27;s action was under investigation by the EPA inspector general and by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and noted that two bills were pending in Congress seeking to clarify that EPA did not have the authority to preemptively veto or otherwise restrict development projects prior to the onset of federal and state permitting. Collier&#x27;s statement also said that EPA&#x27;s proposal was based on outdated mining scenarios that were not part of the project&#x27;s approach. Multiple journalists and organizations have reported on the controversy including the Natural Resources Defense Council in support of the cancelation of the project and John Stossel in support of the development of the mine. , the mine remains a controversial topic.
On January 30, 2023, the EPA vetoed the mine.

===Water quality in East Palestine, Ohio===
Ohio governor Mike DeWine and administrator of the EPA Michael Regan drank tap water in East Palestine, Ohio, on February 3, 2023, after a train derailment to show that the water was safe. The derailment caused a fire and the release of toxic chemicals into the air and water making locals and environmental groups concerned for the quality of water in the area. Despite the EPA&#x27;s assurance that the water is safe some residents do not trust the quality of the water and question its long-term effects.

<text>Year 405 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Barbatus, Capitolinus, Cincinnatus, Medullinus, Iullus and Mamercinus (or, less frequently, year 349 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 405 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* After their victory in the Battle of Arginusae over the Spartans, the Athenian fleet follows the reappointed Spartan admiral, Lysander, to the Hellespont. The Athenian fleet under Admiral Conon is destroyed by the Spartans under Lysander in the Battle of Aegospotami in the Sea of Marmara and Conon flees to Cyprus.
* The Spartan king Pausanias lays siege to Athens while Lysander&#x27;s fleet blockades Piraeus. This action closes the grain route through the Hellespont, thereby starving Athens.
* While the Peloponnesians besiege Athens, Theramenes tries to negotiate with Lysander. He is away for three months while Athens is being reduced to starvation. Then he heads the embassy that negotiates the terms of capitulation to the Spartans.

==== Sicily ====
* Dionysius the Elder rises to power as the tyrant of Syracuse. He makes peace with the Carthaginian general, Himilco (whose army has been weakened by the plague), and fortifies Syracuse. This treaty leaves Carthage in control of most of Sicily.
* Dionysius the Elder ruthlessly consolidates and expands his power. He builds a wall around Syracuse and fortifies Epipolae. The Greek citizens of Naxos, Catana, and Leontini are removed from their cities; many of them are enslaved and their homes are given to Sicilian and Italian mercenaries. Dionysius prepares his army to fight against Carthage, which now occupies western and southern Sicily.

=== By topic ===

==== Drama ====
* January – Aristophanes&#x27; play The Frogs is performed.
* March/April – Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot; and &quot;Iphigeneia at Aulis&quot; are performed posthumously as part of a tetralogy at the City Dionysia festival and win first prize.

==== Art ====
* The &quot;Erechtheum&quot;, which includes &quot;The Porch of Maidens&quot; (Caryatid Porch), is completed in the Ionian style on the Acropolis in Athens after 16 years of construction.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Philolaus, Greek mathematician and philosopher (approximate date) (b. c. 480 BC)

<text>Year 400 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Republic, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Esquilinus, Capitolinus, Vulso, Medullinus, Saccus and Vulscus (or, less frequently, year 354 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 400 BC for this year has been used in Europe since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became prevalent there.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
* Artaxerxes II, king of Persia, appoints Tissaphernes to take over all the districts in Asia Minor over which Artaxerxes II&#x27;s brother Cyrus had been governor before his revolt.
* Tamõs, the satrap of Ionia, fled from his satrapy in fear of the king&#x27;s retribution. He loaded his possessions onto his satrapy&#x27;s fleet of triremes and sailed to Egypt seeking the protection of Psammetichus, the King of the Egyptians. Psammetichus executed Tamõs and his family and took his possessions and fleet for himself.
* When the Greek cities of Ionia heard about Cyrus&#x27; defeat they knew Artaxerxes would want to exact his revenge on them for supporting Cyrus. They sent several embassies to Sparta to request the Lacedaemonians assistance. The Spartans sent Thibron who recruits 5,000 soldiers to aid the Ionian Greeks.
* Thibron embarks his army at the Isthmus of Corinth and sails to Ephesus on the Ionian coast. Upon arrival, he recruits an additional 2,000 soldiers and starts his campaign against Tissaphernes.
* Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; make their way back to Greece, with most of the men enlisting with the Spartans. Xenophon&#x27;s successful march through the Persian Empire encourages Sparta to turn on the Persians and begin wars against the Persians in Asia Minor.
* With the outbreak of the war between Sparta and the Persians, the Athenian admiral, Conon, obtains joint command, with Pharnabazus, of a Persian fleet.
* War breaks out between Sparta and Elis.
* London has its origins on a rise above marshy waters at the point where the Walbrook joins the River Thames. The Celtic king, Belin, rebuilds an earth wall surrounding a few dozen huts and orders a small landing place to be cut into the south side of the wall, along the river front, where a wooden quay is built (approximate date).
* Amyrtaeus of Sais successfully completes a revolt against Persian control by gaining control of all of Upper Egypt.
* The Olmec culture in Mesoamerica comes to an end as its city of La Venta is abandoned (approximate date).
* San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán is abandoned (approximate date).
* The Bianzhong of the Marquis Yi of Zheng are cast.
*India had the biggest epic on earth - The Mahabharata.

=== By topic ===
* The catapult is invented by Greek engineers.
* The Mature classical period of sculpture ends in Ancient Greece and is succeeded by the fourth-century (Late Classical) period (approximate date).
* A model of the Acropolis of Athens is made. It is now kept at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (approximate date).
* Theodorus from Phokaia in Asia Minor, builds the Tholos of Delphi, the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia in Delphi (approximate date).
* Dionysius I, Greek tyrant of Syracuse, confiscates gold and silver coins and re-mints them, keeping the weight the same but changing the denomination from one to two drachmae — the first known official devaluation at the expense of the general population. A virulent inflation ensues (approximate date).
* Zoroastrianism becomes the faith of many Persians. The Zoroastrians believe in a struggle between their god, Mazda, and the devil. They believe that the birth of their founder, the prophet Zarathustra, was the beginning of a final epoch that is to end in an Armageddon and triumph of good and evil.
* Brahmanism starts evolving in Hinduism, a process which takes place over the following 200 years (approximate date).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Antipater, a Macedonian general (d. 319 BC).
* Parmenion, Macedonian general under Alexander the Great (d. 330 BC).

== Deaths ==
* Aspasia of Miletus, widow of Pericles of Athens (approximate date) (b. c. 470 BC)
* Siddhārtha Gautama (also known as Buddha), founder of Buddhism (approximate date)
* Thucydides, Greek historian (approximate date) (b. c. 460 BC)

<doc id="58669" wikidata="Q268218" url="?curid=58669" title="Emperor of China">
<text>Throughout Chinese history, &quot;Emperor&quot; () was the superlative title held by the monarchs of imperial China&#x27;s various dynasties. In traditional Chinese political theory, the emperor was the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, an autocrat with the divine mandate to rule all under Heaven. Emperors were worshiped posthumously under an imperial cult. The lineage of emperors descended from a paternal family line constituted a dynasty, and succession in most cases theoretically followed agnatic primogeniture. The emperor of China was an absolute monarch.

During the Han dynasty, Confucianism gained sanction as the official political theory. The absolute authority of the emperor came with a variety of governing duties and moral obligations; failure to uphold these was thought to remove the dynasty&#x27;s Mandate of Heaven and to justify its overthrow. In practice, emperors sometimes avoided the strict rules of succession and dynasties&#x27; purported &quot;failures&quot; were detailed in official histories written by their successful replacements or even later dynasties. The power of the emperor was also limited by the imperial bureaucracy, which was staffed by scholar-officials, and eunuchs during some dynasties. An emperor was also constrained by filial obligations to his ancestors&#x27; policies and dynastic traditions, such as those first detailed in the Ming-era &quot;Huang-Ming Zuxun&quot; (&quot;Ancestral Instructions&quot;).

== Origin and history ==

During the Western Zhou dynasty (771 BC), Chinese vassal rulers with power over their particular fiefdoms served a strong central monarch. Following a brutal succession crisis and relocation of the royal capital, the power of the Zhou kings () waned, and during the Eastern Zhou period, the regional lords overshadowed the king and began to usurp that title for themselves. In 221 BC, after the King of Qin completed the conquest of the various kingdoms of the Warring States period, he adopted a new title to reflect his prestige as a ruler greater than the rulers before him. He called himself &quot;Shi Huangdi&quot;, or the &#x27;First Emperor&#x27;. Before this, &quot;Huang&quot; ( &#x27;august&#x27;, &#x27;sovereign&#x27;) was most commonly seen as a reverential epithet for a deceased ancestor, and &quot;Di&quot; (, ) was an apical ancestor, originally referring to the deified ancestors of the Shang kings. In the 3rd century BC, the two titles had not previously been used together. The emperor of China, like the Zhou kings before him, and the Shang kings before them, was most commonly referred to as &quot;Tianzi&quot; ( &#x27;Son of Heaven&#x27;), who was divinely appointed to rule. The appellation &quot;Huangdi&quot; carried similar shades of meaning. Alternate English translations of the word include &quot;The August Ancestor&quot;, &quot;The Holy Ruler&quot;, or &quot;The Divine Lord&quot;. On that account, some modern scholars translate the title as &quot;thearch&quot;.

On occasion, the father of the ascended emperor was still alive. Such an emperor was titled as the Taishang Huang (&#x27;grand imperial sire&#x27;). The practice was initiated by Qin Shi Huang, who gave the title as a posthumous name to his own father, as was already common for monarchs of any stratum of power. Liu Bang, who established the Han dynasty, was the first to become emperor while his father yet lived. It was said he granted the title during his father&#x27;s life because he would not be done obeisance to by his own father, a commoner.

Owing to political fragmentation, over the centuries, it has not been uncommon to have numerous claimants to the title of &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;. The Chinese political concept of the Mandate of Heaven essentially legitimized those claimants who emerged victorious. The proper list was considered those made by the official dynastic histories; the compilation of a history of the preceding dynasty was considered one of the hallmarks of legitimacy, along with symbols such as the Nine Ding or the Heirloom Seal of the Realm. As with the First Emperor, it remained very common to grant posthumous titles to the ancestors of the victors.

The Yuan and Qing dynasties were founded by successful invaders of different ethnic groups. As part of their rule over China, they also went through the culturally appropriate rituals of formally declaring a new dynasty and taking on the Chinese title of &quot;Huangdi&quot;, in addition to the titles of their respective people, especially in the case of the Yuan dynasty. Thus, Kublai Khan was simultaneously khagan of the Mongols and emperor of China.

== End of the imperial system ==

In 1911, the title of Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet was created to rule alongside the emperor, as part of an attempt to turn China into a constitutional monarchy.

Puyi, who had reigned as the Xuantong Emperor, abdicated on 12 February 1912, ending the Qing dynasty as well as the imperial tradition altogether, after more than 2100 years. Yuan Shikai, former President of the Republic of China, attempted to restore dynastic rule with himself as the Hongxian Emperor, however he abdicated the throne on 22 March 1916 after only 83 days. Puyi was briefly restored for 12 days during a coup in 1917 but was overthrown again shortly after. Although permitted to remain in the palace, he absconded to the Japanese concession in Tianjin in 1924. In 1934 he was installed as emperor of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state. In 1945, he was captured by the Red Army as a prisoner of war, where he was held in the Siberian city of Chita. In 1950, he was extradited to China and imprisoned in Fushun War Criminals Management Centre. He would be formally pardoned and released in 1959, working in a repair shop and as a researcher of literature and history until his death in 1967. 

The current head of the House of Aisin-Gioro and hypothetical claimant to the throne is Jin Yuzhang. He has worked for various local councils on China, and has no interest in the restoration of monarchy.

== Enumeration ==
Traditional political theory holds that there can only be one legitimate Son of Heaven at any given time. However, identifying the &quot;legitimate&quot; emperor during times of division is not always uncontroversial, and therefore the exact number of legitimate emperors depends on where one stands on a number of succession disputes. The two most notable such controversies are whether Cao Wei or Shu Han had legitimacy during the Three Kingdoms, and at what point the Song dynasty ceased to be the legitimate dynasty in favor of the Yuan dynasty. The Qing view, reported to Europe by the Jesuits, was that there had been 150 emperors from the First Emperor to the Kangxi Emperor. Adding the eight uncontroversial emperors that followed the Kangxi Emperor would give a grand total of 158 emperors from the First Emperor to Puyi.

By one count, from the Qin dynasty to the Qing dynasty, there were a total 557 individuals who at one point or another claimed the title of Emperor, including several simultaneous claimants at various times. Some, such as Li Zicheng, Huang Chao, and Yuan Shu, declared themselves the emperors, Son of Heaven and founded their own empires as a rival government to challenge the legitimacy of and overthrow the existing emperor. Among the most famous emperors were Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty, emperors Gaozu, Han Wudi as well as Guangwu of the Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang of the Tang, the Hongwu Emperor and Yongle Emperor of the Ming, and the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing.

== Power ==
The emperor&#x27;s words were considered sacred edicts (), and his written proclamations were called &#x27;directives from above&#x27; (). In theory, the emperor&#x27;s orders were to be obeyed immediately. He was elevated above all commoners, nobility and members of the Imperial family. Addresses to the emperor were always to be formal and self-deprecatory, even by the closest of family members.

In practice, however, the power of the emperor varied between different emperors and different dynasties. Generally, in the Chinese dynastic cycle, emperors founding a dynasty usually consolidated the empire through comparative autocracy—examples include Qin Shi Huang, emperors Gaozu and Guangwu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, Kublai Khan of the Yuan, and the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing.

The usual method for widespread geographic power consolidation was to involve the whole family. From generation to generation, the bonds weakened between the branches of family established as local rulers in different areas. After a sufficient period of time, their loyalty could no longer be assured, and the taxes they collected sapped the imperial coffers. This led to situations like the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, who disenfranchised and annihilated the nobilities of virtually all imperial relatives whose forebears had been enfeoffed by his own ancestor, Gaozu.

Apart from a few very energetic monarchs, the emperor usually delegated the majority of decision making to the civil bureaucracy (chiefly the chancellery and the Central Secretariat), the military, and in some periods the censorate. Paranoid emperors, like Emperor Wu of Han and the Ming&#x27;s Hongwu Emperor, would cycle through high government officials rapidly, or simply leave top-ranking posts vacant, such that no one could threaten their power. During other reigns, certain officials in the civil bureaucracy wielded more power than the emperor himself.

The emperor&#x27;s position, unless deposed in a rebellion, was always hereditary, usually by agnatic primogeniture. As a result, many emperors ascended the throne while still children. During minority reigns, the Empress Dowager, the emperor&#x27;s mother, would usually possess significant political power, along with the male members of her birth family. In fact, the vast majority of female rulers throughout Chinese Imperial history came to power by ruling as regents on behalf of their sons; prominent examples include Empress Lü Zhi of the Han, as well as the empress dowagers Cixi and Ci&#x27;an during the Qing, who for a time ruled jointly as co-regents. Where Empresses Dowager were too weak to assume power, or her family too strongly opposed, court officials often seized control. Court eunuchs had a significant role in the power structure, as emperors often relied on a few of them as confidants, which gave them access to many court documents. In a few places, eunuchs wielded vast power; one of the most powerful eunuchs in Chinese history was Wei Zhongxian during the Ming. Occasionally, other nobles seized power as regents.

The actual area ruled by the emperor of China varied from dynasty to dynasty. In some cases, such as during the Southern Song dynasty, political power in East Asia was effectively split among several governments; nonetheless, the political fiction that there was but one ruler was maintained.

== Heredity and succession ==

The title of &quot;emperor&quot; was hereditary, traditionally passed on from father to son in each dynasty. There are also instances where the throne is assumed by a younger brother, should the deceased emperor have no male offspring. By convention in most dynasties, the eldest son born to the Empress consort () succeeded to the throne. In some cases when the empress did not bear any children, the emperor would have a child with another of his many wives (all children of the emperor were said also to be the children of the empress, regardless of birth mother). In some dynasties the succession of the empress&#x27; eldest son was disputed, and because many emperors had large numbers of progeny, there were wars of succession between rival sons. In an attempt to resolve after-death disputes, the emperor, while still living, often designated a crown prince (). Even such a clear designation, however, was often thwarted by jealousy and distrust, whether it was the crown prince plotting against the emperor, or brothers plotting against each other. Some emperors, like the Yongzheng Emperor, after abolishing the position of Crown Prince, placed the succession papers in a sealed box, only to be opened and announced after his death.

Unlike, for example, the Japanese monarchy, Chinese political theory allowed for a change in the ruling house. This was based on the concept of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;. The theory behind this was that the Chinese emperor acted as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; and held a mandate to rule over everyone else in the world; but only as long as he served the people well. If the quality of rule became questionable because of repeated natural disasters such as flood or famine, or for other reasons, then rebellion was justified. This important concept legitimized the dynastic cycle or the change of dynasties. This principle made it possible even for peasants to found new dynasties, as happened with the Han and Ming dynasties, and for the establishment of conquest dynasties such as the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Manchu-led Qing dynasty. It was moral integrity and benevolent leadership that determined the holder of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;.

There has been only one lawful queen regnant in Chinese history, Wu Zetian, who briefly replaced the Tang dynasty with her own Wu Zhou dynasty. Many women, however, did become de facto leaders, usually as Empress Dowager. Prominent examples include Empress Dowager Lü of the Han, Empress Liu of the Song, and Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing.

== Styles, names and forms of address ==

As the emperor had, by law, an absolute position not to be challenged by anyone else, his subjects were to show the utmost respect in his presence, whether in direct conversation or otherwise. When approaching the imperial throne, one was expected to kowtow before the emperor. In a conversation with the emperor, it was considered a crime to compare oneself to the emperor in any way. It was taboo to refer to the emperor by his given name, even for the emperor&#x27;s own mother, who instead was to use &quot;Huangdi&quot; (), or simply &quot;Er&quot; ( &#x27;son&#x27;, for a male emperor). The given names of all the emperor&#x27;s deceased male ancestors were forbidden from being written, and were avoided () by the use of synonyms, homophones, or leaving out the final stroke of the taboo character. This linguistic feature can sometimes be used to date historical texts, by noting which words in parallel texts are altered.

The emperor was never to be addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Instead, one used &quot;Bixia&quot; ( &#x27;bottom of the steps&#x27;), corresponding to &quot;Your Imperial Majesty&quot; and originally referring to his attendants, &quot;Huangshang&quot; ( &#x27;imperial highness&#x27;, &quot;Shengshang&quot; ( &#x27;holy highness&#x27;) or &quot;Tianzi&quot; ( &#x27;Son of Heaven&#x27;). The emperor was also alluded to indirectly through reference to the imperial dragon symbology. Servants often addressed the emperor as &quot;Wansuiye&quot; ( &#x27;lord of ten thousand years&#x27;). The emperor referred to himself as &quot;zhen&quot; (), the original Chinese first-person singular pronoun arrogated by Qin Shi Huang, functioning as an equivalent to the royal we. In front of subjects, the emperor may also refer to themselves self-deprecatingly as &quot;Guaren&quot; ( &#x27;the morally-deficient one&#x27;) or &quot;Gu&quot; ( &#x27;lonely one&#x27;).

In contrast to the Western convention of using a regnal or personal name (e.g. George V) to refer to a sovereign, the emperor was referred to in the third person simply as &quot;Huangdi Bixia&quot; ( &#x27;His Majesty the Emperor&#x27;) or &quot;Dangjin Huangshang&quot; ( &#x27;present emperor above&#x27;). Under the Qing, the emperor was usually styled &#x27;His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the Great Qing Dynasty, Son of Heaven, Lord of Ten Thousand Years&#x27;, though this varied considerably. In historical texts, the present emperor was almost universally referred to as &quot;Shang&quot; ().

Generally, emperors also ruled with an era name (). Since the adoption of era names by Emperor Wu of Han and up until the Ming dynasty, the sovereign conventionally changed the era name semi-regularly during his reign. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, emperors simply chose one era name for their entire reign, and people often referred to past emperors with that title. In earlier dynasties, the emperors were known with a temple name given after their death. Most emperors were also given a posthumous name which was sometimes combined with the temple name (e.g. Emperor Shengzu Ren for the Kangxi Emperor). The passing of an emperor was referred to as &quot;Jiabeng&quot; ( &#x27;collapse of the imperial chariot&#x27;) and an emperor that had just died was referred to as &quot;Daixing Huangdi&quot; ( &#x27;the emperor of the great journey&#x27;).

== Consorts and children ==
In Imperial China, child marriage was the norm. The imperial family was made up of the emperor and the empress () as the primary consort and Mother of the Nation (). In addition, the emperor would typically have several other consorts and concubines (), ranked by importance into a harem, in which the Empress was supreme. Every dynasty had its set of rules regarding the numerical composition of the harem. During the Qing dynasty, for example, imperial convention dictated that at any given time there should be one &quot;Empress&quot;, one &quot;Imperial Noble Consort&quot;, two &quot;Noble Consort&quot;, four &quot;Consort&quot; and six &quot;Concubine&quot;, plus an unlimited number of &quot;Noble Lady&quot;, &quot;First Class Attendant&quot; and &quot;Second Class Attendant&quot;. Although the emperor had the highest status by law, by tradition and precedent the empress dowager () usually received the greatest respect in the palace and was the decision maker in most family affairs. At times, especially when a young emperor was on the throne, she was the de facto ruler. The emperor&#x27;s children, the princes () and princesses (), were often referred to by their order of birth—e.g. Eldest Prince or Third Princess. Princes were often given titles of peerage once they reached adulthood. The emperor&#x27;s brothers and uncles served in court by law, and held equal status with other court officials (). The emperor was always elevated above all others despite any chronological or generational superiority.

== Ethnicity ==

Recent scholarship is wary of applying present-day ethnic categories to historical situations. Most Chinese emperors have been considered members of the Han ethnicity, but there were also many Chinese emperors who were of non-Han ethnic origins. The most successful of these were the Khitans of the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), who later ruled the Qing dynasty as the Manchus, and the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty. The orthodox historical view sees these as dynasties as sinicized polities as they adopted Han culture, claimed the Mandate of Heaven, and performed the traditional imperial obligations such as annual sacrifices to Heaven for rain and prosperity. The revisionist New Qing History school, however, argues that the interaction between politics and ethnicity was far more complex and that elements of these dynasties differed from and altered &quot;native Chinese&quot; traditions concerning imperial rule.

<doc id="58671" wikidata="Q3539111" url="?curid=58671" title="Tripropellant rocket">
<text>A tripropellant rocket is a rocket that uses three propellants, as opposed to the more common bipropellant rocket or monopropellant rocket designs, which use two or one propellants, respectively. Tripropellant systems can be designed to have high specific impulse and have been investigated for single-stage-to-orbit designs. While tripropellant engines have been tested by Rocketdyne and NPO Energomash, no tripropellant rocket has been flown.

There are two different kinds of tripropellant rockets. One is a rocket engine which mixes three separate streams of propellants, burning all three propellants simultaneously. The other kind of tripropellant rocket is one that uses one oxidizer but two fuels, burning the two fuels in sequence during the flight.

== Simultaneous burn ==
Simultaneous tripropellant systems often involve the use of a high energy density metal additive, like beryllium or lithium, with existing bipropellant systems. In these motors, the burning of the fuel with the oxidizer provides activation energy needed for a more energetic reaction between the oxidizer and the metal. While theoretical modeling of these systems suggests an advantage over bipropellant motors, several factors limit their practical implementation, including the difficulty of injecting solid metal into the thrust chamber; heat, mass, and momentum transport limitations across phases; and the difficulty of achieving and sustaining combustion of the metal.

In the 1960s, Rocketdyne test-fired an engine using a mixture of liquid lithium, gaseous hydrogen, and liquid fluorine to produce a specific impulse of 542 seconds, likely the highest measured such value for a chemical rocket motor. Despite the high specific impulse, the technical difficulties of the combination and the hazardous nature of the propellants ensured the engine has not been developed further.

== Sequential burn ==
In sequential tripropellant rockets, the fuel is changed during flight, so the motor can combine the high thrust of a dense fuel like kerosene early in flight with the high specific impulse of a lighter fuel like liquid hydrogen (LH2) later in flight. The result is a single engine providing some of the benefits of staging.

For example, injecting a small amount of liquid hydrogen into a kerosene-burning engine can yield significant specific impulse improvements without compromising propellant density. This was demonstrated by the RD-701 achieving a specific impulse of 415 seconds in vacuum (higher than the pure LH2/LOX RS-68), where a pure kerosene engine with a similar expansion ratio would achieve 330–340 seconds.

Although liquid hydrogen delivers the largest specific impulse of the plausible rocket fuels, it also requires huge structures to hold it due to its low density. These structures can weigh a lot, offsetting the light weight of the fuel itself to some degree, and also result in higher drag while in the atmosphere. While kerosene has lower specific impulse, its higher density results in smaller structures, which reduces stage mass, and furthermore reduces losses to atmospheric drag. In addition, kerosene-based engines generally provide higher thrust, which is important for takeoff, reducing gravity drag. So in general terms there is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; in altitude where one type of fuel becomes more practical than the other.

Traditional rocket designs use this sweet spot to their advantage via staging. For instance the Saturn Vs used a lower stage powered by RP-1 (kerosene) and upper stages powered by LH2. Some of the early Space Shuttle design efforts used similar designs, with one stage using kerosene into the upper atmosphere, where an LH2 powered upper stage would light and go on from there. The later Shuttle design is somewhat similar, although it used solid rockets for its lower stages.

SSTO rockets could simply carry two sets of engines, but this would mean the spacecraft would be carrying one or the other set &quot;turned off&quot; for most of the flight. With light enough engines this might be reasonable, but an SSTO design requires a very high mass fraction and so has razor-thin margins for extra weight.

At liftoff the engine typically burns both fuels, gradually changing the mixture over altitude in order to keep the exhaust plume &quot;tuned&quot; (a strategy similar in concept to the plug nozzle but using a normal bell), eventually switching entirely to LH2 once the kerosene is burned off. At that point the engine is largely a straight LH2/LOX engine, with an extra fuel pump hanging onto it.

The concept was first explored in the US by Robert Salkeld, who published the first study on the concept in &quot;Mixed-Mode Propulsion for the Space Shuttle&quot;, &quot;Astronautics&quot; &quot;&amp;&quot; &quot;Aeronautics&quot;, which was published in August 1971. He studied a number of designs using such engines, both ground-based and a number that were air-launched from large jet aircraft. He concluded that tripropellant engines would produce gains of over 100% (essentially more than double) in payload fraction, reductions of over 65% in propellant volume and better than 20% in dry weight. A second design series studied the replacement of the Shuttle&#x27;s SRBs with tripropellant based boosters, in which case the engine almost halved the overall weight of the designs. His last full study was on the &quot;Orbital Rocket Airplane&quot; which used both tripropellant and (in some versions) a plug nozzle, resulting in a spaceship only slightly larger than a Lockheed SR-71, able to operate from traditional runways.

Tripropellant engines were built in Russia. Kosberg and Glushko developed a number of experimental engines in 1988 for a SSTO spaceplane called MAKS, but both the engines and MAKS were cancelled in 1991 due to a lack of funding. Glushko&#x27;s RD-701 was built and test fired, however, and although there were some problems, Energomash feels that the problems are entirely solvable and that the design does represent one way to reduce launch costs by about 10 times.

<text> (Latin for &#x27;by scripture alone&#x27;) is a Christian theological doctrine held by most Protestant Christian denominations, in particular the Lutheran and Reformed traditions, that posits the Bible as the sole infallible source of authority for Christian faith and practice. The Catholic Church considers it heresy and generally the Orthodox churches consider it to be contrary to the phronema of the Church.

While the scriptures&#x27; meaning is mediated through many kinds of subordinate authority—such as the ordinary teaching offices of a church, the ecumenical creeds, councils of the Catholic Church, or even personal special revelation— in contrast rejects any infallible authority other than the Bible. In this view, all non-scriptural authority is derived from the authority of the scriptures or is independent of the scriptures, and is, therefore, subject to reform when compared to the teaching of the Bible.

 is a formal principle of many Protestant Christian denominations, and one of the five &quot;solae&quot;. It was a foundational doctrinal principle of the Protestant Reformation held by many of the Reformers, who taught that authentication of Scripture is governed by the discernible excellence of the text, as well as the personal witness of the Holy Spirit to the heart of each man. 

By contrast, the Protestant traditions of Anglicanism, Methodism and Pentecostalism uphold the doctrine of , with scripture being illumined by tradition and reason. The Methodists thought reason should be delineated from experience, though the latter was classically filed under the former and guided by reason, nonetheless this was added, thus changing the &quot;Anglican Stool&quot; to the four sides of the Wesleyan Quadrilateral. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that to &quot;accept the books of the canon is also to accept the ongoing Spirit-led authority of the church&#x27;s tradition, which recognizes, interprets, worships, and corrects itself by the witness of Holy Scripture&quot;. The Catholic Church officially regards tradition and scripture as equal, forming a single deposit, and considers the magisterium as the living organ which interprets said deposit. The Roman magisterium thus serves Tradition and Scripture as &quot;one common source [...] with two distinct modes of transmission&quot;, while some Protestant authors call it &quot;a dual source of revelation&quot;.

Many Protestants want to distinguish the view that scripture is the only rule of faith with the exclusion of other sources (nuda scriptura), from the view taught by Luther and Calvin that the scripture alone is infallible, without excluding church tradition in its entirety, viewing them as subordinate and ministerial.

== History ==

Augustine of Hippo is frequently cited by Protestants as a Church Father who espoused the doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. The following is a passage in Augustine&#x27;s letter (82) to Jerome, which is given as evidence for Augustine&#x27;s adherence to the notion that Scripture is of a uniquely infallible authority in contrast to the writings of all other men. It is also noteworthy that Augustine attributes his view to Jerome.I admit to your Charity that it is from those books alone of the Scriptures, which are now called canonical, that I have learned to pay them such honor and respect as to believe most firmly that not one of their authors has erred in writing anything at all. If I do find anything in those books which seems contrary to truth, I decide that either the text is corrupt, or the translator did not follow what was really said, or that I failed to understand it. But, when I read other authors, however eminent they may be in sanctity and learning, I do not necessarily believe a thing is true because they think so, but because they have been able to convince me, either on the authority of the canonical writers or by a probable reason which is not inconsistent with truth. And I think that you, my brother, feel the same way; moreover, I say, I do not believe that you want your books to be read as if they were those of Prophets or Apostles, about whose writings, free of all error, it is unlawful to doubt.Protestants also argue that Augustine professes the sufficiency of Scripture in this sentence from &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;, &quot;among the things that are plainly laid down in Scripture are to be found all matters that concern faith and the manner of life&quot;.

In the 14th century, Marsilius of Padua believed that the only authority for a Christian is the scriptures, instead of the pope. The same point was made by John Wycliffe who foreshadowed the doctrine in the 14th century.

Johann Ruchrat von Wesel, Wessel Gansfort and Johannes von Goch also foreshadowed the Protestant view of : they viewed the scripture as being the only infallible authority and denied the authority of the pope or the church as infallible. Peter Abelard believed that human reason was a means of understanding the scriptures, instead of submitting to everything the Catholic Church defines.

Some elements of sola-scriptura are also foreshadowed by William of Ockham and Girolamo Savonarola.

==Overview==
 is one of the five , considered by some Protestant groups to be the theological pillars of the Reformation. The key implication of the principle is that interpretations and applications of the scriptures don&#x27;t have the same authority as the scriptures themselves; hence, the authority of the church is viewed as subject to correction by the scriptures, even by an individual member of the church.

Martin Luther, 16th-century friar and figurehead of the Protestant Reformation, stated that &quot;a simple layman armed with Scripture is greater than the mightiest pope without it&quot;. The intention of the Reformation was thus to correct what he asserted to be the errors of the Catholic Church, by appealing to the uniqueness of the Bible&#x27;s textual authority. Catholic doctrine is based on sacred tradition, as well as scripture. rejected the assertion that infallible authority was given to the magisterium to interpret both Scripture and tradition.

, however, does not ignore Christian history, tradition, or the church when seeking to understand the Bible. Rather, it sees the church as the Bible&#x27;s interpreter, the &quot;rule of faith&quot; () embodied in the ecumenical creeds as the interpretive context, and scripture as the only final authority in matters of faith and practice. As Luther said, &quot;The true rule is this: God&#x27;s Word shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel can do so.&quot;

===Characteristics in Lutheranism===

Lutheranism teaches that the books of the Old and New Testaments are the only divinely inspired books and the only source of divinely revealed knowledge. Scripture alone is the formal principle of the faith in Lutheranism, the final authority for all matters of faith and morals because of its inspiration, authority, clarity, efficacy, and sufficiency.

====Inspiration====
Lutheranism teaches that the Bible does not merely contain the Word of God, but every word of it is, because of verbal inspiration, the word of God. Most Lutheran traditions acknowledge that understanding scriptures is complex given that the Bible contains a collection of manuscripts and manuscript fragments that were written and collected over thousands of years. For example, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America teaches that &quot;Lutheran Christians believe that the story of God&#x27;s steadfast love and mercy in Jesus is the heart and center of what the Scriptures have to say.&quot;

As Lutherans confess in the Nicene Creed, the Holy Spirit &quot;spoke through the prophets&quot;. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession identifies &quot;Holy Scripture&quot; with the Word of God and calls the Holy Spirit the author of the Bible. Because of this, Lutherans confess in the Formula of Concord, &quot;we receive and embrace with our whole heart the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of Israel&quot;. The apocryphal books were not written by the prophets, by inspiration; they contain errors, were never included in the Palestinian Canon that Jesus used, and therefore are not a part of scripture. The prophetic and apostolic Scriptures are said by the Lutheran church to be authentic as written by the prophets and apostles, and that a correct translation of their writings is God&#x27;s Word because it has the same meaning as the original Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek. A mistranslation is not God&#x27;s word, and no human authority can invest it with divine authority.
====Divine authority====
Scripture, regarded as the word of God, carries the full authority of God in Lutheranism: every single statement of the Bible calls for instant, unqualified and unrestricted acceptance. Every doctrine of the Bible is the teaching of God and therefore requires full agreement. Every promise of the Bible calls for unshakable trust in its fulfillment; every command of the Bible is the directive of God himself and therefore demands willing observance.

What is said here of &quot;every statement of the Bible&quot; does not represent the faith of all Lutherans: a 2001 survey showed that 72 percent of members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America do not accept that everything in the Bible is literal, but that it may contain scientific or historical errors or describe events symbolically.

====Clarity====

Lutheranism teaches that the Bible presents all doctrines and commands of the Christian faith clearly; that God&#x27;s word is freely accessible to every reader or hearer of ordinary intelligence, without requiring any special education. It also teaches that readers must understand the language God&#x27;s word is presented in, and not be so preoccupied by contrary thoughts so as to prevent understanding. It teaches that, consequently, no one needs to wait for any clergy, and pope, scholar, or ecumenical council to explain the real meaning of any part of the Bible.
====Efficacy====
Lutheranism teaches that scripture is united with the power of the Holy Spirit and with it, not only demands but also creates the acceptance of its teaching. This teaching produces faith and obedience. Scripture is not a dead letter, but rather, the power of the Holy Spirit is inherent in it. Scripture does not compel a mere intellectual assent to its doctrine, resting on logical argumentation, but rather it creates the living agreement of faith. The Smalcald Articles affirm, &quot;in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word&quot;.

====Sufficiency====
Lutheranism teaches that the Bible contains everything that one needs to know in order to obtain salvation and to live a Christian life. There are no deficiencies in scripture that need to be filled with by tradition, pronouncements of the Pope, new revelations, or present-day development of doctrine.

===Characteristics in the Reformed faith===
&quot;Sola scriptura&quot; in the Reformed faith possesses the same characteristics to those of Lutheranism: inspiration, authority, clarity, efficacy, and sufficiency.

Article 3 of the Belgic Confession, a Reformed confessional of faith, teaches the divine inspiration of Scripture, &quot;We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of man, but &quot;that holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost&quot;, as the apostle Peter saith ().&quot;

Article 7 teaches the sole infallibility or unique authority of Scripture, &quot;Neither do we consider of equal value any writing of men, however holy these men may have been, with those divine Scriptures; nor ought we to consider custom, or the great multitude, or antiquity, or succession of times and persons, or councils, decrees or statutes, as of equal value with the truth of God&quot;.

Chapter 1.7 of Westminster Confession of Faith, another authoritative Reformed confession, speaks of the use of &quot;ordinary means&quot; (such as turning to pastors and teachers) for reaching an understanding of what is contained in scripture and what is necessary to know, while still espousing the doctrine of the clarity or perspicuity of Scripture; &quot;All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all, yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them&quot;.

In the same chapter, &quot;efficacy&quot; is ascribed to the doctrine of Scripture.

The sufficiency of Scripture is also taught in Article 7 of the Belgic Confession, &quot;We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein.&quot;

==&quot;Prima scriptura&quot;==
 may be contrasted with , which holds that, besides canonical scripture, there are other guides for what a believer should believe, and how he or she should live. Examples of this include the general revelation in creation, traditions, charismatic gifts, mystical insight, angelic visitations, conscience, common sense, the views of experts, the spirit of the times or something else. suggests that ways of knowing or understanding God and his will, that do not originate from canonized scripture, are in a second place, perhaps helpful in interpreting that scripture, but testable by the canon and correctable by it, if they seem to contradict the scriptures.

Two Christian denominations that uphold the position of are Anglicanism and Methodism. In the Anglican tradition, scripture, tradition, and reason form the &quot;Anglican triad&quot; or &quot;three-legged stool&quot;, formulated by the Anglican theologian Richard Hooker. With respect to the Methodist tradition, &quot;A Dictionary for United Methodists&quot; states:
&quot;Sola scriptura&quot; rejects any original infallible authority, other than the Bible. In this view, all secondary authority is derived from the authority of the scriptures and is therefore subject to reform when compared to the teaching of the Bible. Church councils, preachers, biblical commentators, private revelation, or even a message allegedly from an angel or an apostle are not an original authority alongside the Bible in the &quot;sola scriptura&quot; approach.

==Scripture and sacred tradition==
The Roman Catholic Church, against whom the Protestants directed these arguments, did not see Scripture and the Sacred Tradition of the faith as different sources of authority, but that Scripture was handed down as part of Sacred Tradition (see 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 2 Timothy 2:2).

The Catholic Church holds that the Gospel was transmitted by the apostles by their oral preaching, by example, and by observances handed on what they had received from the lips of Christ, from living with Him, and from what He did, or what they had learned through the prompting of the Holy Spirit; as well as by those apostles and apostolic men who under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit committed the message of salvation to writing. &quot;This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though closely connected to it.&quot; &quot;Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God.&quot;

The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus&#x27; teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit. (The Catholic Church distinguishes Sacred Tradition from lesser ecclesiastical traditions—local customs that may be retained, modified or even abandoned.) As explained by Athanasius of Alexandria, &quot;Let us look at the very tradition, teaching, and faith of the Catholic Church from the very beginning, which the Logos gave (edoken), the Apostles preached (ekeryxan), and the Fathers preserved (ephylaxan). Upon this the Church is founded (tethemeliotai)&quot;(St. Athanasius, &quot;First Letter to Serapion&quot;, 28)

The doctrines which constitute Sacred Tradition are also perceived by the Church as cohesive in nature. The proper interpretation of the Scriptures was seen as part of the faith of the Church and seen indeed as the manner in which biblical authority was upheld (see Book of Acts 15:28–29). The meaning of Scripture was seen as proven from the faith universally held in the churches (see Phil. 2:1, Acts 4:32), and the correctness of that universal faith was seen as proven from the Scriptures and apostolic Sacred Tradition (see 2 Thes. 2:15, 2 Thes. 3:6, 1 Corinthians 11:2). The Biblical canon itself was thus viewed by the Church as part of the Church&#x27;s tradition, as defined by its leadership and acknowledged by its laity. The first generation of Christians did not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process of living Tradition.

The Catholic &quot;Dei verbum&quot; and the papal encyclicals &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot; by Pope Leo XIII and &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot; by Pope Pius XII set out Catholic teaching on tradition versus individual interpretation.

The Catholic Church teaches that Christ entrusted the preaching of the Gospel to the apostles, who handed it on orally and in writing, and according to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, &quot;the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books, was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time. &quot;Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God in which, as in a mirror, the pilgrim Church contemplates God, the source of all her riches.&quot; For the Eastern Orthodox too, &quot;the Holy Bible forms a part of Holy Tradition, but does not lie outside of it. One would be in error to suppose that Scripture and Tradition are two separate and distinct sources of Christian Faith, as some do, since there is, in reality, only one source; and the Holy Bible exists and found its formulation within Tradition&quot;.

Catholics apply to apostolic tradition many of the qualities that evangelicals and other Protestants apply to scripture alone. For example, the 1978 Evangelical declaration &quot;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy&quot;, states: &quot;We affirm that inspiration was the work in which God by His Spirit, through human writers, gave us His Word. The origin of Scripture is divine. The mode of divine inspiration remains largely a mystery to us. We deny that inspiration can be reduced to human insight, or to heightened states of consciousness of any kind.&quot;

Since the Catholic Church professes that apostolic tradition and scripture are both the word of God, Catholics can affirm that many of these propositions apply equally well to tradition: It is the work of the Holy Spirit, which cannot be reduced to human insight or heightened consciousness.

This ties in with the question of what constitutes apostolic tradition. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that this tradition is given &quot;by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of their preaching, by the example they gave, by the institutions they established, what they themselves had received – whether from the lips of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they had learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

There remains some confusion on the matter among both Catholics and non-Catholics. This confusion can be seen in those who interpret Catholic researcher James Keenan to claim that the doctrines given by apostolic tradition have changed. Keenan reviewed the history of moral theology, and in particular a change in the approach of moral theologians, specifically in the twentieth century. Keenan noted that Mark D. Jordan said that medieval texts he had reviewed appeared to be inconsistent. This refers to medieval traditions and not to apostolic tradition or doctrine. Keenan, however, says that John T. Noonan Jr. demonstrated that, &quot;despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition&quot;. According to Noonan, &quot;history cannot leave a principle or a teaching untouched; every application to a situation affects our understanding of the principle itself.&quot;

==Critiques==
Following the Protestant churches&#x27; separation from the Roman Catholic Church, the relatively new idea of came under serious critique by the Catholic and Orthodox Christians. In his 2001 &quot;The Shape of Sola Scriptura&quot;, the Reformed Christian writer Keith A. Mathison mentions several recent examples of such critics. In response, Mathison distinguishes what he considers to be the true doctrine of from the &quot;subjective and individualistic version&quot; of the doctrine that most Protestants have adopted.

The American Roman Catholic author and television presenter Patrick Madrid wrote that is self-referentially incoherent, as the Bible itself does not teach , and therefore the belief that the scriptures are the only source of Christian belief is self-contradicting given that it cannot be supported without extra-scriptural doctrine.

In the 2008 book &quot;Catholicism and Science&quot;, the authors Peter M. J. Hess and Paul Allen wrote that is &quot;inherently divisive&quot;, citing the Marburg Colloquy where Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli debated the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist on scriptural grounds but were unable to reach agreement on sacramental union. Hess and Allen argue that, when scripture is seen as the only source of infallible teaching, its interpretation is subject to fallible interpretation, and without an infallible interpreter, a certainty of Christian belief is not possible.

The Roman Catholic &quot;Encyclopedia of Theology&quot; notes that, since the 27 books that make up the New Testament canon of scripture are not based on a scriptural list that authenticates them to be inspired, their legitimacy would be impossible to distinguish with certainty without appealing to another infallible source, such as the magisterium of the Catholic Church, which assembled and authenticated this list at Synod of Rome and the Synod of Carthage, both of which took place in the fourth century. Before this, a compiled and authenticated Bible as it is now known did not yet exist.

The American Roman Catholic writer Dave Armstrong wrote that there are several examples of Jesus and his Apostles accepting oral and extrabiblical tradition in the New Testament:
*The reference to &quot;He shall be called a Nazarene&quot; cannot be found in the Old Testament, yet it was &quot;spoken by the prophets&quot; (Matthew 2:23). This prophecy, which is considered to be &quot;God&#x27;s Word&quot;, was passed down orally rather than through Scripture. 
*In Matthew 23:2–3, Jesus teaches that the scribes and Pharisees have a legitimate, binding authority based &quot;on Moses&#x27; seat&quot;, but this phrase or idea cannot be found anywhere in the Old Testament. It is found in the (originally oral) Mishnah, which teaches a sort of &quot;teaching succession&quot; from Moses.
*In 1 Corinthians 10:4, Paul the Apostle refers to a rock that &quot;followed&quot; the Jews through the Sinai wilderness. The Old Testament says nothing about such miraculous movement. But, this critic writes, rabbinic tradition does.
*&quot;As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses&quot; (2 Timothy 3:8). These two men cannot be found in the related Old Testament passage (cf. Exodus 7:8ff.) or anywhere else in the Old Testament.
*In the Epistle of Jude 9, a dispute is mentioned between the Archangel Michael and Satan over Moses&#x27; body, which is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and is drawn from oral Jewish tradition.
*In the Epistle of James 5:17, when recounting the prayers of Elijah described in 1 Kings 17, a lack of rain for three years is mentioned, which is absent from the passage in 1 Kings.
Armstrong argues that since Jesus and the Apostles acknowledge authoritative Jewish oral tradition, Christians can therefore not dispute oral tradition&#x27;s legitimacy and authority. However, according to scripture, Jesus also challenges some man-made Jewish traditions. But Catholics also make a similar distinction today between Sacred Tradition, which is considered inerrant, and lesser ecclesiastical traditions or disciplines, which can be subject to change. In the Catholic view, one can know what belongs to Sacred Tradition and what is an ecclesiastical tradition or discipline by consulting the Magisterium of the Church. The difference between the two, in the Catholic view, is that Sacred Tradition is apostolic and part of the deposit of faith, while ecclesiastical traditions and disciplines are not.

=== Views of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) states: &quot;The official, canonized scriptures of the Church, often called the standard works, are the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.&quot; The Church accepts the Bible as the word of God &quot;as far as it is translated correctly,&quot; and it regards parts of the Apocrypha, some writings of the Protestant Reformers and non-Christian religious leaders, and the non-religious writings of some philosophers – and, notably, the Constitution of the United States of America – to be &quot;inspired&quot;, though &quot;not canonical&quot;.

Regarding the Church&#x27;s view on the belief held by many that the Holy Bible, as presently constituted (in any translation, or even from the extant Hebrew and Greek manuscripts), is inerrant or infallible, etc, or the doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;, the Church has said the following: &quot;The Latter-day Saints have a great reverence and love for the Bible. They study it and try to live its teachings. They treasure its witness of the life and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith studied the Bible all his life, and he taught its precepts. He testified that a person who can &#x27;mark the power of Omnipotence, inscribed upon the heavens, can also see God’s own handwriting in the sacred volume: and he who reads it oftenest will like it best, and he who is acquainted with it, will know the hand [of the Lord] wherever he can see it&#x27;.&quot;

The Church further said on the subject of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;: &quot;Latter-day Saints believe in an open scriptural canon, which means that there are other books of scripture besides the Bible (such as the Book of Mormon) and that God continues to reveal His word through living prophets. The argument is often made that to be a Christian means to assent to the principle of &quot;sola scriptura,&quot; or the self-sufficiency of the Bible. But to claim that the Bible is the final word of God—more specifically, the final written word of God—is to claim more for the Bible than it claims for itself. Nowhere does the Bible proclaim that all revelations from God would be gathered into a single volume to be forever closed and that no further scriptural revelation could be received.&quot;

<doc id="58673" wikidata="Q622779" url="?curid=58673" title="Liquid hydrogen">
<text>Liquid hydrogen () is the liquid state of the element hydrogen. Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form.

To exist as a liquid, H2 must be cooled below its critical point of 33 K. However, for it to be in a fully liquid state at atmospheric pressure, H2 needs to be cooled to . A common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of hydrogen storage. Storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure. However, the liquid density is very low compared to other common fuels. Once liquefied, it can be maintained as a liquid for some time in thermally insulated containers.

There are two spin isomers of hydrogen; whereas room temperature hydrogen is mostly orthohydrogen, liquid hydrogen consists of 99.79% parahydrogen and 0.21% orthohydrogen.

Hydrogen requires a theoretical minimum of to liquefy, and including converting the hydrogen to the para isomer, but practically generally takes compared to a heating value of hydrogen.

==History==

In 1885, Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski published hydrogen&#x27;s critical temperature as ; critical pressure, ; and boiling point, .

Hydrogen was liquefied by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. The first synthesis of the stable isomer form of liquid hydrogen, parahydrogen, was achieved by Paul Harteck and Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer in 1929.

==Spin isomers of hydrogen==

The two nuclei in a dihydrogen molecule can have two different spin states.
Parahydrogen, in which the two nuclear spins are antiparallel, is more stable than orthohydrogen, in which the two are parallel. At room temperature, gaseous hydrogen is mostly in the ortho isomeric form due to thermal energy, but an ortho-enriched mixture is only metastable when liquified at low temperature. It slowly undergoes an exothermic reaction to become the para isomer, with enough energy released as heat to cause some of the liquid to boil. To prevent loss of the liquid during long-term storage, it is therefore intentionally converted to the para isomer as part of the production process, typically using a catalyst such as iron(III) oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromium(III) oxide, or some nickel compounds.

==Uses==
Liquid hydrogen is a common liquid rocket fuel for rocketry application and is used by NASA and the U.S. Air Force, which operate a large number of liquid hydrogen tanks with an individual capacity up to 3.8 million liters (1 million U.S. gallons).

In most rocket engines fueled by liquid hydrogen, it first cools the nozzle and other parts before being mixed with the oxidizer, usually liquid oxygen, and burned to produce water with traces of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Practical H2–O2 rocket engines run fuel-rich so that the exhaust contains some unburned hydrogen. This reduces combustion chamber and nozzle erosion. It also reduces the molecular weight of the exhaust, which can increase specific impulse, despite the incomplete combustion.

Liquid hydrogen can be used as the fuel for an internal combustion engine or fuel cell. Various submarines, including the Type 212 submarine, Type 214 submarine, and others, and concept hydrogen vehicles have been built using this form of hydrogen, such as the DeepC, BMW H2R, and others. Due to its similarity, builders can sometimes modify and share equipment with systems designed for liquefied natural gas (LNG). Liquid hydrogen is being investigated as a zero carbon fuel for aircraft. Because of the lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large. Unless direct injection is used, a severe gas-displacement effect also hampers maximum breathing and increases pumping losses.

Liquid hydrogen is also used to cool neutrons to be used in neutron scattering. Since neutrons and hydrogen nuclei have similar masses, kinetic energy exchange per interaction is maximum (elastic collision). Finally, superheated liquid hydrogen was used in many bubble chamber experiments.

The first thermonuclear bomb, Ivy Mike, used liquid deuterium, also known as hydrogen-2, for nuclear fusion.

==Properties==
The product of hydrogen combustion in a pure oxygen environment is solely water vapor. However, the high combustion temperatures and present atmospheric nitrogen can result in the breaking of N≡N bonds, forming toxic NOx if no exhaust scrubbing is done. Since water is often considered harmless to the environment, an engine burning it can be considered &quot;zero emissions&quot;. In aviation, however, water vapor emitted in the atmosphere contributes to global warming (to a lesser extent than CO2). Liquid hydrogen also has a much higher specific energy than gasoline, natural gas, or diesel.

The density of liquid hydrogen is only 70.85 kg/m3 (at 20 K), a relative density of just 0.07. Although the specific energy is more than twice that of other fuels, this gives it a remarkably low volumetric energy density, many fold lower.

Liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage technology such as special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all cryogenic fuels. This is similar to, but more severe than liquid oxygen. Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away (typically at a rate of 1% per day). It also shares many of the same safety issues as other forms of hydrogen, as well as being cold enough to liquefy, or even solidify atmospheric oxygen, which can be an explosion hazard.

The triple point of hydrogen is at 13.81 K and 7.042 kPa.

==Safety==
Due to its cold temperatures, liquid hydrogen is a hazard for cold burns. Hydrogen itself is biologically inert and its only human health hazard as a vapor is displacement of oxygen, resulting in asphyxiation, and its very high flammability and ability to detonate when mixed with air. Because of its flammability, liquid hydrogen should be kept away from heat or flame unless ignition is intended. Unlike ambient-temperature gaseous hydrogen, which is lighter than air, hydrogen recently vaporized from liquid is so cold that it is heavier than air and can form flammable heavier-than-air air–hydrogen mixtures.

<doc id="58674" wikidata="Q310355" url="?curid=58674" title="Sola fide">
<text>&#x27; (or simply &#x27;), meaning justification by faith alone, is a soteriological doctrine in Christian theology commonly held to distinguish the Lutheran and Reformed traditions of Protestantism, among others, from the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian and Anabaptist churches. The doctrine asserts that it is on the basis of faith alone that believers are made right of sin (such as their transgressions of divine law); and not on the basis of what Paul the Apostle calls &quot;works of the law&quot;, which &quot;sola fide&quot; proponents interpret as including not only moral, legal or ceremonial requirements but any good works or &quot;works of charity.&quot;

This forgiveness is known as &quot;justification&quot;. In classical Lutheran and Reformed theologies, works are seen as crucial &quot;evidence&quot; of faith, but the works themselves do not determine salvation. In contrast, Methodist doctrine affirms a belief in justification by faith that offers God&#x27;s forgiveness, but holds that holy living with the goal of Christian perfection (entire sanctification) is essential for salvation; maintenance of sanctification is contingent on continual faith in and obedience to God. Anabaptist theology categorically rejects the Lutheran and Reformed doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot;, and instead emphasizes a &quot;faith that works&quot;; Anabaptists teach that &quot;justification [began] a dynamic process by which the believer partook of the nature of Christ and was so enabled to live increasingly like Jesus.&quot;

== Origin of the term ==

=== Luther===
Martin Luther elevated &quot;sola fide&quot; to the principal cause of the Protestant Reformation, the rallying cry of the Lutheran cause, and the chief distinction of the Lutheran and Reformed branches of Christianity from Roman Catholicism. 

Luther added the word &quot;allein&quot; (&quot;alone&quot; in German) to Romans controversially so that it read: &quot;So now we hold, that man is justified without the help of the works of the law, &quot;alone&quot; through faith&quot;. The word &quot;alone&quot; does not appear in the Greek manuscripts and Luther acknowledged this fact, but he defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb &quot;alone&quot; was required by idiomatic German:

Luther further stated that &quot;sola&quot; was used in theological traditions before him and this adverb makes Paul&#x27;s intended meaning clearer:

=== Translations ===
Historically, expressions similar to —&quot;justification by faith alone&quot;— had appeared in a number of Catholic bible translations: the Nuremberg Bible (1483) in Galatians (&quot;δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ... διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ&quot;) has &quot;nur durch den glauben&quot;, and the Italian translations of 1476, 1538, and 1546 have &quot;&quot;ma solo per la fede&quot; or &quot;per la sola fede&quot;&quot;. The official Italian Bible of the Catholic Church, &quot;La Sacra Bibbia della Conferenza Episcopale Italiana&quot; (2008), in Galatians 2:16, reads in part: &quot;but only through faith in Jesus Christ&quot; (&quot;ma soltanto per mezzo della fede&quot;).

The &quot;faith alone&quot; expression also appears in at least nine modern English Bible translations:

* Amplified Bible (AMP)
* Amplified Bible, Classic Edition (AMPC)
* God&#x27;s Word Translation (GW)
* Good News Translation (GNT)
* Living Bible (TLB)
* The Message (MSG)
* Names of God Bible (NOG)
* The Voice (VOICE)
* Weymouth New Testament (WNY)

== History ==
=== Early Church ===
====Clement of Rome====
According to Protestant historian Philip Schaff faith alone was not clearly taught by most church fathers, except for Clement of Rome. In contrast, the Catholic Encyclopedia indicates that Clement of Rome held works to be meritorious and holding works to be a part of justification.

According to Baptist theologian Thomas Schreiner &quot;sola fide&quot; can be found in some apostolic fathers. He contends that Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch and the Epistle to Diognetus viewed salvation as being God&#x27;s work granted to those who exercise faith, which then causes works. Clement&#x27;s view on justification has caused much scholarly discussion, because Clement asserted: &quot;we are not justified through ourselves, but through faith&quot;, but still emphasizing God&#x27;s judgement upon wickedness. Some see Clement as believing in faith alone but that faith will lead into doing good works, while some others have argued that Clement held synergist views. 

====Early literature====
The Epistle to Diognetus talks much about the human inability to merit justification themselves by their own good works. 

The Shepherd of Hermas has a clear rejection of the faith alone doctrine, instead holding works to have merit. The Didache also appears to see works as meritorious, though not unambigiously.

Thomas R. Schreiner argued that the Odes of Solomon taught that works do not justify a person, but instead faith, he also argued that the book supports imputed righteousness.

====Patristic statements====

Thomas Schreiner asserted that because justification wasn&#x27;t a big issue in the patristic period, &quot;thus the theology isn’t always integrated or consistent&quot;, however Schreiner argued that people such as John Chrysostom, and Ambrosiaster had similarities to the views of justification as the reformers did:&quot;By faith alone one is freely forgiven of all sins and the believer is no longer burdened by the Law for meriting good works. Our works, however, are demonstrative of our faith and will determine whether we are ultimately justified&quot; &lt;br&gt; —Ambrosiaster 

Schreiner observes that Augustine of Hippo differs from the reformers as he understood the word &quot;justify&quot; to mean make righteous and not declare righteous, and thus he denied imputed righteousness. He also saw salvation as a process, despite that he still held very grace-oriented views of salvation, having similarities to the views reformers later would believe. Jovinian, who is often seen as a heretic by Catholics and as a forerunner by Protestants, has been argued to have been a very early witness to a Protestant view of justification. It has been argued that Marius Victorinus and Hilary of Poitiers taught faith alone. Marius Victorinus wrote that our own merits do not justify us and that we are justified by faith alone, however works should follow from that faith. Hilary of Poitiers seemed to have believed grace oriented views of salvation, which is by faith: as he declared &quot;salvation is entirely by faith&quot;, Hilary often contrasts salvific faith and salvation by works, which leads to unbelief. He also believed salvation to be by grace in the Old Testament and he saw Abraham as a model for the Jews, who was justified by faith.

Schreiner wrote that some statements made by Origen are consistent with the doctrine of faith alone, claiming that faith is the foundation of justification, but that he is not very clear on his view of justification.

Clement of Alexandria taught that faith was the basis of salvation, however he also believed that faith was also the basis of &quot;gnosis&quot; which for him mean spiritual and mystical knowledge.

Because Polycarp does not make enough statements on salvation, he could have been either believed &quot;sola fide&quot; or that both works and faith are needed, but it is unclear which one he believed from his few statements.

Catholic Answers wrote that Origen, Cyprian, Aphraates, Gregory of Nyssa, Clement of Alexandria, Gregory the Great and Jerome held that both faith and works are part of the process of salvation.Whoever dies in his sins, even if he profess to believe in Christ, does not truly believe in him; and even if that which exists without works be called faith, such faith is dead in itself, as we read in the epistle bearing the name of James” – Origen

Paul, joining righteousness to faith and weaving them together, constructs of them the breastplates for the infantryman, armoring the soldier properly and safely on both sides. A soldier cannot be considered safely armored when either shield is disjoined from the other. Faith without works of justice is not sufficient for salvation; neither is righteous living secure in itself of salvation, if it is disjoined from faith – Gregory of Nyssa

Neither faith without works nor works without faith is of any avail, except, perhaps, that works may go towards the reception of faith, just as Cornelius, before he had become one of the faithful, merited to be heard on account of his good works. From this it can be gathered that his performance of good works furthered his reception of faith” – Gregory the Great

When we hear, ‘Your faith has saved you,’ we do not understand the Lord to say simply that they will be saved who have believed in whatever manner, even if works have not followed. To begin with, it was to the Jews alone that he spoke this phrase, who had lived in accord with the law and blamelessly and who had lacked only faith in the Lord – Clement of AlexandriaAccording to Ken Wilson, Augustine criticized unnamed individuals who held to a stronger view of faith alone as espoused by Free Grace theologians. The individuals Augustine criticized held that one is saved by faith alone and that God&#x27;s future judgement for Christians only consisted of temporal punishment and reward; hell was out of question. Thus, they held that deeds such as repentance and good works were not necessary to enter heaven.

=== Medieval ===

Early medieval thinkers whose statements on faith that have been interpreted as preceding Luther&#x27;s include Gottschalk (c. 808 – 868 AD), Claudius of Turin (8.–9. century AD)
Some have argued that Ildefonsus and Julian of Toledo believed that faith alone was sufficient for salvation, Julian of Toledo made statements such as &quot;all effort of human argument must be suspended where faith alone is sufficient&quot;.

Protestants also have claimed that the writings of Bernard of Clairvaux include the doctrine of justification by faith alone.

=== Pre-Reformation ===
The doctrine of faith alone precedes Martin Luther in the theologies of many so-called proto-Protestant reformers: Wessel Gansfort (1419 – 1489), Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples (c. 1455 – 1536), and possibly also in Johann Pupper (c. 1400 – 1475). The doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot; also seems to appear in the doctrine of John Wycliffe (c. 1328 – 1384), as he stated: &quot;Trust wholly in Christ; rely altogether on his sufferings; beware of seeking to be justified in any other way than by his righteousness. Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for salvation.&quot;. According to some historians Luther&#x27;s view on the doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot; was influenced by the Italian reformer Girolamo Savonarola.

==Centrality in the doctrine of the Protestant Reformation==
The doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot; asserts that God&#x27;s pardon for guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith alone, excluding all &quot;works&quot; (good deeds). Without God&#x27;s input, mankind, Christianity asserts, is fallen and sinful, meaning its actions and omissions are afflicted by the curse and most if not all would face God&#x27;s wrath due to the fall of man (which spelt the end of Eden). God, the faith holds, sent his only Son in human form, to be reborn in all mankind so through Jesus Christ alone (&quot;solus Christus&quot;) sinners may receive pardon (justification), which is granted solely through faith.

Christ&#x27;s righteousness, according to the followers of &quot;sola fide&quot;, is imputed (or attributed) by God to sinners coming to a state of true, loving belief (as opposed to infused or imparted). If so God&#x27;s verdict and potential pardon is from genuinely held Christian faith (or in a few more liberal sects, all of Christ&#x27;s principles) rather than anything in the sinner. This contrasts with other supposed means of grace, such as priestly confession and rituals such as weekly taking of the sacrament. See the &quot;ordo salutis&quot; for more detail on the doctrine of salvation considered more broadly than justification by faith alone.

The standalone &quot;sola fide&quot; justification of souls is a tenet of most Lutheran and Reformed churches but neither the Roman Catholic nor the Eastern Orthodox churches affirm it. These Protestant traditions exclude all human works (except the works of Jesus Christ, which form the basis of justification) from the legal verdict (or pardon) of justification. According to Martin Luther, justification by faith alone is the article on which the Church stands or falls. Thus, &quot;faith alone&quot; is foundational to Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity, and as a formula distinguishes it from other Christian denominations.

===Lutheran theology===


From 1510 to 1520, Martin Luther lectured on the Book of Psalms and the Pauline epistles to the Galatians, Hebrews, and Romans. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Roman Catholic Church in new ways (see Genesis , Galatians , Romans ). He became convinced that the Roman Catholic Church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity, the most important of which, for Luther, was the doctrine of justification—God&#x27;s act of declaring a sinner righteous—by faith alone through God&#x27;s grace. Therefore, he began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God&#x27;s grace, attainable exclusively through faith in Jesus Christ.

&quot;This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification,&quot; insisted Luther, &quot;is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.&quot; He also called this doctrine the &quot;articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae&quot; (&quot;article of the standing and falling church&quot;): &quot;if this article stands, the Church stands; if it falls, the Church falls.&quot; For Lutherans this doctrine is the material principle of theology in relation to the Bible, which is the formal principle. They believe justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ&#x27;s righteousness alone is the gospel, the core of the Christian faith around which all other Christian doctrines are centered and based.

Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. When God&#x27;s righteousness is mentioned in the gospel, it is God&#x27;s action of declaring righteous the unrighteous sinner who has faith in Jesus Christ. The righteousness by which the person is justified (declared righteous) is not his own (theologically, &quot;proper&quot; righteousness) but that of another, Christ (&quot;alien&quot; righteousness). &quot;That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,&quot; said Luther. &quot;Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.&quot; Thus faith, for Luther, is a gift from God, and &quot;a living, bold trust in God&#x27;s grace, so certain of God&#x27;s favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it.&quot; This faith grasps Christ&#x27;s righteousness and appropriates it for the believer. He explained his concept of &quot;justification&quot; in the Smalcald Articles:

Traditionally, Lutherans have taught &quot;forensic&quot; (or legal) justification, a divine verdict of acquittal pronounced on the believing sinner. God declares the sinner to be &quot;not guilty&quot; because Christ has taken his place, living a perfect life according to God&#x27;s law and suffering for his sins. For Lutherans, justification is in no way dependent upon the thoughts, words, and deeds of those justified through faith alone in Christ. The new obedience that the justified sinner renders to God through sanctification follows justification as a consequence, but is not part of justification.

Lutherans believe that individuals receive this gift of salvation through faith alone. Saving faith is the knowledge of, acceptance of, and trust in the promise of the Gospel. Even faith itself is seen as a gift of God, created in the hearts of Christians by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word and Baptism. Faith is seen as an instrument that receives the gift of salvation, not something that causes salvation. Thus, Lutherans reject the &quot;decision theology&quot; which is common among modern evangelicals.

For Lutherans, justification provides the power by which Christians can grow in holiness. Such improvement comes about in the believer only after he has become a new creation in Christ through Holy Baptism. This improvement is not completed in this life: Christians are always &quot;saint and sinner at the same time&quot; (&quot;simul iustus et peccator&quot;)—saints because they are holy in God&#x27;s eyes, for Christ&#x27;s sake, and do works that please him; sinners because they continue to sin until death.

==Faith and works==
While salvation cannot be achieved through works (Titus ), faith being a unity with Christ in the Spirit naturally issues in love (Galatians ). This was Martin Luther&#x27;s emphasis likewise.

In relation to &quot;sola fide&quot;, the place of works is found in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians: Justification is by grace through faith, &quot;&quot;not from yourselves&quot; and &quot;not by works&quot;&quot;. In other words, it is by faith alone since all human efforts are excluded here (Ephesians ). Ephesians goes on to say that every person who has faith is to produce good works, according to God&#x27;s plan (Ephesians ). These works, however, are not a cause of forgiveness but a result of forgiveness. Faith alone justifies but faith is never alone. It is followed by works. In short, works of love are the goal of the saving faith (1 Timothy ).

According to the Defense of the Augsburg Confession of Philipp Melanchthon, the Epistle of James clearly teaches that the recipients of the letter have been justified by God through the saving Gospel (James ):


In answer to a question on James (&quot;you see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone&quot;), the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has written: &quot;In James 2, the author was dealing with errorists who said that if they had faith they didn&#x27;t need to show their love by a life of faith (2:14–17). James countered this error by teaching that true, saving faith is alive, showing itself to be so by deeds of love (James 2:18, 26). The author of James taught that justification is by faith alone and also that faith is never alone but shows itself to be alive by good deeds that express a believer&#x27;s thanks to God for the free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ.&quot;

According to the Defense of the Augsburg Confession again,

In &quot;Article XX of Good Works&quot;, the Augsburg Confession states that:

Martin Luther, who opposed antinomianism, is recorded as stating, &quot;Works are necessary for salvation but they do not cause salvation; for faith alone gives life.&quot;

In his Introduction to Romans, Luther stated that saving faith is,
a living, creative, active and powerful thing, this faith. Faith cannot help doing good works constantly. It doesn’t stop to ask if good works ought to be done, but before anyone asks, it already has done them and continues to do them without ceasing. Anyone who does not do good works in this manner is an unbeliever...Thus, it is just as impossible to separate faith and works as it is to separate heat and light from fire!
Scottish theologian John Murray of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, asserted:
&quot;Faith alone justifies but a justified person with faith alone would be a monstrosity which never exists in the kingdom of grace. Faith works itself out through love (Gal. 5:6). And Faith without works is dead (James 2:17–20).&quot;
&quot;It is living faith that justifies and living faith unites to Christ both in the virtue of his death and in the power of his resurrection. No one has entrusted himself to Christ for deliverance from the guilt of sin who has not also entrusted himself to him for deliverance from the power of sin.&quot;

Contemporary evangelical theologian R. C. Sproul writes:
The relationship of faith and good works is one that may be distinguished but never separated ... if good works do not follow from our profession of faith, it is a clear indication that we do not possess justifying faith. The Reformed formula is, &quot;We are justified by faith alone but not by a faith that is alone.&quot;
Michael Horton concurs by saying:
This debate, therefore, is not over the question of whether God renews us and initiates a process of gradual growth in holiness throughout the course of our lives. &#x27;We are justified by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone,&#x27; Luther stated, and this recurring affirmation of the new birth and sanctification as necessarily linked to justification leads one to wonder how the caricatures continue to be perpetuated without foundation.
=== Works of the law ===
Many Catholics see the exclusion of &quot;works of the law&quot; as only referring to works done for salvation under the Mosaic law, versus works of faith which are held as meritorious for salvation.

Adherents of &quot;sola fide&quot; respond that Jesus was not instituting keeping a higher moral code as means of salvation, and tend to see the exclusion of &quot;works of the law&quot; (as the means of obtaining justification) as referring to any works of the Mosaic law, and by implication, any &quot;works of righteousness which we have done&quot; (Titus ) or any system in which one earns eternal life on the basis of the merit of works.

However, most understand that the &quot;righteousness of the law&quot; is to be fulfilled by those who are justified by faith (Romans ). The Mosaic law and the principles of the gospel (such as the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Judgment of Matthew 25) are seen as being in correspondence, with the latter fulfilling, clarifying, and expanding on the former, centering on God&#x27;s love for us, and love to others. Thus a Lutheran or Reformed believer can claim that &quot;the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good,&quot; (Romans ) harmonizing the two principles of the same Bible.

==Reconciliation of differing emphases==
Christian theologies answer questions about the nature, function, and meaning of justification quite differently. These issues include: Is justification an event occurring instantaneously or is it an ongoing process? Is justification effected by divine action alone (&quot;monergism&quot;), by divine and human action together (&quot;synergism&quot;), or by human action (erroneously called &quot;Pelagianism&quot;)? Is justification permanent or can it be lost? What is the relationship of justification to sanctification, the process whereby sinners become righteous and are enabled by the Holy Spirit to live lives pleasing to God?

Discussion in the centuries since the Reformation and in some ways liberalising Counter-Reformation has suggested that the differences are in emphasis and concepts rather than doctrine, since Catholic and Orthodox Christians concede works are not the basis of &quot;justification&quot; nor relatedly &quot;salvation&quot;, and most Protestants accept the need for repentance and the primacy of grace (see and below). Further, many Protestant churches actually hold more nuanced positions such as &quot;sola gratia, sola fide&quot; or &quot;justification by faith&quot; (i.e. without the &quot;alone&quot;). According to a 2017 survey conducted in Western Europe by the Pew Research Center, &quot;fewer people say that faith alone (in Latin, &quot;sola fide&quot;) leads to salvation, the position that Martin Luther made a central rallying cry of 16th-century Protestant reformers.&quot; Protestants in every country surveyed except Norway are more likely to say that both good deeds and faith in God are necessary for salvation.

The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ), signed by both the Lutheran World Federation and the Roman Catholic Church on 31 October 1999 declares:
We confess together that good works – a Christian life lived in faith, hope and love – follow justification and are its fruits. When the justified live in Christ and act in the grace they receive, they bring forth, in biblical terms, good fruit. Since Christians struggle against sin their entire lives, this consequence of justification is also for them an obligation they must fulfill. Thus both Jesus and the apostolic Scriptures admonish Christians to bring forth the works of love.
The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ), signed by the Lutheran World Federation and the Catholic Church, says that &quot;sinners are justified by faith in the saving action of God in Christ. ... Such a faith is active in love and thus the Christian cannot and should not remain without works.&quot; And later, &quot;Good works – a Christian life lived in faith, hope and love – follow justification and are its fruits. When the justified live in Christ and act in the grace they receive, they bring forth, in biblical terms, good fruit. Since Christians struggle against sin their entire lives, this consequence of justification is also for them an obligation they must fulfill. Thus both Jesus and the apostolic Scriptures admonish Christians to bring forth the works of love.&quot;

The Joint Declaration never mentions the expression &quot;Sola Fide&quot; and the Catechism of the Catholic Church clearly teaches that salvation is obtained by a combination of both faith and good works, which are considered to be a human response to God&#x27;s prior and continuing grace.

===Epistle of James and Pauline Epistles===
Chapter 2 of the Epistle of James, verses 14–26, discusses faith and works, starting with verse 14, &quot;What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?&quot; In verse 20 it says that faith without works is dead.

The Defense of the Augsburg Confession rejects the idea that the Epistle of James contradicts the Lutheran teaching on Justification.

Confessional Lutheran theologians summarize James 2: &quot;we are justified/declared righteous by people when they see the good works we do as a result of our faith and they conclude that our faith is sincere.&quot;

In answer to another question on James 2:24 as well as Romans 3:23–24, the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod replied:
A Lutheran exegesis further points out that James is simply reaffirming Jesus&#x27; teaching in Matthew 7:16, and that in the tenth verse of the same chapter (&quot;For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it&quot;), James too denies works as a means to obtain forgiveness:

Lutheran and Reformed Protestants, as well as others, base the sola fide on the fact that the New Testament contains almost two hundred statements that appear to imply that faith or belief is sufficient for salvation, for example: &quot;Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.&quot; () and especially Paul&#x27;s words in Romans, &quot;Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.&quot; ()

&quot;Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.&quot; ()

The precise relationship between faith and good works remains an area of controversy in some Protestant traditions (see also Law and Gospel). Even at the outset of the Reformation, subtle differences of emphasis appeared. For example, because the Epistle of James emphasizes the importance of good works, Martin Luther sometimes referred to it as the &quot;epistle of straw&quot;. Calvin on the other hand, while not intending to differ with Luther, wrote of the necessity of good works as a consequence or &#x27;fruit&#x27; of faith. The Anabaptists tended to make a nominal distinction between faith and obedience.

A recent article suggests that the current confusion regarding the Epistle of James about faith and works resulted from Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s anti-Donatist polemic in the early fifth century. This approach reconciles the views of Paul and James on faith and works. Recent meetings of scholars and clergy have attempted to soften the antithesis between Protestant and Catholic conceptions of the role of faith in salvation, which, if they were successful, would have far reaching implications for the relationship between most Protestant churches and the Catholic Church. These attempts to form a consensus are accepted among many Protestants and Catholics, but among others, &quot;sola fide&quot; continues to divide the Reformation churches, including many Lutherans, Reformed, and others, from other denominations. Some statements of the doctrine are interpreted as a denial of the doctrine as understood by other groups.

== Catholic view ==

In the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the Catholic Church cautioned against an extreme version of &quot;sola fide&quot; in canon XIV on self-righteousness and justification without repentance, declaring: &quot;If any one says, that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified, because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified; or, that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified; and that, by this faith alone, absolution and justification are effected; let him be anathema.&quot;

Pope Benedict XVI summarized the Catholic position as &quot;&quot;...Luther&#x27;s phrase: &quot;faith alone&quot; is true, if it is not opposed to faith in charity, in love. Faith is looking at Christ, entrusting oneself to Christ, being united to Christ, conformed to Christ, to his life. ... St Paul speaks of faith that works through love (cf. Gal 5: 14).&quot;&quot;

The following principles from the Catechism of the Catholic Church (labeled by paragraph number) are useful for understanding the Catholic view of justification.

* 1989. Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man.
* 1990. Justification &quot;detaches man from sin&quot; which contradicts the love of God, and purifies his heart of sin.
* 1991. With justification, faith, hope, and charity are poured into our hearts, and obedience to the divine will is granted us.
* 1992. Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who offered himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and pleasing to God, and whose blood has become the instrument of atonement for the sins of all men.
* 1993. Justification establishes &quot;cooperation&quot; between God&#x27;s grace and man&#x27;s freedom. On man&#x27;s part it is expressed by &quot;the assent of faith&quot; to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in &quot;the cooperation of charity&quot; with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent.
* 1996. Our justification comes from the grace of God.
* 2007. With regard to God, there is &quot;no strict right to any merit&quot; on the part of man.
* 2010. Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, &quot;no one can merit the initial grace&quot; of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life.
* 2011. The charity of Christ is the source in us of &quot;all our merits before God&quot;. Grace, by uniting us to Christ in active love, ensures the supernatural quality of our acts and consequently their merit before God and before men.

Thus the Catholic view could perhaps be interpreted as a progression or flow: first grace, then initial trust/repentance/conversion, then faith/hope/charity, combined with an emphasis that none of these elements should be isolated thus missing the package.

Further, the sacraments of baptism, Eucharist, and reconciliation relate to each: baptism for the removal of sin (in the case of an infant, original sin), Eucharist for the participation in Jesus&#x27; sacrifice, and penance for the confession of lapses of faith and charity and the assignment of prayers/actions to rejoin faith and charity. &quot;Sola fide&quot; is rejected only as far is it would ignore or reject grace or the New Commandment.

===Grace===
The Catholic view holds instead that grace, specifically, the form of grace known as &quot;sanctifying grace&quot;, and which first floods the soul at baptism, which empowers one&#x27;s ability both to believe and to perform good works, is essential as the gateway to salvation, but not the only element needed for salvation (Eph 2:8–10). God&#x27;s freely given grace is offered and empowers one&#x27;s ability to believe and to perform good works, both then becoming meritorious because they are joined to Christ&#x27;s saving power of the Cross. (Phil 2:12–13) (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1987–2029) A Christian must respond to this free gift of Grace from God given first, ordinarily, in Baptism (1 Pet 3:21) both by having faith and by living in the light of Christ through love (Jn 3:16; 1 Jn 1:7) (Galatians 5:6) which perfects the Christian throughout his or her life (James 2:22). The Catholic position is best summed up in John 3:16, if one has the proper, contextual understanding of the word &quot;believe&quot;. &quot;Believe&quot;, in context and in ancient Judaism, meant more than an intellectual assent. &quot;To believe&quot; also meant to obey, which is seen, in context, in Jn 3:36, 1 Jn 2:3ff, and 1 Jn 5:1ff. Without our positive response to grace offered, salvation is not possible.

As expounded in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching is that it is the grace of God, &quot;the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call&quot;, that justifies us, a grace that is a prerequisite for our free response of &quot;collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification through charity&quot;.

===Justification===
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church justification is conferred in baptism, the sacrament of faith. The sacrament of reconciliation enables recovery of justification, if lost through committing a mortal sin. A mortal sin makes justification lost, even if faith is still present.

The Council of Trent sought to clarify the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on justification and the manner in which it differed from that proposed by Lutheran and Reformed Christians. It stated: &quot;Faith is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation and root of all justification, without which it is impossible to please God () and to come to the fellowship of His sons; and we are therefore said to be justified gratuitously, because none of those things that precede justification, whether faith or works, merit the grace of justification.&quot; &quot;Faith, unless hope and charity be added to it, neither unites man perfectly with Christ nor makes him a living member of His body. For which reason it is most truly said that faith without works is dead () and of no profit, and in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by charity ().&quot; After being justified, &quot;to those who work well unto the end and trust in God, eternal life is to be offered, both as a grace mercifully promised to the sons of God through Christ Jesus, and as a reward promised by God himself, to be faithfully given to their good works and merits. ... Since Christ Jesus Himself, as the head into the members and the vine into the branches (), continually infuses strength into those justified, which strength always precedes, accompanies and follows their good works, and without which they could not in any manner be pleasing and meritorious before God, we must believe that nothing further is wanting to those justified to prevent them from being considered to have, by those very works which have been done in God, fully satisfied the divine law according to the state of this life and to have truly merited eternal life, to be obtained in its [due] time, provided they depart [this life] in grace&quot;.

In its canons, the Council condemned the following propositions:
* man can be justified before God by his own works, whether done by his own natural powers or through the teaching of the law, without divine grace through Jesus Christ (canon 1);
* the sinner is justified by faith alone, meaning that nothing else is required to cooperate in order to obtain the grace of justification, and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the action of his own will (canon 9);
* the commandments of God are, even for one that is justified and constituted in grace, impossible to observe (canon 18);
* the justice received is not preserved and also not increased before God through good works, but those works are merely the fruits and signs of justification obtained, but not the cause of its increase (canon 24);
* the good works of the one justified are in such manner the gifts of God that they are not also the good merits of him justified; or the one justified by the good works that he performs by the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does not truly merit an increase of grace, eternal life, and in case he dies in grace, the attainment of eternal life itself and also an increase of glory (canon 32).

===Biblical exegesis===
Catholic exegetes believe that St. James, to continue the thread above, had no other object than to emphasize the fact—already emphasized by St. Paul—that only such faith as is active in charity and good works (fides caritate formata) possesses any power to justify man (cf. Galatians 5:6; 1 Corinthians 13:2), whilst faith devoid of charity and good works (fides informis) is a dead faith and in the eyes of God insufficient for justification (cf. James 2:17 sqq.)

In response to sola fide, Robert Sungenis argues in his 1997 book &quot;Not by Faith Alone&quot; that:
# Lutherans and Reformed Christians have devised many and varied explanations to neutralize the clear and unambiguous statement in Jm 2:24 that &quot;man is justified by works and not by faith alone.&quot; Each of these explanations concludes that James is not teaching that man is justified by works in the same sense that Paul says man is justified by faith. Puzzled by James&#x27;s language, Martin Luther even concluded that the epistle of James was a spurious book and should not be canonically authoritative for New Testament teaching.
# Countering the Lutheran and Reformed Christian explanation of the epistle of James which states that James means that &quot;men&quot; witness Abraham&#x27;s works, the Genesis text (Genesis 22) does not include any men as witness to Abraham&#x27;s works, but only God himself.
# Countering the Lutheran and Reformed Christian explanation of James which holds that the word &quot;justified&quot; as James uses the term refers to a &quot;vindication,&quot; rather than to a salvific justification, as Paul uses the term, are the following arguments:
#* If James were teaching a concept of &quot;vindication,&quot; he would have said, with the proper Greek word, &quot;you see, a person is vindicated by works.&quot; Moreover, since James adds the clause &quot;and not by faith alone&quot; we know that he is correcting a false notion concerning the solitude of faith in justification, not suggesting that Abraham was vindicated by works.
#* If James were attempting to teach a vindication of Abraham, the specific argumentation he used would make sense only if James&#x27;s opponents had claimed that Abraham was &quot;vindicated by faith alone.&quot; In other words, if the vindication hypothesis were true, syntactical requirements would have forced James to use the meaning of &quot;vindicated&quot; in the first part of his argument (Jm 2:20–21) in order also to use it in the latter part (Jm 2:24). Since the grammatical structure of the verse would then require that the phrase &quot;not by faith alone&quot; have its referent in the phrase &quot;is vindicated,&quot; this would force the meaning of the verse to be, &quot;a person is vindicated ... not by faith alone&quot;—a meaning that has no relevance to James&#x27;s discussion.
#* The New Testament does not use the word &quot;justified&quot; in the sense of &quot;vindicated&quot; in contexts which are soteriological, i.e., contexts which discuss salvation or damnation. Moreover, such passages as Mt 11:19 where one could plausibly interpret the Greek word dikaioo as referring to a vindication do so only in a metaphorical sense; therefore they do not use dikaioo in the same way that James, and even Paul, use the term, which is historical and literal.
#* James&#x27;s discussion of the events surrounding the justification of Rahab preclude assigning the meaning of &quot;vindicated&quot; to the word justified. Rahab&#x27;s justification, as described in Jm 2:25, is a salvific justification, not a vindication, yet James specifies that Rahab was justified &quot;in the same way&quot; that Abraham was justified. Therefore, one cannot understand Abraham&#x27;s justification as a vindication.
#* Since James and Paul use the same Greek noun dikaiosune (&quot;righteous&quot;) in reference to Abraham, and interpret the word in the same way (cf. Gn 15:6, Rm 4:3, Jm 2:23), it would be totally incongruous for one of them to use a different meaning of its verbal cognate dikaioo in reference to Abraham.
#* The Lutherans and Reformed Christian position assumes that Abraham&#x27;s justification is a once-for-all event. James&#x27;s all important question &quot;Can faith save him?&quot; (Jm 2:14), however, includes Abraham within its purview. Hence we must conclude that if Abraham&#x27;s works were not of the quality that James prescribes in the context (Jm 2:15), then Abraham would not be justified. Abraham could not be justified in a &quot;once-for-all&quot; event in Gn 15:6 and at the same time have that justification put in jeopardy by disobedience to James&#x27;s requirement of works for justification. If this could happen, the question in Jm 2:14 would have no meaning.
# Abraham&#x27;s acts in Genesis 12, 15, and 22 were acts of faith and works. We should not misconstrue Paul&#x27;s stress on Abraham&#x27;s faith in his view of Gn 15:6 to say that Abraham performed no works of loving obedience to God at this time or prior, nor should we misconstrue James&#x27;s view of works in Genesis 22 to say that Abraham&#x27;s attempted sacrifice of Isaac was not a supreme act of faith. Similarly, Abraham&#x27;s departure from his homeland in Genesis 12 also couples his faith and works in regard to justification. Throughout his life, in the periods recorded in Genesis 13–14, 16–21, and 23–25 which are between the times of his recorded faith and obedience in the New Testament, Abraham continued to live in faith and obedience, with only what we may call minor lapses along the way. Genesis 22&#x27;s importance is its detailing of Abraham&#x27;s quintessential act of the faith-and-works which allowed God to swear an oath of blessing to him and for all his future descendants. Abraham&#x27;s act in Genesis 22, not Gn 15:6, was the most important act in Abraham&#x27;s life. The act in Genesis 22 was just as much a crediting of righteousness to Abraham as that in Gn 15:6.
# The entire context of the book of James concerns what one must do to be saved. He concentrates on obedience to the law as the means of salvation, and judgment for those who disobey that law.
# James includes sins of commission as well as omission in his warning against disobedience to the law. The supreme law, or &quot;royal law,&quot; that James has in view is the law of love.
# James assumes that the audience to whom he writes already has faith in God. The main question that James poses to them is whether they have added works to their faith. James does not suggest that works will immediately or inevitably flow from one who has faith, even though he may have a greater disposition towards good works once he has faith. James teaches that one who has faith must make a daily, conscious decision to do good works, just as he must decide each day to refrain from sin. In fact, if he chooses not to do good works when the opportunity arises, he has sinned (Jm 4:17).
# James does not support the Lutherans and Reformed Christian concept that one can be saved as long as he has &quot;saving faith.&quot; James is not so much attempting to qualify the faith needed for justification as he is saying that one must consciously add works to faith in order to be justified. A person, to be justified, must persevere to his last breath in this conscious decision to add works to faith.
# One of the most heinous in the catalogue of sins that James specifies is sin of the tongue. What is &quot;said&quot; to God and man is of the utmost importance to James and a major criterion on how the individual will be judged.
# Both Paul and James speak of the works of love that one must add to his faith in order to be justified.
# Like Paul, James concludes that if one chooses the system of law and desires God to evaluate him on that basis without the benefit of grace, he must then obey the whole law without fault. For one fault, the law will utterly condemn him.

== Anabaptist view ==
Anabaptist cleric David Griffin writes:

&quot;The beginning of the Anabaptist path to salvation was thus marked not by a forensic understanding of salvation by &#x27;faith alone&#x27;, but by the entire process of repentance, self-denial, faith, rebirth and obedience. It was this process that was marked by the biblical sign of baptism.&quot; After becoming a believer, Anabaptist theology emphasizes &quot;a faith that works.&quot;

Anabaptist denominations teach:

Hans Denck wrote:

Obedience to Jesus and other New Testament teachings, loving one another and being at peace with others, and walking in holiness are seen as &quot;earmarks of the saved.&quot; Good works thus have an important role in the life of an Anabaptist believer, with the teaching &quot;that faith without works is a dead faith&quot; (cf. ) occupying a cornerstone in Anabaptist Christianity. 
Anabaptists do not teach faith &quot;and&quot; works—in the sense of two separate entities—are necessary for salvation, but rather that true faith will &quot;always&quot; produce good works. Balthasar Hubmaier wrote that &quot;faith by itself alone is not worthy to be called faith, for there can be no true faith without the works of love.&quot;

Anabaptists &quot;dismissed the Lutheran doctrine of justification, a dead faith as they called it, which was unable to produce Christian love and good works.&quot; Peter Riedemann wrote:
Rather than a forensic justification that only gave a legal change of one&#x27;s status before God, early Anabaptists taught that &quot;justification begun a dynamic process by which the believer partook of the nature of Christ and was so enabled to live increasingly like Jesus.&quot; Christians of the Anabaptist tradition (who teach salvation by &quot;faith that works&quot;) have argued that being a disciple of Jesus by careful obedience to New Testament commands (such as the holy kiss, baptism, communion, headcovering, and feet washing), is &quot;crucial evidence that an individual has repented, believed, and yielded to Christ.&quot; The Anabaptist theologian Menno Simons rebuffed the Lutheran charge of legalism by referencing :
== Free Grace view ==

Free Grace theology, which is held by authors such as Zane Hodges, Jody Dillow, Charles Ryrie, David R. Anderson and others, is distinguished from other traditions by holding an especially strong version of the doctrine of faith alone. It holds that things such as turning from sin, baptism or perseverance in the faith are necessary for salvation, but instead hold that these things are necessary for eternal rewards. It holds eternal security, and denies that every believer will necessarily persevere. Thus, they hold that anyone who believes in Jesus Christ will go to heaven regardless of any future actions—including future sin, unbelief, or apostasy—though Christians who sin or abandon the faith will face God&#x27;s discipline. For example, Robert Thieme states &quot;“Although the believer can never lose his eternal life, he can be in danger of destroying his spiritual life and losing all the blessings that “God has prepared for those who love him”.&quot; This view is primarily taught by Southern Baptist, Independent Baptist, Plymouth Brethren, Non-Denominational and Calvary Chapel churches, although it is not a majority within them.

Free grace theology is distinguished by its treatment of the words &quot;salvation&quot; and &quot;save&quot; in the Bible. These theologians argue that there are many ways believers can experience &quot;salvation&quot;, not necessarily referring to salvation from hell. This view cites verses such as Acts 27:34, where the Greek word &quot;sōtēríā&quot; – typically translated as &#x27;salvation&#x27; – is translated &quot;health&quot; or &quot;strength&quot; because food will assist their deliverance from physical death. Spiritually, salvation is seen as referring to deliverance from the eternal penalty of sin (justification), the current power of sin over the Christian (sanctification), the removal of any possibility to sin (glorification), and being restored to stewardship over the world as God intended for humankind at creation (restoration to rule). Most Free Grace theologians such as Bob Wilkin, Zane Hodges, and Joseph Dillow, among others hold that the one who possesses &quot;dead faith&quot; – as mentioned James 2:17 – is not a false convert, in this view the word &quot;dead&quot; refers to a faith that is not profitable in this life nor in the judgement seat of Christ, but does not imply false conversion. Thus, when the epistle of James says &quot;can that faith save him&quot;, it is either understood as salvation from temporal consequences of sin (as with Hodges), salvation from a loss of reward (as with Bing), both (as with Dillow), or as the physical salvation of the poor person described in the chapter (as with R. T. Kendall).

There are some differences among free grace theologians on the issue of fruit in a Christian life. More moderate free grace theologians still affirm that faith will necessarily lead into good works, although it may not be outwardly evident or last to the end of one&#x27;s life. However, those who hold to a more strong form of free grace theology deny that every Christian will bear fruit in their life.

== Methodist view ==

Methodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in Wesleyan–Arminian theology, justification refers to &quot;pardon, the forgiveness of sins&quot;, rather than &quot;being made actually just and righteous&quot;, which Methodists believe is accomplished through sanctification. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, taught that the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, as well as engaging in the works of piety and the works of mercy, were &quot;indispensable for our sanctification&quot;.
Methodist pastor Amy Wagner has written:


Methodist soteriology emphasizes the importance of the pursuit of holiness in salvation. Thus, for Wesley, &quot;true faith ... &quot;cannot&quot; subsist without works&quot;. Bishop Scott J. Jones in &quot;United Methodist Doctrine&quot; (2002) writes that in Wesleyan theology:
Bishop Jones concludes that &quot;Methodist doctrine thus understands true, saving faith to be the kind that, given time and opportunity, will result in good works. Any supposed faith that does not in fact lead to such behaviors is not genuine, saving faith.&quot; Methodist evangelist Phoebe Palmer stated that &quot;justification would have ended with me had I refused to be holy&quot;. While &quot;faith is essential for a meaningful relationship with God, our relationship with God also takes shape through our care for people, the community, and creation itself.&quot; Methodism, inclusive of the Holiness movement, thus teaches that &quot;justification [is made] conditional on obedience and progress in sanctification&quot;, emphasizing &quot;a deep reliance upon Christ not only in coming to faith, but in remaining in the faith&quot;. The believer who is entirely sanctified (cleansed &quot;from all inward sin and empowered for service&quot;) maintains his/her salvation by &quot;faith and obedience&quot; to God.

Richard P. Bucher contrasts this position with the Lutheran one, discussing an analogy put forth by John Wesley:
== Supporting confessional excerpts ==
===Anabaptism===
The position of the Mennonite Church USA is set out in the pamphlet &quot;Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective&quot; (1995). The commentary to Article 8 of the &quot;Confession&quot; emphasizes both faith and obedience as normative for salvation:

===Anglicanism===
The Anglican position is set out in the Thirty-nine Articles, specifically Article XI &quot;Of the Justification of Man&quot;:

===Lutheranism===
=== Baptist ===
===Reformed===
====Continental Reformed====


====Presbyterian====
====Reformed Baptist====
Chapter XI of the London Baptist Confession of Faith 1689 is the same as the Westminster Confession of Faith.

===Methodism===

The following statements from confessions of faiths of the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition reflect Methodist theology on salvation:

===Non-denominational Evangelicals===


==Additional ecumenical statements==

===Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics===
===Lutheran World Federation and the Roman Catholic Church===
In the preamble , it is suggested that much of the debate on &quot;sola fide&quot; has been based on condemnations of caricatured positions not actually held: &quot;The teaching of the Lutheran Churches presented in the Declaration does not fall under the condemnations from the Council of Trent. The condemnations in the Lutheran Confessions do not apply to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church presented in this Declaration.&quot;

===Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission===
== Protestant Controversies ==
Some scholars of Early Christianity are adherents of the New Perspective on Paul and so believe sola fide is a misinterpretation on the part of Lutherans and that Paul was actually speaking about laws (such as Circumcision, Dietary laws, Sabbath, Temple rituals, etc.) that were considered essential for the Jews of the time.

The doctrine of justification by faith alone and the role of repentance in salvation has been interpreted differently by different Protestants, causing multiple controversies such as the Majoristic controversy (16th century), Antinomian Controversy (17th century), the Marrow Controversy (18th century), the Lordship salvation controversy (1980s), and the Hyper-Grace controversy (21st century).

<text>The Chicago Boys were a group of Chilean economists prominent around the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of whom were educated at the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago under Larry Sjaastad, Milton Friedman, and Arnold Harberger, or at its affiliate in the economics department at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. After they finished their studies and returned to Latin America, they adopted positions in numerous South American governments including the military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990), as economic advisors. Many of them reached the highest positions within those governments. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were influenced by Chile&#x27;s policies and economic reforms.

==History==
The term &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; has been used at least as early as the 1980s to describe Latin American economists who studied or identified with the liberal economic theories then taught at the University of Chicago, popularly known as the Chicago school of economics, even though some of them earned degrees at Harvard University or MIT. They advocated widespread deregulation, privatization, and other free market policies for closely controlled economies. The Chicago Boys rose to prominence as leaders of the early reforms initiated in Chile during General Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s rule. Milton and Rose Friedman used the term &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; in their memoir: &quot;In 1975, when inflation still raged and a world recession triggered a depression in Chile, General Pinochet turned to the &quot;Chicago Boys&quot;; he appointed several of them to powerful positions in the government.
The training program was the result of the &quot;Chile Project&quot; organized in the 1950s by the U.S. State Department, through the Point Four program, the first US program for global economic development. It was funded by the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation aimed at influencing Chilean economic thinking. The University of Chicago&#x27;s Department of Economics set up scholarship programs with Chile&#x27;s Catholic University. About one hundred select students between 1957 and 1970 received training, first in an apprenticeship program in Chile and then in post-graduate work in Chicago. The most influential of the Chicago faculty members involved was Larry Sjaastad, who helped organize the Latin Amerian Workshop and supervised 139 doctoral dissertations, many from Latin American students, during his 42-year teaching career at Chicago.

The project was uneventful until the early 1970s. The Chicago Boys&#x27; ideas remained on the fringes of Chilean economic and political thought, even after a group of them prepared a 189-page &quot;Program for Economic Development&quot; called &quot;El ladrillo&quot; (&quot;the brick&quot;). It was presented in 1969 as part of Jorge Alessandri&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential candidacy. Alessandri rejected &quot;El ladrillo&quot;, but it was revisited after the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état on 11 September 1973 brought Augusto Pinochet to power, and it became the basis of the new regime&#x27;s economic policy.

After the coup when the Chicago boys were given power and &quot;El ladrillo&quot; was implemented, the Chilean GDP fell by about 15% by 1982 and government spending increased slightly. In addition, this has led to greater income inequality in Chile, which still impacts the country today.

These policies were seen as the natural reaction to Marxism and part of Chile&#x27;s role as a hotspot during the Cold War. The anti-Marxist junta supported radical free market policies promoted by the Chicago Boys as a part of their destruction of Marxism.

After the end of the military rule and return to democracy this specific group lost power and many joined the private sector, although their policies and effects still remained in place in many areas.

Even though the Chile Project ended, the training connection between Chile and the University of Chicago continued. One of the numerous networking organizations for alumni, including the Chicago Boys, is the &quot;Latin American Business Group at Chicago Booth School of Business&quot; (LATAM). The term continues to be used in popular culture, business magazines, press and media. In 2015, a Chilean film titled Chicago Boys was released.

=== Shock doctrine and economic policies ===
As the key economic advisors of the Pinochet dictatorship, the Chicago Boys were the forerunners of the economic policies of that government. They sponsored state run policies to decrease national spending, end inflation and promote economic growth. They promoted a policy of strict austerity and cut government expenditures substantially. Free trade agreements and the breakdown of barriers to trade were also promoted to help Chile compete in the world market. They also privatized public companies and used the free market rather than government rule to promote their economic policies. This was part of the neoliberal economic views espoused by Milton Friedman, the ideological backer for their views. Friedman and his connections to the Chicago Boys was highly politicized especially after he received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1976. The policies are also sometimes referred to as shock therapy based on the fact that they were projected to hurt the economy but overall be beneficial in the long run. These policies influenced future governments and organizations tied to the neoliberal economic viewpoint such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other International Organizations and governments. However, the relations between these organizations were not always close, and rivalry between neoliberal organizations still existed. The ideology of free market capitalism and laissez faire economics in conjunction with a strong military rule and total political control is the cornerstone of Pinochetism, in conjunction with a strong anti-communist political platform. These policies and their effects are both highly controversial in Chile and around the World and represent a major divide in Chilean politics to this day.

=== International influence ===
The economic success of the Chicago boys was a critical part of bolstering the Pinochet regime abroad. The Chilean miracle as it was called attracted a lot of necessary positive attention for the Pinochet government and allowed Pinochet to exercise political repression without condemnation by economic allies. New policies such as structural adjustment, free trade, and tax cuts became incredibly popular with conservative political groups throughout the western world. These policies eventually spread into the United States and United Kingdom via their conservative leaders. Chile was one of the first countries to embrace these policies and they have since spread in part due to the initial success Chile experienced.

<text>Worcester ( ) is a cathedral city in Worcestershire, England, of which it is the county town. It is south-west of Birmingham, north of Gloucester and north-east of Hereford. The population was 103,872 in the 2021 census.

The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, overlooked by Worcester Cathedral. Worcester is the home of Royal Worcester Porcelain, Lea &amp; Perrins (makers of traditional Worcestershire sauce), the University of Worcester, and &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Worcester Journal&quot;, claimed as the world&#x27;s oldest newspaper. The composer Edward Elgar (1857–1934) grew up in the city.

The Battle of Worcester in 1651 was the final battle of the English Civil War, during which Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army defeated King Charles II&#x27;s Royalists.

==History==
===Early history===
The trade route past Worcester, later part of the Roman Ryknild Street, dates from Neolithic times. It commanded a ford crossing over the River Severn, which was tidal below Worcester, and fortified by the Britons about 400 BC.

Charcoal from the Forest of Dean enabled Romans to operate pottery kilns and ironworks. They may also have built a small fort. While there is some evidence that the late Iron Age defensive ditches on the east bank may have been dug out during the first century AD, there is no other evidence to suggest that this was used as a fort by the Romans. Scatters of military equipment and coins found in the city centre from this early period may instead have been lost during the course of road building, or won by the local inhabitants in battle, rather than being left by a Roman military garrison. There is no sign of municipal buildings to indicate an administrative role.

In the 3rd century AD, Roman Worcester occupied a larger area than the subsequent medieval city, but silting caused the abandonment of Sidbury. Industrial production ceased and the settlement contracted to a defended position along the lines of the old British fort at the river terrace&#x27;s southern end.

===Anglo-Saxon town===

The form of the place name varied over time. At its settlement in the 7th century, by the Angles of Mercia, it was &quot;Weogorna&quot;. After centuries of warfare against the Vikings and Danelaw it had become a centre for the Anglo-Saxon army or &quot;here&quot; known as &quot;Weogorna ceastre&quot; (Worcester Camp). The Weorgoran were probably a sub-tribe of the larger kingdom of the Hwicce, which occupied present-day Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and western Wiltshire. In 680, Worcester was chosen as their fort over the larger Gloucester, and the royal court at Winchcombe as the episcopal see of a new bishopric, suggesting there was already an established and powerful Christian community.
Worcester became a centre of monastic learning and church power. Oswald of Worcester, appointed Bishop in 961, was an important reformer alongside the Archbishop of York. The last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Worcester, St Wulfstan or Wulstan, was a reformer, who remained in office until he died in 1095.

The city became a focus of violent tax resistance against the monarch Harthacnut (also King of Denmark) in 1041. The townspeople tried to defend themselves by occupying the Severn island of Bevere, two miles up river. After Harthacnut&#x27;s men had sacked the city and set it alight, agreement was reached and the populace returned to rebuild.

===Medieval===
====Norman Conquest====
The first Norman Sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d&#x27;Abetot oversaw the construction of a new castle at Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069. Its outer bailey was built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral.

====Early medieval====
Worcester&#x27;s growth and position as a market town for goods and produce rested on its river crossing and bridge and its position on the road network. The nearest Severn bridges in the 14th century were at Gloucester and Bridgnorth. The main road from London to mid-Wales ran through Worcester, then north-west to Kidderminster, Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury, and via Bromsgrove to Coventry and on to Derby. Southward it connected with Tewkesbury and Gloucester.
Worcester was a centre of religious life. The several monasteries up to the dissolution included Greyfriars, Blackfriars, the Penitent Sisters, and the Benedictine Priory, now Worcester Cathedral. Monastic houses provided hospital and educational services, including Worcester School.

The 12th-century town (then better defended) was attacked in 1139, 1150 and 1151 during the civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I. The 1139 attack again resulted in a fire that destroyed part of the city, with citizens being held for ransom. Another fire in 1189 destroyed much of the city for the fourth time that century.

Worcester received its first royal charter in 1189. In 1227 under a new charter allowed a guild of merchants was created, with a trading monopoly for those admitted. Worcester&#x27;s institutions grew more slowly than those of most county towns.

====Jewish persecution and expulsions====

Worcester had a small Jewish population by the late 12th century. Jewish life probably centred round what is now Copenhagen Street. The Diocese was hostile to the Jewish community. Peter of Blois was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances, to write an anti-Judaic treatise around 1190. William de Blois as Bishop of Worcester imposed strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219. As elsewhere in England, Jews had to wear square white badges, supposedly representing &quot;tabulae&quot;. Blois wrote to Pope Gregory IX in 1229 to request further powers of enforcement. In 1263 Worcester&#x27;s Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force under Robert Earl Ferrers and Henry de Montfort. Most were killed. The Worcester massacre was part of a wider campaign by allies of Simon de Montfort at the start of the Second Barons&#x27; War. In January 1275, Jews still in Worcester were expelled to Hereford.

====Late medieval====
Worcester elected its Member of Parliament at the Guildhall, by the loudest shout rather than the raising of hands. Members of Parliament had to own freehold property worth 40 shillings a year. Their wages were levied by the Constable.

The city council was organised by a system of co-option, with 24 members of the high chamber and 48 of the lower. Committees appointed two bailiffs and made financial decisions; the two chambers agreed the city&#x27;s rules or ordinances.

By late medieval times the population had reached 1,025 families, excluding the cathedral quarter, so that it probably stood under 10,000. Worcester&#x27;s suburbs extended beyond the limits of its walls

Manufacture of cloth and allied trades was significant for the city.

===Craft guilds===
Medieval and early modern Worcester developed a system of craft guilds to regulate who could work in a trade, lay down trade practices and training, and provide social support for members. The city&#x27;s late medieval ordinances banned tilers from forming a guild and encouraged tilers to settle in Worcester to trade freely. Roofs of thatch and wooden chimneys were banned to reduce risks of fire.

===Early modern period===

 The Dissolution saw the Priory&#x27;s status change, as it lost its Benedictine monks. As elsewhere, Worcester had to set up &quot;public&quot; schools to replace monastic education. This led to the establishment of King&#x27;s School. Worcester School continued to teach. St Oswald&#x27;s Hospital survived the dissolution, later providing almshouses; the charity and its housing survives to the present day.

The city gained the right to elect a mayor, and was designated a county corporate in 1621, giving it autonomy from local government. Thereafter Worcester was governed by a mayor, recorder and six aldermen. Councillors were selected by co-option.

Worcester contained green spaces such as orchards and fields between its main streets, within the city wall, as appears on Speed&#x27;s map of 1610. The walls were still more or less complete at the time, but suburbs had been established beyond them.

====Civil war====

Worcester equivocated, then sided with Parliament before the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 but was swiftly occupied by the Royalists. Parliament briefly retook the city after the Battle of Powick Bridge of September 1642, and ransacked the cathedral, where stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments.

The Parliamentary commander, the Earl of Essex was soon forced to withdraw, and the city spent the rest of the war under Royalist occupation. Worcester was a garrison town and had to sustain and billet a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents pressed into the army.

As Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, Worcester was placed under siege. Worcester had some 5,000 civilians and a Royalist garrison of about 1,500 men facing a New Model Army force of 2,500–5,000. The city surrendered on 23 July.

In 1651 a Scottish army, 16,000 strong, marched south along the west coast in support of Charles II&#x27;s attempt to regain the Crown. As the army approached, Worcester Council voted to surrender, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison withdrew to Evesham in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around the city, joined by very limited local forces.

The Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651. Charles II was easily defeated by Cromwell&#x27;s forces of 30,000 men. Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise with help of one of his officers, Francis Talbot to Boscobel House in Shropshire, from where he eventually escaped to France. Worcester was then heavily looted by the Parliamentarian army. The city council estimated £80,000 of damage was done and subsequent debts were still not recovered in the 1670s.

====After the Restoration====

After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Worcester cleverly used its location as the site of the final battles of the First Civil War (1646) and Third Civil War (1651) to mount an appeal for compensation from Charles II. Though not based on historical fact, it invented the epithet &quot;Fidelis Civitas&quot; (The Faithful City), since included in the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

During the 18th century Worcester experienced significant economic growth, and in 1748 Daniel Defoe could note that &#x27;the inhabitants are generally esteemed rich, being full of business, occasioned chiefly by the clothing-trade&#x27;. The Royal Worcester Porcelain Company was established at Warmstry Slip in 1751, and from the later 18th century the city became a major centre for the glovemaking industry.
The wealth of 18th- and 19th-century Worcester is reflected in the city&#x27;s architecture, which has been described as &#x27;one of the most impressive Georgian streetscapes in the Midlands&#x27;. Many public buildings were built or rebuilt in this period, including the Grade I listed Worcester Guildhall, the city bridge, and the Royal Infirmary. Large stretches of the city walls were removed by 1796, allowing for continued expansion along Foregate Street, The Tything, and Upper Tything, and many townhouses were built or remodelled in brick.

Worcester was a popular destination for wealthy visitors, who came to the annual Three Choirs Festival and horse races on Pitchcroft. However, parts of the city suffered from significant poverty, and in 1794 a large workhouse was built on the edge of the city at Tallow Hill.

===Industrial revolution and Victorian era===
Worcester in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was a major centre for glove-making, employing nearly half the glovers in England at its peak (over 30,000 people). employed by 150 firms. At this time nearly half the glove makers in Britain could be found in Worcestershire. In the 19th century, the industry declined as import taxes on foreign competitors, mainly French, were much reduced.

Riots took place in 1831, in response to the defeat of the Reform Bill, reflecting discontent with the city administration and the lack of democratic representation. Citizens petitioned the House of Lords for permission to build a County Hall. Local government reform took place in 1835, which for the first time created election procedures for councillors, but also restricted the ability of the city to buy and sell property. Political corruption, particularly bribing of voters, was endemic in Parliamentary elections, contributing to a string of Conservative victories even against a wider swing to the Liberals, and was investigated in the 1890s and by a Royal Commission in 1906.

The British Medical Association (BMA) was founded in the Board Room of the old Worcester Royal Infirmary building in Castle Street in 1832. Corn trading which had taken place in the Corn Market on the east side of the city moved to the new Corn Exchange in Angel Street in the mid-19th century.

The Kays mail-order business was founded in Worcester in 1889 and operated from various premises in the city until 2007. It was then bought out by Reality, owner of the Grattan catalogue. The Kays warehouse was demolished in 2008 and replaced by housing.

In 1815 the Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened. Railways reached Worcester in 1850, with Shrub Hill, initially only running to Birmingham. Foregate Street was opened in 1860. The WMR lines became part of the Great Western Railway after 1 August 1863. The railways gave Worcester jobs building passenger coaches and signalling. Alongside Worcester Shrub Hill station in Shrub Hill Road were the Worcester Engine Works. Their polychrome brick building was erected about 1864 and probably designed by Thomas Dickson. However, only 84 locomotives were built there and the works closed in 1871. The chairman was Alexander Clunes Sheriff.

In 1882 Worcester hosted the Worcestershire Exhibition with sections for fine arts, historical manuscripts and industrial items, receiving over 222,000 visitors.

===20th century to present===

The Foregate Street cast-iron railway bridge was remodelled by the Great Western Railway in 1908 with a decorative cast-iron exterior serving no structural purpose. Rail reorganisation in 1922 saw the Midland Railway&#x27;s routes from Shrub Hill absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

 By the mid-20th century, only a few Worcester glove firms survived, as gloves became less fashionable and free trade enabled cheaper imports from the Far East. Nevertheless, at least three glove manufacturers survived into the late 20th century: Dent Allcroft, Fownes and Milore. In the 1940s, some Jewish refugees from Europe settled in Worcester. Emil Rich, a refugee from Germany, founded one of Worcester&#x27;s last remaining glovemakers, Milore Glove Factory. Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation gloves were designed by Emil Rich and manufactured in the Worcester factory.

Worcester was a centre for recruitment of soldiers to fight in the First World War, into the Worcestershire Regiment, based at Norton Barracks. The regiment took part in early battles in the war, most notably at the Battle of Gheluvelt in October 1914. The Vicar of St Paul&#x27;s, Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy, became an army chaplain, later known as &#x27;Woodbine Willy&#x27;, as he brought cigarettes to soldiers during fighting and exposed himself to physical danger.

The inter-war years saw rapid growth in engineering and machine-tool manufacturing firms such as James Archdale and H. W. Ward, castings for the motor industry from Worcester Windshields and Casements, valve design and manufacture from Alley &amp; MacLellan, Sentinel Valve Works, mining machinery from Mining Engineering Company (MECO) – later part of Joy Mining Machinery – and open-top cans from Williamsons, although G. H. Williamson and Sons had become part of the Metal Box Co in 1930. Later the company became Carnaud Metal Box PLC.

During the Second World War, the city was chosen to be the seat of an evacuated government in case of mass German invasion. The War Cabinet, along with Winston Churchill and some 16,000 state workers, would have moved to Hindlip Hall (now part of the complex forming the Headquarters of West Mercia Police), north of Worcester. The former RAF station RAF Worcester was located north-east of Worcester.

A fuel-storage depot was built for the government in 1941–42 by Shell-Mex and BP (later operated by Texaco) on the eastern bank of the River Severn, about a mile south of Worcester. It was at one time used as a civil reserve storing gas oil and then aviation kerosene for USAFE. It closed in the early 1990s. Worcester Porcelain operated in Worcester until 2009, when the factory closed due to the recession.

In the 1950s and 1960s large areas of the medieval centre of Worcester were demolished and rebuilt. This was condemned by many such as Nikolaus Pevsner who described it as a &quot;totally incomprehensible... act of self-mutilation&quot;. There is however still a significant area of medieval Worcester remaining, examples of which can be seen along City Walls Road, Friar Street and New Street.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Worcester, at district (city) and county level: Worcester City Council and Worcestershire County Council. There are two civil parishes within the city at Warndon and St Peter the Great County, which form a third tier of local government in those areas; the rest of the city is an unparished area. Worcester forms one of the six local government districts within the county.
Worcester City Council is based at Worcester Guildhall on the High Street in the city centre. Worcestershire County Council also has its headquarters in Worcester, being based at County Hall in Spetchley Road, on the eastern outskirts of the city.

Worcester was an ancient borough which had held city status from time immemorial. When elected county councils were established in 1889, the city was considered large enough to run its own county-level services and so it became a county borough, independent from the surrounding Worcestershire County Council.

Worcester was reformed to become a non-metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The city had its territory enlarged, gaining the parishes of Warndon and St Peter the Great County, and it was transferred to the short-lived county of Hereford and Worcester. Hereford and Worcester was abolished in 1998, since when a re-established Worcestershire County Council has been the upper-tier authority for Worcester.

Worcester&#x27;s one Member of Parliament (MP) is Tom Collins of the Labour Party, who has represented the Worcester constituency since the July 2024 general election.

===Coat of arms===
The city of Worcester is unusual among English cities in having an arms of alliance as the main part of its coat of arms. The shield on the dexter side is the &quot;ancient&quot; arms: &quot;Quarterly sable and gules, a castle triple-towered argent&quot;. First recorded in 1569 but probably older, there is little doubt that it refers to Worcester Castle, now vanished. The shield on the sinister side is the &quot;modern&quot; arms: &quot;Argent, a fess between three pears sable&quot;. Despite its name, the modern arms goes back to 1634. It is said to represent a visit of Queen Elizabeth I to the city in 1575, when according to folklore, she saw a tree with black pears on Foregate and was so impressed with it that she allowed Worcester to have pears on its coat of arms. The city has used several mottos: one is &quot;Floreat semper fidelis civitas&quot;, Latin for &quot;Let the faithful city ever flourish&quot;, while the one currently used is &quot;Civitas in bello et pace fidelis&quot; (A city faithful in peace and war). Both refer to Worcester&#x27;s support for Royalists in the English Civil War.

==Geography==

The district is bounded by the districts of Malvern Hills to the west, and Wychavon to the east. The population of the local government district in 2021 was 103,837. The built up area extends slightly beyond the city boundaries in places and had a population in 2021 of 105,465.

Notable suburbs include Barbourne, Blackpole, Cherry Orchard, Claines, Diglis, Dines Green, Henwick, Northwick, Red Hill, Ronkswood, St Peter the Great (also known as St Peter&#x27;s), Tolladine, Warndon and Warndon Villages. Most of Worcester is on the eastern side of the River Severn. However, Henwick, Lower Wick, St John&#x27;s and Dines Green are on the western side.

===Climate===
Worcester enjoys a temperate climate with generally warm summers and mild winters. However, it can experience more extreme weather and flooding is often a problem. In 1670, the River Severn burst its banks in the worst flood ever seen by the city. The closest flood height to the Flood of 1670 was when torrential rains caused the Severn to flood in July 2007, which is recorded in the Diglis Basin. This recurred in 2014.

During the winters of 2009–2010 and 2010–2011, the city underwent long periods of sub-freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls. In December 2010 the temperature dropped to in nearby Pershore. The Severn and the River Teme partly froze over in Worcester during this cold period. By contrast, Worcester recorded a temperature on 2 August 1990. Between 1990 and 2003, weather data for the area was collected at Barbourne, Worcester. Since the closure of this weather station, the nearest is located at Pershore.

===Green belt===

Worcester is in a regional green belt that extends into the surrounding counties. It is set to reduce urban sprawl between the cities and towns in the nearby West Midlands conurbations centred round Birmingham and Coventry, to discourage further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is done by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing strict conditions on permitted building.

Within the city boundary, there is a small area of green belt north of the Worcester and Birmingham canal and of the Perdiswell and Northwick suburbs. This is part of a larger isolated tract south of the main green belt that extends into the adjacent Wychavon district, minimising urban sprawl between Fernhill Heath and Droitwich Spa, and keeping them separate. The green belt was first drawn up under Worcestershire County Council in 1975; the size within the borough in 2017 amounted to some .

==Demography and religion==
The 2011 census put Worcester&#x27;s population at 98,768. About 93.4 per cent were classed as white, of whom 89.1 percentage points were White British – higher than the national average. The largest religious group consists of Christians, with 63.7 per cent of the city&#x27;s population. Those reporting no religion or declining to state an allegiance make up 32.3 per cent. The next largest religious group, Muslims, makes up 2.9 per cent. The ethnic minorities include people of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Italian and Polish origin, the largest single group being British Pakistanis, numbering around 1,900: 1.95 per cent of the population. This has led to Worcester containing a small but diverse range of religious groups; as well as the prominent Anglican Worcester Cathedral, there are also Catholic, United Reformed and Baptist churches, a large centre for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a small number of Islamic mosques and a number of smaller groups for oriental religions such as Buddhism and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

Worcester is the seat of a Church of England bishop, whose official signature is the personal Christian name followed by &quot;Wigorn&quot;. (abbreviating the Latin &quot;Wigorniensis&quot;, meaning &quot;of Worcester&quot;). This is also used occasionally to abbreviate the name of the county. The previous Archdeacon of Worcester, Robert Jones, inducted in November 2014, had been Rector of St Barnabas with Christ Church in Worcester for eight years. He retired on 30 November 2023

==Economy==

===Manufacturing===

 One of Worcester&#x27;s famous products, Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce, is made and bottled at a Midland Road factory, its home since 16 October 1897. Messrs Lea and Perrins originally partnered a chemist&#x27;s shop on the site of the Debenhams&#x27;s store in Crowngate Shopping Centre.

Worcester has what is claimed to be the oldest newspaper in the world still in publication: &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Worcester Journal&quot;. It traces its descent from a news-sheet started in 1690.

The foundry heritage of the city is represented by Morganite Crucible at Norton which produces graphitic shaped products and cements for use in the modern industry. The city is home to the European manufacturing plant of Yamazaki Mazak Corporation, a global Japanese machine tool builder established here in 1980.

Worcester Heating Systems was started in the city in 1962 by Cecil Duckworth. The company was bought by Bosch and renamed Worcester Bosch in 1996.

===Retail trade===

The city is a major retail centre, with several covered shopping centres to accommodate the major chains and many independent shops and restaurants, particularly in Friar Street and New Street.

Worcester&#x27;s main shopping centre is the High Street, with several major retail chains. The High Street was controversially part-modernised in 2005, and further modernised in 2015; with current redevelopment of Cathedral Plaza and Lychgate Shopping Centre. Much of the protest came at the felling of old trees, the duration of the work (caused by weather and an archaeological find) and removal of flagstones outside the city&#x27;s 18th-century Guildhall.

The other main thoroughfares are the Shambles and Broad Street. The Cross and its immediate surrounding area are the city&#x27;s financial centre for most of Worcester&#x27;s main bank branches.

There are three main covered shopping centres in the city centre: CrownGate Shopping Centre, Cathedral Plaza and Reindeer Court. There is also an unenclosed shopping area immediately east of the city centre called St Martin&#x27;s Quarter. There are three retail parks, the Elgar and Blackpole retail parks located in the inner suburb of Blackpole, and the Shrub Hill Retail Park in neighbouring St Martin&#x27;s Quarter. Retailers such as Asda, B&amp;M and Aldi are all located close to St Martin&#x27;s Quarter.

==Attractions==

The most famous landmark in Worcester is the Anglican Worcester Cathedral. Officially the Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary, it was known as Worcester Priory before the English Reformation. Construction began in 1084. Its crypt dates from the 11th century. It includes the only circular chapter house in the country. It houses the tombs of King John and Prince Arthur.

Near the cathedral is the spire of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, known as Glover&#x27;s Needle. The rest of the church was demolished in 1949.

The Parish Church of St Helen, on the north side of the High Street, is mainly medieval, with a west tower rebuilt in 1813. The east end, re-fenestration and porch were completed by Frederick Preedy in 1857–1863. There was further restoration, by Aston Webb in 1879–1880. It is a Grade II*listed building.

The high-water marks from the flood of 1670 and more recent flood levels are shown on a brass plate on a wall adjacent to the path along the river that leads to the cathedral.

Museums include Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum, Greyfriars&#x27; House, the Infirmary Museum, Tudor House Museum, George Marshall Medical Museum, RAF Defford Museum, Museum of Royal Worcester, Mercian Regiment Museum, the Commandery, and Worcestershire Yeomanry Museum. The Battle of Worcester site is just south of the city. Limited parts of Worcester&#x27;s city wall remain.

The Hive, on the north side of the River Severn at the former cattle market site, is Worcester&#x27;s joint public and university library and archive centre, heralded as &quot;the first of its kind in Europe&quot;, and a prominent feature on the skyline. With seven towers and a golden rooftop, it has gained recognition, winning two international awards for building design and sustainability.

The city&#x27;s three main open spaces Cripplegate Park, Gheluvelt Park and Fort Royal Park, the last on the site of an English Civil War battle. In addition, there is an open area known as Pitchcroft to the north of the city centre on the east bank of the River Severn, which is a public space except on days when it is used for horse racing. Gheluvelt Park commemorates the part played by Worcestershire Regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion in the Battle of Gheluvelt in the First World War.
A statue of Sir Edward Elgar, commissioned from Kenneth Potts and unveiled in 1981, stands at the end of Worcester High Street facing the cathedral, yards from the original location of his father&#x27;s music shop, which was demolished in the 1960s. Elgar&#x27;s birthplace was the nearby village of Broadheath. Plaques installed in the city include a dedication to the medieval Jewish community at Copenhagen Street.

There are two large wooded areas in the city, Perry Wood and Nunnery Wood, covering 12 and 21 hectares. Perry Wood is often said to be where Oliver Cromwell met and made a pact with the Devil. Nunnery Wood is integral to the adjacent Worcester Woods Country Park, itself next door to County Hall on the east side of the city.

==Transport==

===Road===
The M5 Motorway runs north–south immediately to the east of the city. It is accessed by junction 6 (Worcester North) and junction 7 (Worcester South). It connects Worcester to most parts of the country, including London, which is only using the A44 via the Cotswolds and M40. A faster journey to London is possible via the M5, M42 and M40, but with an increased distance of .

The main roads through the city include the A449 road south-west to Malvern and north to Kidderminster. The A44 runs south-east to Evesham and west to Leominster and Aberystwyth and crosses Worcester Bridge. The A38 trunk road runs south to Tewkesbury and Gloucester and north-north-east to Droitwich and Bromsgrove and Birmingham. The A4103 goes west-south-west to Hereford. The A422 heads east to Alcester, branching from the A44 a mile east of the M5. The city is partly ringed by A4440.

Carrington Bridge on the A4440 is the second road bridge across the Severn, linking the A38 from Worcester towards Gloucester with the A449 to Malvern. It is one of Worcestershire&#x27;s busiest roads. The single-carriageway bridge was doubled with work being completed on 5 August 2022, making the Southern Link Road dual between junction 7 of the M5 and Powick Roundabout.

===Rail===
Worcester has three railway stations. Worcester Foregate Street and Worcester Shrub Hill are in the city centre. A third station on the edge of the city, Worcestershire Parkway, opened in 2020.

The Cotswold line towards Great Malvern and Hereford crosses Foregate Street on an arched cast-iron bridge. Between Foregate Street and the St John&#x27;s area of the city, heading towards Malvern and Hereford, the line crosses the Worcester viaduct over the River Severn.

Worcester Shrub Hill lies about a mile east of the city centre on Shrub Hill Road. It is on part of today&#x27;s Cross Country Route, looping off the Birmingham to Gloucester railway.

Both stations have frequent trains to Birmingham via Droitwich Spa, through Kidderminster and Stourbridge into Birmingham Snow Hill and Birmingham Moor Street then onwards usually to Dorridge or Whitlocks End, or via Bromsgrove and University and Birmingham New Street. These services are run by West Midlands Trains. From both stations, trains run to Pershore, Evesham and onto the Cotswolds, Oxford and London.

===Buses===
The main operator in and around the city is First Midland Red. A few smaller operators provide services in Worcester, including Astons, DRM and LMS Travel. Diamond Bus operates a service from Kidderminster to communities along the A449. The terminus and interchange for many bus services is Crowngate bus station in the city centre.

The city had two park and ride sites: off the A38 in Perdiswell and at Sixways Stadium next to the M5. Worcestershire County Council voted to close both in 2014 as part of a package of cutbacks. The service at Sixways Stadium has since been reinstated, with LMS Travel operating the W3 route to Worcestershire Royal Hospital, but avoiding the city centre bus station.

===Air===
Worcester&#x27;s nearest major airport is Birmingham, which is accessible by road and rail. Gloucestershire Airport is about 25 miles away and provided general aviation connections and scheduled services with Citywing to Jersey, the Isle of Man and Belfast. Citywing ceased trading in 2017 after entering administration.

===Cycling===
 Worcester is on routes 45 and 46 of the National Cycle Network. There are various routes around the city. Diglis Bridge, a pedestrian and Cycle bridge across the Severn, opened in 2010 to St Peter&#x27;s with Lower Wick. Beryl bikes were introduced in 2024 to hire across Worcester, providing 175 e-bikes and 50 pedal bikes, from a network of 53 bays.

===Waterways===
The River Severn is navigable through Worcester, and here it links to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, which connects Worcester with Birmingham and the rest of the national canal network. Historically used for the transport of goods, the canal network is now mostly used for leisure boating.

==Education==

The University of Worcester was awarded university status in 2005 by the Privy Council, having been known since 1997 as University College Worcester (UCW) and before that as Worcester College of Higher Education. From 2005 to 2010 it was the fastest growing university in the UK, more than doubling its student population. The university has an independent Worcester Students Union institution. The city is also home to two colleges, Worcester Sixth Form College and Heart of Worcestershire College.

===High schools===
The high schools located in the city are Bishop Perowne CofE College, Blessed Edward Oldcorne Catholic College, Christopher Whitehead Language College, Tudor Grange Academy Worcester, Nunnery Wood High School and New College Worcester, which caters for blind and partially sighted pupils aged 11–18.

===Independent schools===
Worcester is the seat of numerous independent schools. The Royal Grammar School (founded in 1291) and Alice Ottley School merged in 2007. The King&#x27;s School was re-founded in 1541 under King Henry VIII, and is a co-educational day school standing next to Worcester Cathedral. St Mary&#x27;s School, a girls&#x27; Catholic school, was the one remaining single-sex independent school, but closed in July 2014. Other independent schools include the Independent Christian School, the River School in Fernhill Heath and New College Worcester.

==Hospitals==
The Worcestershire Royal Hospital is the principal NHS hospital serving the city and county of Worcester. It opened in 2002, replacing the Worcester Royal Infirmary.

==Culture==
===Festivals and shows===
Every three years Worcester becomes home to the Three Choirs Festival, which dates from the 18th century and is credited with being the oldest music festival in the British Isles. The location rotates between the cathedral cities of Gloucester, Hereford and Worcester. Famous for championing English music, especially that of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst, Worcester hosted the festival in July 2017, but had to postpone its 2020 festival until 2021.

The Worcester Festival (established in 2003 by Chris Jaeger MBE) occurs in August and consists of music, theatre, cinema and workshop events, along with a beer festival.

For one weekend a year the city plays host to the Worcester Music Festival – a weekend of original music performed predominantly by local bands and musicians. All performances are free and take place around the city centre in bars, clubs, community buildings, churches and the central library.

Founded in 2012, the Worcester Film Festival, places Worcestershire on the film-making map and encourages local people to get involved in making film. The first festival took place at the Hive and included screenings, workshops and talks.

The Victorian-themed Christmas Fayre is a busy event in late November/early December, with over 200 stalls lining the streets, and over 100,000 visitors.

The CAMRA Worcester Beer, Cider and Perry Festival takes place for three days each August on Pitchcroft Race Course. It is the largest beer festival in the West Midlands and in the UK top ten with attendances of around 14,000.

The Worcester Vegan Market began in 2021 and takes place in late spring and fall. The Vegan Market fills High Street and Cathedral Square with vegan vendors, vegan food sellers, and vegan food trucks.

===Arts and cinema===

The famous 18th-century actress Sarah Siddons made her acting début at the Theatre Royal in Angel Street. Her sister, the novelist Ann Julia Kemble Hatton, otherwise Ann of Swansea, was born in the city. Also born in Worcester was Matilda Alice Powles, better known as Vesta Tilley, a leading male impersonator and music hall artiste.

In present-day Worcester, the Swan Theatre stages professional touring and local amateur productions and is the base for the Worcester Repertory Company. Past heads have included John Doyle and David Wood OBE. The current artistic director of the company and the theatre is Chris Jaeger MBE.

Stars who started their careers in the Worcester Repertory Company and the Swan Theatre include Imelda Staunton, Sean Pertwee, Celia Imrie, Rufus Norris, Kevin Whately and Bonnie Langford. Directors too have made a name for themselves: Phyllida Lloyd starting her career as an associate under John Doyle.

Huntingdon Hall is a historic church now used as venue for an eclectic range of musical and comedy performances. Recent acts have included Van Morrison, Eddie Izzard, Jack Dee, Omid Djalili and Jason Manford.

The Marrs Bar (in Pierpoint Street) is a venue for gigs and stand-up comedy.

Worcester has two multi-screen cinemas; the Vue Cinema complex is located in Friar Street and the Odeon in Foregate Street – both were 3D-equipped by March 2010.
Six local cultural organisations are working with Worcester City Council on plans to bring The Scala and Corn Exchange in Angel Place back into use as an arts centre, with investment from the government&#x27;s Future High Streets Fund. As well as three performance and creative spaces, the Council intends that the two historic buildings will be a hub providing music, film, and other performance facilities.

The northern suburb of Northwick has the Art Deco Northwick Cinema. Built in 1938, it contains one of only two remaining interiors in Britain designed by John Alexander. The original perspective drawings are held by RIBA. It was a bingo hall from 1966 to 1982, then empty until 1991, a music venue until 1996, and empty again until autumn 2006, when it became an antiques and lifestyle centre, owned by Grey&#x27;s Interiors, which was previously located in the Tything.

Worcester was home to the electronic music producer and collaborator Mike Paradinas and his record label Planet Mu, until the label moved to London in 2007.

==In popular culture==
===&quot;Mildred Arkell&quot;===
The depression that hit the Worcester glove industry in the 1820s and 1830s is the background to a three-volume novel, &quot;Mildred Arkell&quot;, by the Victorian novelist Ellen Wood (then Mrs Henry Wood).

===&quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot;===
The well-researched historical novel &quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot;, part of Ellis Peters&#x27; &quot;The Cadfael Chronicles&quot; series, depicts Worcester at the time of the Anarchy. It begins with the words:
&quot;It was early in November of 1139 that the tide of civil war, lately so sluggish and inactive, rose suddenly to wash over the city of Worcester, wash away half of its livestock, property and women and send all those of its inhabitants who could get away in time scurrying for their lives northwards away from the marauders.&quot; (These are mentioned as arriving from Gloucester, leaving a long lasting legacy of bitterness between the two cities.)

==Twinning==
Worcester is twinned with:

*Kleve, Germany
*Le Vésinet, France
*Worcester, Massachusetts, US
*Ukmergė, Lithuania

In February 2009 Worcester City Council&#x27;s Twinning Association began discussing an application to twin Worcester with the Palestinian city of Gaza. Councillor Alan Amos introduced the application, which was passed at its first stage by a majority of 35–6, but later rejected by the executive committee of the City of Worcester Twinning Association for lack of funding.

<doc id="58682" wikidata="Q483583" url="?curid=58682" title="Alan Shearer">
<text>Alan Shearer (born 13 August 1970) is an English football pundit and former professional player who played as a striker. Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of all time and one of the greatest players in Premier League history, he is the league&#x27;s record goalscorer with 260 goals. He was named Football Writers&#x27; Association Player of the Year in 1994 and won the PFA Player of the Year award in 1995. In 1996 he came third in both Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. In 2004 he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. Shearer was one of the first two players inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.

Shearer played his entire career in the top level of English football. He started his career at Southampton in 1988 before moving to Blackburn Rovers in 1992, where he established himself as among the most prolific goalscorers in Europe and won the 1994–95 Premier League. In the summer of 1996, he joined his hometown club Newcastle United for a then world record £15 million, and in his first season won his third consecutive Premier League Golden Boot. He played in the 1998 FA Cup and 1999 FA Cup finals, captaining the team in the latter, and eventually became the club&#x27;s all-time top scorer. He retired at the end of the 2005–06 season.

For the England national team, Shearer appeared 63 times and scored 30 goals. UEFA Euro 1996 was his biggest success at international football; England reached the semi-finals and Shearer was awarded the UEFA Euro Golden Boot and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament. He went on to captain England at 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, then retired from international football.

Since retiring as a player in 2006, Shearer has worked as a television pundit for the BBC. In 2009, he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United&#x27;s manager in the last eight games of their 2008–09 season, in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation. Shearer is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities.

==Early life==
Alan Shearer was born in the Gosforth area of Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Anne and sheet-metal worker Alan Shearer. His parents were working class. His father encouraged him to play football in his youth, and Shearer continued with the sport as he progressed through school. He was educated at Gosforth Central Middle School and Gosforth High School. Growing up, he played on the streets of his hometown and was originally a midfielder because &quot;it meant [he] could get more involved in the games&quot;. Shearer captained his school team and helped a Newcastle City Schools team win a seven-a-side tournament at St James&#x27; Park, before joining the amateur Wallsend Boys Club as a teenager. It was while playing for the Wallsend club that he was spotted by Southampton&#x27;s scout Jack Hixon, which resulted in him spending his summers training with the club&#x27;s youth team, a time he would later refer to as &quot;the making of me&quot;. Shearer had successful trials for First Division clubs West Bromwich Albion, Manchester City and Newcastle United, before being offered a youth contract with Southampton in April 1986.

==Club career==
===1986–1992: Southampton===
Shearer was promoted to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad. He made his professional debut for Southampton on 26 March 1988, coming on as a substitute in a First Division fixture at Chelsea, before prompting national headlines in his full debut at The Dell two weeks later. He scored a hat-trick, helping the team to a 4–2 victory against Arsenal, thus becoming the youngest player – at 17 years, 240 days – to score a hat-trick in the top division, breaking Jimmy Greaves&#x27; 30-year–old record. Shearer ended the 1987–88 season with three goals in five games, and was rewarded with his first professional contract.

Despite this auspicious start to his career, Shearer was only eased into the first team gradually and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season, and in the next, four goals in 36 games. His performances in the centre of the &quot;Saints&quot; attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.

In the middle of 1991, Shearer was a member of the England national under-21 football squad in the Toulon Tournament in Toulon, France. Shearer was the star of the tournament where he scored seven goals in four games. It was during the 1991–92 season that Shearer rose to national prominence. 13 goals in 41 appearances for the &quot;Saints&quot; led to an England call-up; he scored on his debut, and was strongly linked in the press with a summer move to Manchester United. A possible move for Shearer was being mentioned in the media during late autumn of 1991, but he rejected talk of a transfer and vowed to see out the season with Southampton, resisting the temptation of a possible transfer to the two clubs who headed the title race for most of the season. Speculation of a transfer to Liverpool, who finished the season as FA Cup winners, also came to nothing.

During the middle of 1992, Southampton&#x27;s manager, Ian Branfoot, became &quot;the most popular manager in English football&quot;, as he took telephone calls from clubs &quot;trying to bargain with players they don&#x27;t want plus cash&quot;. Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that &quot;whatever happens, we are in the driving seat&quot;. In July 1992, Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £3.6 million, with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal. Despite Branfoot&#x27;s claim to be &quot;in the driving seat&quot;, &quot;Saints&quot; failed to include a &quot;sell-on clause&quot; in the contract. Shearer, less than a month off his 22nd birthday, was the most expensive player in British football. In his four years in the Southampton first team, Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions, scoring 43 goals.

===1992–1996: Blackburn Rovers===
Despite making just one goalless appearance as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages, Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record-breaking £3.6 million bid from Blackburn Rovers. Although there was also interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker&#x27;s millions were enough to prise the striker from Southampton, and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park in the middle of 1992.

On 15 August 1992, the opening weekend of the first Premier League season, Shearer scored twice against Crystal Palace with two strikes from the edge of the 18-yard box. He missed half of his first season with Blackburn through injury after snapping his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England&#x27;s World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.

Returning to fitness for the 1993–94 season, he scored 31 goals from 40 games as Blackburn finished runners-up in the Premier League. His performances for the club led to him being named the Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year for that season. On the international scene, England had failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals, but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date.

The arrival of Chris Sutton for the 1994–95 season established a strong attacking partnership at Blackburn. Shearer&#x27;s 34 goals, coupled with Sutton&#x27;s 15, helped the Lancashire club take the Premier League title from archrivals Manchester United on the final day of the season, and the duo gained the nickname &quot;the SAS&quot; (Shearer And Sutton). After being asked by the press how he planned to celebrate winning the title, Shearer replied with &quot;creosoting the fence&quot;. Shearer also had his first taste of European football in the UEFA Cup that season, and scored in the second leg as Blackburn went out in the first round, losing to Trelleborgs FF of Sweden. His efforts for the club led to Shearer being awarded the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year for 1995.

Although the club could not retain the title the following year, Shearer again ended the (now 38-game) season as Premier League top scorer, with 31 goals in 35 games, as Blackburn finished seventh in the league. The previous season&#x27;s first-place finish also saw the club enter the Champions League. Shearer&#x27;s only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4–1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture and Blackburn finished fourth in their group, failing to progress to the next stage.

He passed the 100-goal milestone for Blackburn in all competitions on 23 September 1995, scoring a hat-trick in their 5–1 home win over Coventry City in the Premier League. On 30 December, he scored his 100th Premier League goal, making him the first player to hit the landmark, in a 2–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. His final tally for the club was 112 goals in the Premier League and 130 in all competitions. His final goals for the club came on 17 April 1996, when he scored twice in a 3–2 home league win over Wimbledon.

Shearer&#x27;s international strike rate had also dried up, with no goals in the twelve matches leading up to Euro 96. He missed the final three games of the season for his club due to injury, but recovered in time to play in England&#x27;s UEFA European Championship campaign.

===1996–2006: Newcastle United===
After Euro 96, Manchester United and Real Madrid again sought to sign Shearer, and attempted to enter the battle for his signature. Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards and Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz stated that Blackburn Rovers refused to let Shearer go to Old Trafford or Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Ultimately Shearer joined his boyhood club: Newcastle United, Manchester United&#x27;s title rivals.

On 30 July 1996, for a world transfer record-breaking £15 million (equivalent to £ million today), Shearer joined his hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan.

Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996, and maintained his form during the rest of the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25 goals in 31 Premier League games, as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade, despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. Among his best performances of the season came on 2 February 1997, when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3–1 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to win them the game 4–3 by scoring a late hat-trick. The league title still eluded the club, who finished second in the league for a second consecutive year, with Keegan resigning midway through the season.

Another injury problem, this time an ankle ligament injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just two goals in 17 games in the 1997–98 season. His injury was reflected in the club&#x27;s form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. To help Shearer get over the injury, club physiotherapist Paul Ferris devised unorthodox methods. At the club&#x27;s training ground at Durham University, Ferris stacked six school benches and placed Shearer on top with high-jump mats either side – the striker trying to improve his balance by standing on one leg and bending over to pick up coins while having objects thrown at him, while a crowd of student onlookers watched on. United (now managed by Shearer&#x27;s former Blackburn manager, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.
An incident during a game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player&#x27;s defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later wrote in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld, which was strenuously denied by Shearer.

An almost injury-free season helped Shearer improve on his previous year&#x27;s tally in the 1998–99 season, the striker converting 14 goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain, but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish just after the season got underway. He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but they once again lost 2–0, this time to treble-chasing Manchester United.

On the opening day of the 1999–2000 season, Shearer received the first red card of his career in his 100th appearance for Newcastle. After dropping Shearer to the bench in a Tyne-Wear derby loss against Sunderland, the unpopular Gullit resigned to be replaced by the 66-year-old Bobby Robson. Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain&#x27;s armband, reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife, Gullit&#x27;s decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season. The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter, who reportedly told the striker that he was &quot;...the most overrated player I have ever seen.&quot; Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997, making a bid of £20 million which would have seen Shearer break the world&#x27;s transfer fee record for the second time in 12 months. Newcastle&#x27;s manager at the time, Kenny Dalglish, rejected the offer.

In Robson&#x27;s first match in charge, Shearer scored five goals in an 8–0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday. With Robson in charge, the team moved away from the relegation zone, finishing in mid-table and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, but a third consecutive final was beyond them as they were beaten by Chelsea. Shearer missed only one league game and notched up 23 goals.

Shearer suffered an injury-hit and frustrating season in the 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only five goals in 19 games in the league. The 2001–02 season was much better though: Shearer bagged 23 goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth – their highest standing since 1997 – meaning they would qualify for the following season&#x27;s Champions League competition. One of the most memorable incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle&#x27;s 4–3 win over the &quot;Red Devils&quot; in September 2001. Shearer also saw red for the second time in his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic, but this decision was later rescinded.

The 2002–03 season saw Shearer and Newcastle make their return to the UEFA Champions League. Newcastle lost their first three matches in the opening group stage, but Shearer&#x27;s goal against Dynamo Kyiv, coupled with further wins against Juventus and Feyenoord saw the club progress to the second group stage.

Shearer&#x27;s Champions League hat-trick against Bayer Leverkusen and a brace against Inter Milan in the second group stage helped him reach a total of seven Champions League goals, along with his 17 in 35 games in the league, and a total of 25 for the season as the team again improved to finish in third place in the Premier League.
After this, Newcastle would have one more chance to progress in the Champions League in early 2003, but Shearer was one of those who failed to score as the team were eliminated in a penalty shootout by Partizan Belgrade in the third qualifying round. United progressed well in that season&#x27;s UEFA Cup and Shearer&#x27;s six goals helped the club reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille. Domestically he also had a good season, with 22 goals in 37 appearances, but this did not prevent the club dropping out of the Champions League places to finish in fifth, qualifying once again for the UEFA Cup.

Announcing that this would be his final season before retirement, Shearer&#x27;s form in the 2004–05 season was patchy; alongside new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only seven goals in his 28 games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club fared better in the cup competitions, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.

The middle of 2005 saw Shearer reverse his decision to retire, after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness. He decided to continue playing in a player-coach capacity until the end of the following season. and he returned for one more season in the 2005–06 season. This last season saw him break Jackie Milburn&#x27;s 49-year-old record of 200 goals for Newcastle United (not including his 38 World War II Wartime League goals) when he netted his 201st strike in a home Premier League fixture against Portsmouth on 4 February 2006, becoming the club&#x27;s highest-ever league and cup competition goalscorer with 201 goals altogether. On 17 April 2006, with three games remaining in his final season as a player, Shearer suffered a tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee after a collision during a 4–1 win at Sunderland in which he scored his 206th and final goal in what was his 395th appearance for the club. The injury caused him to miss those final three games, effectively bringing forward his retirement. Shearer finished his final season with 10 goals in 32 league games.

===Tribute and testimonial===

In tribute to Shearer&#x27;s contribution to Newcastle United over more than ten years, the club erected a large banner of Shearer on the outside of the cantilever superstructure of the Gallowgate End of St James&#x27; Park. The banner measured high by wide, covering almost half of the Gallowgate End, aptly placed above the club bar, Shearer&#x27;s Bar, opened in his honour in 2005. The banner depicted Shearer as the &quot;Gallowgate Giant&quot;, with one arm aloft in his signature goal celebration, with the message &quot;Thanks for 10 great years&quot;, and was featured in the media coverage reflecting on his career at the club, with the banner being displayed from 19 April 2006 until 11 May 2006, the day of his testimonial match.

Shearer was awarded a testimonial match by the club, against Scottish side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable to play in the whole match, but he kicked off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, helping Newcastle win the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.

==International career==
Shearer&#x27;s international career began in 1990 when he was handed a callup to the England under-21 squad under Dave Sexton. During his time with the squad, he scored 13 times in 11 games, a record return which is still unbeaten. The striker&#x27;s goals at this level, coupled with his club form, meant he was soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor. Marking his debut in the 2–0 win against France in February 1992 with a goal, he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later. Due to replace Gary Lineker, who retired from international action after UEFA Euro 1992, in the England attack, Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals.

UEFA Euro 1996 was a more positive experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far, with five goals in 23 games. Shearer scored in the 22nd minute of the first game, against Switzerland. Scoring once in the following game against Scotland and twice in a 4–1 win over the Netherlands, Shearer helped England to progress to the next stage in front of their own fans in Wembley. In the quarter-finals, England were outplayed by Spain but got through to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer scored the first England penalty, while the Spaniards failed to score from two of theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly equalised and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his teammate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer&#x27;s five goals made him the competition&#x27;s top scorer, and he was included with teammate Paul Gascoigne in the official UEFA team of the tournament. 

The new England manager Glenn Hoddle appointed Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and the player held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and twice in the following game against Poland. He scored a total of five goals in England&#x27;s successful qualification campaign for the World Cup, adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally. Shearer was sidelined for much of the 1997–98 season, but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. He scored England&#x27;s first goal of the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches. England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2–2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty&#x27;s shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper. This defeat ended England&#x27;s participation in what was to be Shearer&#x27;s only World Cup tournament.

In September 1999, Shearer scored his only England hat-trick in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Luxembourg. This helped England reach a play-off against Scotland; England won the game over two legs and in doing so qualified for the European Championship. By now, Shearer was approaching his 30th birthday, and he announced that he intended to retire from international football after the Euro 2000 tournament.

Shearer did not score in England&#x27;s opening 3–2 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England defeated Germany 1–0 in Charleroi, ensuring that England beat Germany for the first time in a competitive match since the 1966 World Cup final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2–1 up, but Romania ultimately won 3–2. England&#x27;s tournament was over, and so was Shearer&#x27;s international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored 30 goals; he is ranked 7th in the England all-time goalscorers list, level with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup – a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.

==Style of play==
Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of all time and one of the greatest players in the history of the Premier League, Shearer was often styled as a classic English centre-forward, owing to his strength, physical stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be a highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his link-up play, work-rate, and early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him of some of his pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him to hold on to the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this that contributed to both of his dismissals, although one was later rescinded on appeal. In addition to his playing ability, he also stood out for his leadership qualities throughout his career.

Shearer was noted as a proficient penalty taker for both club and country, and he scored 45 times from the spot for Newcastle, where he was the first-choice taker; with 56 goals from 67 attempts, he is also the most prolific penalty-taker in Premier League history. He also scored five goals from free-kicks for the north-east club. He was known for his accuracy and shooting power from outside the penalty area either when taking set-pieces or from open play.

==Managerial career==

===Early career===
On his retirement as a player, Shearer responded to speculation of an immediate move into coaching, saying that he would take some personal time off to &quot;enjoy life&quot; for the next couple of years. He was also quoted as saying that he would eventually like to move into management &quot;when the time was right&quot;. As of March 2009 he was yet to start the UEFA Pro Licence course, which is required to be permitted to manage a team in the Premier League and European competition.

Reflecting his desire for personal time off to &quot;enjoy life&quot;, in July 2006 he turned down a coaching role with England, citing his BBC commitments and desire to be away from the pressure of a job within football. Despite this, Shearer was often linked in the media with managerial or coaching positions at his three former clubs.

Shearer took a brief role in the dugout for his final three games under Glenn Roeder. Shearer had rejected offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008. Shearer had previously had talks about, but never been offered, a full-time manager&#x27;s role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009.

===Newcastle United ===
In a surprise move, late on 1 April 2009, it was announced that Shearer would become the manager of his former club Newcastle United for the remaining eight games of the season, taking over from head coach Chris Hughton who was in temporary charge while the permanent manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery, having taken ill on 7 February. Shearer stated &quot;It&#x27;s a club I love and I don&#x27;t want them to go down. I&#x27;ll do everything I can to stop that.&quot;

Shearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias. In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his &quot;Match of the Day&quot; role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that &quot;the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me&quot;. Wise&#x27;s presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters. Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder.

Shearer&#x27;s first match in charge ended in a 2–0 defeat against Chelsea at St James&#x27; Park. On 11 April, Newcastle earned their first point under Shearer with a 1–1 draw with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with Andy Carroll scoring a late equalising goal. After a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and a draw against Portsmouth, his first win for Newcastle came in a 3–1 victory over Middlesbrough that lifted Newcastle from the relegation zone.

On the eve of the final day of the season on 24 May, where all fixtures are played simultaneously, Newcastle faced the prospect of being relegated to the Championship, along with Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, which would end their 16-year unbroken spell in the Premier League. After losing 1–0 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal, Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough, joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks, while Sunderland and Hull City survived. Shearer&#x27;s eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty-four.

Shearer did not get the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis. Chris Hughton stepped up from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League, which was achieved at the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in the 2009–10 season.

==Outside football==

===Personal life===

Shearer met his future wife, Lainya, whilst playing for Southampton. They lived locally with her parents in the city during his second year at the club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St James&#x27; Church, West End, near Southampton. They have three children together. Shearer has described his wife as a quiet and reserved person who is uncomfortable with the public attention his fame sometimes brings. He cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career, having had the chance to move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn. In May 2006, his family accompanied him onto the pitch at St James&#x27; Park as he performed a lap of honour following his testimonial match.

===Personal honours===

On 6 December 2000, Shearer was given Honorary Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, with the citation &quot;in recognition of his role as captain of Newcastle United Football Club and as former captain of England which have enhanced the reputation of the City&quot;. Shearer was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for charitable services to the community in North East England.

On 4 December 2006, Shearer was created a Doctor of Civil Law by Northumbria University, at a ceremony at Newcastle City Hall, where the university vice-chancellor declared that &quot;Throughout his career Alan Shearer has been hard-working, committed, disciplined and focused in his endeavours, fighting back from career-threatening injuries with great determination and courage&quot;.

On 1 October 2009, Shearer was commissioned as Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, having been nominated by the Duchess of Northumberland in her capacity as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, and approved for the position by the Queen. In this role, Shearer, along with 21 other deputies, is the stand-in for the Duchess when she cannot fulfill her role as the Queen&#x27;s official representative in the region at official engagements. Deputies must live within seven miles of the county boundaries, and retain their appointment until age 75. The Duchess said of the appointment that &quot;You could not find a more iconic person than Alan, not just for what he has done in football but for all the extra work he tirelessly does for charity and communities. I am delighted he has accepted the role of Deputy Lieutenant because he is a real role model. I have promised him he is not going to have to do too much, but even if it is just one occasion a year he is the perfect choice&quot;

On 7 December 2009, Shearer was made a Doctor of Civil Law by Newcastle University. Chancellor Liam Donaldson stated &quot;Newcastle United are my team. Alan Shearer is more than just a local legend, he&#x27;s probably one of the greatest footballers of all time&quot;. On 12 September 2016, a statue of Shearer&#x27;s likeness was unveiled outside St James&#x27; Park. It was sculpted by Tom Maley, and paid for by the Shepherd family.

On 26 April 2021, Shearer was announced as the first inductee in the Premier League Hall of Fame.

===Media===

After his retirement and following guest appearances, Shearer became a regular pundit for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. He also formed part of the team which covered the World Cups and European Championships from 2006 onwards for the BBC.

Former Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd announced that, after Shearer finished the 2005–06 season as Newcastle&#x27;s caretaker assistant manager, he would become the club&#x27;s &quot;Sporting Ambassador&quot; for the 2006–07 season. However, in September 2008, tabloids reported that Shearer was removed from this largely honorary position by the club&#x27;s owner Mike Ashley – though these reports were denied by the club.

During his playing career Shearer appeared in commercials for the sports drink Lucozade. He is among a group of high-profile athletic figures in British pop culture to promote the brand, which includes Olympic champions Daley Thompson and Linford Christie, footballer John Barnes, rugby player Jonny Wilkinson, and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; heroine Lara Croft.

Shearer features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was included in the &quot;FIFA 15&quot; Ultimate Team Legends.

On 10 March 2023, following the suspension of Gary Lineker as the host of Match of the Day for allegedly breaching BBC impartiality rules by criticising the government&#x27;s asylum policy on Twitter, Shearer alongside other pundits announced that they would not present the following episode of the show in solidarity with Lineker.

In October 2024, Shearer&#x27;s famous quote from UEFA Euro 2024, &quot;pressure is for tyres&quot; was used by the HarrisWalz campaign.

===Philanthropy===

During his playing days, Shearer had been involved with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), taking part in the organisation&#x27;s Full Stop campaign in 1999. Since retiring from football Shearer has also done work for several charities both nationally and in the Newcastle area.

In his testimonial match, he raised £1.64m benefiting fourteen good causes including £400,000 for the NSPCC and £320,000 for completion of the &quot;Alan Shearer Centre&quot;, a respite care facility based in West Denton, Newcastle. In October 2006, he became an ambassador for the NSPCC, describing it as &quot;the kick-off to my most important role yet&quot;. He has also worked with The Dream Foundation. In 2006, Shearer founded the Alan Shearer Academy Scholarship to aid the development of promising young players in the region.

In 2008, he raised over £300,000 for Sport Relief in a bike ride with fellow &quot;Match of the Day&quot; presenter Adrian Chiles, the idea for which emerged in an off the cuff question from cycling fan Chiles to Shearer as to how he kept fit since retirement. Shearer also played and scored twice in Soccer Aid, a game involving celebrities and former players at Wembley Stadium in September 2008, to raise money for UNICEF.

On 26 July 2009, Shearer played and scored in the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, a charity match held at St James&#x27; Park in tribute of Bobby Robson and in aid of his cancer charity the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. It proved to be Robson&#x27;s last public appearance, as he died five days later. On 15 October 2009, Shearer became the new patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.

<text>A bookmaker, bookie, or turf accountant is an organization or a person that accepts and pays out bets on sporting and other events at agreed-upon odds.

==History==
The first bookmaker, Harry Ogden, stood at Newmarket in 1795, although similar activities had existed in other forms earlier in the eighteenth century.

Following the Gaming Act 1845, the only gambling allowed in the United Kingdom was at race tracks. The introduction of special excursion trains meant that all classes of society could attend the new racecourses opening across the country. Runners working for bookmakers would collect bets in clock bags. Cash flowed to the bookmakers who employed bodyguards against protection gangs operating within the vast crowds. Illegal betting shops were fined, but some, like Bella Thomasson, ran betting businesses that the police appeared to turn a blind eye to.

== Range of events ==
Bookmakers in many countries focus on accepting bets on professional sports, especially horse racing and association football or Indian Premier League cricket. However, a wider range of bets, including on political elections, awards ceremonies such as the Oscars, and novelty bets are accepted by bookmakers in some countries.

== Operational procedures ==

By &quot;adjusting the odds&quot; in their favour (paying out amounts using odds that are less than what they determined to be the true odds) or by having a point spread, bookmakers aim to guarantee a profit by achieving a &#x27;balanced book&#x27;, either by getting an equal number of bets for each possible outcome or (when they are offering odds) by getting the amounts wagered on each outcome to reflect the odds. When a large bet comes in, a bookmaker may also try to &quot;lay off&quot; the risk by buying bets from other bookmakers. Bookmakers do not generally attempt to make money from the bets themselves but rather by acting as market makers and profiting from the event regardless of the outcome. Their working methods are similar to those of an actuary, who does a similar balancing of financial outcomes of events for the assurance and insurance industries.

==Gambling industry by country==
=== United Kingdom ===

In 1961, Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government legalised betting shops, with tough measures enacted to ensure that bookmakers remained honest. A large industry has grown since. At one time, there were over 15,000 betting shops. Now, through consolidation, they have been reduced to between 9,100 and 9,200 in 2013. This number has reduced further to 6,219 as of March 2022, largely as a result of Covid-19 and the forced closure of shops on the UK high street. The group of the largest bookmakers in the country, known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;, comprises William Hill, Ladbrokes, and Coral.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s Gambling Act 2005 introduced a new regulatory system for governing gambling in Great Britain. This system includes new provisions for regulating the advertising of gambling products. These provisions of the Act came into effect in September 2007. It is an offence to advertise in the UK, gambling that physically takes place in a non-European Economic Area (EEA) or, in the case of gambling by remote means, gambling that is not regulated by the gambling laws of an EEA state. The Gambling Commission is the body that makes sure all sites and operators follow the new restrictions. In addition to the Gambling Act of 2005, according to the new gambling bill, online gambling sites are only allowed to offer services within the United Kingdom, if they are registered at the UK Gambling Commission.

Improved TV coverage and the modernisation of the law have allowed betting in shops and casinos in most countries. In the UK, on-track bookies still mark up the odds on boards beside the racecourse and use tic-tac or mobile telephones to communicate the odds between their staff and to other bookies, but, with the modernisation of United Kingdom bookmaking laws, online and high street gambling are at an all-time high. A so-called super-casino had been planned for construction in Manchester, but the government announced that this plan had been scrapped on 26 February 2008.

=== Germany ===
The law on betting on horse racing and lotteries was passed by the German legislature and came into force on 1 July 2012. Since then, a tax of 5% of the bet must be paid to the tax authorities for all sports betting (offline and online). This affects the entire sports betting market in Germany.

Many of the bookmakers are sponsoring some of the major football teams in the major European football leagues, although Werder Bremen are currently fighting the German courts for the freedom to continue featuring bookmaker Bwin on their shirts, as Germany and France take action against online gamers. For example, as of 1 January 2020, Germany bettors will not be able to bet more than €1,000 a month. The latest amendment of the ITG states that. New online sportsbook laws are expected shortly in Germany, as this law is only temporary: the expiration date is set to be on 20 June 2020.
=== Canada ===
The fundamental law governing gambling activities in Canada is the federal Criminal Code (the &quot;Code&quot;). Sections 201 to 206, including section 206, make all types of gambling, betting and lotteries illegal throughout Canada with very limited exceptions, such as betting-mutuel on horse racing (provided for in section 204). While the federal Code is the applicable prohibitionist law, all regulations (and regulatory bodies) are provincial, with one exception - pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, which is regulated by the federal Canadian agency Pari-Mutuel. However, this law has many critics, as it is believed that the Canadian sports betting market can generate $25 billion a year.

=== United States === 
Attempts to restrict operators of foreign gambling websites from accessing their domestic market resulted in a 2007 ruling against the US government by the World Trade Organization. However, common online gambling laws in the United States still don&#x27;t exist – it differs from state to state. All forms of online gambling are illegal within the states of Utah and Hawaii, while the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey took a different approach: almost all forms of online gambling are legal in these states. These are the only US states where online casino sites can be legally registered. It is important to mention that Native Americans have their own gambling legislation - the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. However, they need their state&#x27;s approval to be able to offer their services online.

The Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on online gambling in 2018. However, while online gambling and casinos are legal, each state has its own rules. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the legal bookmakers are DraftKings, FanDuel and Pointsbet. Mississippi, New Jersey, Delaware, Nevada and West Virginia are on the road to legalisation, but Nevada and New Jersey have already passed laws. And most analysts predict the trend towards legalization of online gambling will continue in more and more US states.

=== Australia ===
Some bookmakers have taken to using betting exchanges as a way of laying off unfavourable bets and thus reducing their overall exposure. This has led to insecurity from some TABs in Australia, state-run betting agencies that attempted to deny Betfair an Australian licence by running unfavourable ads in the media regarding the company. When Tasmania granted Betfair a licence despite these efforts, the Western Australian state legislature passed a law that specifically criminalised using betting exchanges from within the state; however, the law was later ruled to be unconstitutional. As a result, internet gambling in Australia required a new legal framework. The Interactive Gambling Act 2001 regulates the online gambling market in Australia, together with all its amendments. The last amendment was introduced on 13 September 2017. This bill states that online casinos, online poker and live betting are illegal in Australia. The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) is the regulatory body responsible for all supervising online gambling activities. Online sports betting is legal, however.

===France===
Online sports betting in France is divided into two sections: Autorité de Régulation des Jeux en Ligne (ARJEL) regulates online sports betting, while online horse betting is regulated by the law &quot;Decree 2010-498 from 17 May 2010. International bookmakers are allowed to enter the French market, thanks to the Law No. 2010-476 from 12 May 2010.

== Internet gambling ==
With the increasing number of online betting exchanges, betting exchanges are now providing free bet offers in an attempt to lure customers away from the competition. These free bets are generally based on the size of the deposit made into the gambling account. For example, if a customer deposited £20, the betting exchange would deposit an additional £20 for the customer to use. Free bet rules vary depending on the betting exchange.

==Sponsorships==
Most televised sports in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe are now sponsored wholly or partly by Internet and high street bookmakers, with sometimes several bookmakers and online casinos being displayed on players&#x27; shirts, advertising hoardings, stadium signs and competition event titles. Sponsors are especially highlighted in the football category since football fans present a significant percentage of the bookmakers&#x27; target group.

With the recent banning of tobacco sponsorship and the significant commercial budgets available to the gaming industry, sponsorship by car manufacturers, alcoholic drinks, soft drinks and fast-food marketers is being rapidly replaced by sponsorship from gaming companies in the Far East and Europe.
